                                         2014-16 Activity Report


                                         This activity report summarizes activities of Result Area 5, also known as the Africa Disaster
                                         Risk Financing (ADRF) Initiative—referred to as the “ADRF Initiative”, the “Initiative”
                                         or “R5”—from its commencement in August 2014 to June 30, 2016. The report gives an
                                         overview of the achievements to date and identifies upcoming priorities and challenges.

                                         The ADRF Initiative aims to support African countries develop national risk financing
                                         tools and strategies that have the potential to significantly reduce disaster losses, speed
                                         recovery and build resilience to natural hazards. In its early phases, the initiative has
                                         already yielded results in supporting governments with efforts to strengthen capacity to
                                         design and implement risk financing strategies at regional, national and local levels.

1. Introduction




           A
                     fter slowing to 3 percent in 2015, economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is
                     projected to fall to 1.6 percent in 2016, the lowest level in over two decades.
                     Low commodity prices and tight financial conditions, exacerbated by domestic
                     headwinds from policy uncertainty, droughts, and political and security concerns,
           continued to weigh on activity across the region. The overall slowdown in Sub-Saharan
           Africa’s growth reflects economic deterioration in the region’s largest economies. Economic
           performance was notably weak across oil exporters. At the same time, in about a quarter of
           the countries, economic growth is showing signs of resilience1.

           African countries continue to face persistent, long-term developmental challenges. Among them
           are frequently recurring disaster events that undermine Africa’s development gains. Disasters,
           particularly cyclones, storms, floods, droughts, landslides and extreme temperature events,
           cause major negative impacts on social and economic development in many countries. Although
           recent years have seen engagement in building disaster resilience at regional, sub-regional and
           national levels, addressing prevention, mitigation and preparedness to natural hazards has
           proven complex. It is still an emerging issue in the policy agenda of many African governments.

           To mitigate the socio-economic, fiscal and financial impacts of disasters, many African countries
           are increasingly seeking support in understanding the underlying hazards, vulnerability and
           risks and to develop strategies for risk financing and insurance. Governments are starting to
           consider financial protection as an important lever in a comprehensive approach to disaster
           risk management.

           Evidence shows that when financial commitments are made before a disaster strikes,
           governments are able to show how a better system for managing risks is possible. For
           example, FONDEN,2 a financial vehicle set up after the 1984 earthquake in Mexico, enabled
           the Government of Mexico to have adequate financial capacity following natural disasters.
           By 1999, the fund played a pivotal role in aiding the timely reconstruction of federal and
           subnational infrastructure. More recently, an impact evaluation of FONDEN3 found that it
           increased post-disaster gross domestic product by two to four percent, a significant result.

Understanding Risk and Finance
                                    sustained focus is needed to address a number of existing bottlenecks. A 2012 report by the
Conference. Photo credit: World
Bank                                World Bank4 highlighted a number of challenges to the development of financial resilience
                                    in Sub-Saharan Africa. These included poor institutional capacity, the lack of an integrated
                                    approach to resource mobilization and budget execution, the absence of national strategies
                                    on disaster risk financing and insurance, and insufficient data necessary for identifying and
                                    quantifying risk.

                                    To address these challenges, the Africa Disaster Risk Financing (ADRF) Initiative was
                                    launched in 2015 as part of the Africa Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) – European Union (EU)
                                    Program Building Disaster Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, an initiative of the ACP Group
                                    of States, financed by the EU.

                  he EU and ACP Group of States established the Intra-ACP cooperation Program
                  Building Disaster Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa5, financed under the 10th
                  European Development Fund (EDF), which has the overall objective of strengthening
                  the resilience of sub-Saharan African regions, countries and communities to the
           impacts of natural disasters. These include the potential impacts of climate change to
           reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.

           To achieve this objective, five Result Areas were identified, to be implemented by several
           partners, including the African Development Bank (AfDB), African Union Commission
           (AUC), the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) and the
           World Bank-managed Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). These
           are as follows:

           R1:	 Extended Program of Action for the implementation of the Africa regional strategy for
                disaster risk reduction. Implemented by the AUC and the UNISDR;

           R2:	 African Regional Economic Communities (RECs)6 have DRR coordination, planning and
                policy advisory capacities operational to support their respective member states and
                regional and sub-regional programs. Implemented by GFDRR;

           R3:	 Core capacities of the specialized national and regional climate centers are improved
                to meet the needs of disaster risk management agencies and socio-economic sectors
                for effective use of weather and climate services and community-focused and real-time
                early warning systems. Implemented by the AfDB;

           R4:	African countries have improved knowledge of risks through, the compilation of
               historical disaster related data to inform the assessment and modelling of future risks.
               Implemented by the UNISDR;

           R5:	Multi-risk financing strategies are developed at regional, national and local levels

Result Area 5                       The overall objectives of the ADRF Initiative are to support the development of multi-risk
                                    financing strategies at regional, national and local levels to help African countries make
                                    informed decisions; improve financial response capacity post disaster; and mitigate the
                                    socio-economic, fiscal and financial impacts of disasters in African countries.

                                    The initiative expects to catalyze the uptake of innovative risk identification, assessment
                                    and financing tools within the development policy frameworks and agenda of several
                                    middle and low-income African countries.

                                    To achieve these objectives the ADRF Initiative has three operational components:

                                          A)	 Creating the enabling data environment for risk financing;

                                          B)	 Supporting countries in developing risk financing strategies;

                                          C)	 Facilitating regional risk financing and knowledge sharing initiatives.

                                    The expected results of the ADRF Initiative are:

                                         A)	 Strengthening capacities to generate, access and use information on disaster risk
                                             to conduct risk assessments that support development of Disaster Risk Manage-
                                             ment (DRM) strategies, such as financial protection and risk reduction investment
                                             programs;

                                         B)	 Strengthening capacities to incorporate disaster and climate risk information in
                                             decision making;

                                         C)	 Developing strategies to increase financial resilience against natural hazards; and

                                         D)	 Facilitating knowledge sharing and best practices on risk financing solutions rele-

3.	 Highlights


           ❉❉ The ADRF Initiative facilitated the development of simplified multiple-hazard country
              risk profiles for Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, Senegal and Uganda. These profiles clearly
              demonstrate the risk posed by a variety of natural hazards, as well as illustrating how
              these risks could impact socio-economic growth and be influenced by climate change.
              With this information, respective governments are able to use hazard data sets to inform
              on the financial losses arising from disasters.

           ❉❉ Two analytical studies on the impact of disasters on poverty were produced in 2016:
              Welfare, Income Growth and Shocks in Uganda and Vulnerability to Poverty in Rural
              Malawi.

           ❉❉ A series of important preparatory missions were carried out by the ADRF Initiative
              operational team to lay the ground work for strategy development by opening risk
              financing dialogue in 11 countries, identifying key local partners, as well as exploring
              the potential for synergies among other relevant programs led by development and
              humanitarian organizations.

           ❉❉ Initial disaster risk financing diagnostic reports were produced for Kenya, Senegal,
              Madagascar, and South Africa. These focused on a range of issues that differed according
              to the context of each country and the specific requests of respective governments.

           ❉❉ The ADRF Initiative supported knowledge-sharing and best practices on risk assessment
              and risk financing solutions. The flagship event was the Understanding Risk and Finance
              Conference, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 17-20 November 2015, in partnership
              with the AUC, the EU and the Government of Ethiopia. The conference gathered 450
              participants and a wide range of African partners including the African Development
              Bank (AfDB), the Addis Ababa University, African Risk Capacity, along with private
              sector firms and insurance companies.

           ❉❉ The Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) was implemented in Malawi and
              Niger and the various Indian Ocean Island States under the Southwest Indian Ocean
              Islands Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (SWIO RAFI).

                                    ❉❉ The GFDRR Innovation Lab10 leads the work on creating the enabling environment for
                                         risk financing and on facilitating regional risk sharing and knowledge sharing initiatives;

                                    ❉❉ The Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program (DRFIP),11 a joint partnership of the
                                         World Bank Group’s Finance and Markets Global Practice and GFDRR, leads the dialogue
                                         on disaster risk finance with governments and stakeholders.

                                    Coordination: To ensure efficiency and avoid overlaps, ADRF Initiative activities are closely
                                    coordinated with ongoing programs developed by the EU (through the EU delegations),
                                    UN agencies, WB/GFDRR and other development partners. Particular attention is given to
                                    the coordination between the different result areas of this Program and AUC’s PoA for the
                                    implementation of the Africa Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (2006-15) and
                                    the revised PoA (to be presented at the Africa Regional Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction
                                    in November 2016 in Mauritius) through bi-annual Program Steering Committee meetings,
                                    quarterly Program Technical Committee meetings and proactive coordination of the GFDRR

Africa Program, under the leadership of UNISDR/AUC.

Steering Committee: The ADRF Initiative, as part of the Program Building Disaster
Resilience Sub-Saharan Africa, reports to the Program’s Steering Committee (PSC)12. PSC
members meet twice a year to oversee general implementation of activities, and to oversee
and validate the overall strategic direction and policy guidance of the Program.



4.2 Monitoring framework
A dedicated Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework was developed to track the
progress of the ADRF Initiative implementation. It evaluates the contribution of each
activity to the Initiative’s objectives and presents the status of implementation. The ADRF
Initiative M&E framework is aligned with the M&E framework of the Building Disaster
Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa Program under AUC and UNISDR’s responsibility (R1).

                                           rom August 2014 to January 2015, the team focused on setting up the ADRF
                                           Initiative’s structure, drafting the work plan for Year 1 and visibility guidelines, and
                                           coordinating with the Program’s partners, including the EU, mainly through the EU
                                           Delegation to the African Union in Addis Ababa. A preparation workshop was held in
                                    Brussels on September 23-26, 2014, with representatives from the EU, the ACP Secretariat,
                                    UNISDR, AUC, EUMETSAT and African RECs. Though the workshop had a strong focus on
                                    R2, a specific working session was devoted to coordination among the Result Areas of the
                                    EU-ACP cooperation Program Building Disaster Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa.

                                    The ADRF Initiative was officially launched on November 17, 2015 in Addis Ababa during
                                    the Understanding Risk and Finance conference (refer to section 5.3).



                                    5.1. Creating the enabling data environment
                                         for risk financing
                                    One of the key objectives of the ADRF Initiative is to create an enabling data environment
                                    for risk financing. To achieve this, specific activities were initiated to strengthen capacities
                                    of selected African countries to generate, access and use disaster risk information. These
                                    focused on building understanding and awareness of disaster and climate risks in Sub-
                                    Saharan Africa as a fundamental input to disaster risk financing strategy development and
                                    on approaches and tools for financing risks.
                                    Such activities include:

                                    ❉❉ Development of simplified national-level multiple-hazard country risk profiles in
                                        five countries – Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, Senegal and Uganda (refer to Box 1 below).
                                        These risk profiles were created using globally-available and readily-accessible local
                                        datasets in combination with scientifically proven methodologies. The risk profiles were
                                        designed to support the formulation of disaster risk management strategies in these
                                        five countries, particularly risk reduction investment programs and financial protection.
                                        In early 2016, work began on four additional risk profiles (Cabo Verde, Malawi, Mali
                                        and Mozambique) in response to governments’ interest in undertaking disaster risk
                                        financing activities.

                                    ❉❉ The development of two analytical studies on the impact of disasters on poverty:
                                        Welfare, Income Growth and Shocks in Uganda and Vulnerability to Poverty in Rural

     Malawi. These studies will help guide the countries in defining priorities engagements
     and investments in DRM engagement to address the impact of disaster shocks on
     household welfare,13 a critical input to disaster risk financing strategies and particularly
     for planning social protection programs. Based on these studies, the ADRF Initiative
     team has produced a series of infographic posters and booklets to highlight the results
     for non-specialists. In addition, these online versions will be shared with the Africa
     Community of Practice.14 Where appropriate, the infographics will be showcased at
     learning events throughout the region. For more information, please refer to Annex 1.

❉❉ Finally, during the first year of implementation, initial discussions were undertaken
     with governments and development partners to develop and implement demand-driven
     risk assessment initiatives. These initiatives aim to provide governments a deeper
     understanding of their disaster risk, that is, using subnational datasets to develop
     assessments for particular sectors in a country (as opposed to simplified national
     level risk profiles). These initiatives will help decision-makers reduce and mitigate
     risks, improve preparedness, and provide a high-level overview of financial exposure.
     A preliminary work plan for developing a customized, simplified Post Disaster Needs
     Assessment (PDNA) baseline tool for Uganda has been prepared and discussed with
     the Government and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In Niger and
     Senegal, risk information geoportals have been initiated. Initial discussions with the
     government of Malawi have taken place to provide support to DRM projects, including
     the development of a detailed flood risk modeling in the north of the country and support
     to geospatial data platforms.

5.2 	Supporting countries in developing
     risk financing strategies
Another key objective of the ADRF Initiative is to assist countries in developing financial
decision-making tools and integrated national risk financing strategies to enhance their
post-disaster response capacity, from resource mobilization ex-ante to resource execution
post-disaster. The ADRF Initiative is using a three-phased approach for customized technical
assistance:

❉❉ Phase 1: Identifying country needs and priorities;

❉❉ Phase 2: Formulating these priorities into strategies for action by building up elements
   of disaster risk financing strategies. This could include review of existing budget
   instruments and expenditure frameworks, assessing current response tools and funding
   sources, exploring the potential to establish contingency funds and use contingent
   loans/grants, assessing use of sovereign-level insurance contracts, and strengthening
   delivery mechanisms, such as through national social protection systems, for cash
   transfers funded by contingency funds or insurance solutions.

❉❉ Phase 3: Designing and implementing disaster risk financing policies, instruments and
   strategies

During the first two years of the ADRF Initiative, the work focused on Phase 1—identifying
needs and priorities. ADRF Initiative operational teams working on risk financing undertook
consultations in 11 countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali,
Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Senegal, and South Africa) to:

❉❉ Initiate dialogue with governments on risk financing;

❉❉ Identify existing instruments for disaster risk management and disaster risk financing;

❉❉ Assess demand and level of engagement from Ministries of Finance counterparts;

❉❉ Identify entry points for activities which could achieve synergies by complementing re-
   lated operations/programs supported by development and humanitarian organizations;
   and

❉❉ Identify local counterparts and partners.

The main outputs included initial disaster risk financing diagnostic reports for Kenya,
Senegal, Madagascar, and South Africa. These focused on a range of issues that
differed according to the context of each country and the specific requests of respective
governments. For Senegal and Kenya, for example, the diagnostic involved an overview
of existing mechanisms for financing disaster response; for Madagascar, an overview of
efforts to assess fiscal impact of tropical cyclone Chezda (January, 2015); and for South
Africa, a diagnostic on estimated fiscal costs of specific interventions design to support the
agricultural insurance market.

                                    ❉❉ Contingency funds: Kenya, Mozambique, and Madagascar have requested World Bank
                                        support through the ADRF Initiative to develop contingency funds, which are a valuable
                                        tool for providing resources efficiently in response to drought. Contingency funds are
                                        an important building block in disaster risk financing and are, for the most part, lacking
                                        in the region. Reasons for this include the financial opportunity costs associated with
                                        setting aside resources that may not be used, legal or institutional constraints, and
                                        political economy issues associated with protecting resources set aside for emergencies.
                                        Global experience has shown that setting up effective disaster contingency funds is a
                                        long-term process.

                                        In Mozambique, the following activities were supported (i) organization of an
                                        introductory workshop to disaster risk financing; (ii) development of terms of reference

     (TORs) and recruitment of a consultant to provide advisory services to the Government
     for the assessment of conditions for the establishment and transparent operation of
     a National Disaster Management Fund; (iii) development of TORs and recruitment of
     a consultant for a complementary study to better understand the economic and fiscal
     impact of disasters; and (iv) identification of government officials who would technically
     support the development of a disaster risk financing strategy. In addition, the Initiative
     supported the governments of Mozambique and Madagascar in the development of an
     Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM), which included the preparation and validation
     of IRM operations manuals. Following an eligible emergency or crisis, the IRM allows an
     International Development Association (IDA) country to rapidly reallocate funds from
     investment projects integrating a Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC)
     to support recovery measures and reconstruction. IRM CERCs have been included in
     several investment operations in Mozambique, Madagascar and Niger, the IRM is now
     operational in the three countries. This represents a positive step forward in providing
     these countries with a contingent instrument that can be part of the overall risk financing
     strategy.

❉❉ Sovereign level insurance solutions: Sovereign level insurance for drought (now also
     including floods and cyclones), are offered to countries in the region by African Risk
     Capacity (ARC).15 The ADRF Initiative is working closely with ARC to identify synergies
     related to the technical assistance needs of participating countries. In April–May 2016
     the ADRF Initiative team began dialogue with the Government of Ethiopia following
     an invitation by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development
     (DFID) and the WB teams supporting the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) to
     explore risk financing solutions for scaling up the PSNP. This led to a request from the
     Government to the Initiative for assistance in evaluating insurance options which are
     being offered to the Government by both by African Risk Capacity (ARC) and Swiss Re.16
     Activities began in July 2016.

❉❉ Risk financing for shock-responsive social safety nets. Countries in the region have
     indicated a strong interest in strengthening existing national safety net programs,
     or designing new ones, that can channel assistance in the event of a disaster. This is
     driven by i) high levels of exposure to drought in the region, which typically hit poor
     and vulnerable households in rural/remote areas; ii) high-level focus on the poor and
     vulnerable with significant investment in national and partner-supported programs to
     improve identification, targeting, and ability to reach them; and iii) the lack of other
     formal channels, programs or entities within government structures that can implement
15
  	 The ARC sovereign risk pool was established by the AUC. In 2014/5, four African governments, Kenya, Mauritania,
   Niger and Senegal, purchased $129 million in drought insurance cover from ARC Ltd at a total of $17 million in
   premium costs paid by those governments. Following a poor agricultural season in the Sahel, by February 2015 three
   Member States received payouts from ARC Ltd totaling over $26 million, which allowed these governments to deliver
   timely assistance to 1.3 million people and over half a million livestock. This intervention demonstrated the ARC proof
   of concept, which is to support early intervention in countries. In May 2015, ARC added three countries to the pool:
   The Gambia, Mali, and Malawi. Each of these countries, in addition to the original four members, secured drought
   coverage for the 2015/16 policy year totaling $178 million with corresponding premium of $24.7 million. For the
   agricultural season 2015/16, there have been no payouts.

                                         this work involves analyzing data needs, creating coverage scenarios, and quantifying
                                         the costs of those coverage scenarios to help decision-making related to scaling up.
                                         With these elements in place, a risk financing strategy to support scaling up safety nets
                                         can then be designed.

                                    ❉❉ In terms of specific country engagements, the ADRF Initiative received requests for
                                         assistance in this area from Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and
                                         Uganda. Scoping missions took place in all of these countries to better understand
                                         needs and priorities related to the development of shock-responsive social safety nets.
                                         This information is being used to design technical assistance that will be initiated in
                                         the second half of 2016. In Kenya, the ADRF Initiative also helped develop an approach
                                         to guide decision-making about the financial costs of scaling up the Hunger Safety Net
                                         Program (HSNP) in response to drought. This involved analysis of the historical costs of
                                         drought and creating a tool that could be used to develop different coverage scenarios

                                         Going forward, such information can be used to design a more comprehensive disaster

                                    ❉❉ Risk financing through development of agriculture insurance markets.                  Efforts
                                         to strengthen agriculture insurance markets are supported by a number of partners
                                         with whom the ADRF Initiative is closely coordinating. This includes the Global Index
                                         Insurance Facility,17 the Agriculture Insurance Development Program, the International
                                         Livestock Research Institute,18 and others. Lessons from global experience indicate that
                                         some degree of support from the public sector is necessary to take these programs to
                                         scale, and as a result, the ADRF Initiative is looking for opportunities to connect macro-
                                         level policy dialogue on risk financing to micro-level insurance programs. In terms of

     the overall strategic organization and coordination of this program alongside other
     initiatives. This request forms the basis of the design of ADRF Initiative technical
     assistance for Kenya’s Ministry of Finance on developing a disaster risk financing
     strategy.

   • 	 In South Africa, the high costs of responding to drought in 2016 led the government
     to request ADRF Initiative assistance to explore ways for supporting agriculture
     insurance program development. This led to the production of a formal diagnostic,
     which examined the fiscal costs of three different mechanisms for potential public
     support to strengthen and expand commercial agricultural insurance programs. The
     South African government is evaluating the report as an input into decision-making
     to determine whether to proceed with a national program, and if so, how.

❉❉ Assistance in mapping existing response mechanisms and costs. In many African
   countries contingent liabilities associated with natural disasters are financed in large part
   by a wide array of humanitarian and development partners in addition to government.
   For most countries, it is important to understand existing response mechanisms and
   tools, which are often fragmented and poorly coordinated, before developing a coherent
   disaster risk financing strategy. Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal consider
   this a priority and made specific requests to the ADRF Initiative. The ADRF Initiative
   completed an initial diagnostic for Kenya and Senegal and an interim piece of work for
   a diagnostic for Madagascar.

❉❉ Design of Ministry of Finance-led Disaster Risk Financing Strategy. An important
   pre-requisite for the ADRF Initiative to provide technical assistance to develop disaster
   risk financing strategies is strong demand and ownership from the relevant Ministry
   of Finance. Since disaster risk financing is a new concept and a new policy area, the
   Initiative has focused first on introducing concepts and approaches. The Ministries of
   Finance of Kenya and Mozambique, expressed interest in receiving support to develop
   a risk financing strategy. In both countries efforts were challenged by political events
   affecting key government counterparts. The ADRF Initiative will, however, continue to
   prioritize these countries with the objective of initiating more sustained support in the
   coming year.

5.3	 Facilitating regional risk financing
     and knowledge sharing initiatives
The ADRF Initiative facilitated knowledge-sharing and best practices on risk assessment and
risk financing solutions. These involved activities to enhance regional knowledge-sharing
initiatives on assessing and managing physical and financial risk, and was undertaken in
collaboration with partners working on other results areas.

Under this component, the Understanding Risk and Finance Conference (URF), which took
place on November 17-20, 2015 in Addis Ababa, hosted by the African Union, was a major
output of the ADRF Initiative. The URF, which gathered 450 participants from Africa and
beyond, introduced best practices in disaster risk assessment and risk financing to African
policy makers and DRM experts. It also provided a platform for other result areas of the
ACP-EU Program Building Disaster Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa to engage stakeholders,
highlight best practices and exchange knowledge. For more details, please refer to Box 3
and in Annex 1.
The Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI)21 was implemented in Malawi and
Niger and the various Indian Ocean Island States under the Southwest Indian Ocean
Islands Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (SWIO RAFI)22 (see below). OpenDRI
aims to enhance the decision-making capabilities of DRM practitioners by improving data
accessibility. In Malawi, the Initiative supports the maintenance of the Malawi Spatial
Data Platform (MASDAP),23 as well as training activities in the GeoNode24 platform and
InaSAFE.25 In Niger, technical advice and support was provided to the government on the
establishment, maintenance and use of the PADRE spatial data storage, visualization and
real time analysis platform26, and to coordinate emergency response.

The ADRF Initiative also supported the implementation of SWIO RAFI activities. 102
people across the five islands states were provided hands-on training on geospatial data
platforms and participatory mapping techniques under the OpenDRI. In Seychelles,
training was provided on the GeoNode spatial data platform, QGIS27 and InaSAFE to 20

  	 With financial support from the EU within the framework of the ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Program
     managed by GFDRR, the World Bank launched the Southwest Indian Ocean Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative
     (SWIO RAFI) in 2014. The objective of SWIO RAFI is to improve the understanding of disaster risks and risk financing
     solutions of Indian Ocean Islands (IOIs) to provide a solid basis for the future implementation of disaster risk
     financing strategies. Since January 2016, remaining activities under SWIO RAFI (particularly those at national levels)
     have been financed by the ADRF Initiative.

                                    and four webinars) were provided in the GeoNode, QGIS and InaSAFE from September
                                    2015 to June 2016 to 42 officials; there are also plans for community mapping activities
                                    to support critical data collection. Additionally, Government representatives were invited
                                    to attend the URF conference in Addis Ababa – including eight from Madagascar, two from
                                    Seychelles, four from Comoros, and three from Mauritius.

                                    At the onset of the ADRF Initiative, a large potential was identified in the Sahel Region for
                                    the development of synergies between hazard-specific information systems to inform
                                    risk assessments, early warning systems (CREWS), adaptive social protection programs and
                                    disaster risk financing. This allows existing information to be used for multiple purposes.
                                    To operationalize this, a diagnosis of information systems existing at the sub-regional
                                    and at the national levels for the monitoring of food security, severe weather, climate and
                                    hydrological phenomena and their impacts, was conducted in the six Sahel countries28 and
                                    relevant sub-regional institutions. The diagnosis is now being used as an input to consider
                                    development of early warning systems in Sahel countries, which are critical elements for
                                    optimal use of emergency response capacities, IRMs and adaptive (shock-responsive)
                                    safety net programs.

                                    The ADRF Initiative supported the development of a training course: The Fundamentals
                                    of Disaster Risk Financing, implemented for the first time in Addis Ababa at the URF
                                    conference. The training course was adapted and used in Ethiopia and delivered internally
                                    via webinar in a pilot with World Bank staff. Roll-outs of the training helped refine and
                                    improve the materials, which can be used for both in-person and distance-based learning
                                    for the Initiative.

                                    The ADRF Initiative also provided a number of technical contributions on the topic of
                                    disaster risk financing in preparation of the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS), which
                                    took place in Istanbul, in May 2016. Knowledge sharing resulted in technical contributions
                                    to the High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing of the Secretary-General of the United
                                    Nations (UNSG), co-chaired by EU Vice-President, Kristalina Georgieva and Sultan Shah of
                                    Malaysia, and provided inputs to the High-Level Roundtables at the Summit on Managing
                                    Disaster Differently and Humanitarian Financing. Major outputs of this effort can be seen
                                    in the content of The High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing and the UNSG’s report

                                    view about the need to shift humanitarian investment toward more risk management,
                                    risk financing, resilience-building, and to make better use of a wider range of financial

partnerships to support it.

Moreover, the ADRF Initiative initiated engagement with the Regional Inter-Agency Standing
Committee (RIASCO) to support the development of the El Niño Action Plan for SADC
countries. The Initiative contributed technical expertise to support immediate humanitarian
needs, outline steps necessary to build the resilience of affected populations, and discuss
macro-economic measures, which will be required to help countries improve their financial
resilience to respond to disasters. According to estimates as of June 2016, the SADC countries
where populations have been most severely impacted by the current drought are Lesotho,
Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe.

In response to country-specific requests, the ADRF Initiative team provided inputs to the Post-
Disaster Needs Assessment undertaken in Malawi (which included a section on risk financing)
and the structuring of a Crisis Response Window operation for IDA financing in Lesotho. This
included a component on developing mechanisms to support scaling-up the social protection
system in the event of a shock, and involved initiating dialogue with the government on initiating
a risk financing strategy. The impact of the drought in the region has heightened interest from
not only governments but humanitarian and development partners, about the need to develop a
wider set of instruments (contingency funds, contingent grants/loans, and market risk transfer
tools such as insurance and price hedging tools) that can be used to finance the early action that
is needed to mitigate the impacts and costs of responding to drought.

The Africa Disaster Risk Financing Initiative brochure offers an overview on how
the ADRF Initiative contributes to strengthening the resilience of sub-Saharan African
regions, countries and communities to the impacts of natural disasters. Specifically, it
shows how the ADRF Initiative aims to support the development of multi-risk financing
strategies at regional, national, and local levels to help African countries make informed
decisions, improve financial response capacity after disasters happen, and mitigate the
socioeconomic, fiscal, and financial impact of disasters.




                                  Risk profiles. High-level, national-level, multiple-peril country risk profiles have been
                                  developed by World Bank operational teams in Senegal, Ethiopia, Uganda, Niger and
                                  Kenya. These profiles cover drought, flood, landslide, earthquake and volcanic eruption,
                                  depending on the presence of these hazards in each country, and include how the risks
                                  will change in the future with socio-economic growth and climate change. All data
                                  collected and created through the development of these profiles will be made publicly
                                  available through the GFDRR geospatial platform and through national geospatial
                                  platforms. The risk datasets and information can be used to prioritize more detailed
                                  risk analysis, the hazard datasets for use in preparedness activities, and to inform
                                  dialogue on the financial cost of disasters.
