Cash services remain the most widely available (43
percent, see Figure 13) and one of the most
competitive ways to send money, with an average
cost of 7.07 percent, as shown in Figure 12.
An increased number of account-to-account
services have been recorded in Q1 2014. This is

the last three years, two of the leading global
MTOs have acquired Foreign Exchange companies
that specialize in sending money to bank accounts.
As these services become more common in the
market, the average cost seem to have been little
affected, with account service (to any bank)
remaining over 13 percent. The cost of transfers
within the same bank (or to a partner bank in the
receiving country) has slightly decreased and is
now 7.26 percent.
While not widely available (6 percent), cash to
account services are the cheapest product type, at
an average cost of 5.69 percent.
Services offered on-line seem to be gaining ground.
While the available services covered in RPW is
stable around 13 percent of the total sample, a
number of providers are emerging in this space.
