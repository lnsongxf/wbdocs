Box 2 Global Index Insurance Facility

Established in 2009, the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) is a multi-donor trust fund, jointly operated by the IFC and the World Bank, supporting the
development and growth of local markets for weather and disaster index-based insurance in developing countries, primarily Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and
the Caribbean and Asia Pacific. GIIF’s implementing partners have issued more than 600,000 policies to cover farmers, pastoralists and micro-entrepreneurs with
US$119 million in sums insured and reached over one million with information and access to index insurance. GIIF's objective is to expand the use of index insurance
as a risk management tool in agriculture, food security, disaster risk reduction and access to finance.

Index insurance is a relatively new but innovative approach to insurance provision that pays out benefits on the basis of a pre-determined index (e.g. rainfall level,
seismic activity, livestock mortality rates) for loss of assets and investments, primarily working capital, resulting from weather and catastrophic events, without
requiring the traditional services of insurance claims assessors. It also allows for the claims settlement process to be quicker and more objective.

Box 3 Examples of technical contributions from the private sector

  Quantification of risk
///                              ///




Although catastrophe risk modelling has been undertaken in the academic, public, and private spheres, it is the private sector that has driven this discipline forward
the most. High resolution probabilistic catastrophe risk modelling (detailed computer simulations to quantify loss that could be sustained from a particular disaster)
was first developed in response to the needs of the private insurance industry, for pricing and accumulation management.22 These sophisticated modelling tools are
now being used in less developed insurance markets around the world, and the improved understanding of risk they enable also informs disaster risk management
beyond financial protection.

  Risk-based pricing
///                  ///




One way the insurance industry has managed its catastrophe risk exposure is through risk-based pricing. Insurance companies calculate premiums on the basis of
modelled expected loss. The cost of cover then serves as a signal of the risk customers are exposed to and provides an economic incentive to minimize this risk. This
could include investing in disaster resistant construction and retrofitting, and settling outside of risk prone areas.

  Introducing technical and transparency standards
///                                                 ///




Cooperation with the private sector can play an important role in instilling and strengthening technical and transparency standards in public financial management.
To access insurance, governments need a solid damage assessment methodology and transparent handling of payouts. Through adopting terms and conditions
based on international standards for the insurance contracts themselves, governments can also bring international best practice to domestic insurance markets.
In Colombia, the government uses standardized terms and conditions from international insurance market best practices to purchase catastrophe insurance for its
public buildings. The government of Mexico has in place an indemnity-based excess-of-loss insurance contract since 2011. In order to place the contract with the
private markets, it was necessary for the government to develop transparent and robust processes for loss reporting. Such improvements will have applications well
beyond the contract itself.23

  Product expansion
///                        ///




The private sector led the development of risk-transfer products that trigger—meaning they pay-out—based on predetermined parameters such as wind speed
instead of loss estimates. The development of these parametric products has increased access to insurance to areas and consumers that could not have been
reached effectively using a traditional claims-based model of insurance provision.

For example, the first weather insurance product in India, and indeed in the developing world, was a rainfall insurance contract underwritten and designed in 2003
by ICICI-Lombard General Insurance Company for groundnut and castor farmers (Clarke, et al., 2012). This pilot, supported by technical assistance from the World
Bank, spurred rainfall insurance product offerings from other insurers, such as IFFCO-Tokio and the public insurer Agriculture Insurance Company of India, leading to
a high rate of growth in the number of farmers insured between 2003 and 2007. As a result of this private sector-led pilot, the government of India launched a pilot
of the Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme in 2007, now a largely compulsory, publicly-subsidized program that insures more than 10 million farmers for a range
of crops. While the private sector plays a key role in the design of new products, experience has shown that the public sector is needed to reach the critical mass
required to sustainably scale up such products and initiatives and hence encourage innovation by the private companies.

Similar innovations also supported sovereign risk transfer via parametric products for developing country governments. Sovereign risk transfer initiatives that have
used parametric products include: the catastrophe bonds issued by the government of Mexico in 2006, 2009, and 2012 for earthquake and hurricane risk; the first-
ever multi-country regional risk pool, established in 2007 as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility; the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot in 2013;
and the African Risk Capacity in 2014. Private sector partnerships can also unlock new delivery channels, for example by making agricultural insurance products
available to farmers as a bundle with seed purchases.

Box 4 Disaster risk financing in the Hyogo Framework for Action

The Hyogo Framework for Action recognized a role for risk transfer and the need for some sort of financial tool or reserve to support effective response and recovery.
HFA’s Priority for Action #4 alludes to financial risk transfer as an important step to reducing underlying disaster risk factors. Paragraph 19 (k) calls for promoting “the
development of financial risk-sharing mechanisms, particularly insurance and reinsurance against disasters.”

The framework also states the need to set up “financial reserves and contingency mechanisms … to support effective response and recovery when required.”
Disaster risk financing as a proactive agenda to manage and reduce financial risks is, however, not reflected in the monitoring questions for reducing the underlying
risk factors.

The HFA did not explicitly discuss disaster risk financing as a priority agenda for governments, nor was it recognized as a core component of the disaster risk
management agenda. At the time the framework was drafted, disaster risk financing was still not very well understood nor viewed as a priority. Countries, the
international community, and others involved in thinking about financial protection were only just beginning to realize the extent to which it is a fundamental
component of comprehensive disaster risk management.

  Box 5 Regional risk pooling for Caribbean States

  Caribbean countries have been at the forefront of developing new risk transfer tools to address some of the natural hazards they face, including hurricanes and
  earthquakes. The region has historically faced numerous challenges in absorbing the financial impact of natural disasters in the traditional insurance marketplace,
  including a limited ability to diversify risk, limited budgetary capacity, insufficient vulnerability reduction measures, limited reserves of domestic insurance capital,
  high insurance costs, and issues with underinsurance (existing but inadequate insurance coverage by policy holders).

  In 2007, 16 Caribbean island countries came together to form a regional risk insurance pool, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), with
  technical assistance from the World Bank and initial capitalization by the international donor community and the World Bank. CCRIF is a first-of-its-kind
  government risk-sharing platform, aimed at assisting members manage part of their catastrophe risk exposure through access to affordable and effective
  insurance coverage against natural disasters. For almost all Caribbean governments, a direct hit by a major hurricane or earthquake is the largest single risk it
  faces. Prior to CCRIF, the economic aspects of disasters had gone largely unmanaged by governments, which had mostly relied on post-disaster humanitarian
  assistance from donors.

  With CCRIF, the member governments have developed a parametric insurance mechanism that enables them to share their risk between all participating
  countries and provides rapid payouts—similar to business interruption insurance—to finance an initial disaster response while maintaining basic government
  functions immediately following an event. By pooling their risks into a single diversified portfolio, member countries’ insurance costs are significantly lowered, with
  pricing reduced by half or more of what it would cost if countries were to purchase the same coverage individually and directly from global markets. CCRIF retains
  a significant level of risk thanks to initial capitalization from the participating countries, bilateral donors, and the World Bank, and transfers part of its risk to the
  international reinsurance and capital markets.

  CCRIF was the first ever multi-country risk pool and was well received by the reinsurance market. The success of CCRIF, which thus far has made eight payouts
  totaling more than $32 million to seven member governments, brought about the development of a regional catastrophe risk pool in the Pacific and Africa as well
  as ongoing discussions on disaster risk financing solutions among the Indian Ocean island countries.

Sustainable and effective disaster risk financing and insurance strategies can help governments raise funds to address potential financial needs and manage
fiscal volatility after a disaster hits. Equally important are the administrative and legal procedures to ensure that the available resources are used effectively in the
aftermath of a natural disaster, including a legal framework for declaring emergencies, a clear process for budget appropriation and execution, as well as fiduciary
control and management of funding channels during an emergency.

In Mexico, the Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN) is the centerpiece and operator of the government’s disaster risk financing and insurance strategy, combining several
financial instruments for various sources of funding, depending on the timing and amount of funding needs as well as the cost of securing said funds. The main
role of FONDEN, however, is to ensure coordination between federal, state, and municipal governments and the private sector. For example, following a disaster,
FONDEN’s coordination and budget execution role includes collecting information on affected public infrastructure and services; managing and allocating disparate
requests for funds based on a transparent damage and loss assessment methodology; coordinating administrative capacities across geographical locations; and
monitoring the use of funds and reconstruction progress.

Box 8 Strengthening subnational disaster risk financing capabilities

A significant share of the public cost of disaster recovery and reconstruction ultimately falls on local governments. For example, they often must pay for the repair
of provincial, district, and community roads, schools, health clinics and other infrastructure within their remit. Local governments may face additional pressures to
support the recovery of local businesses and livelihoods, speeding the restoration of local economies. While local governments in developing countries are often
required by law to make budgetary provisions for post-disaster needs, they typically have limited discretionary financing, and what little funds they do have are
quickly spent in the event of a disaster. As a consequence, reconstruction efforts can extend over a number of years, exacerbating the indirect economic and social
costs of a disaster. State-owned enterprises can face similar challenges and pose additional contingent liabilities to national governments.

Over the past decade, there has been an increasing recognition of the need to address this issue by strengthening local, as well as national, disaster risk financing
capabilities. National governments can help stimulate this growth at the local level by providing explicit incentives for uptake and through regulatory and legislative
reforms supporting the growth of financially sustainable risk transfer solutions tuned to the needs of local government. For instance, in addition to limiting the
availability of post-disaster federal funds for states that continuously do not insure their assets, Mexico also incentivizes states to build reserve funds, similar to its
national-level program FONDEN by providing seed funding.

Colombia has begun to improve guidelines on insurance requirements for concessions at the subnational level, modeled after the 2013 reform of insurance
requirements of national government concessions. In Indonesia, provincial and municipal governments voluntarily insure critical public assets (World Bank, 2011).
International Financial Institutions are supporting the development of disaster risk financing and insurance strategies and risk transfer schemes tailored to the
subnational level. The Asian Development Bank, for example, has been focusing on climate risk adaptation in megacities and is currently developing disaster risk
financing and insurance instruments at the city level in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

Box 9 How risk modeling and analytics are informing disaster risk financing in Mexico

The government of Mexico developed the probabilistic catastrophe risk modelling software R-FONDEN to improve the effectiveness of Mexico’s disaster risk
management system. Combined with actuarial analysis of historical loss data, this tool helps inform decision making about the government’s risk financing and
insurance strategy, and provides risk visualization. An in-depth understanding of its risks allowed the Mexican government to develop a comprehensive financial
protection strategy relying on risk retention and transfer mechanisms, including successfully accessing international reinsurance and capital markets. To identify
assets exposed to natural disasters—including roads and bridges, hospitals, schools, hydraulic infrastructure, and low-income housing—and the potential financial
impact of their destruction, R-FONDEN was developed in three steps:

1) Data Gathering: The required database was prepared, including hazard information, an asset inventory with the key variables such as building characteristics
  ///              ///




required for evaluation of vulnerability and loss of infrastructure, and the integration of historical loss data to complement simulated data.

2) Catastrophe Risk Modeling: The government, together with the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), developed hazard models for earthquakes,
          ///                   ///




tropical cyclones, and floods, and vulnerability functions for all types of infrastructure. Together with the exposure database this enabled the government of Mexico
to carry out deterministic and probabilistic risk modeling used to inform financial analysis of probable disaster loss.

3) Financial Analysis: Finally, the government carried out actuarial analysis of the simulated risk data and historical losses to develop and fine tune the federal
        ///              ///




disaster risk financing strategy for public infrastructure—including both risk retention and risk transfer. This also includes the development of a decision support tool
to facilitate this process in the future.

As a result, R-FONDEN has informed the development of the federal disaster risk financing strategy and helped improve individual insurance policies for federal
agencies. For instance, it enabled the design of an insurance program for the Ministry of Transport in charge of federal roads and bridges, a scheme that previously
was difficult to insure due to insufficient asset information.

Providing appropriate risk management tools for agriculture is a key challenge for development. Agricultural insurance can play a vital role in that process by
providing cover against natural perils, serving as collateral for agricultural loans and providing a safety net for investments. While agricultural insurance systems
have been successfully implemented in recent decades, this was mostly in industrialized countries.

One key requirement is the integration of insurance in the broader context of agricultural development and risk management. Sustainable agricultural production
methods and use of the best available production techniques specific to each site are prerequisites of insurance.

Second, only systems based on public-private partnerships have proved to be successful and sustainable, whereas purely private or purely state-organized systems
have often failed. In such public-private partnerships the government, farmers, and the insurance industry play complementary roles:

Ş The government provides the enabling legal and regulatory framework. It can also provide part of the financing for risk premiums and administrative costs, invest
   in creating, auditing, and managing the required data, and facilitate market penetration through premium subsidies and state reinsurance for catastrophe losses.
   This helps keep insurance terms affordable for farmers.

Ş Farmers finance part of the risk transfer through insurance premiums. They also retain part of the risk in the form of a deductible or as basis risk in the case of
   index products. Agricultural producers also have a crucial role in making such insurance programs sustainable through overall agricultural risk management.

Ş Insurance and reinsurance companies take on roles as risk carrier and take care of the marketing and administration of insurance policies. They also manage the
   portfolio, develop new products, and carry out loss adjustment. Especially in developing countries, where insurance companies are often short of risk capital,
   reinsurance arrangements are essential to maintain adequate solvency margins for insurance companies. Besides much-needed capital, global reinsurers also
   bring international expertise and experience to developing countries.

Box 11 Challenges of assessing risk for risk financing and insurance

Successful financial protection solutions rely on underlying risk data. Yet appropriate risk modelling tools are still lacking in countries that need them the most.

Lack of appropriate solutions and tools for developing countries: Disaster risk financing requires sophisticated risk modelling tools generally unavailable for low- and
often also middle-income countries. Their development requires substantial seed investment for example for the collection of the required data on exposed assets,
even before there is a reasonable certainty that the government will use the tools once completed.

Where financial risk models do exist, they are usually not tailored to answer governments’ specific disaster risk financing questions and needs, such as modelling
for collapsed buildings, fatalities, impact on crops and food security, and taking into account the homeless population. Almost always developed for the insurance
industry, these models often only assess the impact on “insurable” assets, excluding, for example, low-income housing. Exposure data may also rely heavily on
official census data that often excludes infrastructure and public buildings and disregards unofficial settlements—such as shantytowns or squatter towns—that
regularly suffer the most damage in a disaster.

Even where countries can access risk modelling tools, they go out of date quickly; some are even born obsolete or inaccurate. For example, many models rely on
census data that can be 10 years old. Even if growth trends are used to update figures, using old census data to collect information on exposure in fast growing
countries is potentially inaccurate.

  Lack of disaster risk information in developing countries: Disaster risk financing solutions are only as reliable as the risk models that support them, and the latter are
///                                                         ///




only as good as the data used to develop them. Unfortunately, developing countries often lack adequate data to build and validate risk assessment tools, not least
because gathering the necessary data sets requires large investments.

If not already available, exposure data—such as information on public and private assets—are the hardest and most expensive to gather and organize. Use of
satellite imagery is often the only way to gather up-to-date exposure data, but the cost of acquiring such images can be prohibitive for developing countries, unless
companies such as Google provide information already in their possession free of charge for development purposes, including disaster risk financing.

Data on exposure may be scattered among different government ministries and other organizations, and may be kept in precarious conditions. For example, when
the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) undertook a risk assessment in the region in 2012, some of the only existing maps about
crops in the South Pacific were available in a single paper copy in the archive of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community in Suva, Fiji.

  Data sharing is often not the norm: Even within the same government, different ministries may not share data, and are even more reluctant to share data with
///                                    ///




international organizations for the purpose of developing risk assessment models. Data are still seen in many countries as a source of power not to be relinquished
lightly, often for security concerns. And when countries do share data, they often receive no reward for their efforts such as usable feedback or products based on
the data.

  Looking ahead: Developing countries are increasingly requesting support in managing the fiscal costs of natural disasters. New financial instruments and strategies
///              ///




are needed, however, to help governments increase post-disaster financial response capacity, and build domestic catastrophe insurance markets. Probabilistic risk
assessment and catastrophe risk modelling are important tools that empower policy makers to take better-informed decisions in financial protection. Technical
support helps countries collect the underlying data and build the required models. More work is also needed to bridge the gap between catastrophe risk data and
informed decision making, establishing the link from technical outputs to financial analysis that is useful to nontechnical decision makers. Simplifying complex
technical data and providing key financial figures ensures that policy makers have the information they need to make the best decisions about financing disaster
risk.

                                To achieve its objective of enhancing catastrophe risk insurance for public assets over the next five to ten years,
                                the Ministry of Finance will:

                                1. Build an information system on public buildings, including information on physical characteristics of buildings
                                   and insurance policies already in effect;

 Example of longer-term         2. Partner with other public agencies and authorities to establish a centralized system for purchasing and
 actions to achieve Policy         managing insurance for government buildings, starting with the health and education sectors;
 Objective 3:
                                3. Improve insurance requirements for buildings and road infrastructure concessions, that align with international
                                   reinsurance market technical standards; and

                                4. Share the Ministry of Finance’s experience by providing best practice insurance guidelines to subnational

                                     The Department of Finance seeks to (i) sustain economic growth and protect development gains from
 OVERARCHING GOAL:                   disaster shocks; and (ii) reduce the impact on the poorest and most vulnerable and prevent them from
                                     falling into a cycle of poverty.


                                     1. National Level: Improve the financing of post-disaster emergency response, recovery, and
                                        reconstruction needs.

                                     2. Local Level: Provide local governments with funds for post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts.

                                     3. Individual Level: Empower poor and vulnerable households and owners of small and medium-sized
                                        enterprises to quickly restore their livelihoods after a disaster.

                                     4. Risk Analytics: Use disaster risk data to support decision making on financial protection.



                                     To achieve its objective of improving the financing of post-disaster funding needs at the national level, the
                                     Department of Finance will:

                                     1. Improve the financing of post-disaster emergency response, recovery, and reconstruction needs;
 Examples of actions to
 achieve Policy Objective 1:
                                     2. Build up multi-year reserves through annual contributions to a response contingency fund set aside for
                                        post-disaster response efforts; and

                                     3. Use risk transfer to access international private reinsurance and capital markets

Disaster Risk Finance helps countries improve financial resilience against natural disasters by implementing
sustainable and cost-effective financial protection policies and operations. It supports governments,
businesses, and households to manage the financial impacts of disaster and climate risks without compromising
sustainable development, fiscal stability, or wellbeing. Financial protection complements investments in risk
reduction, prevention, and building resilience. It addresses residual risk, which is either not feasible or not
cost effective to reduce or prevent.


Only by looking at the financial impact of disasters comprehensively can governments build the financial
resilience of society as a whole. This publication proposes an operational framework to guide countries in
developing and implementing such comprehensive financial protection policies. It also takes stock of the
progress in the field to date.


The Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program is a joint program of the World Bank’s Finance &
Markets Global Practice and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GDFRR). DRFIP has
provided advisory services on disaster risk financing and insurance to more than 40 countries worldwide.
The program works along four priority areas to support four main beneficiary groups governments, farmers,
homeowners and SMEs, and the poorest and most vulnerable.


With support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), the DRFIP is working with
selected middle-income countries to strengthen financial resilience and protect their fiscal balance. This is
one component of the broader Swiss-World Bank Group partnership on fiscal risk management for middle
income-countries, which also includes a component on government debt and risk management.




ABOUT GFDRR The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) helps
high-risk, low-income developing counties better understand and reduce their vulnerabilities
to natural hazards, and adapt to climate change. Working with over 300 national, community
level, and international partners GFDRR provides grant financing, on-the-ground technical
assistance helping mainstream disaster mitigation policies into country level strategies, and
thought leadership on disaster and climate resilience issues through a range of knowledge
sharing activities. GFDRR is managed by the World Bank and funded by 21 donor partners.
