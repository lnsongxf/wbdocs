CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1     What is the Land Governance Assessment Framework?
The Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) is a diagnostic tool for the
evaluation of the legal framework, policies and practices regarding land and land use.
The LGAF is based on a comprehensive review of available conceptual and empirical
material regarding experience in land governance (refer to Land Governance Assessment
Framework: Conceptual Approach, Formulation and Methodology). The LGAF groups land
topics into five core thematic areas:

1. Legal and Institutional Framework

2. Land Use Planning, Management and Taxation

3. Management of Public Land

4. Public Provision of Land Information

5. Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management.

These core thematic areas cover the indicators to provide a relatively exhaustive
assessment of land governance issues relevant for most developing countries. They can
be complemented with optional thematic modules for an in-depth assessment of issues
that can be important for some countries but not for others. This Implementation
Manual includes directions for the implementation of two such modules:
6. Large-Scale Acquisition of Land Rights

7. Forestry
Within each theme area or optional module, a series of indicators has been developed
with specific dimensions that define areas for investigation, quantitative measurement
or qualitative assessment. Through the assessment of these indicators, the LGAF
highlights areas for legal, policy or procedural reform to improve governance in land
administration over time and can be used as a basis for global and intra-regional
comparisons.

1.2    Why the Land Governance Assessment Framework Is Important For
Uganda
In 1995, the Uganda government embarked on land reform starting with the
Constitutional provisions. Land reform was imperative because of the country’s
turbulent land tenure history. Since 1995, many policies and laws have been
promulgated to streamline land governance. In addition, financial, human and
infrastructure resources have been put in place to enhance the process. All these efforts
are attributed to the recognition that secure land rights and effective land governance
are key stimulants to social and economic development for Uganda. In a pluralistic
society like Uganda, effective land governance is premised on the pillars of equity,
proficiency and justice.
The LGAF is introduced in Uganda at a time when the major policy reform process is
coming to a close and more in-depth implementation of the reforms about to
commence. This is such an appropriate moment in the history of Uganda where
successes in policy and legal reforms meet real implementation challenges requiring a
concerted effort of all land sector actors to pull off the reforms in practice.

The objective of Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) in Uganda is to (i)
assess the status of land governance at country level and (ii) build consensus around
priority recommendations amongst key stakeholders to improve land governance. This
participatory and locally driven assessment process helps to establish a consensus on
the status of land governance and identify priority actions regarding (i) gaps in existing
evidence; (ii) areas for regulatory or institutional change, (iii) for piloting of new
approaches and interventions to improve land governance on a broader scale (iv)
opportunities for south/south learning to take advantage of experiences from other
countries in dealing with land sector issues, and (v) indicators to assess the


                                                                                        7
effectiveness of these measures. LGAF thus also helps put in place a benchmark and
process to systematically track progress in improving land governance over time.

Uganda concluded the development of its National Land Policy in August 2013, a
process that saw the participation of the entire citizenry in its development. As Uganda
looks ahead to implementation of the National Land Policy, several reforms are
foreseeable especially in the legal and institutional arrangement to enable land
governance take root and yield the desired results of making land work for the citizens
of Uganda as a tool for poverty reduction and wealth creation. Land is no longer viewed
in terms of rights recognition only, but in terms of its productive capacity and as an
enabler for economic empowerment and political participation.

Uganda chose to undertake the assessment of ten themes with a total of 33 indicators
and 119 sub indicators. Below is a brief description of each of the ten themes that
Uganda considered.

Theme 1: Land rights recognition
This theme considered the land tenure typology in Uganda particularly drawing
distinctions between registered land and documentation. Land governance is a
multifaceted web of laws, processes and structures through which decisions are made
about access to land and its use, the manner in which the decisions are implemented
and enforced, and how competing interests in land are managed. It includes all relevant
institutions from the state, civil society and private sectors – including statutory,
customary and religious institutions. It also covers the legal and policy framework for
land, as well as traditional practices governing land transactions, inheritance and
dispute resolution (FAO 2009).

 The basic concern for good land governance is two-fold; one is its embeddedness in
Rights discourse generally and the second is states’ political goals such as economic
growth, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability. This assessment
framework intends examine the legal and policy framework for land; therefore, it is
about the second concern achievement of political goals. It gives an overview of the land
and institutional governance framework in Uganda over a period of 20 years. It outlines
the reform policies and laws as well as other processes and activities within this period
with the aim of assessing progress regarding land reform implementation and legal
framework enforcement.

Theme 2: Rights common lands & rural land use regulations
The question of rural land use planning in Uganda is one that has remained unanswered
for decades. This dimension enabled to unearth the significance of not only rural land
use planning but the understanding of rights structures; protection and enforcement of
those rights. It delves into issues of multiple layering of rights over the same piece of
land, a challenge currently faced by policy and the legal framework and multiple
layering of rights over the sub soil resources, an unfolding debate in Uganda given the

                                                                                       8
recent discovery of oil and gas; and mineral wealth throughout the country. The process
underscores the significance of recognition. It brings to the fore front the significance of
mapping and recording group rights and ascertainment of boundaries and demarcation
of communal lands. This is of particularly significance to Uganda where over 80% of the
land is held under customary tenure, 90% of the population lives in rural areas and less
than ¼ of the land is mapped and registered of which approximately 515,000 titles have
been issued altogether. The LGAF process created space and a forum for reflection on
appropriate models and mechanisms for security of tenure over rural lands not only
through individualized models but taking cognizance of group rights.

Theme 3: Urban land use, planning, and development
Urban Land Use and Planning in Uganda is regulated by the Physical Planning Act
enacted in 2010. Urbanization is growing in Uganda at a rate of 4.5% p.a1 and 60% of
the population is slum dwellers2. This means that there is a high growth of informal
settlements and this creates challenges for urban planning. The growth of urbanization
is resulting from a myriad of factors ranging from rural poverty, search for employment,
and access to social services & opportunities, reclassification of land use and, the
exploding population in the country.

Planning is key issue to urban development because it plays a significant role on what
and how developments will occur, when and where they will occur. Urban planning in
Uganda can be traced back to 1890s when the first European footprint can be traced
through spatial and urban planning that set Kampala to be similar to a European city3.
The Ideas and theories of planning emerged from the British concept of cities taking
into consideration health, aesthetics and exclusive settlement areas and this was made
law through the Uganda’s Town and Country Planning Act of 1951. In this period,
physical planning formed one of the grounds for compulsory acquisition of land and as
such the area would be declared a planning Area.

In 1995, physical planning ceased to be a ground for compulsory acquisition of land.
Land further was vested in the Citizens of Uganda according to four tenure systems,
Leasehold, Freehold, Mailo and Customary Tenure. In effect, this did away with public
land that vested in the state. It also provided that all leases out of public land were
convertible to freeholds and this included statutory leases to urban authorities4 . The
Constitution in its Article 237(7) provides that Parliament make laws to enable urban
authorities to enforce and implement planning and development. The implications of
this provision is that regardless tenure type, an area can be declared a planning area
and planning regulations and development enforceable. This however does not come
without challenge especially where rights to land are fuzzy.

The LGAF process enabled the analysis of the key constraints and challenges to urban
growth and development in Uganda, considering the relationship between informal
settlements and land tenure patterns, restrictions to urban land use, the conduciveness
of the legislative and institutional arrangements to support urban land use planning and
development.

Theme 4: Public land management
The LGAF defines public land as land in the custodianship of the state, municipality, or
local authority, as opposed to private land.

Public land in Uganda has evolved with the land question in Uganda, a process which
has always been at the centre of the constitutional and legal discourse. The result is that
land issues are mired in a bed of complex constitutional structures and processes,
drawing legitimacy from historical as well as contemporary political exigencies. Today,
the mention of Public land in Uganda is foreign.

The National Land Policy Consultative processes generated a common stand throughout
Uganda with regard to the public land/ government land issue. It became apparent that
over the years, the state and local governments have demonstrated systematic
arbitrariness, inefficiency, and lack of transparency in the exercise of these powers, at
the risk of some communities becoming landless and in continuous land conflicts with
their neighbors. The state therefore became both an inefficient land manager and a
predator on land which belongs to ordinary land users. In particular, the constitutional
and legal framework lacked clarity on:

      implications of shifting the radical title to land from the State to the citizens of
       Uganda at large;
      proper role of the central governments and local governments in land use and
       development control ( the police of the State);
      land taxation;
      scope and exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition;
      Control and management of public land and government land;
      doctrine of public trusteeship;

The LGAF process enabled the analysis of the whole spectrum of public land governance
form the legal and institutional framework, its management, protection and
enforcement mechanisms, to its alienation.


Theme 5: Transfer of Large Tracts of Land to Investors
The agricultural sector is the most important source of income and livelihoods for
Uganda's predominantly rural population. Agriculture contributes 43% of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), 85% of export earnings, and 80% of employment (Republic of
Uganda, 2000). Although food crop production dominates, only one-third of the food


                                                                                        10
crop produced is marketed. Major crops are bananas, cereals, root crops, pulses and oil
seeds. Export crops, including coffee, tea, tobacco and cotton, account for only 8 percent
of cultivated area. Because of the significance of agriculture to rural livelihoods, land is
the most important asset for many Ugandan households. Average land holdings are
estimated at 2.2 ha per household, although there are inter- and intraregional
inequalities in this distribution, and evidence suggests much of this land is not
cultivated (McKinnon and Reinikka, 2000).

In Uganda, the land is mainly transferred to public and private sector investors. The
investors are basically Ugandan citizens that are not indigenous or Ugandan local elites
who have entered into agreement with the Uganda Government and the production is
mainly for export purposes. The public sector does it mainly for food security purposes
while some are for energy and investment opportunity. Whereas small holder farmers
utilize small pieces of land to meet their basic needs including food, shelter, health and
clothing, commercial farmers utilize large acreages of land with sole aim of
accumulating wealth for the individuals or corporate entities owning the investment. As
a result, commercial farming initiatives always address profit maximizing opportunities
irrespective of the cost to either the environment or the communities in which the
initiative is implemented. However, it is argued that large scale land acquisition for
agricultural purposes can be beneficial for the poor countries’ economic development
through job creation and food security to some extent. In this regard, International land
acquisition refers to countries with insufficient land for food production look beyond
their borders to find land that they can use.

The LGAF process enabled the examination of how land alienations happen in Uganda,
the legal and regulatory framework governing these processes, people participation and
coordination of the various departments. It brought a lot of learning on the need to
streamline the processes through the regulation of the investment climate.

Theme 6: Public provision of land information: registry and cadastre
Land administration is a function, which entails the mobilization of institutional
mechanisms and personnel for juridical, regulatory, fiscal and cadastral components
development. Land rights administration involves the process of determining,
registering and availing information about ownership, value and use of land and its
associated resources.

Land Administration operates within two parallel systems comprising a) the traditional
customary/informal systems governed by customs and norms of given communities
and b) the centralized statutory/formal (state) system governed by written law. The
two are not in harmony and often lead to confusion as the institutional arrangements
are not clearly spelt out and the two systems are not at the same level of development
(GOU-NLP 2013:32).



                                                                                         11
Land rights administration in Uganda has contributed to land rights insecurity as a
result of lack of proper record keeping, inaccuracies in land registry process, fraud and
forgeries in the land administration system.

Public provision of land information enables the building of public confidence in the
delivery of land services and promotes transparency and accountability in land
governance. The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development has developed the
Land Information System that should function irrespective of tenure. It requires the
accurate capture of land information as elaborated in the introduction and the
translation of that information into digital format for storage and retrieval.

The LGAF enabled a close examination of the existing land administration system and
how it is facilitating security of tenure both formal and informal. It investigates whether
the registry records are linked to the national cadastre and whether maps are up to
date.

It enabled to bring to bear where Uganda is in terms of provision of land information
and to clearly highlight the existing challenges in managing sustained growth in land
registration in Uganda.

Theme 7: Land valuation and taxation
Valuation has particularly been challenging to Uganda especially in light of large scale
land acquisitions for investment and the discovery of mineral wealth. Should the
conventional methods of valuation continue to apply? The LGAF process enabled a close
examination of the valuation system in Uganda and enabled the understanding and
consensus to be reached on the need to improve and review the valuation laws in the
country. As regards taxation, an analysis of the valuation for taxation rolls were
analyzed in a bid to determine how supportive they are for efficiency in taxation. The
LGAF process enabled consensus building on the need to improve the taxation system in
Uganda as a mechanism of increasing the funding to support of land services delivery.

Panel 8: Dispute resolution
Land related disputes are among the most prevalent types of disputes occurring with
and among communities in Uganda both in the rural and urban areas. These disputes
are fuelled by a number of factors, which include: population pressures, unfair land
tenure regimes, changes in land laws, lack of clearly demarcated boundaries, backward
and discriminatory customary laws and practices, inheritance practices, outdated
statutory laws, underdeveloped land markets, lack of a modern land information system
as well as inaccessibility to available land information.

Land disputes do not only stifle investment on land, they also divert scarce resources
(labour, time and money) to solve them, thus impacting negatively on productivity and
household income generation, resulting into heightened poverty levels. Quite often land
disputes result into destruction of property and, in extreme cases, even loss of lives.
Very often, the disputed land becomes a ‘no-go’ area and is not available for use while

                                                                                        12
the dispute lasts, which results in the withdrawal of a critical factor for wealth-
generation from productivity. Thus, there is obvious need to find effective ways of
resolving and/or mitigating land disputes particularly for poor households. Inadequacy
and in many cases, lack of information and knowledge about land rights is a cause of
fraudulent land dealings due to ignorance and at times lack of concrete information
about a given land parcel and the attendant land rights, especially within communities.
Lack of information about land seriously impacts on poverty levels in that communities
do not have the basis on which to effectively protect their land rights and to plan for the
development of their land at optimal productivity levels.

The LGAF process in Uganda enabled to bring the elements of administrative dispute
resolution in the same breath with judicial dispute resolution, a process that was critical
to drawing synergy between various departments of Government to resolve the land
dispute management function and at the same time consider the formal and informal
dispute resolution. The LGAF enabled highlight the gaps in institutional arrangement
but to underscore the significance of Alternative dispute resolution models.

Panel 9: Review of institutional arrangements and policies
Uganda embraced a decentralized system of governance based on the District as a Unit
under which there are lower Local Governments and Administrative Unit Councils.
Elected Local Government Councils which are accountable to the people are made up of
persons directly elected to represent electoral areas, persons with disabilities, the youth
and women councilors forming one third of the council. The Local Government Council
is the highest political authority in its area of jurisdiction. The councils are corporate
bodies having both legislative and executive powers. They have powers to make local
laws and enforce implementation. On the other hand Administrative Unit Councils serve
as political units to advise on planning and implementation of services. They assist in
the resolution of disputes, monitor the delivery of services and assist in the
maintenance of law, order and security.

The LGAF process enabled the assessment of the clarity of mandates and inter-linkages
that do exist within the land sector, how strong and efficient they are to ensure
sustainability and effectiveness of service provision. In this regard the LGAF process
enabled the analysis of existing mandates and the determination where there are
possible conflicts of interest. The process enabled the identification of administrative
overlaps and therefore areas of improvement.

Panel 10: Forestry
Forests provide a variety of goods and services, at the global and local levels. At the local
level, in many countries, they are an important source of food, fuel and fodder and
overall livelihoods for local communities. Forests provide important global public goods
functions of which climate change mitigation (through carbon storage) is currently the
most high profile one. Yet, forests are also one of the least well-governed resources,
suffering excessive destruction and consequent (and often irreversible) loss of
                                                                                          13
contributions to timber, non-timber forest products, biodiversity and climate
mitigation. This needs to be controlled and improving the quality of governance is a key
challenge needing urgent redress in this context.

This module aims to assess the quality of key dimensions of forest governance and how
they might be strengthened when found to be inadequate. Through a core set of
questions, the module probes governance aspects such as the available incentives in a
country to promote climate change mitigation, how forest management and resources
address the drivers of deforestation, legal recognition of the rights of indigenous people,
participation of local communities in land use plans, efforts to control illegal logging and
corruption, etc. Where existing systems are judged to be inadequate, the module points
the way for further verification and analysis.

CHAPTER 2 - METHODOLOGY

2.1 The Overall approach
Although the Land Governance Assessment Framework implementation manual
adopted five thematic areas for the measurement of performance in the field of land
governance (these five thematic areas are: Legal and Institutional Framework; Land
Use Planning, Management and Taxation; Management of Public Land; Public Provision
of Land Information; and Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management), Uganda
assessed ten thematic areas.. Within the 10 thematic areas there are 27 “land
governance indicators” (LGI) and 6 Forestry Governance Indicators (FGI). Each
indicator relates to a basic principle of governance and is further broken down into a
number of “dimensions. For each indicator, there are between 2 and 6 dimensions, with
a total of 119 core dimensions in the LGAF. Each dimension is to be assessed by
selecting an appropriate answer among a list of pre-coded statements.

The LGAF hierarchy of thematic areas, indicators and dimensions is represented in
Table 1 below which lists the most satisfactory assessment for each dimension. A full
detailed version of the LGAF that includes comments and all possible alternative
assessments for each dimension is set out in chapter 4 of this report.

The assessment was conducted using the Land Governance Assessment Framework
(LGAF) developed by the World Bank together with many multi and bilateral partners
and is an instrument to bring together a wide range of stakeholders to assess the status
of land governance in a participatory way that can provide a basis for a shared vision
and thus a platform for change in the sector. To this end, ULA composed a multi
disciplinary team of researchers and panels of experts to respond to the diversity of
issues covered in the LGAF.

A score methodology was used at the expert panels to assess the ten themes of the
LGAF for which rankings were assigned by expert panels based on pre-coded answers
(on a scale from A to D) that drew on global experience. The panels were a consensus
building exercise that ensured that all key stakeholders in the land sector participated
in the assessment of the land sector performance and took ownership of the results not
only to better implementation, but for comparative analyses across countries for
learning.


2.2    LGAF Implementation Process in Uganda
Consideration of the LGAF indicators
The Land Governance Indicators were assessed together with the Forestry Governance
indicators. For the Case of Uganda, combining forestry with rights to common land and
rural land use regulation did not create an appropriate theme for assessment. It was
then decided that the two themes be separated to enable more in depth analysis.

                                                                                     15
Preparation of the Inception Report
The inception report delved into the background to land governance in Uganda. It sets
the context within which the LGAF is carried out in Uganda. It sought to justify the
involvement of the Government in the process. The inception report analysed both the
typology of land and the institutional map. It gave comprehensive background
information on the legal and institutional framework governing land tenure and land
rights administration in Uganda. It is on the basis of the inception report that panels 1,
4, 8 and 9 derive most of the information.

The inception report further laid down the methodology that would be applied, the
likely challenges that would be faced and the likely timeframe for the execution of the
task. It outlined the list of proposed panellists and the details of the expert team.

Expert Background Papers
The Expert Investigation Reports were prepared following the Terms of Reference
specified in the LGAF Implementation Manual. Uganda decided to separate rural land
use from Forestry and thus the ten technical background papers. The background
papers sought as much as possible to link theory to practice save for where there was
no documentary evidence available to substantiate the practice. Where there was no
documentary evidence, the Expert professional experience was called into play to
substantiate assessment of the dimension.

All indicators and dimensions were investigated although some had less information
available. The dimensions below were deficient in information to enable conclusive
assessments to be made. However, an attempt was made based on available information
to score the dimensions and then subjected to the expert panels to support the
generation of more information.

Panel 2: Rights common lands & rural land use regulations

4 Effectiveness and Equity of Rural Land Use Regulations

Dimensions

4.1 Restrictions regarding rural land use are justified and enforced

4.2 Restrictions on rural land transferability effectively serve public policy objectives

4.3 Rural land use plans are elaborated/ changed through clear public process &
resulting burdens are shared

4.4 Rural lands the use of which is changed are swiftly transferred to the assigned
purpose

4.5 Rezoning of rural land use follows a public process that safeguards existing rights

                                                                                            16

8.2 A building permit for a residential dwelling can be obtained quickly and at low cost

Panel 5: Transfer of Large Tracts of Land to Investors
16.3 Avenues to Deal with Non-Compliance Exist & Obtain Timely and Fair Decisions

Briefing Notes
Based on the draft background reports, the Country Coordinator prepared the draft
Panel briefing Notes following the template provided in the LGAF Implementation
Manual. As the briefing notes are prepared, these were sent to the Global LGAF
Coordinator in WB Washington for review and/or comments. Revised panel notes were
then circulated to the panel members to be used as basis for discussions during the
Panel Workshops.

The Briefing notes are based on the ten themes and a preliminary scoring for each of the
119 dimensions was undertaken by the Expert investigators based on the information
obtained and assessment of that information. Explanatory notes accompanied the
scoring of each indicator. These explanatory notes seek to justify or rather give the
relevant information including data sources and reliability that led the expert
investigators to score as such. The briefing notes were shared with the panel of experts
a week prior to the panel workshops.

Panels
A total of ten panels were conducted and the experts to the panels composed as below.
Because of lack of specialization in all fields in the country, and the timing of conducting
the panels (just after the festive season and in the New Year) the Expert team
categorized the themes into three and experts invited repeatedly to each of these
themes. There were a total of ten experts in each particular team with a combination of
private sector practitioners, academia, civil society and Government. This ensured that
the discussions were rich and new information generated for each of the panels.

Although it is ideal to have a gender representation on the various expert panels, Search
for experts revealed that there are very few women experts in the land sector, of those
who exist, the majority are in government. The approach to panel composition was to
have a balanced representation of the various land sector institutions in these panels for
a more balanced engagement. This has left some panels only constituted by Men. It was


                                                                                         17
the coordinators job therefore to ensure that the views and assessment was no blind to
the gender dimension of land sector issues.

Procedure for holding the panels
Upon acceptance of the Panel workshop invitation, the Panel Experts were given the set
of dimensions to be assessed, as well as compiled information and data by the Expert
Investigators to support the dimension assessment. The Briefing notes were given to
the panellists a week prior to running of the workshops to enable them read and find
additional information prior to the workshop. This preparatory period was deemed
important in enabling constructive engagement at the panels, and reduction in the
amount of time that would be spent on clarifications. Panellists were asked to seek
clarifications on dimensions prior to the panel sessions. The assessment undertaken by
the experts were fine tuned with the panel members based on their knowledge and
experience. The material was revised and a preliminary ranking of each dimension
made by individual Panel Experts prior to the briefing session. Each individual panellist
made his/her own initial assessment on a separate dimension scoring sheet.
The scoring at the panel was done through a participatory process, with each panellist
stating what their score was and why. Additional information was solicited at this point.
Discussions ensued of the assessment dimensions and consensus built around each
dimension. This ensured that the discussions among panellists were be based on
substantive evidence, statistics, or relevant information supporting a diversity of points
of view and expertise. Where there were strong views to the contrary by a dissenting
section, the views were captured. The discussions were aided by the use of recorded to
ensure that transcribing of the proceedings to reflect a true and correct record could be
done.
The moderated discussions were an opportunity to discuss particular cases, potential
policy interventions and reform suggestions. Panellists were encouraged to discuss
policy options and implications of the dimension scenario. These need to be carefully
noted and formed the policy commentary and recommendations that were drawn on
each of the indicators.
Country Score Card
A synthesis of all the agreed to scoring of the 119 dimensions of the 27 Land
Governance Indicators (LGIs) and 6 Forestry governance Indicators (FGIs) were
tabulated into the country score card. The Country scorecard, giving a clear picture of
what the country’s land governance status is by indicator and dimension.

Preparation of the Final Report
Findings from the into the 119 dimensions of the 27 Land Governance Indicators (LGIs)
and 6 Forestry governance Indicators (FGIs) were synthesized into a final summarizing
the LGAF indicator and dimension findings and policy recommendations. The policy
recommendations from the panel deliberations and other investigations were
formulated into a clear policy matrix that sets out policy recommendations in a form

                                                                                       18
that can be readily communicated to policy makers and other key stakeholders. The
Country Coordination is responsible for the preparation of the policy matrix and the
draft report submitted to the World Bank for peer review and quality control.

Participation of Government Departments
Whereas the LGAF process is a very transparent one, it was found important to win
Government buy-in from the very start. The Coordinator discussed the process with key
government Departments thus availing adequate information for the preparation of the
inception report and improvement of the panel briefing notes and enriching the final
report. There was some high profile information that could not be captured but was
taken note of. This caused changes in the panel scores but no recording was done of the
sensitive statements that were derived from the panels.

Furthermore, the participation of these functionaries enhances the divulgence of
information especially by other government departments and the local governments
because they are sure it is for Government use. This also enabled the gaining of political
support to the whole process and the sustainability of the impacts of LGAF in Uganda.

Validation
The Draft final report will be subjected to national validation for confirmation (or
adjusting) of rankings and articulation of policy messages. Prioritisation will be done of
which indicators or dimensions require urgent attention and it is on this basis that
follow on actions will be decided.

Follow on actions
Through the LGAF process, key areas have already emerged as points of interest. Key
among these are:
Theme 5 - Transfer of Large tracts of Land
Theme 7 - Valuation and Taxation
Theme 8 - Dispute Resolution
Theme 10 - Forestry
These will most likely be endorsed by the validation workshop as the v=critical areas of
intervention. There are already actions proposed for each of these areas.

As part of the Legal Aid Conference in March, the issues in the Dispute resolution will be
discussed. The High Court Land Division Users Committee takes up dialogues on the
efficiency in delivery of justice and to deal with bottlenecks to effectiveness of the chain
of justice.

A multi stakeholder working group was composed as a result of the work on panel 5 to
develop strategies to respond to the challenges of transfer of land tracts of land. A
national Land forum will be composed in April to discuss these matters and raw a clear
way forward for engagement and making land work for investment.

                                                                                         19
A World Bank project will be commencing in Uganda to support REDD+ in Uganda. The
issues discussed in panel 10 and panel 4 will be delved into further to give support to
the project.

Policy dialogues will be organized for each of the themes once a month in a bid to
disseminate the findings and popularise the LGAF in Uganda. This will attract a wide
range of actors from different sectors to participate. The Policy dialogues will attract
between 70 - 100 participants, mainly comprised of the academia, private sector,
government, civil society, farmer groups and consumer groups in Uganda. The aim of
these policy dialogues is further to have the identified specific policy actions identified
during the validation and LGAF-associated indicators are adopted by the Government
and included in the relevant agencies routine reporting to monitor progress.

CHAPTER 3 - COUNTRY CONTEXT


3.1     Geographical features and Demographics
Uganda is an East African country bordered by Sudan to the North, Zaire to the West,
Rwanda and Tanzania to the South and Kenya to the East. Its total area is 241,039 sq.
km, of which 197,097 sq. km. is land while the rest, which is approximately 43,942 sq.
km. is covered by water and swamps. It lies between latitudes 42o north and 1.5o south
and latitudes 28o and 35o east. The country occupies a plateau averaging 915 meters in
the north rising to 1,340 near Kampala. Uganda’s highest point, Mt. Stanley at 5,110
meters, is to be found in the east rift system which lies along the southwestern border
near the Equator. In addition to lakes which cover approximately one-fifth of its
territory, the country also has a complex system of rivers many of which are to be found
in the south of the country and which drain into Lake Victoria, the third largest lake in
the world.

There are two distinct wet seasons, namely March to May and October to November.
The northeast part of the country is the driest, receiving about 812 millimeters of
rainfall between April and August while the Lake Victoria region receives in excess of
1,500 millimeters annually.

Temperatures are moderated by altitude and range from 35 degrees centigrade on the
rift floor near the Sudanese border, to 5 degrees centigrade in the south-western
highlands.

   Population and human settlements:

   The population of Uganda is approximately 36.3 million people growing at the rate of
   3.3% per annum. In terms of distribution 3.4 of the population is to be found in the
   urban areas and approximately 86.6% in the rural areas. The capital city of Kampala
   boasts of a population of 1.5 million people. The overall population density is estimated
   at 76.4 to a sq. km. This, however, belies the fact that actual densities are much higher
   in the riverine districts of the country. In terms of demographic characteristics, the
   population remains relatively young at 55% below the age of 18 years; slightly over
   51% of it being female.
   The pattern of human settlements in Uganda has been shaped not only by eco-climatic
   factors, but also by such traumatic phenomena as wars and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
   Consequently many parts of the country are sparsely populated while others carry fairly
   high physiological averages. One consequence of this is that size distribution of land
   varies quite widely.

3.2    Land in economy and society
Economic significance of land:
Like all other African countries, Uganda’s economy depends on its agriculture, which
contributes 43% of the total GDP of the country and over 90% of its total exports.
Agriculture remains the largest single employer engaging approximately 80% of
workforce. Indeed, Uganda remains one of the few nations that is self-sufficient in food,
despite the almost total collapse of its economic infrastructure due to civil war and the
impact of the HIV/Aids pandemic.



                                                                                      24
Although 42% of the total land area of the country is suitable for agricultural use, only
21% of this is currently under cultivation and this is mostly in the southern regions. A
large part of the country, particularly in the north and the northeast, is not suitable for
agriculture due to the prevalence of the tsetse fly. Livestock rearing is, nonetheless, an
important activity in these arrears.

The basic unit of production in the agricultural areas is the small-scale family holdings.
The average size of such holdings is between 1.6 to 2.8 hectares in the south and 3.2
hectares in the north. Such holdings are typically held under customary tenure; a land
rights system which varies from one ethnic community to another and from one region
to the other. The majority of the ethnic communities, however, recognise continuous
use of specific areas of land under the control of the family or some larger units as the
basic land tenure principle. The right to hold and work such land is secured for as long
as the land is occupied and cultivated. Generally, when such occupation and cultivation
cease, the land reverts to common ownership and may be reallocated to other users.

Description of the Political system
Uganda is a presidential republic, in which the President of Uganda is both head of
state and head of government; there is a multi-party system. Executive power is
exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and
the National Assembly. The system is based on a democratic parliamentary system
with universal suffrage for all citizens over 18 of years age. In a measure ostensibly
designed to reduce sectarian violence, political parties were restricted in their activities
from 1986. In the non-party "Movement" system instituted by the current
president Yoweri Museveni, political parties continued to exist but could not campaign
in elections or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to
political parties). A constitutional referendum cancelled this 19-year ban on multi-party
politics in July 2005.
The Ugandan constitution was adopted on October 8, 1995 by the interim, 284-
member Constituent Assembly, charged with debating the draft constitution that had
been proposed in May 1993. Uganda's legal system since 1995 has been based on
English common law and African customary law (customary law is in effect only when it
does not conflict with statutory law). It is in this constitution that land tenure and land
rights are enshrined. The Ugandan judiciary operates as an independent branch of
government and consists of magistrate's courts, high courts, courts of appeal, and the
Supreme Court. Judges for the High Court are appointed by the president; Judges for the
Court of Appeal are appointed by the president and approved by the legislature. The
decisions of the courts form the body of law in Uganda by setting precedents.

The system of Local Government in Uganda is based on the District as a Unit under
which there are lower Local Governments and Administrative Unit Councils. Elected
Local Government Councils which are accountable to the people are made up of persons
directly elected to represent electoral areas, persons with disabilities, the youth and
women councilors forming one third of the council. The Local Government Council is the
highest political authority in its area of jurisdiction. The councils are corporate bodies
having both legislative and executive powers. They have powers to make local laws and
enforce implementation. On the other hand Administrative Unit Councils serve as
political units to advise on planning and implementation of services. They assist in the

     resolution of disputes, monitor the delivery of services and assist in the maintenance of
     law, order and security.

Political and social significance of land:
Even before colonisation, land was always an important factor in the political
organisation of Ugandan societies. This is clear not only in the organisation of
governments in the kingdoms of Buganda, Busoga, Bunyoro and Toro, but also among
territorial societies such as the Karimonjong. What colonialism did, therefore, was
merely to legitimize an intricate system of political relationships based on land that had
been in existence for centuries. This is the context in which the Uganda Agreement
1900 and the laws that were subsequently made to govern the relationships between
the nobility and their tenants in Buganda, Toro, Ankole and Busoga must be read.


Underlying and hence reinforcing the political significance of land, is the fact that for
indigenous Ugandans, land has always had an important ontological value. For land is
regarded not merely as a factor of production, but first, and foremost, as the medium
which defines and binds together social and spiritual relations within and across
generations. Issues about ownership and control are therefore as much about the
structure of social and cultural relations as they are about access to material livelihoods.
This is one reason why debate about land tenure in Uganda and elsewhere in Africa has
always revolved around the structure and dynamics of lineages and cultural
communities, rather than on strict juridical principles and precepts. For this reason,
control over land and associated resources constitutes, in social and cultural terms,
sovereignty over the very spirituality of society.
The geo-physical, economic, political and socio-cultural significance of land outlined
above must constantly be kept in mind if the essential characteristics of the land
question in Uganda are to be identified. For not only do they locate land and associated
resources at the centre of the struggle for identity and survival, they also point to the
major concerns which policy development in this area must address. Indeed, they link
land not only to the nature of contemporary political and social struggles but more
importantly to basic livelihood concerns such as poverty and food security.

3.3       Land Tenure in Uganda


3.3.1 Evolution of Land Tenure in Uganda
Historical Background to the Land Tenure Systems in Uganda
In common with other African countries, colonization had an important impact on land
relations in Uganda. In the first instance, through a series of agreements made with
traditional rulers and their functionaries the British authorities granted a number of
private estates called Mailo in Buganda and native freeholds in Toro and Ankole that
were broadly equivalent to the English freehold. The effect of these agreements was not
only to legitimise the feudal system of land tenure then in existence, but also to firmly
confer upon feudal overlords’ absolute control of land, which they never had under
customary law. For the rest of Uganda, all land was expressly declared to be crown land
meaning that the British authorities now held radical title to such land and all land users
became, at the stroke of the pen, tenants of the British crown. Thus being holder of
radical title, the colonial government proceeded to grant a limited number of freehold
estates to selected individuals and corporations. In the second instance by virtue of
political sovereignty, the British authorities now asserted the right to control the
management and use of land, a power that was previously vested either in communities

                                                                                        32
or in the political functionaries of such communities. These changes were accompanied
by an elaborate system of land administration, which included, in the case of Buganda, a
system of land registration purporting to confer indivisible title to the Buganda King, his
Princes and other landlords.

Independence and continuity
Upon the attainment of independence in 1962, the Government of Uganda retained the
system of land tenure introduced by the colonial government In 1975, however, the
Government of President Idi Amin issued a decree called ‘The Land Reform Decree’
which declared all land to be public land and vested the same in the State to be held in
trust for the people of Uganda and to be administered by the Uganda Land Commission.
The decree abolished all freehold interests in land except where these were vested in
the State in which case these were transferred to the Land Commission. It also
abolished the Mailo system of land tenure and converted them into leasehold of 99
years where these were vested in public bodies, and to 999 years where individuals
held these.

All laws that had been passed to regulate the relationships between landlords and
tenants in Buganda, Ankole and Toro were also abolished. Elsewhere customary land
users became tenants at sufferance of the state.

The legal implications of the Land Reform Decree, though not fully felt on the ground,
persisted until 1995 when a new Constitution was enacted. That Constitution abolished
the Land Reform Decree and restored the systems of land tenure that were in existence
at independence. These were re-stated as customary land tenure, freehold tenure,
leasehold tenure and Mailo tenure. The Constitution, however, went further: it made
new and radical changes in the relationships between the State and the land in Uganda.
It declared that land in Uganda would henceforth belong to the citizens of Uganda and
vest in them in accordance with the land tenure systems outlined above. The
Constitution went further and set up a new system of land administration consisting of
Land Boards in every district, the functions of which were: -

   a) to hold and allocate land in the district which is not owned by any person or
      authority;
   b) to facilitate the registration and transfer of interests in land: and
   c) to deal with all other matters connected with land in the district in accordance
      with laws made by Parliament.


Although the Uganda Land Commission was re-established, the Constitution made it
clear that District Land Boards were to operate independently of that Commission and
were not subject to the direction or control of any person or authority. They were,
however, expected to take account of national and district council policy on land.



                                                                                        33
The Constitution further provided that Parliament would provide for the establishment
of land tribunals, the jurisdiction of which would be to determine disputes relating to
the grant, lease, repossession, transfer or acquisition of land by individuals, the Uganda
Land Commission or other authority with responsibility relating to land, and the
determination of any disputes relating to the amount of compensation to be paid for
land acquired.

Finally, the Constitution reaffirmed the authority of the State to make laws regulating
the use of land.

The land question in contemporary Uganda
It should be clear from what has been stated above that at least until 1995, the
characteristics of the land question in Uganda were no different from what they were
during the colonial period. First, the feudal system of land tenure remained a feature of
land relations in Buganda; secondly, customary land tenure systems remained
unregulated and completely outside the statutory framework of land law of the country
and, thirdly, the system of land administration was in no way integrated into the land
tenure framework of the country.


The 1995 Constitution and a new law passed in 1998 did not entirely deal with the
fundamental issues underlying these characteristics. Indeed what the Act, did rather,
was to elaborate upon juridical principles underlying the land tenure and management
systems introduced by the Constitution. Apart from providing some relief for tenants
under the Mailo system, the Act did not, and could not, question the essential merits of
the new tenure systems nor the desirability of the elaborate system of land
administration and dispute resolution introduced by the Constitution. The primary
reason for this was not simply that the Constitution had set the parameters for the new
land laws; but it was because no clear policy principles existed to inform legislators in
the enactment of that law.


3.3.2 Land Tenure Systems post 1995
Land tenure refers to the terms and conditions under which access to land rights are
acquired, retained, used, disposed of, or transmitted. An examination of land tenure is
therefore central to the formulation of an adequate land policy. There are three ways of
classifying land tenure regimes. The first is in terms of the legal regime governing
tenure i.e. whether that regime is statutory or customary. The second is in terms of the
manner in which such land is held i.e. whether as private, public or community
property. The third is in terms of the quantum of rights held i.e. whether as freehold,
leasehold or commonhold.




                                                                                       34
The Constitution of Uganda and the Land Act 1998 have addressed only the last of these
classification schemes. They provide that land in Uganda may be held in terms of four
tenure categories, namely customary freehold, mailo and leasehold.

Three principles guided the formulation of the 1998 Land Act:

•   A good land tenure system should support agricultural development through the
    function of land market that permits those who have rights in land to voluntarily sell
    their land and for progressive framers to gain access to land.

•   A good land tenure system should not force people off the land, particularly those
    who have no other way to earn a reasonable living or to survive. The land tenure
    system should protect people’s rights in land so they are not forced off the land
    before there are jobs available in the non-agricultural sector of the economy.

•   A good land tenure system should be uniform throughout the country.


Based on the categorization of rights, land tenure is commonly translated into four
major regimes: communal ownership, common property, State/public ownership, and
individual or private ownership (Bruce 1998). Theoretically, it is relatively easy and
feasible to distinguish between these four tenure regimes where very well defined
property boundaries based on de jure rights exist. In practice, however, it is often
difficult to identify the boundaries of each property regime, in part because formal and
informal (customary) tenure systems often differ and exist in parallel, and in part
because such customary or formal rights may differ from de facto access. De facto access
may exist with or without a corresponding set of norms that in fact recognize or permit
such access. Resource users may lack de jure rights but may have de facto rights that are
based upon a number of ‘moral’ concepts about what is appropriate or just behaviour.
De facto rights are created through various social-political relations that in practice are
not necessarily based upon the legal or formal boundaries but instead result in the
emergence of informal, layered, nested and overlapping access regimes. Furthermore,
land access may not automatically translate into exclusive de jure or de facto access to
resources on the land, although land access rights may certainly act to strongly
condition access to these resources.



Most land in Uganda is currently held under unregistered ‘customary tenure’. This
means that it is privately owned, either by individuals, families or by clans. (Most
farming land is owned by households or families, while clans usually own grazing and
hunting land.). People’s rights to this land are recognized by law, although they have no
documents to prove ownership, and there is no register where their land ownership is
recorded. Their land has never been formally surveyed: boundaries are locally

                                                                                        35
established, usually by trees or other natural markers. Local land judges or clan elders
know who owns which land and they will arbitrate in cases of dispute. The ‘traditional’
rules of the people relating to land have legal force – this would include matters
concerning the rights of the elderly or children, rights of passage through land, rules
about borrowing and lending land, and about selling land. (However, local rules are not
allowed to discriminate against women or the disabled). However, these authorities
have no power to enforce their decisions except through social pressure (LEMU 2009).


The map below shows the land tenure systems and their geographical coverage in
Uganda. Although up to date reliable figures of extent of the area and populations on
each tenure type are not readily available, this map gives estimate coverage of the
various tenure systems.

     evidently more common in Northern, North Eastern and West Nile Regions of
     Uganda.

     To ensure effective land administration in a decentralized democracy such as
     Uganda, the country has been divided into land administration zones with a
     regional zonal office providing this function. The map below clearly shows these
     zonal offices as spread out across the country.

Customary tenure

The first tenure category specified under the Constitution and the Act is customary land
tenure. Customary land tenure is a complex system of land relations, the incidents of
which are not always capable of precise definition. These incidents often vary from
community to community. The underlying commonality in all customary law systems is
that rights are derived by reason of membership in a community and are retained as a
result of performance of reciprocal obligations in that community. Customary tenure
Uganda has persisted for a long time despite its neglect by the legal regime.


It has long been appreciated that customary tenure arrangements have important
positive attributes. The land allocation system, which is generally designed as part of
the political organization of the community, is an important factor in ensuring inter and
trans-generational equity among members of that community and; because kinship
relations are reproduced in the land tenure system, equilibrium between social, political
and economic processes is generally maintained. This is sustained inter-alia, through
the resolution of land disputes as part of the community process of reconciliation.

Under the communal land system, primarily found in northern Uganda, the household is
the primary owner of the land and may include extended members of the family.
Communal land in Uganda includes gardens and pastures, grazing areas, burial grounds
and hunting areas commonly known as common property regimes. The common
property regime is especially utilized by the pastoralist communities in northern
Uganda and parts of the cattle corridor in the West. User rights are guaranteed for
farming and seasonal grazing, access to water, pasture, burial grounds, firewood
gathering, and other community activities. No specific ownership rights of control are
conferred on users. Control and ownership are through the family, clan, or community.

Under individual/family or clan customary tenure, emphasis is also placed on use rather
than on ownership. Male elders are the custodians of customary land in most
communities and determine distribution of the land. However the family rather than the
community has more control in the land utilization, and individuals in the family are
allocated land. Allocations are only made to male members of the household with very
few exceptions. In many places in Uganda customary land has tended to become more
individualized and though not initially acceptable, incidents of sale are very high. In
many ethnic groups, before a sale is made clan members and family have to be
consulted. However the institution of customary land is weakening in many places,
people are poorer, and sales, mostly distress sales, have increased.

   1. Customary tenure is dynamic and its legal status must not be limited to land
      registration, but must be left to evolve over time taking into account the rules,
      and processes relating to inheritance, third party rights and dispute adjudication.
   2. Defining incidents of customary tenure in terms of generalities as the Land Act
      does may not be useful.


   3. Providing that customary land rights may be registered and certificates of
      ownership issued and subsequent conversion to freehold fails to appreciate the
      complexities of the system.


   4. There is obvious contempt of customary tenure regime in legislation as an
      impediment to agrarian development.


   5. There are apparent conflicts in customary tenure that cannot be resolved
      through customs and norms.


   6. There is preferred privatization of land ownership for agricultural development
      rather than public control of land use.


   7. Any reform of customary tenure must take account of social, cultural, and
      economic realities of Uganda.

Freehold
The second land tenure category set out in the Constitution and the Act is freehold. The
origin of freehold tenure is distinctly colonial and feudal in nature. It connotes the
largest quantum of land rights, which the sovereign can grant to an individual. Being
held of the sovereign, however, the freehold is technically a tenancy hence subject to
resumption by the State. This means that, in theory any surrender of a freehold interest
on sub-division does not entitle the holder to an automatic re-grant of an interest of
equivalent quantum. Nonetheless the freehold interest is said to confer unlimited right
of use, abuse and disposition. Typically, such interests are individually held. In Uganda,
freehold grants have been few and far between.

Although the most sustainable tenure, its application in contemporary Uganda has been
very limited with titles being issued to mainly large scale plantations and religious
bodies. Indeed the incidents of freehold tenure as defined in the Act appear to be no
different from those of customary tenure or of Mailo tenure, both of which are also
defined in the Act. Hence, apart from the fact that freehold land rights are always



                                                                                       39
individually held, there appears to be no distinction between this tenure system and
customary or Mailo land tenure.

Existing Gaps/Issues Identified
   1. Freehold tenure has not made extraordinary contributions to land sector
      Development in Uganda, thus the need therefore, to review its place in Uganda’s
      property system.
   2. Freehold tenure needs to be adapted to the Ugandan Context to encourage the
      registration of rural land in absolute ownership and creating flexibility in its
      administration and management to respond to the needs of the rights seeking
      public.


Mailo
The third tenure system specified by the Constitution and the Act is the Mailo.
Historically, the Mailo was a system of freehold tenure exclusive to Buganda and meant
to solidify political control by Buganda Kings and Princes over their subjects. The
continuation of such a distinctly feudal system of land tenure in contemporary Uganda
is clearly anachronistic. Besides, land under Mailo tenure, being governed by Buganda
law and custom, is held and transmitted exclusively to male heirs. This discriminatory
disposition is clearly contrary to the equalitarian ideology to which the Government of
Uganda is firmly committed.

The recognition and formalization in the Constitution of overlapping rights on a single
land plot, especially on Mailo land is a critical issue requiring redress. On one hand, the
Land Act following the Constitution clearly grants registered land owners the right to
exercise all of the powers of ownership, including the right to take and use all the
produce from the land, the right to engage in any transaction with the land, and the
right to bequeath the land. On the other hand, the same Act, also recognizes the rights of
tenants in occupancy (lawful occupants as well as bonafide occupants) to occupy that
land in perpetuity for as long as they continue to pay the annual ground rent of one
thousand shillings to the registered owner.

Tenants by occupancy have the right to transact on the land in the same way as the
registered owner. A tenant has the right to assign, sublet, pledge, sub-divide, bequeath,
or create third party rights in the land. The existence of various consent requirements
and rights of first refusal are an attempt to reconcile the conflicting rights.
The Existing Gaps/ Issues
   1. The continuation of Mailo as a distinct feudal system is anachronistic. There have been
      massive evictions of tenants on Mailo primarily due to its failure to offer de facto
      protection to tenants, making it a non-sustainable land tenure regime.



                                                                                          40
   2. Under Mailo, land is held, governed, and transmitted by Buganda law and custom to
      exclusively male heirs.


   3. Under this under there is argument that even the tenants are assured of security of
      tenure as long as they pay their dues, it is very popular in Buganda.


   4. The issue of absentee landlords especially in the lost counties (Kibaale cannot be
      overlooked in any tenure policy.


   5. The owner of Mailo tenure is not compelled to put land to the best economic use.

Leasehold
The fourth system of land tenure set out in the Constitution and the Act is the
leasehold. This is a device that is known to every system of land tenure. It involves the
derivation of rights from a superior title and the enjoyment of such rights in exchange
for specific conditions including, but not limited to the payment of rent. Leaseholds may
be created by any proprietor holding a superior interest in any land.

The leasehold is a flexible device, which many jurisdictions have found useful for a
number of reasons. First, the term of lease is usually variable and may be defined in
terms of specific developments planned by the prospective leaseholder. Second, the
supervision of land use, which lies mainly in the domain of contract, is a matter of
fulfillment of reciprocal rights and obligations agreed to by the parties. Third, the
leasehold permits access to land by a much larger range of users and use categories
than either the freehold or the Mailo. Fourth, unlike freeholds and the Mailo, leaseholds
are easily transferable.

Although it is not clear under the Land Act 1998 whether leases can be created under
customary land tenure, there is no doubt that this regime also recognizes leaseholds,
even though the conditions of obtaining such a lease may be different from what they
would be under freehold or Mailo tenure.

Existing Gaps/issues identified
   1. Planning in urban areas has greatly been impeded by the multiplicity of tenure
      systems and the potential of leasehold tenure not explored as a solution to this
      problem.
   2. The access to land through leasehold or analogous arrangements needs to be
      promoted especially in urban areas and areas of high land demand.

The Central region has the greatest percentage of registered land comprising 98.04% of
all the registered land in Uganda. 50% of this land is under the Mailo Tenure system.
Only 0.01% of the land in Northern Uganda is registered.

Table 8: Number of Land titles issued by region




       Source: Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development Facts and figures 2010.

Despite this, customary tenure remains predominant in Uganda. The 2002 Census
report revealed that 68.8% of households occupied customary tenure, 18.6% Freeholds,
9.2% Mailo and only 3.6% occupied leaseholds. Of that, the largest population on
customary land is the rural population. However in the central region, only 2.6% of the
population is on customary land. The percentage distribution by tenure and region is
shown herein below.

Despite the above data, there is a challenge with verifying the accuracy of the statistics
above and there is no complete record of data in the land offices both at the central
government and Local Government land offices.

The Cadastral map below reveals that more than three quarters of the country has
either no cadastral information or incomplete sheets. This is exacerbated further by the
fact that there is no update to these cadastral sheets. The existing data is more than 30
years old.

mostly Mailo data although the verification exercise is still ongoing. The table below
compares the titles entered in the data base and those sorted through the
computerization exercise. By 2010, the Mailo register was largely cleaned out although
the constitutionally recognized rights of tenants and spouses are still not covered,
creating many gaps in the system.

                                 however should not be unnecessarily withheld (Section 34(4-6). Upon

                                 Through mutual agreement, the lawful occupant and the Mailo owner may
                                 agree to subdivisions of the occupancy rights with each party having exclusive
                                 occupancy or ownership rights to such portions either as joint proprietors

                                 will be determined by both parties, or as joint tenants (Section 36(1) of the
                                 Land Act). Appropriate entries will be made on the certificate of title and

PANEL 1- LAND RIGHTS RECOGNITION
The Land Rights Recognition theme delves into the extent to which the legal regime takes
cognizance of the range of rights including derived and secondary rights to land. It further
investigates the enforceability of such rights within the existing legal framework. This
theme considers two indicators with 14 dimensions. The first four dimensions focus on
rights recognition within the continuum while the seven dimensions focus on enforcement
mechanisms for rights recognition.

LG1-1 Recognition of a continuum of rights: (The law recognizes a range of rights held by
individuals incl. secondary rights of tenants. sharecroppers, women etc.). The table below
delves into the four dimensions relating to the recognition of rights.

LGI 1(i) Individuals' Rural Land Tenure Rights are Legally Recognized and Protected
in Practice
The basis for recognition of rural land tenure in Uganda is in the Constitutional declaration
in its Article 237(1) that Land vests in the Citizens of Uganda according to four tenure
types. Key among these tenure types is the recognition of customary tenure as formal
tenure in Uganda. The Constitutional provisions were enforced through Section 4 (1), 9, &
22(1) of the Land Act (Cap 227). These rights are further protected through the
decentralization of the land administration and management functions. The lead ministry
for the delivery of land services is the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development
through the Directorate of Lands. A number of branch offices around the country are in
place to provide local land services (surveying, mapping, valuation and registration).
Whereas the Constitution formalized a tenure that had since been ignored, customary
tenure is complex and most of it remains non-registered. Over 80% of the land in Uganda is
held under customary tenure by over 90% of the rural populations. Based on the tenure
systems and the categorization of rights, land tenure is commonly translated into four
major regimes: communal ownership, common property, State/public ownership, and
individual or private ownership (Bruce et.al 1994). For the registered tenures, it is
relatively easy and feasible to distinguish between Mailo, leasehold and freehold regimes as
they are characterized by very well defined property boundaries. It is however often
difficult to identify the boundaries of the customary tenure regime because there was
neither documentation of custom nor procedures for the recognition of customary tenure.
This tenure has remained marred by conflicts especially boundary related disputes,
succession and inheritance challenges.

The lack of documentation, although legally do not pose a challenge to proof of ownership,
in practice it poses challenges in case of land transactions or land conflicts as the burden of
proof is often transferred to the buyer whose good faith wanes in the event of a land
conflict.

LGI 1(ii) Customary Tenure Rights are Legally Recognized and Protected in Practice
The constitution of the Republic of Uganda in Article 237(3)(a) recognizes customary land
tenure, as one of the ways citizens of Uganda can own land. S.4 (1) of the Land Act provides
that a person, family or community holding land under customary tenure on former public
land may acquire a certificate of customary ownership in respect of that land. An
individual, male or female, or a family may apply to the family or clan to transfer to
him/her/it, his/her/its portion of land and may cause that portion to be surveyed and
transferred to the applicant and registered (Section 22(1) of the Land Act). The holder of a
certificate of customary ownership may convert his/her holding to freehold (Section 9 of
the Land Act). For purposes of holding land under customary tenure, a family is a legal
person represented by the head of the family. In this proviso, the law is silent on the



                                                                                            55
definition of ‘head of family’ and this undermines gender equality as defined in Article
31(2) of the constitution.

On the other hand, land tenure security especially for women and other vulnerable groups
has not been fully ascertained. Uncertainty in tenure rights coupled with lack of
information and access to advice renders poor people vulnerable to loss of land. Tenure
insecurity has been exacerbated by civil wars especially in the Northern part of Uganda.
The World Bank study (Lessons from Northern Uganda, June, 2008), found that tenure
insecurity had worsened and there was a greater (and increasing) number of land conflicts
compared to the pre-displacement period. About 85% of the respondents had experienced
threats to tenure security and 59% felt these threats were significant. Land dispute
incidences had risen from 12.8% total disputes at the time of displacement to 15.5% during
displacement and 16.4% on return (or post conflict). Insecure land tenure was attributed
to lack of Public Knowledge on Land Issues and Rights, Land Conflicts and Disputes,
inadequate capacity of land administration institutions, loopholes in the policy, laws and
institutional frameworks, gender inequities, to mention but a few.

LGI -1(iii) Indigenous Rights to Land and Forests are legally Recognized and
Protected in Practice
Minorities and indigenous groups are more likely to be among the poorest of the poor with
less access to the basic social amenities. They are marginalized in all dimensions of life
where participation in national events is minimal; autonomy is curtailed but where identity
and dignity is more relevant to them than achieving a certain level of income and
consumption (African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights: 2009). In Uganda there
are 3 indigenous groups: the Batwa (6,700 people), the Benet (20,000 people), and Ik a
minority group among the Karimojong).

The Benet lives in north-eastern Uganda while the Batwa live in the south-west of Uganda.
The Benet had been earlier evicted from Mt Elgon forest but were later reinstituted to their
ancestral lands following a test case decided in their favour. The Batwa of south-west5
Uganda were evicted from their ancestral habitat of Mgahinga, Bwindi and Echuya forests
which were established as conservation areas and declared national parks in 1991
(Couillard et al 2009). Eviction of the Batwa from forests has limited their access to food
and familiar shelter. As a result, they are plagued by starvation, sickness and exposure.
There is real danger of this group being extinct in the near future.




5
 The Batwa are currently spread in 5 districts of Bundibugyo, Rukungiri, Kisoro, Kanungu and Kabale which
also surround the 3 Forests that boarders with Ruwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burudi.

                                                                                                      56
The Constitution of Uganda does not recognize the rights of these minority groups as
indigenous peoples because it was argued during the constitutional making debates that
except for the minority Asian population, all ethnicities in Uganda and indigenous. None
the less, article 32 provides for affirmative action for marginalized groups which most
often refers to gender, sex and disability groups. On the other hand, the final national land
policy (2013) recognizes rights of minority groups (§ 4.8) and the policy statement
reaffirms the intent to recognize and protect the rights to these groups in its use and
management of natural resources. It also pledges to promptly pay adequate and fair
compensation to ethnic minority groups which may be displaced from their ancestral land.
It is noted however, that the Batwa as a particularly vulnerable group is not specifically
mentioned. The other legal frameworks such as the Land Act (Cap 227) and the National
Environment Act (Cap 153) also protect customary interests in land and traditional uses of
forests. None the less, it is these very laws which also authorize the government to exclude
human activities in any forest area by declaring it a protected forest. Indeed the National
Forest Authority and Uganda Wildlife Authority have subsequently used these laws to
nullify the customary land rights of the Batwa who were mercilessly evicted and without
offering alternative sources of livelihood.

Political participation of minority groups remains limited and their socioeconomic rights
are ignored. While article 36 of the Uganda Constitution affirms the protection of minority
groups to participate in decision-making processes, and incorporation of their views and
interests in the making of national plans and programmes, the Batwa for example are
completely left out of the governance structures in the districts where they are reside. For
example the African Commission’s report (2009:53) noted that although the Batwa are
willing to move out to the forest to increase their chances of moving out of poverty, there is
no institutional mechanism by which they could be involved in political decision-making
processes.

LGI - 1(iv) Urban Land Tenure Rights are legally Recognized and Protected in
Practice
It is estimated that 60% of slum dwellers (Somik Lall 2012:17) around the country occupy
what was initially public land which translated into customary tenure and ownership
through article 237 of the Constitution. Therefore their legal rights are legally recognized
and protected.
Meanwhile rapid population growth and urbanization is taking place in the absence of an
urban policy. Urban settlements are characterized by informal settlements, inadequate
shelter, lack of infrastructure and basic services, urban sprawl, infringement on
environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and lakeshores.



                                                                                           57
The urban dynamics are clearly seen in Kampala city and this is because Kampala was
initially planned. All the other developing urban areas have a big portion of land being
customarily held. It is even common to find freeholds in the urban areas resulting from the
constitutional provisions in article 237 that abolished statutory leases in urban areas.
For those under tenancy, the Land (Amendment) Act (No 1 of 2010) regarding evictions
protects them as it is not easy evict them.
The National land policy affirms government intention to ensure the supply of affordable
land in urban areas and to provide a framework for regularizing land tenure for dwellers in
informal settlements and slums as well as facilitating negotiations between registered land
owners with the aim of promoting private-public partnerships to enhance tenure security
and stem the growth of slums and informal settlements.

LGI -2(i) Accessible Opportunities for Tenure individualization Exist
Following the recognition of customary tenure under the Constitution, section 4 (1) of the
Land Act empowers an individual, family or community holding land under customary
tenure on former public land to acquire a certificate of customary ownership in respect of
that land. An individual, male or female, or a family may apply to the family or clan to
transfer to him/her/it, his/her/its portion of land and may cause that portion to be
surveyed and transferred to the applicant and registered (Section 22(1) of the Land Act).

Where an Association holds land under customary or Freehold tenure, the Association
must recognize and verify that all or part of the land it holds is occupied and used by
individuals and or families for their own purposes and benefits. Under customary tenure, a
family is recognized as legal person represented by the head of the family.

An individual or family within a community wishing to own her/his/its land which under
customary norms is available for her/his/its use and occupation may:
 If held by the Association on behalf of the community applies for a certificate of
   customary ownership or a certificate of freehold title in respect of her/his/its portion of
   land. The rules that apply for the application for a certificate of customary ownership or
   freehold certificate of title apply in this case without exception.

   Where the Association holds land under customary tenure, the individual or family
    applies to the Association to have her/his/its portion of land transferred and
    registered. If the Association approves, the applicant causes her/his/its land to be
    demarcated, transferred and registered by the Recorder.

   Where the Association holds the land under freehold, the individual or family applies to
    the Association to transfer the portion of land to her/his/it. If the Association approves



                                                                                           59
   the application, the applicant causes the piece of land to be surveyed and transferred to
   the applicant and registered by the Registrar of Titles.


Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Association may appeal to the District Land
Tribunal. The District Land Tribunal may:
    Confirm, vary, reverse or modify the decision of the Association
    Make any other orders it is empowered to make under the Land Act, 1998.
The holder of a certificate of customary ownership may convert his/her holding to freehold
(Section 9).


Whereas the law is very clear and the fees are prescribed, the failings are in the practice of
protecting these rights. To date very few certificates of customary ownership have been
issued it at all. There are still ongoing debates within government as to what form the
certification process should take, whether an independent register should be instituted,
what form the land record will take. All these are fundamental questions that must be
resolved quickly if rights protection on customary land is to become a reality.

Secondly, a practical challenge underlies the move toward individualization. Given the
complexity in the customary tenure regime, in which no single rights holder can claim that
the full bundle of rights vests in him or her. The question that remains unanswered to date
in Uganda is whether individualization under customary tenure should be promoted or
models for group rights and collective rights recognition should be promoted. This includes
land held by the family unit. These dilemmas have stalled the process of enforcement and
protection of customary rights through recordation and certification.

Furthermore, survey fees are a deterrent to those who would wish to have their land
certified or registered. The survey function in Uganda is privatised and although the cost of
registration is low and affordable, the cost of the survey is often far from the reach of the
rural poor. It can go up to ten times the cost of land registration. This is a disincentive to
those who would have sporadically registered their land.

All the above is compounded by a non-functional decentralized system of land
administration. Service delivery is very poor and hardly does a single land office have all
the requisite staff required to support rights protection and enforcement. This led to the
Ministry creating the zonal offices in a bid to cure this prevailing mischief of lack of
capacity and staff in the land offices at district level.

LGI-2(ii) Individual Land in Rural Areas is Registered & Mapped
There is a clear procedure in law for the mapping and registration of customary land, as
well as the statutory procedures for the registration of freehold, leasehold and Mailo land.
                                                                                           60
Below is the procedure for registering customary land which forms about 80% of land in
Uganda.
   The applicant submits an application (form 1) to the land committee with the required fees.
   the land committee puts a notice in a known place in the parish e.g. in a market , on a
    prominent tree, on the church notice board and on the land being applied for
   the land committee confirms and marks the boundaries of the land applied for
   the land committee makes a decision following the customs of the area on any question
    or matter concerning the land applied for and listens to claims and interests of other
    people on the land or occupying the neighboring land
   the committee makes a report and submits it to the district land board, gives a copy to
    the applicant and a copy for any person who submitted a claim on the land
   The land committee produces three (3) copies of the sketch of the land applied for. The
    original copy is sent to the district land board, a copy given to the applicant and the land
    committee retains the third copy.
   The district land board considers the application and in doing so must refer to the
    committees report and recommendations. The board may confirm or reject the report
    of the committee.
   If the board approves the application, it makes copies of the sketch, sends to the
    recorder and requests him/ her to issue a certificate of customary ownership. The
    board must inform the recorder in writing about its decision
   The recorder makes and hands over the certificate of customary ownership to the
    owner.
   Remember that the land for which a certificate of customary ownership is issued bears
    a unique parcel identification number (PIN) given by the recorder.

Through the systematic demarcation pilots, a process by which land rights of people living
in a given area are identified, ascertained, established, and marked in an orderly and
uniform way, two parishes had their rights in land mapped and ascertained in Rukarango-
Ntugamo District, Iganga.

In cognizance of the fact that most land in Uganda is under customary tenure therefore it is
not registered. There have been attempts to issue certificates of customary ownerships but
this has been stalled by the lack of an established system to assign parcel identification
numbers which is a responsibility of the department of mapping and surveys. In the
central and south-west where most of the land is mapped and under cadastre, the rate of
application to acquire freehold titles has been reported to be on the increase.
Through the systematic demarcation process, the main activities carried out during
systematic demarcation involve the following:

Planning stage

                                                                                                  61
The first step was to figure out how to implement the objective and constituting a
Systematic Demarcation Technical Committee to do this. This committee is comprised of
experienced individuals from different sectors and academic institutions. The Team has a
total of about 18 members including the technical personnel from the ministry itself.

Baseline Studies
Baseline studies are conducted under the supervision of the Systematic Demarcation
Technical Committee, which is a multidisciplinary and multi sectoral committee, for
gauging community expectations.

Mobilisation,
Confidence and consensus building are the major elements for the success of the systematic
demarcation program.

Training and village to village sensitisation
A training manual was developed to ensure training of the members of the systematic
demarcation Team. The process generates substantial amount of information about land
parcels, both within and outside the community

Participatory adjudication and demarcation
SD is all inclusive – adjudication and demarcation under SD covers all parcels in a given
area, including parcels for the poor. SD calls for wider participation/involvement. SD is
highly participatory at all levels - community and central level. The nature of participation
implies wider publicity, more transparency and prompt public dispute resolution

By adjudicating and marking boundaries for all parcels of land at the same time, without
discrimination, Government is trying to be efficient and pro-poor. Targeting the poor is
directly and/or indirectly reiterated in all the pillars of PEAP;

Land Surveying and mapping.
Efficiency – By handling several parcels at the same time, SD has economies of scale

Public display of resultant survey resultants and drawing.
In the display exercise the , the community is expected to improve the process by
identifying and proving correct information on the omissions, duplications or inconsistent
spelling of names of land owners/neighbours.

Certification/registration.
This process finally results in formal registration of the land rights in the names of the
applicant. The applicant is issued with either a certificate of customary ownership or
occupancy, or a land title whichever is applicable.

Generation of cadastral database.

                                                                                          62
Most (over 80%) of the current land records are manual and paper based. Most such
records are in a sorry state due to the wear and tear arising from the day to day use. The
Systematic adjudication, demarcation, survey and certification/ registration of land rights
pilot has opened an avenue to move away from the purely analogue data format to digital
records. It is hoped that the database will eventually directly feed into the National Land
Information System (NLIS).
Whereas this was government pilots, there is sporadic registration of land ongoing in rural
areas. The quantum of rights mapped and registered is not readily available from the land
office.

LGI-2(iii) Individual Land in Urban Areas is Registered & Mapped
Over 90% of the registered land in Uganda is in urban areas. Despite this, many parcels in
the urban areas especially outside the city and a few major towns is still customarily held.

Through its systematic demarcation program, the Ministry of lands piloted in two urban
areas, in Mbale district and Kibaale District. Results from Mbale revealed that a total of 960
parcels have so been surveyed and the application forms for issuance of freehold titles for
382 parcels have been filled. Luki village 363; Masalire 304, and Nasasa village 293 parcels
in Mbale district as of November 2008.

In Kibaale district, mobilization, training and sensitization have been done. 200 Area
adjudication members of Bwamswa Sub County have been trained. Detailed Systrematic
Demarcation in Kasingo parish Bwanswa Sub County was scheduled for early January 2009
(MLHUD 2008). Results of this exercise are not available.

UNHABITAT/GLTN applied the Social Tenure Domain Model in Mbale District. The specific
objective of the first phase of activities is to pilot test the Social Tenure Domain Model, and
the documentation of the process and capacity building requirements around its use and
application, in a selected municipality in Uganda for wider learning and application. The
first phase will be dove-tailed to the existing project initiative referred to as "Transforming
the Settlements of the Urban Poor in Uganda (TSUPU)" by the Government of Uganda as co-
financed by Cities Alliance and partly being implemented by Shack/Slum Dwellers
International (SDI).

The long-term objective is to address the land information requirements of women and
men living in slum communities and to build their capacity in the use and application of the
land information systems based on free and open source software packages and in
mainstreaming the thinking behind the continuum of land rights.

Through the support and intervention from the Ministry of Land, Housing and Urban
Development (MoLHUD) and Municipality of Mbale, the community-driven enumeration
                                                                                            63
and mapping exercise of the project is a success. Below were the key processes and steps
adopted by the project:

Planning and consultations
Earlier in the project implementation, SDI and GLTN conducted a series of consultation
meetings and workshops with government authorities (national and local), Actogether (an
Urban NGO), Slum Federation and community members. Such consultations yielded in the
understanding of the Social Tenure Domain Model, the finalisation of the enumeration
questionnaire, the development of an implementation plan, agreement on the roles and
responsibilities as well as the identification and mobilisation of the needed resources.

Community mobilisation process
The next step in implementing the project at settlement level is to mobilise the community
leaders and members through a vigorous sensitization and awareness building process.
Slum Federation leaders and members spearheaded this process in close collaboration
with the Municipal officials. Such process generated a wide support from the targeted
communities on the project and its implementation. Enumerators from community
members were identified and subsequently they were trained on mapping, data collection
and administration of questionnaires.

Customisation of STDM
 Following the agreement with the local stakeholders and community members on the
enumeration questionnaire and identification of the resources available such as satellite
imagery and a handheld GPS, GLTN Technical Team proceeded to make some adjustments
to customise the STDM system to fit the purpose. The customised version of STDM was well
received and appreciated by project stakeholders including by the slum federation
members and enumerators.

Mapping and structure numbering
Using STDM, Actogether assisted the Slum Federation and community members to digitise
structures from the satellite imagery and produce initial maps. Using the initial map,
assigned enumerators and Slum Federation members number all existing structures in the
slum settlements using a unique code. They made use of the handheld GPS to identify
available community facilities and utilities such as water points, public toilet, dumping
ground to update the map as the satellite imagery used in the process may no longer reflect
the actual realities on the ground. For example, new structures were built or some
structures as reflected by satellite imagery were not existent anymore.

Interviews and data collection
As scheduled and communicated with the community, enumeration teams mostly
accompanied by local leaders or elders and municipal officials, conducted house to house
                                                                                        64
interviews administering the questionnaire. In addition, they collected other information
such as supporting documents and photos, with the unique code painted or written in the
structure as a background.

Data entry and analysis
With the filled up questionnaires and gathered information including supporting
documents and photos, the enumeration teams entered all the data into the STDM system.
This process also included the updating of the initial digital maps. STDM, being a simple
and user-friendly system, is able to undertake quick analyses and reporting. The slum
federation leaders and enumerators were trained on how to use STDM to analyze the data
and produce reports.

Data validation and continuous updating
As part of quality assurance, the gathered information were printed and disseminated to
community members. Community members then have the opportunity to validate and
correct the information. This process enhanced the acceptability of the information and all
stakeholders appreciated the fact that the turnaround time between the enumeration
exercise and the production of results is relatively fast. After the validation period,
enumeration teams and slum federation leaders updated the information in the system.
Those community members who were not able to provide their comments and corrections
during the validation period may come to the Slum Federation office to update the data.
Some Slum Federation leaders and members were trained to manage the system and to
continue the updating process.

Most stakeholders including slum dwellers themselves appreciated the added value of
STDM in addressing the information requirements of the urban poor particularly for
improving tenure security and enhancing planning and access to basic services and
infrastructure. Some stakeholders including government officials appreciated STDM as a
potential     tool    for    much       larger    urban     development       objectives
(http://www.gltn.net/index.php/land-tools/social-tenure-domain-model-stdm).

Whereas 100% of land in Buganda is mapped and registered, the parent titles only record
the primary rights to land. Subsidiary rights, although constitution are neither recognized
nor mapped. This includes the rights of tenants on registered land, rights of spouses and
rights derived as a result of these secondary rights.

For the other urban areas, apart from the statutory leases that were mapped by 1986, no
new lands have been mapped. Most of the land in the urban areas is customary (mainly not
registered) or freeholds. The rate of urbanization is not matched by the rate of mapping



                                                                                        65
and registration. This explains the sprawling development of Uganda’s urban areas. To
date, there are over 100 town councils that are not mapped.

LGI-2(iv) The Number of Illegal Land Sales Is Low
There are no national official figures on illegal land sales in the country but local media
frequently report on this phenomenon. However the research done in the Albertine Rift
valley (Rugadya 2009) reveals that the discovery and exploration of oil prospects has led to
increased land conflicts as well as rampant fraudulent land sales in the region. To take
advantage of the processes of exploration, individuals have taken to alienation of
customary land creating large chunks of registered land in form of leaseholds, across the
districts in the region. The situation is further aggravated by attempts to degazette parts of
the National Park and where neighbouring communities that were supposed to benefit the
degazettement were unaware of their rights. The local council officials took advantage of
the situation to fraudulently sale the land to new migrants. It was observed that the
incident took with it all communal lands and resources which have been privatized to the
exclusion of communities who ought to be the rightful holders of such land.
In the other parts of the country Local Council officials have been reported to participate in
fraudulent land sales particularly in peri-urban area.

Whereas illegal land sales may seem to be high, this is mostly true for Kampala and the
Buganda subregion. If a national average is taken, the percentage drops drastically.
Fraudulent land transactions are dependent on tenure type, location of the land and land
values. When the land is in a prime location on Mailo land will be more prone to fraudulent
dealings than leaseholds or freeholds. There are hardly fraudulent dealings on customary
land because the land is often located where the owners live and everybody knows
everybody else, ensuring social protection in the event of fraud. The Land Information
System affirms that most of the fraudulent dealings are in the urban areas and mainly in
Buganda.

LGI-2(v) The Number of Illegal Lease Transactions is Low
Similar to rates of illegal land sales in general, there are no authentic figures regarding
illegal lease transactions. According to the Baseline Evaluation Report (MLHUD 2007)
quoted by Rugadya, the Land Registry’s with the sector ministry also contribute to
fraudulent land transactions through back-door practices which lead to loss of land by
rightful owners which in turn undermines public confidence in the national land
registration system. Consequently, tenure security is compromised also making land
transactions uncertain and the subsequent tragic consequences for many families that
suffer from such practices. The counterfeit land titles circulating in the market further
create additional uncertainty in the market. The existing registration system and
procedures are too disorganized and ineffective to prevent such cases. It is further

                                                                                           66
observed the degraded registry environment, damaged and outdated land records leaves
limited chance for the genuine owners and clients to protect themselves or get reliable
information about the property.

Despite the above, the leasehold documents are too bulky and in small print that the
leaseholder often does not read and internalize he document. Most of the fraudulent
dealings arise due to the ignorance of the term and conditions of the lease. For example,
many rights holders under leasehold will realize that their lease periods have expired when
a speculator applies for the same piece of land upon reversion.

LGI-2(vi) Women's Property Rights are registered
Although the constitution accords equal property rights between women and men, to all
citizens of Uganda, women’s land rights not yet recorded on the existing titles; moreover
the majority of the customary land is yet to be registered. The official statistics of women’s
ownership of land has remained at 7% due to lack of new nationally updated statistics.
There have however been studies undertaken by institutions that infer that this status has
ling changed. In 2003 a study conducted by Dr. Sebina Zziwa of Makerere Institute for
Social Research (MISR 2004), women land ownership under registered tenures was found
to be 16% of registered land. After computerization the figure is estimated to be close to
25% of registered land in Uganda. Because of its being out of customary binds for over 50
years, the Mailo tenure has enabled women to own registered land and it has the highest
proportion of women landownership. Registered land forms only 20% of land in Uganda.

Experiences from the land offices reveal that there is bias when the issue of women’s land
rights arises. There are no clear indicators and methods to capture gender sensitive data so
different statistics emerge each time. Secondly, there are lots of hidden properties tat
rightly belong to women but are registered in either male names or companies. It is
therefore not possible to ascertain the extent of land registered by women. A methodology
has to be developed for the accurate capture of this data. This situation is made worse by
the failure of the LIS i[to capture gender disaggregated data on land parcels.

LGI -2(vii) Women's land rights equal to those of men in law & in practice
Article 32 recognizes the significant role women play in society and oblige a duty on the
state to take affirmative action in favour of marginalized groups on the basis of gender for
purposes of redressing imbalances, which exist against them. Ugandan law provides for
equal rights for women and men but women often are denied their rights in practice. Rural
women’s land rights are still largely at the mercy of customary practices and traditional
legal systems which consider men as sole owners of land. Section 39 of the Land Act as
amended, provides for ‘security of occupancy’ for either spouse; that is, right to access and
live on that land. This effectively means one person is the owner while the other is only

                                                                                           67
entitled to security of occupancy. In practice, customary practices systematically
discriminate women from owning land in most parts of the country. The express to accord
equal land rights- the Domestic Relations Law has been put aside twice following tabling in
parliament.
In October 2010, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE), a Geneva-based
international housing rights watchdog, released a “report card” that examined Uganda’s
land reform processes and their impact on women. The report observed that while there
have been many advances in land reform in Uganda that grant women legal rights, custom
and practice are still lagging behind the law, leading to a regular violation of women’s land
rights. The land laws offer a lot of protection to women on paper – but many women –
particularly those in rural areas, have not benefited from these policies in reality the report
concluded.
Thus there is a huge disparity between the legal pronouncements on equality and the
translation of those constitutional principles in law and practice. Equality in practice is a
far cry in Uganda.


PANEL 2: RURAL LAND OWNERSHIP AND USE RIGHTS
The rural land ownership and use rights theme considers the extent to which the existing
legal framework takes cognizance of group rights including rights of forest dependent
communities. It investigates the extent to which collectivity in rights holding is legally
recognized and enforced and if the legal provisions are translated into practice through
land use planning and management. Although this dimension included forestry, the experts
separated this and created a 10th theme that separately delved into the forestry resource.
The theme has two indicators with a total of 14 dimensions. The first eight dimensions
focus on the recognition, protection and enforcement of group rights through recordation,
mapping and demarcation. The following six dimensions focus on rural land use planning
and management in light of land rights integrity.

LGI 3(i) Common lands are clearly identified legally and responsibility for their use
is clearly assigned

Common land is that land which the community agrees to set aside for common use by
members of that community. It comprises grazing areas, wood lots, hunting grounds,
swamps etc.

The Land Act 1998 (23) provides for establishment of areas of common land use in a
communally-owned land. It states that an association may, and shall, when so requested to
do so by the community on whose behalf it holds land, set aside one or more areas of land
for common use by members of the group. The boundaries of any area of land which has
been set aside for common use shall be marked out in such a manner, including any such
manner as is customary among the persons who will use that land, so as to enable those
persons to recognise and keep to those boundaries.

With regards to utilization, the Land Act 1998 stipulates that an area of land set aside for
common use shall be used and managed in accordance with the terms of a common land
management scheme. A common land management scheme shall be made by an
association, but it shall only come into effect when it is agreed to by the community on
whose behalf the association holds land. This scheme may extend to cover the use and
management of more than one area of common land. It further clarifies that a person who
is not a member of the community may, with the agreement of the association, which
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, use common land in accordance with the
terms of the common land management scheme applicable to that land. Section 26 clearly
sets out the basic rights and duties of the members of the community using the common
land.

According to the National Land Policy 2013, the 1995 Constitution and Land Act (Cap 227)
do not take into account the role of local communities in the preservation and management
of common property resources. As a result most of these resources especially grazing lands
have been in the past grabbed, sold illegally or individualized by some members of the local
communities. The policy therefore recommends Government to reform laws and
regulations for the management of common property resources to conform with the
standards for sustainable use and development.

Panel discussions revealed that while the law provides for the establishment of areas of
common land use and its management in accordance with the terms of a common land


                                                                                         70
management regime, almost all common lands are not clearly identified. Nonetheless, for
most areas, the responsibility for land use is customarily assigned and practices, but with
conflicts ensuing over their use and management. If such areas were established and
mapped as required by the law, the responsibility for use would clearly be stipulated.
There is a possibility that the communities currently are not aware of the provisions in the
law and in the cases where efforts to map and register common lands have been registered,
NGOs have been responsible for the move. Government has not currently taken any action
for the protection of common lands.

LGI-3(ii) Rural group rights are formally recognized & can be enforced.
Rural group rights can then be derived as those identifiable groups in a rural setting, which
people can be easily classified as members or non-members for the purpose of benefitting
from specific rights to an area.

Article 26(1) of the constitution provides that every person has a right to own property
alone or in association with others. This constitutional declaration in the fundamental
rights chapter gives the basis for the provisions in the land Act on group rights.

The Uganda land law defines communal land as the land held by a specific community or
group of people recognizing individual rights in that land and regulating its use and
management. Communal land may be held on a certificate of customary ownership,
freehold or leasehold title by the managing committee on behalf of members of the
communal association. Communal land is managed under customary law and any other law
such as statutory law. For example, the provisions of the National Environment statue must
be followed to ensure conservation of the environment, wetlands and grasslands.

Common land on the other hand is that land which the community agrees to set aside for
common use by members of that community. It comprises grazing areas, wood lots,
hunting grounds, swamps etc.

For purposes of this indicator, focus will be given to communal land.

The Land Act Cap 227 provides for the establishment of Communal Land Associations
(CLA) by any group of persons who wish. The purpose for such a CLA would be connected
with communal ownership and management of land, whether under customary law or
otherwise. There is in the land Act (Sections 16-18) an elaborate procedure of
“incorporation” of the CLAs, determination of the group leadership, and reaching a
constitution to govern members. There are provisions in the Act for a managing committee
of the CLA, the resolution of disputes, dissolution and decertification of an association,
common land, and management schemes, the rights and duties of members of the CLA, and
provision for an individual to opt out of an association (Sections19-26).


                                                                                          71
The National Land Use Policy 2003, however noted that the rights to resource utilization
are at times not properly defined and this has led to misinterpretation by the users. Such
an anomaly needs to be rectified to avoid resource degradation.

Wetland Resources: The National Wetlands Policy (1995:7.6i) stipulates that although all
wetlands are a public resource to be controlled by the Government on behalf of the public,
communal use will be permitted, but only if environmental conservation and sustainable
use principles and strategies of this policy are adhered to. This communal use may be
terminated by the Government if it is found that the community or any other person has
not adhered to the environmental obligations, principles and strategies of this policy.

LGI-3(iii) Use rights to key natural resources on land (incl. Fisheries) are legally
recognized and protected in practice.
Section 43 of the Land Act Cap 227 clearly stipulates that a person who owns or occupies
land shall manage and utilize the land in accordance with the Forests Act, the Mining Act,
and the National Environment Act, the Water Act, the Uganda Wildlife Act and any other
law.

For Example:
Wetland Resources: The National Wetlands Policy (1995(7.6i) stipulates that although all
wetlands are a public resource to be controlled by the Government on behalf of the public,
communal use will be permitted, but only if environmental conservation and sustainable
use principles and strategies of this policy are adhered to. This communal use may be
terminated by the Government if it is found that the community or any other person has
not adhered to the environmental obligations, principles and strategies of this policy.

Section 37 (1) of the National Environment Act Cap 153 states that the authority shall, in
consultation with the lead agency, establish guidelines for the identification and
sustainable management of all wetlands in Uganda. Section 37(3) of the National
Environment Act 1995 states that the authority may, in consultation with the lead agency
and the district environment committee, declare any wetland to be a protected wetland,
thereby excluding or limiting human activities in that wetland. These provisions in the Act
suggest that the right to use wetlands is determined by the National Environment
Management Authority.

Fisheries: The substantive law that provides for the regulation of the Uganda Fisheries is
the Fish Act (Cap 197). The Act restricts fishing to a person with a valid specific licence
issued for that purpose. Subject to this Act (Section13), the chief fisheries officer, or an
authorised licensing officer may, in his or her discretion, on application being made in the
prescribed manner and on payment of the prescribed fee, issue to an applicant a licence in
such manner and subject to such conditions as he or she may deem fit to impose. However

                                                                                         72
the Act is now considered to be inadequate to cope with the domestic and international
changes in fisheries administration and the latest policy thinking. The National Fisheries
Policy 2004, under Policy Area No. 2 calls for stakeholders’ involvement in the
management of fisheries by devolving some decision-making responsibilities to local
governments and communities.

Section 6(2) of the Fish Act Cap 197 states that no person who is not a citizen of Uganda
shall fish in any waters of Uganda for the purpose of obtaining fish for sale unless he or she
holds a valid specific licence issued for that purpose. This suggests that as long as one is a
Ugandan he/she is allowed to fish. However section 5 requires getting a licence for the
vessel used while fishing.

Section 10(1) of the Fish Act Cap 197 states No person shall fish in any dam unless he or she
is in possession of a valid permit issued for that purpose by the fisheries officer in charge of
the area concerned in respect of all or any particular species of fish.

Wildlife Resources: Section 31 of the Uganda Wildlife Act Cap 200 states that; A person,
community or lead agency may apply to the authority for one or more wildlife use rights to
be granted to them.

Forestry Resources: The Forestry and Tree Planting Act, 2003 provides for the use of
different forest categories.

For the forest reserves, a responsible body is expected to manage, maintain and control the
forest reserve in accordance with generally accepted principles of forest management as
may be prescribed in guidelines issued by the Minister. In this respect, use rights for both
extractive and non-extractive purpose may be granted as long as they are in accordance
with the forest management plan. For the forest reserves, a responsible body may subject
to the management plan grant a licence to an interested person for the cutting, taking,
working or removing of forest produce from a forest reserve or community forest, or the
sustainable utilization and management of the forest reserve or community forest. Further,
Section 33(1), of the National Forestry and tree planting Act, 2003 states that subject to the
management plan, a member of a local community may, in a forest reserve or community
forest, cut and take free of any fee or charge, for personal domestic use in reasonable
quantities any dry wood or bamboo. Under Section 33(2) no materials however may be
collected in the strict nature reserves or from sites of special scientific interest.

For the case of group use rights, the Forestry and Tree planting Act 2003, provides for
collaborative forest management where a responsible body such as NFA or the local
government may enter into a collaborative arrangement with a forest user group for the

                                                                                             73
purpose of managing a Central or local forest reserve or part of it in accordance with
regulations or guidelines issued by the Minister. In this case, communities bordering forest
resources exercise specified access and use rights and take on specific roles and
responsibilities to ensure sustainable utilization of the forest resource. There are several
examples including CFM groups in Mabira CFR and Budongo CFR.

With regards to community forests, Section 19(1) stipulates that any revenue derived from
the management of a community forest by a responsible body shall belong to and form part
of the accountable funds of the responsible body and shall be devoted to the sustainable
management of the community forest and the welfare of the local community.

With regards to private forests, Section 21(1) and 22(1) stipulates that a person may
register with the district land board a natural forest or plantation situated on land owned
in accordance with the Land Act Cap 227, or a forest or land in respect of which a licence is
granted in accordance with this act. Further, Sec 21(2) and 22(2) indicates that all forest
produce from such a forest belongs to the owner and may be used in any manner that the
owner may determine, except that forest produce shall be harvested in accordance with the
management plan and regulations made under this act.

The National Land Policy, 2013 recognizes that the rights to resource utilization are at
times not properly defined and this has led to misinterpretation by the users. Such an
anomaly needs to be rectified to avoid resource degradation. It therefore defines Policy
statement 14 aiming to define resource use rights and responsibilities with key strategies
including
a) Re-define up-date and harmonize the different natural resource policies and legislation
    as they relate to use-rights and responsibilities.
b) Encourage community participation in the formulation of policies and legislation to
    avoid future conflicts.
c) Sensitize the populace on their resource-use rights, responsibilities, and the need for
    sustainable resource utilization.
d) Develop and implement appropriate use rights mechanisms to resolve use right
    conflicts between communities and protected area authorities.

Panel discussions revealed that although the legal and policy framework is in place and
actually very progressive, implementation and practice change remains a challenge. There
are no regulations and procedures laid out for the implementation of the legal provisions.
This makes it impossible to translate these legal provisions into practice as there are no
mechanisms in place to get this done. A lot of work needs to be done to ensure that the
requisite changes can be realised in practice. This is compounded by lack of technical
capacity in the Government staff to implement these provisions. There is need to build

                                                                                          74
collaborative arrangements with civil society to ensure that the implementation of certain
provisions become a reality.


LGI-3(iv) Multiple rights over common land & natural resources can legally coexist
and be registered.
Subject to article 237 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995, all land in
Uganda shall vest in the citizens of Uganda and shall be owned in accordance with the four
land tenure systems, that is, customary, freehold, Mailo and leasehold. The Land Act Cap
227 (43) clearly stipulates that a person who owns or occupies land shall manage and
utilize the land in accordance with the Forests Act, the Mining Act, and the National
Environment Act, the Water Act, the Uganda Wildlife Act and any other law.

The co-existence or non co-existence of multiple rights over common land and natural
resources is specific for the different resources. The Forestry and Tree Planting Act 2003,
recognizes communal rights to forests. Therefore, registration for such a resource
recognizes rights over the land and the resource. However, two independent bodies, the
District land board and the Ministry of Water and Environment are responsible for
registering the land rights and forestry rights respectively.

The panel discussions raised concern about the respect for these rights in practice. An
example of the pastoralist rights of the Karimojong was raised and although recognized in
law, because of the mineral wealth in this area, most of the land (estimated at 90%) has
been issued concessions and mining licences without recourse to the land rights of the
pastoralists. This undermines the legal principles that seek to protect the rights of the land
holders despite the multiple uses and rights that may accrue on the same piece of land. The
same situation is now witnessed in the Albertine region particularly the Kayiso Tonya oil
well where the wells exist on customary land but the rights of the owners of such land have
been downplayed in favour of the exploration activities.

The panel discussions raised concern over the greyness of the law with regard to discovery
of a resource of national importance on communal lands. There are no clear mechanisms in
place on responding to such challenges leading to these lands being compulsorily acquired
by the state, a move that is not constitutional. There are no clear procedures and
mechanisms in place for restitution or compensation in the face of group rights that are
unregistered, a situation that is predominant in Uganda.

legally coexist and be registered



                                                                                           75
During the reign of the 27th Kabaka of Buganda a system was established under which the
Kabaka appointed “abatongole” or agents to administer land affairs, among other things, on
his behalf.

This system resulted in four types of customary land tenure in Buganda namely land vested
in the Kabaka (ettaka ly’obwakabaka), land vested in clans (ettaka ly’obutaka), interests
granted by the batongole to individuals (ettaka ly’obwesenze) and interests granted by
individuals to individuals (ettaka ly’obusenze.) In 1900 all these interests were turned into
mailo land. In fact the allocations under the 1900 agreement were actually confirmations of
these estates.

Once custom is codified, it stops growing and evolving. This is exactly what happened in
1900 because the customary methods of acquiring interests in land were done away with
without putting in place a new system to cater for people who had not acquired interests in
land at the time. This meant that such people lived on land at the caprice of the new
registered owners who exploited them. As a result of an outcry by such people a law to
govern the relationship between the new registered owners of land and their lawful or
bona fide occupants was enacted under the name of Busuulu and Envujo Law, 1928.

This law achieved two important aims. First, it secured the occupancy of the holder of a
kibanja a new type of holding which did not exceed one acre for use for residential and
other domestic purposes. Secondly, it provided for economic development of the land by
enabling the holder to cultivate cash crops up to three acres without the permission of the
owner and up to five acres with his permission. Both the lawful owner and bona fide
occupants who were defined to be his wife and lawful customary successor enjoyed rights
of the lawful owner of the kibanja by extension. The rights of the registered owner, on the
other hand, were recognized in three ways. First by payment to him of a standard rent of
Shs.10/= in respect of the one acre. Secondly by getting a tithe from crop revenues and
thirdly the holder was under an obligation to be of good conduct towards land owner.
There was also a system of how one came to be on the land and size of the holding was
consensual.

This system worked well. In a study published in 1953 A.B. Mukwaya showed that in over
400 land cases he examined there was no case of illegal evictions. All the cases involved
petty differences over boundaries or issues of succession and the like. After 1975 all hell
broke loose after Mailo land and the Obusuulu and Envujo Law were abolished. Land
became free for all and there was no respect for landlords anymore. When Mailo land was
reintroduced evictions of illegal tenants started in a small way by the time the constitution
was made but has become a menace of late as a result of the craze in estate development
and large scale farming (Mulira P 2010).

The constitution came in to fill the gap which was created in 1975.
                                                                                          76
The Constitution
In order to deal with this problem article 237 (9) of the constitution directed parliament to
pass a law regulating the relationship between the registered owners and the lawful or
bona fide occupants of land. The article reads as follows:

(9) Within two years after the first sitting of Parliament elected under this constitution,
Parliament shall enact a law—

      regulating the relationship between the lawful or bona fide occupants of land referred
       to in clause (8) of this article and the registered owners of the land;

      providing for the acquisition of registrable interest in the land by the occupant.

The instructions given by the constitution are quite clear and straight forward. The
constitution did not tell parliament to enact a Land Act in the fashion of the Land Act, 1908.
It limited its intent to the relationship of registered owners and lawful or bona fide
occupants of land. In this regard a correct interpretation would be that the intention of the
constitution was to put in place a national law on the lines of the Busuulu and Envujo Law
or the Toro Landlord and Tenant Law, 1937, and the Ankole Landlord and Tenant Law,
1937.

The terms “registered owner” and “lawful occupant of land” as used in the constitutional
provision should not cause any problem. A registered owner is one registered under the
provisions of the Registration of Titles Act whereas a bona fide occupant must be one who
came on the land with the permission of the registered owner. A bona fide occupant must
be one who lawfully claims an interest in the land through a lawful occupant. In this regard
section 8 of the Busuulu and Envujo Law, 1928, is instructive. It reads:

     “ (8) (1) Nothing in this law shall give any person the right to reside upon the land of a
Mailo owner without first obtaining the consent of the Mailo owner except—

          (a) the wife or child of the holder of a kibanja; or
          (b) a person who succeeds to a kibanja in accordance with native custom upon
              the death of the holder thereof
          (2) Nothing in this law shall give to the holder of a kibanja the right to transfer
          or sublet his kibanja to any other person.”

It is clear that this provision excludes a trespasser or a person who bought a kibanja from a
lawful occupier without the consent of the owner from the definition of a bona fide
occupier. In this sense a bona fide occupant should receive the same treatment as the
lawful occupant since his claim is also lawful.



                                                                                            77
The term bona fide occupier should mean a different thing altogether in areas where Mailo
land or individualization of land does not exist as yet. Here acquisition of land is based on
the customary rules of particular communities. These rules are location-specific. For
example how you come to individually own land in Bugisu is not the same way you will
own it in Teso. In this case we must first identify the particular customary system and the
rules under it before we can identify who is a bona fide occupant of land (Mulia P. 2010).

The constitution also required parliament to provide the lawful or bona fide occupant of
land with registerable interests. The constitutions recognize four tenures of land namely
freehold, Mailo, leasehold and customary. The first three tenures are registerable interests
and although customary tenure has been recognized it has not become a registerable
interest yet. Both lawful and bona fide interests are customary and the challenge posed by
the constitution, in our view, was how customary land interests could become registerable.
It is our view that the Land Act, 1998 misinterpreted these constitutional provisions.

 The Land Act, 1998
The constitution directed parliament to make a law regulating the relationship between
lawful or bona fide occupants of land and registered proprietors. However parliament did
something different altogether. The preamble to the Act reads: “An Act to provide for the
tenure, ownership and management of land; to amend and consolidate the law relating to
tenure, ownership and management of land, and to provide for other related or incidental
matters.” The constitution provided for the different tenures of land and one wonders
what other tenure the Act is trying to provide for since ownership of land is governed by
the Registration of Titles Act. The preamble is a far cry from the intentions of the
constitution (Mulira. P 2010).

Some general comments on the Land Act will suffice.

   (a) The Act creates a tenancy by occupancy section 32. This is wrong because what was
       directed by the constitution was the creation of registerable interests not tenancies.
       Under the law a tenancy is not an interest in land but is akin to user rights of less
       than three years


   (b) Under the Torrens system of land registration we use in Uganda the title deed is
supreme and cannot be cancelled except for fraud. The Act introduces the principle of
acquisition of land by prescription a principle which applies in Britain where ownership is
evidenced by possession not in countries which follow the Australian Torrens system
based on registration and certificate of title.

   (c)) Section 30 (b) defines a bona fide occupant as a person who occupied or developed
   any land unchallenged by the registered owner or his agent. Since there was no law

                                                                                          78
       which required a registered owner to challenge a trespasser the provision amounts to
       retrospective legislation which is not permitted by the constitution. Secondly providing
       for acquisition of title where the owner did not make a challenge for twelve years prior
       to the coming into force of the constitution is also wrong for the following reasons:

                (i) An interest in land cannot be taken away without compensation.

             (ii) Since the owner’s title deed cannot be legally cancelled the provision has the
       effect of creating two competing interests in the some land.

              (iii) The provision confers rights on a trespasser which other laws deny him.

              (v) There is no determination of the size of the holding.

Tenants by Occupancy are tenants on registered land which may be under freehold, mailo
or leasehold title. Their tenancy is recognized because of their presence on land or because
of the fact that they occupy and utilize land in spite of the existence of a registered
landowner. The Land Act 1998 recognizes two types of tenants by occupancy:

Lawful Occupants
These are defined as tenants occupying land in any of the three ways described below6:

       a) Persons who occupy land as a result of having paid rent under the Busuulu and
          Envujjo law of 1928, Toro Landlord–Tenant Law of 1937 and the Ankole Landlord-
          Tenant Law of 1937. Such persons are mostly found on either mailo land or native
          freehold.
       b) Persons who occupy land with approval of the landowner in possession of mailo,
          freehold or leasehold land. It is implied / assumed that the owner granted
          permission to occupy his/her land basing on some form of agreement, contract or
          understanding. This includes buyers or purchasers of such land occupied.
       c) Persons who were customary tenants on former public land, whose existence
          (tenancy) on land was not made known or was not paid for (compensated) by the
          landowner at the time of acquiring a leasehold title.


Bonafide Occupants
These are defined as tenants occupying land in any of the two ways described below7:




6
    Section 30(1) Land Act
7
    Section 30(2) Land Act

                                                                                              79
   a) Persons who occupied and utilized or developed land that has a freehold, mailo or
      leasehold title, unchallenged (concealed or openly) by the landowner (titleholder)
      or his/her agent (representative) for 12 consecutive or more years.

   b) Persons settled by government or agent of government (representative of
      government) or a local authority on land that is already titled either as mailo,
      freehold or leasehold. This includes persons in resettlement schemes, who will be
      facilitated to register their rights of Occupancy in such land. Government was
      supposed to have compensated the owners of such land by the year 2003.

Any person who buys land from a Lawful or Bonafide Occupant takes on the same status .
However, Persons who occupy registered land (mailo, freehold or leasehold) and are not
landowners, and do not fall in the categories defined above i.e. are not Bonafide or Lawful
Occupants. They must seek and identify the owners of the land they occupy and negotiate
with them. The terms or conditions set for occupying land (tenancy) for those who do not
qualify as Bonafide or Lawful Occupants are not spelt out in the Land Act. Such terms and
conditions are subject to agreement between themselves and the landowners (Obaikol
2007).

Land Occupancy and Land Reforms
Lawful and Bonafide Occupants shall enjoy security of tenure. This legal guarantee of
continued occupancy rights for the tenants by the Land Act is aimed at enhancing
productivity and sustainable livelihoods, and to reduce recurring instances of massive
evictions in the country. Tenants may acquire certificates of occupancy on the land they
occupy if they so wish. This is evidence of their ascertained rights. However, not having
one does not mean, one loses the right to the tenancy. This certificate of occupancy can be
mortgaged, pledged, transferred or passed on by will with the permission of the landowner.
In granting permission, the landowner may impose conditions, which must not discourage
the transaction from taking place.

Tenancies may be terminated by mutual agreement or by failure to pay ground rent for two
(2) consecutive years which results into notice of one year to the tenant to show sufficient
reason for not paying. If after one year of notice, the tenant is still unable to pay, the Land
Tribunal will terminate the tenancy.

Tenancies by occupancy, although viewed by some as detrimental to development because
both the land owner and the tenant do not put the land to optimal productive use, this
opinion is countered by that of ensuring security of tenure to the citizens of Uganda; which
in turn is a production incentive (Obaikol 2007).

Panel discussions raised the challenges that exist between government departments. For
example, the Uganda Wildlife Authority has overlapping claims with the National Forestry
                                                                                            80
Authority over forests found in wildlife areas. Whereas Uganda Wildlife Authority lays
claim over these forests, the National Forestry Authority lays claim over the carbon. This
overlapping claim has created confusion and conflicts between the two departments.




LGI-3(vi) Multiple rights over land & and mining/sub-soil resources on the same plot
can legally coexist and be registered
Interpretation: Having registered rights for both the land and the mining resources found
in/under that land

Subject to Article 237 of the Constitution, all land in Uganda shall vest in the citizens of
Uganda and shall be owned in accordance with the four land tenure systems, that is,
customary, freehold, Mailo and leasehold.

Article 244(1 ) of the constitution of the republic of Uganda states “ subject to article 26 of
this constitution, the entire property and the control of, all minerals and petroleum in, on
or under, any land or waters in Uganda are vested in the Government on behalf of the
republic of Uganda. . Clause (5) specifies that mineral does not include clay, murram, sand
or any stone commonly used for building or similar purposes. This therefore implies that
sub-soil resources are the property of the nation, not the individual owner of the surface
rights

Further Section 3 of the National Mining Act 2003 stipulates that the entire property in and
control of all minerals in, on or under, any land or waters in Uganda are and shall be vested
in the Government, notwithstanding any right of ownership of or by any person in relation
to any land in, on or under which any such minerals are found. Nonetheless, section 4(1)
stipulates that subject to the provisions of this Act, a person may acquire the right to search
for, retain, mine and dispose of any mineral in Uganda by acquiring such right under and in
accordance with the provisions of this Act.

Panel discussions revealed that the benefit sharing close was excluded from oil and gas.
This means that the many that live or whose lands are found in the oil and gas areas will
not benefit from the exploration of oil and gas. This exclusion however does not have a
constitutional basis and there needs to be an interpretation as to why this has become the
case.

Secondly when concessions are given to miners, the lands are fenced off and the
communities living around the resources cannot access the common properties in the area.
There is need to include a disclaimer to the concession agreements that permit the
communities continue the derivation of benefits from the resources within the


                                                                                            81
concenssioned areas. The role of civil society in influencing practice change in this regard
should be encouraged as the hands of the technocrats are quite tied on this matter.



LGI-3(vii) Accessible opportunities exist to map & register group rights
Structures for mapping and registering group rights do exist at sub-county level, which is
the lower local governance structure in a district.

Area Land Committees
Area Land Committees (ALC) are established at sub-county or division level. Their role is
to adjudicate upon and demarcate land. During land adjudication an ALC may be required
to resolve land disputes over boundaries or conflicting claims over land. In hearing and
determining any claim, ALC is required to use its best endevours to mediate between and
reconcile parties having conflicting claims to land.

Recorders
The Recorder at the sub-county level is the sub-county Chief or assistant Town Clerk at the
division level. The role of the Recorder is to issue certificates of customary ownership and
certificates of occupancy and to register subsequent land transactions on the basis of the
said certificates.

The district Land Board facilitates the registration of rights with the support of the District
Land Office.

Land Act provides for the establishment of Communal Land Associations (CLA) by any
group of persons who wish (Section15). The purpose for such a CLA would be connected
with communal ownership and management of land, whether under customary law or
otherwise. The district registrar of titles is meant to keep a public register of associations,
and to exercise a broad and general supervision over the administration of the associations
within the district (Section 15 (3)). The formal procedures concerning the formation and
operations of the CLA as provided for in the Land Act are too elaborate, and require a
reasonable degree of literacy and “external” assistance in terms of provision of information
and guidance. As a result, the CLA provisons for the law have not been taken advantage of
(e.g. RCI, 2006), with only a few examples such as the initiative being undertaken by
ECOTRUST to secure legal CLA formation for two communal forests in Masindi district.

Some detailed procedures for mapping and registering group rights as provided for in the
Land Act 1998 (15) include
    Not less than 60 percent of the group determine so to incorporate themselves into
      an association


                                                                                            82
      Elect not more than nine nor less than three persons, of whom not less than one-
       third shall be women, to be the officers of the association
      The officers elected shall be responsible for preparing a constitution for the
       association.
      The district registrar of titles shall assist the officers in preparing a constitution for
       the association and may provide the officers with a model constitution containing
       such matters as may be prescribed.
      A constitution prepared by the officers shall be submitted to the district registrar of
       titles for his or her certification that it complies with such matters as may have been
       prescribed or where no matter has been prescribed, that it provides for a
       transparent and democratic process of management of the affairs of the association.
      A constitution which has been certified as complying with subsection (3) shall be
       put before and voted on by a meeting of the members of the association specifically
       convened for that purpose.
      A constitution shall be the approved constitution of the association when and only
       when it is approved by an absolute majority of all the members of that association at
       the meeting referred to in subsection (16)
      The officers of an association which has voted to approve a certified constitution
       shall apply to the district registrar of titles on the prescribed form to be
       incorporated under this Act.
      Upon the issue of a certificate of incorporation, the persons named in it as the
       officers shall become a body corporate with the name specified in the certificate and
       shall have perpetual succession and a common seal
      The group then proceeds to secure a legal ownership of a specified resource which
       calls for
            o Surveying and clear demarcation of boundaries
            o Submission of the survey report to process the land title
            o Gazettement by the Minister in charge
            o Public declaration of a resource as a designated communal resource

Section 15 of the forestry and tree planting act, 2003 allows communities to enter into CFM
Section 17 of the forestry and tree planting act, 2003 allow communities to register
community forests.
Section 31 of the wildlife act states that: a person, community or lead agency may apply to
the authority for one or more wildlife use rights to be granted to them.

Panel discussions highlighted that although government has not ventured into the
registration of group rights, NGOs have made an effort to establish these. The Uganda Land
Alliance and The Land and Equity Movement have both made attempts applying different

                                                                                              83
 approaches. To achieve this however, services of a surveyor are required to ensure that the
 mapped land is included in the cadastre. This makes the costs to go higher such that the
 communities cannot afford it if done outside of a project. It also requires a level of literacy
 within the communities to understand the procedures if the legal procedures are to be
 followed.

 The whole procedure for mapping and recording of group rights is clear but not affordable.
 The government has never managed to draw or even estimate the total cost of mapping
 and recording rights. The only costs that have been stipulated are the registration cost
 which is the lowest of all the transaction costs.


 LGI-3(viii) Boundaries of communal land are demarcated
 While communal lands are often informally known by the user group, formal/legal
 boundaries are lacking. This has overtime resulted into conflicts between members and
 non-members of particular user groups. Although provided for in law, there have been
 attempts by various agencies and institutions to clarify the methodology or boundary
 demarcation over common lands8. To date, there is no agreed to methodology and no
 parcels have conclusively been certified as such by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and
 Urban Development.

 According to the Physical Planning Act, “rural area” means any area not within a
 municipality or a town. Under section 5, the Act declares planning for areas of towns set
 out in the first schedule to the Act, and is regarded as planning areas. Further, If in respect
 of any rural area or any area partly within and partly without any municipality or town the
 board, upon representations made by or after consultation with every local authority
 concerned, is of the opinion that an outline scheme should be made in respect of that area
 and makes recommendations to that effect to the Minister submitting with its
 recommendations a plan of the area, the Minister may by statutory order declare the area
 to be a planning area .Although now repealed, the Physical Planning Act No.5 of 2010, the
 new law does not provide for planning for the rural areas.

 In respect of every area declared to be a planning area under section 5, there shall be a
 planning committee or planning committees. When the area declared a planning area is a
 municipality, the planning committee shall be the municipal council. When the area
 declared a planning area is a town, the planning committee shall be the town council.

 This implies that by law, there are no legal provisions for rural land use.

 However, the Land Use Policy, 2007 highlights the lack of inter-sectoral linkages in land use
 planning. Each sector has its own land use activities, which are not always integrated with
 those of other sectors. These alternative land uses have led to conflict and disharmony over
 land use allocation. There are inadequate consultations between sectors both in land use


                                                                                             85
allocation and formulation of laws. Lack of common guiding principles has led to each
sector or institution pursuing its own objectives when it comes to planning for land
utilization.

Hence, it stipulates Policy statement 28 “To promote integrated land use planning and
management with a view to achieving coordination among various sectoral land use
activities. The key strategies include:
        a) Develop, review and harmonize the different sectoral laws and policies relating
            to land use and management
        b) Develop a national land use plan for the country
        c) Develop district land use plans in conformity with the national land use plan

The Policy further reveals that some laws relating to land management and administration
are weak and outdated. In addition, land is subjected to different uses and thus its
management falls under different sectoral institutions that have limited human and
financial resources. Furthermore, decentralization introduced new institutions aimed at
improving service delivery at grassroots level, but these are beset with weak
implementation due to lack of adequate professional expertise, as well as poor
coordination between central and local Governments. Inadequate sectoral coordination has
also had negative impact on land use, just as weak inter-sectoral and district coordination
has resulted in contradictory land use patterns.

Hence, it stipulates Policy statement 32 “To revise and harmonize all existing laws and
policies related to land use planning and develop implementation capacity”. Some of the
key strategies include:

a) Complete the on-going revision of the Town and Country Planning Act (1964), and
   harmonize it with related Policies and legislation.
b) Review the following pieces of legislation (as amended) and harmonize them with the
   aim of enabling smooth implementation of the Land Act (1998): The Mortgage Decree
   (1975); The Registration of Titles Act (1964); The Land Acquisition Act (1965); and The
   Local Government Act (1997).
c) Strengthen links among sectors, between sectors and local governments, and among
   local governments in order to improve their coordination.
d) Provide financial support and train local government staff in order to attain efficient
   service delivery.
e) Strengthen the land use planning and management systems provided for in planning
   legislation.
These laws have since been amended accordingly.


                                                                                        86
Panel discussions revealed that the Physical planning Act does not provide for rural land
use planning. Recourse must therefore be had to other laws such as the National
Environment act, the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act, The Uganda Wildlife Act to
give direction on rural land use planning and management. Despite the existence of these
legal frameworks, most of them do not have regulations to ensure implementation. This
therefore creates practical challenges in regulating the use of rural lands. Wetlands are
particularly challenged as they are provided for under the National Environment Act but
have no substantial law regulating their use and thus the enormous abuse currently
realised.

The Ugandan situation is compounded by the lack of the National Land Use Plan, intended
to ensure the planning of the entire country. In the absence of this, it is impossible to
undertake any planning of rural lands. This is particularly crucial given that Uganda’s
investment climate is shifting away from the urban areas to the rural areas as agricultural
investments increase and so is the exploration of mineral wealth. Furthermore, Uganda is
experiencing a population explosion that necessitates planning if it is to harness its
resource capacity to feed the nation.

LGI-4(ii) Restrictions on rural land transferability effectively serve public policy
objectives
According to the Country and Town Planning Act, 1951(5), if in respect of any rural area or
any area partly within and partly without any municipality or town the board, upon
representations made by or after consultation with every local authority concerned, is of
the opinion that an outline scheme should be made in respect of that area and makes
recommendations to that effect to the Minister submitting with its recommendations a plan
of the area, the Minister may by statutory order declare the area to be a planning area.

Although since repealed by the Physical Planning Act, other laws such as the National
Environment Act Cap 153, the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act 2003 and the
Wildlife Act Cap200 provide restrictions on the transfer of rural lands for purposes of
environmental conservation and protection. This serves public policy objectives.

Panel discussions revealed that there are guidelines for land use change. These are
however not enforced due to lack of technical capacity to enforce them. However, when it
comes to conversion of resources on private lands to public purpose, guidelines do not
exist. For example, there are no guidelines for the conversion of wetlands on private land to
public resources. What is clear is the gazzetement and de-gazzetement procedures.

LGI-4(iii) Rural land use plans are elaborated/changed through clear public process
& resulting burdens are shared

                                                                                          87
There are no rural land use plans, but a part of the rural land may be changed to become
part of planning area (town or municipality). In this case, according to Country and Town
Planning Act (6(2)) any person aggrieved by a decision of any committee may appeal to the
board.

Under Section 7, when an order declaring a planning area has been published under section
5, the board may, if it comes to its notice that any building or development in the area has
been allowed, which appears to it to be contrary to the provisions of any scheme that is
being prepared, direct the local authority or any other person who has given a permit for
the erection of the building or for the development to cancel the permit. Any person who
has been granted a permit to erect any building or proceed with any development whose
permit is cancelled under subsection (1) shall be entitled to such compensation as the
board shall think fit to grant. An appeal shall lie from any award made by the board under
subsection (2) which shall be determined under section 21.

One the area has been declared as planning areas, section (10) provides that the board
shall in respect of any area declared a planning area under section 5, in consultation with
the committee or committees, prepare an outline scheme in respect of the area. Section
(11) further states that when an outline scheme has been prepared, a copy of it shall be
deposited in such place as the board shall decide.

Notice of that deposit shall be published by the board in the Gazette and at least one
newspaper circulating in Uganda. Any person may, within three months of the date of the
notice of that deposit, inspect and make representations to the board respecting the
scheme.

Despite declaring the whole country a planning area, the new law (Physical Planning Act)
does not provide for rural land use planning and there are no mechanisms in place to
ensure that this is done. As such in practice, there is no rural land use planning now.

LGI-4(iv) Rural lands the use of which is changed are swiftly transferred to the
assigned purpose
According to Section 5 of the repealed Town and Country Planning Act Cap 246, when an
area has been declared a planning area under this section, the value of any building or land
in that area shall, for the purposes of determining the amount of compensation payable
under this Act, be deemed to be the value of the building or land on the day twelve months
immediately prior to the declaration together with the value of any improvements and
alterations carried out during those twelve months and subsequently approved by the
board.


                                                                                         88
Where a planning area has been declared under this section in any municipality or town,
and the boundaries of the municipality or town are subsequently varied, the Minister may
by statutory order vary the boundaries of the planning area so as to conform with the
varied boundaries of that municipality or town.

Under Section 7, when an order declaring a planning area has been published under section
5, the board may, if it comes to its notice that any building or development in the area has
been allowed, which appears to it to be contrary to the provisions of any scheme that is
being prepared, direct the local authority or any other person who has given a permit for
the erection of the building or for the development to cancel the permit. Any person who
has been granted a permit to erect any building or proceed with any development whose
permit is cancelled under subsection (1) shall be entitled to such compensation as the
board shall think fit to grant. An appeal shall lie from any award made by the board under
subsection (2) which shall be determined under section 21.

One the area has been declared as a planning areas, section (10) provides that the board
shall in respect of any area declared a planning area under section 5, in consultation with
the committee or committees, prepare an outline scheme in respect of the area. Section
(11) further states that when an outline scheme has been prepared, a copy of it shall be
deposited in such place as the board shall decide.

Notice of that deposit shall be published by the board in the Gazette and at least one
newspaper circulating in Uganda. Any person may, within three months of the date of the
notice of that deposit, inspect and make representations to the board respecting the
scheme. Under section (12),as soon as is convenient after the period referred to in section
11(3), the board shall consider any representations made under that subsection and any
other matters that may have come to its notice and shall if it sees fit amend or vary the
scheme. The board after considering the scheme shall submit the scheme or, in any case
where the scheme has been amended or varied, the amended or varied scheme, to the
Minister for his or her approval. If the Minister approves the outline scheme , the board
shall deposit the scheme with any modifications made by the Minister in such places as it
shall consider desirable and shall by statutory instrument declare the scheme to be in force
and inform the public where it is available for inspection. So soon as the statutory
instrument has been published, the scheme shall have full force and effect, and no authority
shall pass or approve any plans for building or development that contravene the provisions
of the scheme.




                                                                                         89
Although the law was repealed, the land administration system still executes its mandate
swiftly. Panel discussions gave examples of the de-gazzettement of the Namanve Forest
Reserve in 1997 into an industrial park. The Land administration system executed its
mandate swiftly although developing the park has been slow.

The degazzettement of part of Lake Mburo National Park for purposes of ranching
happened swiftly and the land use change happened quite quickly.

LGI-4(v) Rezoning of rural land use follows a public process that safeguards existing
rights
There are no rural land use plans but a part of the rural land may be changed to be a part of
the planning area (town or municipality). In this case, according to according to Section 6 of
the Country and Town Planning Act provides that any person aggrieved by a decision of
any committee may appeal to the board

Under Section 7, when an order declaring a planning area has been published under section
5, the board may, if it comes to its notice that any building or development in the area has
been allowed, which appears to it to be contrary to the provisions of any scheme that is
being prepared, direct the local authority or any other person who has given a permit for
the erection of the building or for the development to cancel the permit. Any person who
has been granted a permit to erect any building or proceed with any development whose
permit is cancelled under subsection (1) shall be entitled to such compensation as the
board shall think fit to grant. An appeal shall lie from any award made by the board under
subsection (2) which shall be determined under section 21.

One the area has been declared as a planning area, section (10) provides that the board
shall in respect of any area declared a planning area under section 5, in consultation with
the committee or committees prepare an outline scheme in respect of the area. Section (11)
further states that when an outline scheme has been prepared, a copy of it shall be
deposited in such place as the board shall decide. Notice of that deposit shall be published
by the board in the Gazette and at least one newspaper circulating in Uganda. Any person
may, within three months of the date of the notice of that deposit, inspect and make
representations to the board respecting the scheme.

Panel discussions revealed that there is a lacuna now in the law as there were no saving
provisions for these provisions. Furthermore, Uganda is in the early stages of developing
planning laws. It is therefore not possible for the country at this point in time to have rural
land use plans and therefore undertake rezoning since the National Land Use Plan does not
yet exist.




                                                                                            90
LGI-4(vi) For protected rural land uses (forest, pastures, wetlands, parks) plans
correspond to actual use
Almost all the rural land uses do not have land-use plans. There are a few exceptions where
farmers are involved in tree planting schemes such as the SPGS, TGB and other carbon
schemes in which beneficiaries are expected to prepare land use plans prior enrolment in
to the scheme.

Panel discussions delved into the forest resources and it was agreed that although mapped
in the 1950s and their uses clearly stipulated, forests are heavily encroached. Efforts to
ensure that forest reserves are used for purpose are being made.

100% of national parks are used for purpose and there is little or no encroachment of the
National Parks. This is because the Uganda Wildlife Authority has been vigilant, working
with the local communities and local governments to ensure that the wildlife reserves are
protected. The achievements in this area have mainly resulted from collaborative
arrangements between the Wildlife Authority, Local Communities and Local governments,
in which communities have benefited from wildlife uses or from eco-tourism. These have
acted as incentives to good wildlife husbandry and protection of wildlife reserves.

Although efforts have been made by government to ensure the protection of gazetted areas
such as wetlands, Kampala remains a problematic area with wetlands being converted into
high end developments causing flooding of the city and lowered absorption of effluent from
the industries within the city. Lubigi and Nakivubo channels have in particular been
impacted by urban developments.

For Rangelands management, the Sustainable Land Management Project is piloting in
Nakasongola and Kamuli with the aim of having land use plans developed. Results of this
pilot will be a determining factor of whether the process should be up-scaled along the
entire cattle corridor. This project is preparing land use planning guidelines that will be
relevant for rangelands management in Uganda.


PANEL 3: URBAN LAND USE, PLANNING, AND DEVELOPMENT

Urban Land Use and Planning in Uganda is regulated under the Town and Country Planning
Act Chapter 246, revised in 2000 and the Physical Planning Act enacted in 2010.
Urbanization is growing in Uganda at a rate of 4.5% p.a9 and 60% of the population is slum
dwellers10. This means that there is a high growth of informal settlements and this creates

    challenges for urban planning. The growth of urbanization is resulting from a myriad of
    factors ranging from rural poverty, search for employment, and access to social services &
    opportunities, reclassification of land use and, the exploding population in the country.

    Planning is key issue to urban development because it plays a significant role on what and
    how developments will occur, when and where they will occur. Urban planning in Uganda
    can be traced back to 1890s when the first European footprint can be traced through
    spatial and urban planning that set Kampala to be similar to a European city 11. The Ideas
    and theories of planning emerged from the British concept of cities taking into
    consideration health, aesthetics and exclusive settlement areas and this was made law
    through the Uganda’s Town and Country Planning Act of 1951. In this period, physical
    planning formed one of the grounds for compulsory acquisition of land and as such the area
    would be declared a planning Area.

    In 1995, physical planning ceased to be a ground for compulsory acquisition of land. Land
    further was vested in the Citizens of Uganda according to four tenure systems, Leasehold,
    Freehold, Mailo and Customary Tenure. In effect, this did away with public land that vested
    in the state. It also provided that all leases out of public land were convertible to freeholds
    and this included statutory leases to urban authorities12 . The Constitution in its Article
    237(7) provides that Parliament make laws to enable urban authorities to enforce and
    implement planning and development. The implications of this provision is that regardless
    tenure type, an area can be declared a planning area and planning regulations and
    development enforceable. This however does not come without challenge especially where
    rights to land are fuzzy.

    This theme has four indicators with 14 dimensions.

          public policy objectives



    LGI-5(i)Restrictions on urban land ownership and transferability effectively serve
    public policy objectives
    According Article 237 (7) of the Constitution, tenure security supersedes planning. Land
    tenure security refers to enforceable claims on land, with the level of enforcement ranging
    from national laws to local village rules, which again are supported by national regulatory
    frameworks. It refers to people’s recognized ability to control and manage land– using it
    and disposing of its products as well as engaging in such transactions as the transferring or
    leasing of land (IFAD, 2008). The Ugandan constitution defines four tenure systems
    elaborated in the typology as Mailo, Freehold, Leasehold and Customary. Theoretically, it is
    relatively easy and feasible to distinguish between these four tenure regimes where very
    well defined property boundaries based on de jure rights exist.

     In practice, however, it is often difficult to identify the boundaries of each property regime,
    in part because formal and informal (customary) tenure systems often differ and exist in
    parallel, and in part because such customary or formal rights may differ from de facto
    access. De facto access may exist with or without a corresponding set of norms that in fact
    recognize or permit such access. Resource users may lack de jure rights but may have de
    facto rights that are based upon a number of ‘moral’ concepts about what is appropriate or
    just behavior. De facto rights are created through various social-political relations that in
    practice are not necessarily based upon the legal or formal boundaries but instead result in
    the emergence of informal, layered, nested and overlapping access regimes. Also, land
    access may not automatically translate into exclusive de jure or de facto access to resources
    on the land, although land access rights may certainly act to strongly condition access to
    these resources.

    For purposes of planning particularly in urban areas, the complexity of tenure comes into
    play as over 60% of city dwellers in Uganda are informal settlers on land. Therefore
    although land tenure creates security to land holding, it has a direct effect to development
    as the perception of the holders of rights only perceive their security of tenure in light of
    the proposed developments. In other words if an area is declared an industrial park, the
    land owners in that area who live and derive benefit from such land begin to perceive
    themselves as insecure in light of the physical development plan. This often causes
    resistance and failure of enforcement mechanisms to be executed making development
    control difficult. This is corroborated by the findings by UNHABITAT (2007), MLHUD
    (2008), and Giddings (2009).

                                                                                                                93
The proposed Urban policy recognizes this as an issue and has as one of its Policy
statements under Urban Housing “Government will ensure the supply of affordable land in
urban areas and provide a framework for regularizing the tenure system in the informal
settlement.” It envisages achieving this through the identification of land for public housing
and implementation of the National Land Policy for effective and efficient land
administration and management in urban areas.

Whereas this sounds pretty simple and the right thing to do, the complexity surrounding
this is that the land is privately owned with complex layers of rights existing over a single
parcel. This is particularly true for the Central region whether the Mailo Certificate of title
gives rise to subservient rights whose interests are guaranteed by the Constitution. How
then will government find this land and streamline informal settlements through the
regularization of tenure? Since physical planning is not a ground for compulsory
acquisition under Article 26 of the constitution, the only option Government would be left
with is to purchase such land on a “willing buyer-willing seller basis.” This is a costly
process that is unlikely to yield any results given that the land sector is underfunded.

Not only is underfunding the challenge, the regulation of tenants by occupancy poses a
challenge today in Uganda. The Land Act in its section 31 places the burden of proof on the
land owner of registered land to show cause why that occupant is not lawful or bonafide.
With fluid grounds of claiming bonafide occupancy, more often than not land owners are
unable prove the contrary. Transacting in land is thus hampered by the fuzziness of the
tenure system providing incomplete rights to the land owner and the tenant, both of whom
must be compensated for their interests in the same parcel, moreover with an unverifiable
evidence of such rights to land. This was illustrated by Damaris Kathini Muini et.al. Pg.35
when he analyses the development of the real estate industry being constrained by a
sudden influx of tenants seeking compensation for their rights to land and the challenge of
proving that they are not entitled to such compensation as they are not rights holders. This
is compounded by lack of regulation for compensation of the occupants by occupancy
making it difficult to amass land for development.

Furthermore, the non-eviction law13 protects tenants by occupancy from eviction except
for the non-payment of ground rent. This compounds the complexity of urban planning in
Uganda. There are good plans on paper that are challenging to enforce in practice because
of the land tenure regime.

However, where Government is the land owner and where leaseholds exist in urban areas,
regulation and enforcement of planning is possible and is executed. In situations where
there are unplanned areas occupied by informal settlements, it has been proved by GLTN

                                                                                            94
through the Mbale pilot that it is possible to regularize these informalities and have rights
recorded.

Currently, it is only leaseholds that have planning restrictions described in the lease
agreement and enforcement effected. These are leaseholds granted by urban authorities
out of former government land. In Kampala city for example, leasehold tenure accounts for
26% of the land in the city. 57% of the land is privately owned under Mailo, 14% is official
Mailo belonging to the Buganda Kingdom and 3% is freehold owned by schools, mosques
and churches (MLHUD 2013).

The panel discussions mainly revealed that despite the good legal provisions, the lack of
enforcement mechanisms pose a challenge to the entering of generic restrictions in every
certificate of title. Such restrictions would be easements, the use of wetlands and building
restrictions that would form restrictive covenants. The challenges to enforcement are
mainly as a result of corruption tendencies of the officials holding the mandate of
enforcement.

LGI-5(ii) Restrictions on urban land use effectively and comprehensively serve
public policy objectives
There is no urban policy to take into consideration the restrictions that should be instituted
on urban land use. However, there are currently supporting legal frameworks to which
regard must be had in land use management. These are the National Environment Act Cap
153, the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act 2003 and the Wildlife Act Cap200, the
Wetlands policy and regulations, regulations on the use of hill tops and river banks. All
these provide restrictions on the use of urban lands to avoid disaster situations and for
purposes of environmental conservation and protection. This serves public policy
objectives.

Panel discussions affirmed that the regulatory framework does exist but is clearly not
enforced and thus the chaotic growth of urban areas in Uganda. Building standards and
structural plans are not followed despite the existence of regulations. Failure in
enforcement is marred by political interests and high-handedness from politicians,
ignorance by the people and therefore their input in preparation of the plans is very low.
The people will often not be consulted as they do not even know that they do have a right

           by actual land use changes



    LGI-6(i) Processes of urban expansion/infrastructure development are transparent
    and respect existing rights.
    Urban expansion in Uganda is characterized by reclassification of land use from rural to
    urban through spatial expansion by annexing the adjacent townships and rural areas,
    converting farmlands and villages into urban areas. Kampala city for example has grown
    from an administrative township measuring 0.7Sq Km in 1902 to over 195sq km by 1968
    and now estimated at about 839sqkm. Urban Expansion in Uganda is estimated at a rate of
    6%p.a, which is much faster than the global rate of urbanization (Somik Lall 2012:5).

    Beyond spatial expansion, administrative reclassifications have influenced the pace and
    magnitude of urbanization. The Local Governments Act authorizes the Ministry of Local
    Government to classify cities, municipalities and town councils as urban areas. This
    classification is followed by the gazzettement of these areas. Furthermore, all district
    headquarters are classified as towns. For all these classifications, it is only the
    municipalities which require master plans, water services and capacity to provide services.

    The Physical Planning Act 2010 in its Section 29 provides that the National Planning Board
    within 14 days after the approving the district, urban or local development plan publish in
    the Gazzette whether or not it has approved the plan with or without modification and
    where the plan can be found for inspection. This is an attempt to make the process
    transparent. This proviso has not been implemented to date.

    The growth of urban areas in Uganda has been unplanned – with high rates of spatial
    expansion (sprawl) and unplanned growth, lack of integration between sectoral and spatial
    planning, inadequate provision of basic services, weak urban management capacity and
    significant fiscal constraints (Somik Lall 2012:17). The land use change and management in
    Uganda is characterized by corruption and high handed actions of the officials. As a

                                                                                                                        96
consequence, congestion and chaotic development is setting in making it impossible to
develop organized living environment within the towns and cities. As stated earlier, over
60% of those living in the urban areas are slum dwellers living in unplanned
neighbourhoods, with poor road network, poor drainage, sanitation and waste disposal
characterized by solid waste damping in the neighbourhood and liquid waste disposal into
the water sources leading to contamination water sources and increase in disease
especially during the rainy season.

Part of the urban chaos is due to the lack of the urban policy and a weak legal framework.
This has left the aspect of planning to individual interests and manipulation of systems and
processes has been at the forefront of shaping land use restrictions. This lack of
transparency has resulted in riots and violent acts in towns as the ordinary people begin to
realize that they are powerless and voiceless.

Tom Goodfellow (2012) describes urban planning in Uganda as “Planning through the
barrel of the gun.”The Ugandan urban planning situation is best described by the words of
Giddens as ‘the reflexive monitoring of action that both draws upon and reconstitutes the
institutional organization of society’. This implies more attention to social action as a factor
in determining how planning happens in Ugandan urban centres and the reproduction of
formal institutional matrices relying on popular action and civil defiance; after all,
‘institutions do not just work ‘behind the backs’ of the social actors who produce and
reproduce them’ (Giddens 1979: 71).

The issue of agency in the reproduction of institutions for urban planning in Uganda raises
questions of power. Informal institutions are arguably reproduced and reinforced by the
powerless as well as the powerful through strikes, riots and street action, even if they are
not in the former’s immediate interests. They may take on ‘functional’ qualities over time
as they become ‘locked in’, because ‘social adaptation to institutions drastically increases
the cost of exit from existing arrangements’ (Pierson 2000b: 492). This is the case when the
President of Uganda in many instances sides with the urban dwellers especially in the big
cities, leaving the technocrats making effort to enforce planning in the cold.


Examples were given in the panels of infrastructure development in major towns and
Kampala where people are not involved in the preparation phase and are only made aware
when infrastructure expansion begins to happen by the surveys carried out. At that point is
when issues arise as to how they might be affected and what kind of compensation will be
paid to those affected.




                                                                                             97
Kampala city has got an approved plan, but it is not widely publicized and thus keeping all
the residents in ignorance. This impacts on infrastructural development which in most
cases than not opposed by the city dwellers.

LGI-6(ii) Changes in urban land use plans are based on a public process with input by
all stakeholders and benefit sharing

In Uganda, power relations have evolved in a manner that there is less scope for the
powerful to exercise either total domination or ‘three dimensional’ power, state -society
conflict is overt and may be expressed through a politics of ‘noise.’ The interesting point
about this sequence of events is not that there was corruption and elite collusion in the sale
of the market lease, or that vendors were angry about it, neither of which is surprising. The
point is the way in which rioting became almost the ‘normal’ mode of political interchange
through which a large group of urban-dwellers participated in engagement with the state.
As it became evident that rioting was more effective than complaining to the City Council,
there were clear incentives to riot; yet at the same time, rioting was not effective enough to
end the matter once and for all, causing incentives for more riots to win further attention
and concessions. The government’s decision to respond with both fire power and public
rhetorical interventions in vendors’ favour was a way of both subduing and conciliating
them without actually giving too many concessions. Vendors’ expectations that government
would respond only to riots, and government expectations that a limited response would
suffice to placate the vendors, have both perpetuated rioting as a form of political dialogue.

In the smaller urban areas, the relatively powerless often continue adhering to, and thereby
reinforcing, existing norms that are seemingly detrimental to them, even in the absence of
overt coercion. Whether this happens because they are deceived as to their ‘real’ inter ests,
or because they find it expedient to conform but are actually resisting internally, has been a
subject of much debate. The urban dwellers even though excluded from planning and
decision making processes regarding urban planning seem aloof and mere observers of
developments in their locality.

 Despite all these challenges that emerged, the issues paper for the development of the
Urban Land Policy (MLHUD 2013b) does not consider lack transparency and participation
of urban dwellers and stakeholders as challenges to urban planning requiring policy
response. It still considers urban planning as a technocratic top-down process with skewed
power relations, where it is only the state that knows what is good for the citizen. The
issues paper only considers the technical aspects of urban planning and not integrated
planning and decision making that takes into account the interests and needs of the society
that makes up an urban area. The only mention of stakeholder participation is in the final
chapter of the draft National Urban Policy (MLHUD 2013c) in which it is required that
simplified versions be distributed to all stakeholders and the inclusion of stakeholders in

                                                                                           98
the preparation and implementation of subsequent plans and programs of the Urban
Policy. Moreover, the definition of stakeholders is restricted to Ministry Departments and
Agencies, Development Partners, Private Sector, the Academia and Civil society
organizations. There is no stake for the urban dwellers and the community that makes up
the urban area to participate in planning processes irrespective of the fact that they shape
the development path and shape the fabric of urban space.

It is most probable that the Urban Policy when developed will have little or no significant
effect in improving urban planning because of the non-consideration of transparency and
participation as important ingredients to sustainable urban planning, development and
growth. Communities largely influence the development path and fabric of urban space.
Disregarding their participation works to the detriment of urban planning and
development.

Technical staff from the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban development however
explained that the reason for limited participation if because planning is a very technical
subject and it would cost a lot for the government in terms of time, human resource and
money to ensure that there is meaningful participation. All three elements are currently
lacking so there is no way to have participation improved in the current circumstances.

Where consultations have been made, local governance structures are used with the hope
that they will take back the information to their constituents. The cost of public
mobilization and facilitation is really high and unaffordable.

Furthermore, it was noted at the panels that women often shy away from these
consultations probably because they assume it is “a man’s issue” and they have very little
or no value addition in the process. Planning therefore loses the gender dimension and
focus.


LGI-6(iii) Changes in assigned urban land use are swiftly followed by actual land use
changes
Undertaking physical planning requires huge sums of money to compensate the informal
settlements in order to ensure that the changed land use can be developed according to the
plans. Furthermore, there is need to compensate land owners of areas designated through
planning for public facilities such as roads, public open spaces, public health facilities, e.t.c.
Local governments do not have the budgets to undertake these compensations and
therefore forfeit planning altogether.

As a result, the outcomes of urban management in Uganda are unpredictable. Planned
outcomes are often not achieved because urban areas develop as a result of millions of


                                                                                               99
    consumption and production decisions by different individuals, groups and organizations.
    It is common to find pockets of well planned, services, developed and managed
    neighborhoods, industrial parks or transportation corridors (TAHAL 2005:37) amidst
    widespread impoverishment. Successes in urban services delivery can be found in smaller
    secondary towns dotted all around the country especially where the urban managers and
    political leadership is keen to see planned and sustained urban growth and development.
    The larger part of urban development in Uganda is occurring largely informally with
    inadequate planning and regulation (Lwasa & Kadila 2010:30).

    The failures in urban planning are due to a myriad of issues including lack of resources and
    regulation enforcement. However, it is also true that those engaged in urban planning have
    neither been well linked to the values of planning and urban development nor to the
    knowledge bases that guide development (Lwasa 2006:36). This has resulted in urban
    development occurring largely informally with no service provision.

    Panel discussions revealed that land use changes are never communicated to the current
    land users. An example was given on Nakasero Hill in Kampala city that has its land use
    change from residential to commercial. However, this change was never communicated and
    people have continued to reside in the area and even build residential houses in this area.

    Furthermore, Land use change implementation depends on the implementer. If it is private
    sector driven, land use change always happens quite quickly compared to if it is
    Government proposing the land use change.

    LGI-7(i) A policy to ensure delivery of low-cost housing & services exists and is
    progressively implemented
    There is no policy on law cost housing. However, the Draft National Urban Policy (MLHUD
    2013c). Issue 17 (MLHUD2013b:14) estimates that currently Uganda has approximately 1
    million households living in 4.5 million housing units with an average of 4.7 persons. The
    national occupancy density is estimated at 1.1 households per housing unit, giving a total
    national backlog of 612,000 housing units. At national level, there is a backlog of about 1.6
    million units of which 211,000 units are in urban areas and 1.295 million units are in rural
    areas.

    According to UBOS (2006), the urban areas have a total housing stock of 700,000 housing
    units with a backlog of 153,000 housing units compared to the rural areas with a stock of
    4,580,000 housing units and a backlog of 458,000 housing units.

    Panel discussions revealed that there is actually a housing policy under review that
    includes the provision of low cost housing. A copy of the policy was not however readily
    available for reference. The mandate to provide housing used to rest with the National
    Housing and Construction Corporation. Since privatization was embraced in the 1980s, the
    role of the National Housing and Construction Company changed to doing business and no
    longer providing affordable housing. The National Slum Upgrading Strategy exists but
    requires financing if it is to deliver on its mandate.

    LGI-7(ii) Land use planning effectively guides urban spatial expansion in the largest
    city
    Home to 1.6 million, Kampala dominates the urban landscape, accounting for one-third of
    Uganda‘s urban population, Uganda has started its journey into urbanization and economic
    development. The pace of urbanization is picking up – currently at 4.5% per year, and likely
    to accelerate with rising incomes. The urban population is projected to increase from 13.3
    million in 2010 to 20 million in 2030 (Somik Lall: 1).

     The process of urban expansion is not unique to Uganda or the Kampala Metropolitan
    Area. Figure 4 shows Kampala‘s spatial expansion between 1995 and 2001where suburban
    built up area has come up on previously open rural space. Urban expansion – measured by
    the change in built up area is around 6 percent annually, which is faster than either the
    regional or global pace of urban expansion. However, average densities have declined much



                                                                                                           101
slower -- at around 2 percent annually (suggesting redevelopment within the city), which is
faster than regional trends but in line with what is happening globally (Somik Lall: 5).

The fast rate of urban growth is not matched by urban planning which has led to sprawling
development of Kampala. Development has been guided more by infrastructure and
industrial development in the country that dictate the economies of scale rather than
spatial planning.

Panel discussions revealed that Kampala does have a plan, but this does not guide spatial
planning simply because enforcement mechanisms are weak. The towns neighbouring the
city such as Kira Town Council does not have a plan. This leads to sprawling and
uncontrolled developments to emerge. As such many times people settle in areas without
infrastructure plans. Roads and other infrastructural developments often are provided long
after settlements are established. This creates problems of sewerage disposal and lack of
easements for electricity and water services.

LGI-7(iii) land use planning effectively guides urban development in the 4 next
largest cities
The next largest town is Kira with 179,000 located barely 4 kms from Kampala‘s CBD12.
The Northern cities of Gulu and Lira are two other cities with more than 100,000 people
and Mbale. The skewed distribution of city sizes is of considerable concern to policymakers
who would like to stimulate growth in small and medium sized cities. However, this pattern
of city sizes is not an outlier, but an empirical regularity across countries and over time
(Somik Lall: 6).

Urbanization rates in Uganda are higher than official estimates if one considers an alternate
measure – the Agglomeration Index, which considers density, urban size and proximity to
the urban center. In fact, this can be thought of as the shadow of the core urban area – with
vibrant economic and social interactions with the urban core. The agglomeration index
does not use statistical definitions of urban areas. it instead uses three indicators to
estimate the level of urban concentration in a country or region – population density, the
population size of large urban centers, and travel time to the nearest such urban center
(Uchida and Nelson 2008). Using this index, Uganda’s urbanization moves up from 13
percent to 25 percent using proximity to cities of 50,000 people; however the index drops
to 14 percent if cities of 100,000 or more people are considered

There is absence of physical development plans for most of the urban centres in Uganda.
Over 100 urban centres in have no maps to guide their planning. The lack of up-to-date
information including topographic maps, cadastre information and land tenure maps
impacts on the ability to have controlled development of urban areas (MLHUD 2013b:60).
Formulation of physical development plans requires competent and qualified staff. The
                                                                                         102
majority of districts lack competent staff and equipment to undertake planning. The use of
GIS for planning is a foreign concept and manual approaches are still being used by some
districts. Limited qualified personnel, materials, equipment, planning, implementation,
resource mobilization and management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the
implementation of urban development initiatives are a detriment to controlled and
organized urban development. This is compounded by lack of coordination among sectors
mandated to carry out planning. Key among these is the urban local governments, the
District Local governments, Ministry of Local Government and Ministry of Lands, Housing
and Urban Development.

Panel discussions affirmed that the next four are towns and not cities. Uganda’s Vision
20140 makes mention of four cities but these are not named. This regardless, there is an
ongoing World Bank Project whose main objective is to link planning to infrastructure
development. 14 municipal councils are benefiting from this project. The main challenge
experienced by this project is land acquisition for infrastructure development. The cost of
this is a deterrent to many of the municipal council’s implementation and achievement of
project goals.

LGI-7(iv) Urban planning processes are well suited to cope with future urban growth
The Fundamentals of urban planning is that it should meet the needs of the population or
enable people to innovate and meet their own needs. Urban land use planning processes in
Uganda have been challenged by population growth rate, management and governance
challenges.

The emerging rapid increase in the urban population is not matched with growth and
development in the basic physical infrastructure, housing, social amenities, management
and skills. This has led to overcrowding, sprawling development of slums and informal
settlements, dilapidated housing and poor sanitation. The quality of the urban environment
is being degraded due to the proliferation of informal settlements and slums, industrial
emissions and effluent, deforestation and uncontrolled soil erosion.

There is lack of integration of physical planning with socio-economic planning arising out
of a low appreciation of the significance of land use planning and this has led to the
increase in informality and disorderly urban development in Uganda. Whereas physical
planning provides a spatial framework for development of urban centres, socio-economic
planning ensures that there is adequate allocation of human, technical and financial
resources to support the implementation of the physical development plans. There is
absence of good will from the political leadership to commit financial resources to physical
planning. While many of the old districts have structure plans, there is lack of institutional
capacity and technical and financial resources to implement them. In many instances,



                                                                                          103
    Development has preceded planning and thus uncontrolled the sprawling urban
    development (MLHUD 2013b:12).

    Furthermore, undertaking physical planning requires huge sums of money to compensate
    the informal settlements in order to ensure that the changed land use can be developed
    according to the plans. Furthermore, there is need to compensate land owners of areas
    designated through planning for public facilities such as roads, public open spaces, public
    health facilities, e.t.c. Local governments do not have the budgets to undertake these
    compensations and therefore forfeit planning altogether.

    Panel discussions revealed that very few people go through the process of formalizing
    housing. Furthermore, most of the lands are serviced by the parcel owners and not by the
    local administration. This is because the local administration does not have the human and
    financial capacity to service parcels within the city neither can it cope with the demand for
    services. Lots of new slums are mushrooming in the city. Furthermore, the work of the local
    administration is heavily influenced by politics that undermines their work. Examples of
    these are the Acholi quarters in the Kiwanataka area, the Luzira Landing Site and all of
    which have attracted media attention in 2013 when the Kampala City Authority sought to
    enforce development plans.

There is no readily available information stipulating the obtaining residential building
permits. Most processes followed is the approval of building plans. The procedure is
neither clear nor defined for the general public. This makes it not easy to assess.

Panel discussions however revealed that the requirements for building permits are over-
engineered and are too bureaucratic that ordinary people would rather avoid going
through the processes. In the past, 1980s to early 1990s, building permits were issued and
procedures were followed. These are currently non-functional and there is no clear
explanation for the dysfunctionality of this service.

LGI-8(ii) A building permit for a residential dwelling can be obtained quickly and at
low cost
Section 32 of the Physical Planning Act places a duty on the physical planning committee to
prohibit or control the use of land and buildings in the interest of proper orderly
development of its area. Section 33(1) then requires a developer to obtain development
permission from the physical planning committee of the area prior to commencing
development. The committee’s approval is subject to the physical development plan,
development intensity and the land use of the area.

Despite these legal provisions, there are no regulations in place to stipulate the detailed
procedures. The law is quiet regarding timeframes. This makes it difficult to obtain the
development permission. Experience in Uganda is such that upon lodgment of applications
and the acknowledgement of receipt of the lodgment by the physical planner, development
commences. Many buildings have been complemented without the approval of plans and
issuance of development permits. The alternatives available to many developers are to pay
bribes to speed up the process and even then it takes a minimum of six months to receive
the approval to develop.

Given the growing informality, there is evidence in most urban centres of developers
building at night and during weekends to avoid law enforcement. Once the building is
erected, it becomes difficult for the planning committee to erase it.

On a regular basis, it is commercial premises in the city centre that acquire development
permits prior to commencement of development. This flaw in the system has resulted in
the collapse of several buildings across the city of Kampala. In just 2013, a total of five
buildings collapsed in the city centre leading to death of over 30 people.

Panelists gave experiences in approval of building plans saying corruption is at the center
stage. The rigour that was employed in the 1970s and 80s in the approval of building plans
is completely absent today. Job cards used to take 2-3 days to be issued. Today it takes
forever if one is not a person with great political influence or with money to pay. Physical

    planning committees are not as effective as the Councils used to be when they had the
    mandate to approve plans. This has resulted into many developers commencing
    construction with no approvals given.


    9 TENURE REGULARIZATION SCHEMES IN URBAN AREAS

    LGI-9(i) Formalization of urban residential housing is feasible and affordable
    There are many initiatives and interventions in the urban sector by different
    actors/stakeholders e.g. government agencies at both national level and local government
    level; development agencies, donors, NGOs, CSOs, CBOs and the Private Sector which
    impact on slum/informal settlement issues. Through Public Private Partnerships,
    government with support from donors and the private sector has undertaken the following
    housing projects to meet the housing needs of the urban poor:
           I. Under the DANIDA-Masese Women’s Self Help Project, 400 houses have been
                 constructed out of the planned 700 for residents in Jinja;
           II. A total of 460 houses have been constructed, out of the planned 484, for residents
                 in Mbale under the Malukhu slum-upgrading Project;
           III. Under the Oli Housing Project of Arua, a total of 156 houses have been
                 constructed;
           IV. The UN-Habitat-Mpumudde Housing Project constructed for women in
                 Mpumudde Division in Jinja Municipality.
           V. Namuwongo slum upgrading and low-cost housing project in Kampala.

    These projects have benefited about 2000 households of whom 30-37% are female
    households(MWHC:2003).

                                                                                                                         106
The general pattern has been to plan the settlements for redevelopment and service these
settlements with roads, piped water, electricity, sanitation facilities and social services like
healthy facilities and schools. The beneficiaries are allocated land with MLHUD
title deeds and given loans to construct their houses.
They are mobilized at community level to ensure full community participation in planning,
implementation and management of the project activities.
According to the Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications31, the implementation
of the upgrading projects has resulted in the following benefits:
       (i) improved housing conditions, improved access to services;
       (ii) increased opportunities for income generation;
       (iii) increased employment opportunities;
       (iv) increased security of tenure;
       (v) increased stability of the population and social cohesion;
       (vi) increased sense of belonging, dignity and assertiveness;
       (vii) increased propensity to save and invest;
       (viii) reduced morbidity and mortality rates;
       (ix) improved quality of the urban environment;
       (x) increased values of land;
       (xi) higher development potential as more developers are attracted to the
              settlements; and
       (xii) Increased market for various products.

The Housing and Urban Indicators Programme, which has been running through the
Department of Human Settlements for now over 10 years should be having useful
information on housing conditions, urban conditions, access to basic urban infrastructure
and services which is critical in designing strategies for slum/informal upgrading and
monitoring the progress in implementing these strategies. The newly created Department
of Urban Development has embarked on an urban sector profiling exercise, compiling
information about the urban situation throughout the country. The end product will be a
national urban development bank which can be used to plan strategies for slum upgrading
(MLHUD 2008b:30)
.
In addition to the above, Government, through the Department of Human Settlements, in
collaboration with Slum Dwellers International (SDI), started in 2003 a Slum Upgrading
Program (SUP) in 3 parishes in the Central Division of Kampala City (Kisenyi I, Kisenyi II
and Kisenyi III) and 6 other slums in Jinja Municipality. The SUP is comprised of the
following major components:-
     (a) Slum profiling and household baseline survey (i.e. collecting data pertaining to
         slums)


                                                                                            107
    (b) Conducting housing demonstrations
    (c) Carrying out exchange programs
    (d) Mobilizing slum dwellers communities into saving and loans schemes
    (e) Conducting sensitization exercises
    (f) Infrastructure development
It should however be noted that these are donor funded projects. It is however not clear
how the above processes happen outside projecterised funding as there are no clear
procedures for the formalization of housing should an individual; or community seek to do
so.


Panel discussions posed a main challenge of all the housing projects being project driven
rather than demand driven. Thus, the Government cannot on its own develop housing
outside external support or funding. This poses a challenge on the future of housing in
Uganda if there is no deliberate move by Government to address the problem.


LGI-9(ii) In cities with informal tenure, a viable strategy exists to delivery tenure
security, infrastructure & housing
The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development under the Department of Human
Settlements developed the National Slum Upgrading Strategy and Action Plan in 2008.
The development of the National Slum Upgrading Strategy in Uganda is primarily driven by
recognition that actions related to slum-upgrading, environmental management,
infrastructure development, service delivery and poverty-reduction at large cannot be
achieved unless there is a direct recognition that slums are a development issue, which
needs to be faced.

The aim of regularizing tenure in slum areas is to confer de jure security of tenure for land
owners and de facto security of tenure for occupants and tenants. While recognizing the
complexity of land relations within slum settlements and in order to mobilize these hidden
resources, effort will be made to achieve sufficient tenure security (real and perceived)
through sustainable, practical and socially progressive ways of improving tenure security
and rights. There are five issues that the strategy considers to respond to tenure security
infrastructure and housing.

Issue 1: In dealing with land tenure, this Strategy will emphasize three aspects which are
key in upgrading;
(a) Beneficiary identification; with accurate knowledge of land ownership patterns and
     existing tenure conditions of possible beneficiaries. Good processes of land ownership
     analysis, beneficiary selection and subsequent tenure arrangements must prevent
     local speculators, wealthy landlords and non-residents from surreptitiously taking
                                                                                         108
    undue advantage of slum development and diverting limited resources away from the
    intended beneficiaries.

(b) Establishing the Legal status; who owns the land? Is it owned by the local government,
     or a government agency, or a traditional authority? Is it in the absolute ownership of a
     few absentee landlords? Has it been leased to private landlords by a public agency,
     and is it now informally squatted upon by the slum dwellers? If informal land markets
     exist, how do they work? Is some of the land under customary or traditional
     administrative structures? Does all the land fall under a single ownership pattern? If
     not, what are the different patterns?

(c) Cost of the land for accommodating tenure for slum dwellers on private land is much
     higher than it is on public lands. One method of easing this burden is to average out
     the effective costs of public and privately-owned squatted land – either on a site-by-
     site basis or lowering official valuations of squatted land, or conversely, allowing
     private owners to transfer development rights to other properties. To the extent
     possible efforts will be made to control land markets and to curb resident
     displacement or rising rents.

The strategies included in the National slum Upgrading strategy are (MLHUD 2008b:36):

a. Participatory land ownership and tenure analysis and beneficiary selection that is
   participatory and transparent and allowing communities to be consulted to verify
   ‘official’ census data. The beneficiary selection process may also include an assessment
   of beneficiaries’ willingness and ability to pay for better tenure and upgraded services.

b. Participatory Poverty mapping exercises, environmental and infrastructural
   assessments, and socio-economic surveys result in an updated census enlisting those
   households and individuals who are the intended beneficiaries of the comprehensive
   upgrading project.

c. Offering recognizable rights to land and housing; where possible ensure legalization of
   tenure in accordance with existing land laws of Uganda.

       i. where a slum is situate on privately owned land, compensation, land sharing and
          readjustment or land swaps will be encouraged

       ii. where a slum is situate on customary land, efforts will be made to identify the
           various levels of claims and interests ranging form ownership, use and allocative
           rights of customary holders and adapting them (with their attendant customary

                                                                                         109
          rules) to embracing upgrading initiatives by innovatively supporting the
          creation of occupancy interests in the form of urban access and urban use rights

      iii. Offer slum residents priority for relocation to sites that offer employment
           opportunities and access to urban services

      iv. Allow for direct tenure transfer where beneficiaries negotiate with the
          landowner and procure their tenure rights individually and directly. In such
          cases the upgrading agency or the local government or urban authority should
          act as a legal broker and guarantor between the two parties. This option is ideal
          when tenure transfer happens after upgrading is completed.

d. Simplifying land tenure regimes using intermediate forms of legal recognition in
   accordance with existing land titling laws of Uganda, this include but are not limited to;

       i. Community ownership of the entire project site by the community or group title
          administered through project specific land committees as a buffer against
          premature sale of titles in order to cash in on property, this ideal when land is
          privately owned, and when individual beneficiaries’ ability to negotiate with
          landlords is weak.

       ii. Arranging for staged process of legislation with initial recognition granted to an
           upgrading site and individual titles or parcel will be completed later.

      iii. Freehold and outright sale of land with or without a mortgage especially in areas
           where the land costs are very low, and the beneficiaries’ ability and willingness
           to pay is high.

      iv. Leasehold agreement, granting beneficiaries a long-term rental of the land and
          services at affordable prices. This might include an option to purchase the land
          within a specific period of time of continued and uninterrupted occupancy.

e. Upgrading in some instances will inevitably require Government to purchase land for
   upgrading and resettlement purposes. Land banking is a possibility even though it is
   costly and administratively difficult.

f. Providing assurance on investments made on land or housing against confiscation or
   demolition or eviction.



                                                                                         110
g. Slum upgrading should consider environmentally sensitive areas and discourage
   relocation of settlements in ecologically sensitive areas.

Issue 2 :. Regulatory frameworks directly affect the ability of poor households to access land
and housing through legal channels. High planning and building standards have both direct
and indirect impacts on development costs. Often, the poor and sometimes even middle-
income households cannot afford to conform to official standards.

The key strategies here were to review of the regulatory framework, which is the single
most effective tool for reducing future slums and unauthorized settlements. It is essential
to make sure that the regulatory framework does not impose unrealistic or unachievable
requirements, making access to legal housing cheaper and easier by (MLHUD 2008b:38):
a) Relating plot sizes to those found within unauthorized settlements will be a basis for
   revising minimum planning standards with the involvement of communities who live in
   these settlements.
b) Reducing road reservations to the minimum consistent with safe circulation.
c) Permitting the most efficient use of available land, by relaxing constraints on the forms
   of development and uses to which people can put their plots.
d) Simplifying planning procedures so that conformity is easy and affordable. Such as basic
   standards for all, in ways that can be upgraded later, are preferable to high standards
   now for a minority.
e) Identifying specific factors impeding legal and affordable access to land and housing, so
   that revisions can be made when and as required.

Issue 3: Increasing the supply of affordable land for the Urban Poor is important to stem the
growth of new slums. Such pro-active response will require the preparation of a Site
Development Briefs for local governments or urban authorities to initiate proposals
without having to seek recourse to unpopular, time consuming and inefficient land
acquisition and development procedures.

The Slum upgrading strategy and Action plan envisages the following techniques(MLHUD
2008b:39);
a. Urban Land pooling33 and Land Readjustment34 for managing and financing urban
   land development. Local or central governments undertake projects to assemble and
   convert the rural land parcels in selected urban-fringe areas into planned layouts of
   roads, public utility lines, public open spaces and serviced building plots. Some of the
   plots are sold for project cost recovery and other plots are distributed to the
   landowners in exchange for their rural land parcels.



                                                                                          111
b. Public-Private Partnerships or more comprehensive Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships
   under such arrangement are best introduced through pilot projects, as an opportunity
   for all stakeholders to experiment with and learn from new approaches.

c. Local Development Plans (for Local governments and Urban Authorities) provide a
   coherent framework within which land-owners can subdivide their parcels and make a
   reasonable profit. In areas where customary systems of land management ownership
   exist, it is advisable to incorporate the traditional leaders into the planning and
   decision-making process to ensure social legitimacy to proposals.

d. Creating an efficient land use plan within new urban developments, and keeping in
   mind the existing land use patterns and transportation networks. It is better to
   integrate the new development into the existing urban fabric.

e. Tenure policy also exerts a major influence on access to land and housing. Measures
   include;
   i) Encouraging a range of tenure options so that all sections of demand can be
       matched with appropriate supply options.
   ii) Private rental housing is often a vital option for very poor households and provides
       valuable rental income for households

Issue 4: In the past there has been inadequate human settlement planning both in the rural
and urban areas which has resulted not only in haphazard development in urban areas, but
also wasteful and inappropriate settlement systems and patterns. The biggest problem is
that the growth of housing has been left to market forces which don't favor massive
investment in affordable shelter. Policies in place and those still in formulation are yet to
adequately cater for the needs of the urban poor and respond to the deteriorating situation
in slums or even remarkably stem their endemic growth. It is therefore important
that(MLHUD 2008b:40);
    (a) The strategy creates conditions in which all sections of urban society, especially the
          poorest and most vulnerable, can obtain access to legal, affordable and appropriate
          shelter in ways that prevent the need for future slums and unauthorized
          settlements
    (b) The regularization of existing slums takes care of the additional demand of the
          additional poor expected to live in the urban areas. Planning for future urban
          (new) settlement is less expensive than upgrading consolidated informal
          settlements.

This strategy lays emphasis on governments, local governments and urban authorities,
puts in place a framework of planning and urban management that creates pluralistic

                                                                                          112
systems of supply (housing and infrastructure) which can respond to a range of, and to
variations in, demand and needs. The role of the Government in this context will be to
create and maintain a `level playing field’ in which different suppliers of housing, services,
credit and building components can compete on equitable terms and to extent possible
encourage investment in affordable housing for the urban poor and in the slum areas.
Accordingly, it implies the following;

   a) Revisiting and enforcing standards and administrative procedures to reduce entry
      costs and accelerate the supply of new legal development.

   b) Making sure land and housing prices are within the ability of all sections of society
      to pay for them, by balancing supply to demand, and for subsidies to be carefully
      considered and targeted, this can be achieved through preparation of a land budget,
      to assess how much land will need to be urbanized over a 10 and 15 year period,
      based on population growth estimates and other trends such as employment and
      transportation in all urban areas.

   c) In preparing a land budget and assessing the amount of land required 7 inputs or
       key considerations are factored;
        i. The projected demand for commercial and industrial land and the demand for
           land for new housing development.
       ii. Density levels for specified types of housing and other land uses - based on
           minimum official plot sizes, occupancy levels, and road widths.
      iii. Requirements for communal facilities such as schools, clinics, religious sites,
           public open spaces, etc, at central and neighborhood levels.




                                                                                          113
      iv. Topography and ground conditions: these include consideration of issues such
          as steep slopes, load-bearing capacity, and vulnerability to flooding.
       v. Accessibility of available land.
      vi. Public transportation networks, location of economic activities, and
     vii. access to physical and social infrastructure.

   d) A major component of the land budget will be to understand the need for new
      housing. This involves preparing a Housing Needs Assessment. This needs to be
      prepared for the same time periods as the Land Budget, say for 10 and 15 years
      i) The replacement of existing units which will have fully depreciated during the
           plan period, estimates need to be made over a reasonable period.
      ii) The upgrading and replacement of deficient units whose upgrading are not
           economically feasible; a large proportion of substandard housing can usually be
           improved, providing the owners feel secure and have access to credit.
      iii) Estimating the proportion of the existing housing stock which can be upgraded
           where this is economically feasible.
      iv) Estimating the nature of housing needs because not all households want, or can
           afford, the same type of housing. Affordability will be largely determined by
           incomes, though savings may also be relevant.
      v) Additional housing expected to be provided on newly urbanized land in the
           urban periphery.

Issue 5: The rapid urbanization however, has not been matched with capacity to plan and
manage the urban growth. With inadequate capacity to plan, guide and enforce
development control, besides managing the present levels of urban growth, it is envisaged
that the informal settlements will become more densely populated and new squatter
settlements will mushroom on marginal lands such as wetlands, hill slopes and forest
reserves. The growth and expansion are associated with lack of infrastructure, social
services and pose planning and environment problems. In general, the present condition of
urban infrastructure is poor, the services provided are inferior and the financing systems
for infrastructure and services are inadequate.

The strategy is premised on the thinking that slum residents are willing to pay for the
services they value most, this is a proxy indicator for demand. Therefore(MLHUD
2008b:41);

   a) Urban infrastructure and services will be designed to allow for incremental
      upgrading as poor communities improve their incomes and capacity to pay for
      services increases.

                                                                                      114
   b) In the event of resources constraints, single-sector interventions in services will be
      encouraged as opposed to a full range of services (i.e. roads, water, sanitation,
      drainage, solid waste, electricity etc)

   c) Assessment of willingness to contribute to infrastructure services and costs by slum
      residents, provided they are availed adequate information regarding trade-offs will
      be a key ingredient of slum upgrading interventions.

   d) Partial recovery of costs in infrastructure services intervention is critical.
      Beneficiaries and targeted users will explicit within planning and execution of
      upgrading schemes to sustain basic operations and for maintenance, not exceeding
      10% of total infrastructure costs.
      i) These costs need not be made up-front payments but rather introduced in an
          incremental manner.
      ii) Government, Local Governments and Urban Authorities will provide the
          necessary political will to support cost recovery initiatives in upgrading areas

   e) Mainstreaming the delivery and maintenance of upgrading services for slums in
      urban authorities and local governments’ plans, departments and resources.

   f) Community led and demand led approaches should be used to prioritize and
      influence the content of initiatives and to weigh on standards and services options
      to ensure acceptability and enhanced demand responsiveness.

   g) Government and Urban Authorities support initiatives by slum organisations by
      adopting a more ‘enabling’ approach to the delivery of basic services accessible to
      the poor through the more effective mobilisation of community resources and skills
      to complement public resource allocations.

LGI-9(iii) A condominium regime allows effective management and recording urban
property

The Condominium Property Act No. 4 of 2001 was developed to provide for the division of
buildings into units and common property; to provide for individual ownership of those
units by issuance of certificates of title in relation to the units, to provide for ownership of
common property by proprietors of units as tenants in common and to provide for the use
and management of the units and common property.




                                                                                            115
Section 2 of the Condominium Property Act provides for the possibility of a developer
wishing to break down the building into units does prepare a condominium plan and
present it for registration. The registrar upon receipt of the application for registration or a
condominium plan closes part of the register relating to the parcel described in the plan
and opens a separate part for each unit described in the plan and upon payment of the
prescribed fees issue a certificate of title in respect of each unit (Section3).


Part IV of the Act provides for the management and use of the condominium property.
Section 19 provides for the formation of a corporation of persons who own units in the
parcel to which a condominium plan relates. Section 20 details the functions of the
corporation, key among which is to manage the common property that is endorsed on the
plan as such. Common property is defined by the Act as that part of the condominium
property which does not belong to any specific unit and which is used in common by the
owners of the units and includes, without prejudice to the general effect of the foregoing,
the land on which the property is situated, support structures, infrastructure and services
(Section 1).


To fulfil this duty, the corporation may appoint managing agents (Section 28) but must
have annual general meetings of the corporation (Section 27). The Act further provides for
penalties for non-compliance with the rules governing the corporation. This makes the set
structure self regulate due to fear of punitive measures (Section 30).


Panel discussions gave practical examples where this law is being implemented and
working effectively in Kampala City. Titles have been issued for condominium of Bukoto,
Bugolobi, Wandegeya and Buganda road. These have management bodies to oversee the
management and use of the commons. Wandegeya flats in particular is a model
condominium as it greatly improved when the properties were divested under the
condominium law. Bugolobi straggles with the management of the commons. The
differences between the two condominiums lies not in the weaknesses of the legal
framework, but the management of the condominiums and there is a need to study this
further.


PANEL 4: PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT
The LGAF defines public land as land in the custodianship of the state, municipality, or local
authority, as opposed to private land.

Public land in Uganda has evolved with the land question in Uganda, a process which has
always been at the centre of the constitutional and legal discourse. The result is that land

                                                                                            116
issues are mired in a bed of complex constitutional structures and processes, drawing
legitimacy from historical as well as contemporary political exigencies. Today, the mention
of Public land in Uganda is foreign. A brief background to this evolution is herein below.

The 1900 agreement between the Kingdom of Buganda and the British Crown created a
system of land registration for the kings of the main tribes thus Buganda, Tooro and Ankole
to a quantum of known sizes. The rest of the land in Uganda was expressly declared crown
land meaning that the British authorities now held radical title to such land and all land
users became, at the stroke of the pen, tenants of the British crown. Thus being holder of
radical title, the colonial government proceeded to grant a limited number of freehold
estates to selected individuals and corporations. In the second instance by virtue of
political sovereignty, the British authorities asserted the right to control the management
and use of land, a power that was previously vested either in communities or in the
political functionaries of such communities. These changes were accompanied by an
elaborate system of land administration, which included, in the case of Buganda, a system
of land registration purporting to confer indivisible title to the Buganda King, his Princes
and other landlords.

Upon the attainment of independence in 1962, the Government of Uganda retained the
system of land tenure introduced by the colonial government declaring all former crown
lands public land in 1969, with an Act of Parliament, the Public Lands Act to govern its
management. In 1975, however, the Government of President Idi Amin issued ‘The Land
Reform Decree’ which declared all land to be public land and vested the same in the State
to be held in trust for the people of Uganda and to be administered by the Uganda Land
Commission. The decree abolished all freehold interests in land except where these were
vested in the State in which case these were transferred to the Land Commission. It also
abolished the Mailo system of land tenure and converted them into leasehold of 99 years
where these were vested in public bodies, and to 999 years where individuals held these.

The legal implications of the Land Reform Decree, though not fully felt on the ground,
persisted until 1995 when a new Constitution was enacted. That Constitution abolished the
Land Reform Decree and restored the systems of land tenure that were in existence at
independence and included customary tenure as formal tenure in Uganda. These were re-
stated as customary land tenure, freehold tenure, leasehold tenure and Mailo tenure.

The Constitution, however, went further: it made new and radical changes in the
relationships between the State and the land in Uganda. It declared in its Article 237(1)
that land in Uganda would henceforth belong to the citizens of Uganda and vest in them in
accordance with the land tenure systems outlined above. It further stated that all leases
out of former public land could be converted to freeholds and abolished the powers of the
former controlling authorities to administer public land, instead creating a decentralized

                                                                                        117
land management system in which the District Land Board facilitate the registration of land
and own land in a district not owned by anybody. The Uganda Land Commission was
created to manage and administer Government Land. In the language of the 1995
constitution, public land was no more.

The authority to regulate the ownership, administration and use now vests in agencies of
the government, consisting of Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Planning, land boards
in every district, NEMA. Etc. The Constitution also made it clear that District Land Boards
were to operate independently of it (the Constitution?) and would not be subject to the
direction or control of any person or authority. They were, however, expected to be guided
by national policies and regulations set by the central government and district council
policies on land.

The Constitution, thus, reaffirms the sovereign authority of the State to make laws
regulating the use of land. It also enjoined Parliament to enact a specific law regulating the
relationship between occupiers of land held by users under Mailo, freehold or leasehold
land so as to ensure security of occupancy to them and to provide for the acquisition of
registerable interest in land. That obligation was discharged in 1998 through the
enactment of a Land Act which further clarified the content of the various categories of
tenure created by the Constitution, provided for the nature and exercise of the police
power of the state, and set out in detail the powers and functions of land boards and
tribunals.

Implications of the abolition of Public land and how the land policy development
process attempted to address the issue

The National Land Policy Consultative processes generated a common stand throughout
Uganda with regard to the public land/ government land issue. It became apparent that
over the years, the state and local governments have demonstrated systematic
arbitrariness, inefficiency, and lack of transparency in the exercise of these powers, at the
risk of some communities becoming landless and in continuous land conflicts with their
neighbors. The state therefore became both an inefficient land manager and a predator on
land which belongs to ordinary land users. In particular, the constitutional and legal
framework lacked clarity on:

      implications of shifting the radical title to land from the State to the citizens of
       Uganda at large;
      proper role of the central governments and local governments in land use and
       development control ( the police of the State);
      land taxation;
      scope and exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition;


                                                                                          118
          Control and management of public land and government land;
          doctrine of public trusteeship;

LGI-10(i) Criteria for public land ownership are clearly defined and assigned to the
appropriate level of government
The Identification of Public land/government land is not clearly defined. A consultancy was
initiated in 2004 to document or inventory Government land which surfers from no
registration and heavy encroachment. The contract was however not concluded leaving
only 8 districts inventoried. Government divided the country into Seven (7) lots for the
purpose of accessing the workload for developing a government land inventory. The zoning
was based on regional diversity. One typical district was selected from each of the lot to
represent that lot, Kampala district was also included, it being a special case given its small
size and yet having a high concentration of government land parcels.
The Criteria that was proposed and followed for this process was:


                                                                                                                          119
   a) Location: This indicates the Administrative or Local district, county, sub-county,
      Parish and Village(s), in which the given land parcel is located. For each land parcel,
      a representative hand held GPS reading was taken, to enable represent the location
      for each parcel in the form of UTM coordinates, i.e. the metric Easting (E) and
      Northing (N).

   b) Land-Tenure, Survey and Registration Status: The land Tenure for each parcel was
      documented, either to be Mailo, Customary, Freehold or Lease Hold as these are the
      four main Land tenure Regimes, recognised under the Land Act 1998 and the
      Uganda Constitution of 1995.

It was also documented for every parcel inspected whether the land is surveyed or not and
also whether it is registered or not. Where the given parcel was registered the recorded
plot number, Block number, Area size, and sheet number and or road name where
available, were documented. For some of the land parcels that are not surveyed, several
hand held GPS readings were taken along the boundaries of the given land parcel, to enable
a fair estimate of the land size for the un-surveyed land parcel.

For some un-surveyed parcels it was not possible to take the hand held GPS readings mainly
due to hostility from the local communities, as they lacked appreciation of the objectives of
carrying out the field exercise, as some misconstrued it to mean land grabbing!, this
occurrence was more common in Arua district.

c) Land Use: The Designated User government department was documented for each
   inspected land parcel, and the current land use was also recorded, the current land use
   took the form of the actual government activity or activities such as schools, hospitals,
   forests, prisons, Agricultural farm etc on the land, at the time of inspection. The
   predominant government activity on the given land parcel at the time of Inspection
   was taken as the name for that Land Parcel.

d) Levels of Encroachment on the Land, for every Inspected parcel of land, the level of
   encroachment was determined by the approximate size of the area encroached upon as
   a percentage of the overall area of the given land parcel.

   The consultant where possible investigated the circumstances behind the
   encroachment, documenting under what circumstances the encroachment begun,
   gauging the attitudes of the encroachers as regards to vacating the given Government
   land and any steps taken by the User or Designate government Department to end
   /stop encroachment.



                                                                                         120
e) Additional Information documented, for each inspected Land Parcel additional
      information was recorded such as:
      Major features on the land, like Water points, schools, hospitals, hills, wetlands, local
       government offices, Telecommunications masks, Power substations, etc.

      Clear directions to each Inspected Land Parcel from the major Trading Centres, this was in
       form of Surveyors Sketch map and descriptive notes.

      Where available the distance between each Inspected Land parcel and the nearest control
       point and the directions of each control point from major trading centre, (this was in the
       form of the Survey Control Point Location Description Cards).

      Possible unique challenges in the execution of the government land inventory that have had
       a direct bearing on the expected workload, such as insecurity, and poor or difficult Access
       due to a poor road net work were recorded where ever encountered.


This exercise however, led to the recommendation for the improvement of the criteria
based on the following field findings and experiences.

a) Location and Land tenure, survey and registration status, are recommended to be the
   way they are.
b) Land Use is comprehensive enough for government land used ordinarily such as offices,
   schools, hospitals, agricultural farms, etc, but for Government land held in trust such as:
       The Forest Reserves
       The Wild Life Reserves
       The Road Reserves
       The wetlands Reserves,

The issue of encroachment cannot be investigated/documented in the envisaged project
time period, because:

      Most of these reserves are quite large in size, (hundreds of hectares).
      The boundaries defining these Reserves on the ground (forest reserves, wetland reserves)
       are not certain.
      Only very few road reserves have been surveyed and gazetted, hence raising the question
       whether the government has ever actually acquired and owned these Road reserves,
      In a number of Forest Reserves, it would require protracted approach to come up with
       meaningful data concerning encroachment status on these reserves, as it is already known
       that some of these reserves have been heavily encroached on.

c) Estimated Land Value (where deemed necessary)


                                                                                              121
At the time of preparing a government land inventory, it is not critical to determine the
value of the given land parcel, as it is at the stage of policy decisions as regards to land use,
that the value of land is demeaned necessary to be known and particularly so, when
carrying out a cost benefit analysis of any given government land parcel.

Secondly the value of land is always a variable with time, hence a value obtained at the time
of Inspection, may be quite misleading several years after the date and time of inspection
and valuation of any given land parcel. It is therefore our recommendation that this be
deleted from the Field Data Collection Form.

d) Major features on the land, access from the trading centres, and available survey and
   mapping information be maintained on the data collection sheet.

e) Survey Control points nearest to the Land. The cost benefit analysis indicates that it is not
   worth the cost, and hence it should be excluded from the field data collection form.

With the invent of using Global positioning Systems ( GPS) to extend survey control, it is
recommended that at the time of survey an average cost for extending survey control
within a radius of at most fifty kilometres, be included.

It is established that at least in every district there is a known survey control point certified
by the commissioner lands and survey, and that the average radius of any of the eight
sampled districts is about forty (40) Kilometres.

It requires more time to establish the location and status of these survey control points,
than the inspection time for a given land parcel.


LGI-10(ii) There is a complete recording of publicly held land.
The Public/government Land inventory was never completed. The field data collected was
arranged in the agreed format so as to form a Mini Inventory for the Government Land in the
eight sample districts. The min inventory details the location of the land parcels visited,
their status, the designated and current land use and encroachment if any. It should be
noted that these are mini inventories of government land for the sampled eight districts, in
the sense that even though they contain all the required information for any given
government land parcel inspected, not all the identified government land parcels in these
sample districts were inspected. They will become full inventories when all the
government land in these districts has been visited and their data captured and recorded.
Appendix three of this report contains the Mini Inventory for Government Land in the eight
sampled districts of Kampala, Mukono, Pallisa, Nyakapiririt, Kibaale, Mbarara, Kitgum and
Arua.

           Panel discussions revealed that all properties mapped prior to 1986 are the only public properties for which records are

           trace these and ensure management of them is carried out efficiently and effectively.

LGI-10(iii) Information on public land holdings is publicly accessible
The Study on the government Land Inventory (MLHUD 2009) found that many factors
constrain the building of a public land inventory and therefore, hampers the availing of
public information on the same. These constraints include:

   Delay in the flow of information from the ministries to local government leaders and, as a result,
    reception in some districts was characterized by suspicion, apprehension, indifference, resistance
    and the key officials that would have provided the necessary data/information were not available
    at their stations. Some Local Government officials thought that the exercise is intended to identify
    and seize their land.

   Furthermore there was lack of cadastral sheets. Most of the new parcels are falling on areas
    where there are no cadastral sheets constructed. There is need to construct new cadastral sheets
    where they do not exist.

   There is difficulty in determining block boundaries during the plotting by the district
    cartographer.

   There are overlapping surveys in the districts. New surveys are plotting on already surveyed
    plots of land.

   Block and cadastral plot numbers for the areas already covered could not be readily obtained in
    the course of developing the inventory.

   The land users were suspicious about the purpose and motive behind the documentation of
    public land.

   Some districts like Nakapiririt lack Institutional offices and others like Kibaale lack organized
    land records, making it difficult to access the necessary and vital information.

   Because of lack of records, it is not possible to make public information regarding public land.

Panel discussions revealed that there is some information available but this is not easily
accessible by the public because of political reasons and the need to know why the public
would want to have that information. By government practice, information is not easily
accessible and public officers are not willing to provide such information just in case it
creates problems for them leading to loss of employment. Statistics are never available but
rather aggregate values. Most of the available information is still archived in paper form,
however, with the Land Information System, there is no reason why particular information
should not be availed in due course.


LGI-10(iv) Management responsibility for different types of public land is
unambiguously assigned

The findings of an audit carried out by Adam Smith International in 2011 revealed that the
management of public land is ambiguous with no guiding legal framework or guidelines. An
excerpt on this report never made public in the Uganda’s dailies below clearly elaborates the
state of affairs.
Case Study 1: Management of public land in Uganda
The Uganda Land Commission should stop holding and allocating public land because it neither has an
enabling law nor an approved structure, a consultant has recommended.
Uganda Land Commission illegal, says audit report Audit report calls for overhaul of the
underperforming ULC

The Uganda Land Commission should stop holding and allocating public land because it neither has an enabling
law nor an approved structure, a consultant has recommended. The number of commissioners, who have been
costing the taxpayer Shs 8 million per month in sitting allowances, should also be reduced from eight to four.
The commissioners have been working full time, yet the Constitution provides that they should meet at least
once every two months. According to a preliminary report, a copy of which The Observer has seen, the
government needs to amend Article 237 (1) of the Constitution and the Land Act Cap 227 to authorize the state
(the Commission) to exercise power on behalf of Ugandans.
The recommendation is one of several arrived at after a forensic audit of the Mayanja Nkangi-led Commission
that exposed the legal loopholes in this government body that, according to the Constitution, holds and manages
land in Uganda that is vested in or acquired by government in accordance with the law.
The unflattering report, presented to the ministry of Public Service early this month, is to serve as a review for
restructuring of the Commission to address inconsistencies, weaknesses, duplications, overlaps, conflicts,
ambiguities and performance gaps so as to ensure cost effectiveness, affordability and efficiency in service
delivery.
The audit was carried out by an American consortium, Adam Smith International. The report noted, among
other findings, that there are conflicts within the existing public accountability laws. For instance, it was
established that some land under ULC jurisdiction is neither surveyed nor titled, and is either allocated to users
without the knowledge of ULC or simply grabbed and utilized.
This is contrary to the Budget Act, which requires all institutions holding and using public assets to keep them
safely and securely. This particular issue has been the root cause of many conflicts on public land. The report
also shows that government land for sale or allocation is not availed to the public as required by the Public
Procurement and Disposal of Assets Act (PPDA) because the process is done without public advertisement.
The matter was noted by the Auditor General in his management letter to ULC for the 2009/10 financial year, in
which he took the Commission to task for flouting PPDA provisions. There is also lack of a clear distinction
between government land, public land and local government land. “These terms are used interchangeably or
taken to mean the same thing. There is no clear distinction between government land in any existing laws of
Uganda. There is confusion when land is being allocated as to who has the authority or ownership of the land
being allocated,” the report says.
Regarding ULC’s conduct of business, the findings show that there is lack of an effective working and
collaborative relationship between the Commission and other partner institutions like local governments in the
execution of its duties. “This has resulted in double or even triple allocation of the same land to different
developers with different lease titles, thus resulting in costly court cases that take long to resolve,” the report
says.
There is also the case of the Commission allocating land to user institutions without involvement or reference to
District Land Boards in the respective local governments. The Co mmission is further faulted for “misplaced
emphasis and engagement in non-core activities” by, for instance, concentrating more on allocation of land to
individual developers with little regard to purchasing land for current and future use by government, especially
in prime urban areas.“Currently, most government offices are in rented premises, spending staggering sums of


                                                                                                               126
money,” the report says. It adds that in resettling people displaced by natural disasters, the ULC is not only
performing a non-core function, but is also duplicating the responsibilities of the Office of the Prime Minister.
Lack of structures
The report further noted that ULC is too lean to carry out its mandate, has a narrow skill mix and provides for
functions which could be divested to more appropriately skilled institutions, such as banks. The consequences
of this arrangement include limited access to resources, failure to realize its mandate, misallocation and
misappropriation of government/public assets and duplication of roles and responsibilities.
It is, therefore, proposed that ULC’s offices are regionalized, management is separated from the executive
(chairman and commissioners to be part time) and that the Land Fund is relocated and domiciled to a financial
institution with which ULC shall enter a memorandum of understanding.
Lack of funds
While ULC is in custody of a lot of public land, funding from government has been at a minimum, with Shs 7.2
billion of the Shs 8.6 billion allocated to the Commission since 2002 going to land compensation. This has
resulted in failure to pay rates on properties occupied by government around the country (Shs 500 million per
year), failure to acquire appropriate office space and logistics to keep delicate government assets under strong
lock and key.
In order to remove overlaps, gaps and conflicts between ULC and other agencies charged with management of
land-based resources, such as Uganda Properties Holdings Ltd, Uganda Investment Authority, and the National
Forest Authority, among others, there should be a review of the law, the consultant advises.
The other recommendations include: appointment of a Commission lawyer on secondment from the ministry of
Justice and Constitutional Affairs; outsourcing of the services of valuers and surveyors on a case by case need
basis rather than providing for them on ULC’s establishment and payroll, as well as the services of a physical
planner.

LGI-10(v) Responsible public institutions have sufficient resources to fulfil their land
management responsibilities
In Uganda, where the land market is only beginning to develop and where the surveying, land
management and real estate professions are not well established, the absence of reliable land
information makes land transactions difficult, risky and prone to principal agent problems.
The current state of affairs is partly due to a long history of underfunding public agencies
responsible for land administration and the production of land information. This has
significantly contributed to the creation of an unregulated land market environment that
allows graft and opportunistic brokers to operate with impunity.


Support for public officials whose role in execution of the activity is considered
indispensable, especially if mandated by law has to be considered to ensure capacity
limitations do not become an insurmountable bottleneck for the fulfillment of their
mandates. The nature of the public-private interface mandated by existing laws for executing
any land demarcation and registration exercise are not clearly defined and resources for
ensuring adequate capacity do not exist to enable completion of the activities. These have to

under the law.

Provision of human, technical, material and financial support to District land officers to help
overcome the constraining capacity deficits for supporting such project activities: (i) the
dedicated amount of time, (ii) the backlog of normal office work created as a result of the
demands of inventorying public/government land, (iii) the abnormal volume of additional
work generated (computing, plotting and preparation of deed plans) during the period
required for such project activities.

A similar arrangement to provide extra support to facilitating the processing of the bulk of
work required to be processed in the surveys and mapping department, Entebbe, and less so
for the land administration and final registration stages is required in order to avoid
inordinate delays in execution of tasks.

Because of inadequate resourcing of these institutions leads intermediaries such as banks
and mortgage finance institutions, real estate agents, land developers, solicitors and other
land related businesses who are expected to play an important role by facilitating all manner
of land transactions are forced to assume higher levels of risk that ultimately undermine
their competitiveness. These specialized intermediaries form a conduit through which the
land information gap between public sector land administration institutions and land owners
and private sector participants in the land market can be resolved. However, in spite of these
observations, how to improve access and delivery of land services in a manner that is
inclusive and improves the overall efficiency of the land market remains elusive (Ahene
2012).
In practice however, panellists revealed that there is often a clash between technical
interests to protect and manage the public resources and the political interests that override
technical interests. An example was given of the Uganda wildlife Authority which can no
longer enforce the conservation of breeding grounds for the wild animals in the Marchison
Falls National Park due to the granting of the construction of a road to service the oil
exploration inside of the National Park.

Furthermore, for Public institutions that have commitment to the management of public
resources, the financial resources allocated to them is very limited, reducing the
management capacity that could have otherwise been employed.

LGI-10(vi) All essential information on public land allocations to private interests is
publicly accessible.




                                                                                           128
The computerization of the land registry has only been made complete this year and the LIS
system displayed for the first time to the public on 28th November 2013. Prior to this, records
in the land registry were manually managed and in very poor state. As a result, service
delivery was very slow and cumbersome, and title searches and/or verification of claims is
frustrating. The process was prone to mistakes and occurrences of fraud, which makes land
assets unreliable and risky as collateral security for loans. The Land Registration business
process fails to provide clear and reliable information to the public. It is therefore impossible
currently to know how much public land is allocated to neither private interests nor the
processes such allocations take. The Uganda Land commission itself does not have
information regarding public and government land.
Panel discussions highlights that for whatever information is collected a decision has to be
made as to which information can be made accessible. Private people are given leases and all
this information is available in the national land registry and the Uganda land commission.
The moment the procedure gets more stringent and constraining on the technical staff, the
more accessibility of the information becomes difficult.


Examples were given of the Uganda Land Commission’s (ULC) efforts to ensure that
transactions over divestiture of public lands belonging to Uganda Television Corporation and
Shimoni Schools within the city follow proper procedures. This was not possible due to
political pressures and influence. The public therefore knows that the land was divested at
giveaway prices but do not know the challenges that technical departments face when
situations like these arise.

The media plays a major role in providing information to the public but sometimes it is not
possible to divulge information that would otherwise be public due to the existing vested
interests. A case in point was when the Sunrise news paper sought information on
divestiture of the Naguru estate. No officer was committal on divulging this information due
to fear of repercussions. Resultantly, the media instituted a legal case in court, which mater is
ongoing making it sub-judice. Despite this, the media has not got the information to date.

LGI-11(i) There is minimal transfer of public land to private interests
Expropriations of public land in Uganda’s have not been for public interests. They have
mainly been for private interests. Over the past ten years particularly, key public lands have
either been divested or faced threat of divestiture. There are no guidelines or criteria guiding
the expropriation of public land. It is quite clear that more and more public land is being
divested for private benefit and not public interest. A few Examples of public land
expropriations are:

Case 2: Discussions to give away 7,100 Ha of Mabira to Metha Group for Sugar cane growing looming
since 2007
President Museveni may have inadvertently re-opened the controversies surrounding his push to favour
developers over the environment and other community concerns. During the opening of the NRM caucus in
Kyankwanzi on Saturday, the President blamed the failure to get Amuru Sugar Factory started and his wish to
give-away part of Mabira Forest for sugarcane growing on Members of Parliament.
“The other obstacle that has obstructed development is the interference by the political class. What do we do
with Lugazi industrial city? I can’t go on begging as if you are doing anything for me,” Mr Museveni said.
He added: “How can you block the development of Amuru sugar factory? Now these investors are about to go
away and you are surrounded by others who need these factories and so what are you going to do? Import
sugar and [what if] it is blocked by MPs?”
Resisting plans
Some Acholi leaders have resisted Mr Museveni’s suggestion to give away their land for establishment of a
sugar enterprise. They say they were not consulted and that the land is communally owned, making it hard to
be given away.
Opponents to the Mabira project, meanwhile, observe that the central forest reserve is home to 300 bird species
and is a key part of the country’s eco-system.
The President wants 7,100 hectares of the forest to be parcelled out to the Sugar Corporation of Uganda
Limited, a Lugazi-based company owned by Mehta Group. However, legislators and environmentalists have
warned the Mehta group to stay away from the forest, saying “Ugandans can survive without sugar but they
can’t survive without oxygen or a green environment.”
In 2007, the Mabira give-away stirred up tensions, with furious protestors attacking people of Asian origin
because they shared a race with Mehta.

Case 3: Lack of Transparency in Expropriation of Public Land
One of the aspects of governance where the NRM government has acquitted itself most poorly is public land
management and disposal. A lot of public land has been given away to private individuals; some indigenous,
some foreign, under mysterious circumstances.

Last week, it was Kololo Secondary School in Kampala which woke up to the realization that part of its sports
playground had been fenced off. No prizes for guessing; it was ‘sold’ to an investor. Yet the Kololo Secondary
School playground is only the latest on the ever-growing list of public lands that have been given away under
unclear circumstances.

Among these are some prominent ones that Ugandans will probably never forget. Sometime back, part of
Butabika Hospital land in Luzira was shared amongst some well connected individuals. The country’s only
mental referral hospital had plans for expansion, but this didn’t stop the Uganda Land Commission from dishing
the plots out. No major reason was given for the change of land use, and the criteria for picking the beneficiaries
were not revealed either.


                                                                                                               130
Then there were the Shimoni institutions in the city centre, which were hurriedly destroyed so as to have a five-
star hotel in their place in 2005. Five years later, there is n o hotel and Ugandans don’t even know who owns
that prime piece of land right now!

A chunk of Kitante Primary School land was also fenced off some time back. It is not clear what became of the
plans to ‘develop it.’

The authorities often arrogantly cite ‘investment’ to explain away these land giveaways. They forget that most
Ugandans would actually like to see more investors coming to help develop our country.

But that shouldn’t be used as an excuse to treat public property as if it were private. Ugandans ha ve the right to
know why their land is being disposed of, and how.

All we are demanding is transparency. Let the Uganda Land Commission first of all justify why a particular piece
of land has to be given away, and then publicise it so that those interested can bid.

Why should public land transactions be conducted under the table?

disposing-of-public-land




Case Study 4: Members of Parliament appalled by lack of acquisition procedures
of Kampala, that there is no set procedure for the giveaway of public land in the capital city. The MPs have
vowed to investigate Kampala City Council (KCC) and rid it of officials who are behind a long list of shady
business and administrative practices.
Kijjambu, who appeared before the committee yesterday, failed to explain how Kampala City Council (KCC) has
managed to distribute prime plots of land in Kampala without established procedure. She admitted that a
precedent had been set in which individuals would approach KCC with a specific plot of land and proposed
developments that would be approved by the Council
The MPs were angered that Kijjambu could not explain the ownership of Valley View Estates, the company that
was granted a lease to construct apartment blocks at the Lugogo sports ground. She had no information on the
management, the location or the experience of Valley View Estates and asked for time to investigate the
company.
Elias Lukwago, MP for Kampala Central, says he and other committee members were appalled by the revelation.
He says the land giveaways by KCC defy all set regulations for the development of Kampala City.
“I was terribly shocked!” Lukwago says KCC acted illegally by failing to carry out a due diligence study of Valley
View Estates to establish its propriety before leasing to it a prime plot of land. He says KCC has no capacity to
approve developments of the nature proposed by Valley View Estates.
The Mayor of Kampala, Nasser Ntege Ssebagala, defends Valley View Estates. He says it is a U.S.-based company
with the relevant experience to develop Lugogo sports ground.

Panel discussions revealed that actually almost all the divestiture that has happened in the
recent past has been for private purposes and none going to public use. Apart from roads, no
other public purpose has benefited from divestiture.

Although there are laws in place, there is need to develop guidelines to guide divestiture.
There is further a need to differentiate between government land and public land because
the two serve different purposes. In Uganda there is an assumption among policy makers
                                                                                                              131
that public land constitutes government land and therefore it can be made applicable to
private use as Government is a legal person that can do business.

LGI-11( ii)Acquired land is transferred to destined use in a timely manner
It takes an average of 47 days to get the acquired land transferred to its destined use. This if
compared to the OECD average which is 24.1 days may seem like a delay. However, the
provision of this service has greatly improved over the last three years because of the
computerization of the Land Registry. The sub-Saharan Africa Average is 58.9. Uganda has
gone up two placed in the doing business ranking by the World Bank from 128 in 2013 to
126 in 2014 (World Bank 2014). It is the only improvement Uganda registered in the Ease of
Doing Business Index 2014.



LGI-11(iii) Threat of public land acquisition does not lead to pre-emptive behaviour by
private parties
Although there are no reports to this effect, the Experts on this panel have had hands-on
experience and conclude that pre-emptive action is a lot.

Examples were given from the panel discussions of incidences of pre-emptive actions in light
of compensation. The Southern By-pass is a new project of infrastructural development in
Kampala City. Some of the parcel owners within the area of interest for compensation
undertook shoddy construction works faking grave yards or long term occupation of
structures so as to be compensated more. Some of the infrastructure development projects
that have grossly suffered from pre-emptive action are the Bujagaali power dam project
which was shut down momentarily due to the negative impacts of pre-emptive action. Nile
power, the company had to pay compensation to the communities forcing it to shut down its
operations. Mubende-Mityana road faced the same challenge and this stalled the road
construction completion. Currently, the Albertine region is faced with the same challenges,
mainly fuelled by speculators.

compensation claims are represented in the table below:

Calculation of the compensation rates does not have a clear and transparent procedure. The lack of
transparency raises challenges with the acceptance of the rates. Severally districts for example have
stated in meetings with activists that the rates are handed down to them by the chief Government
valuer. The chief government Valuer on the other hand claims the rates are set by the Districts. The
reality is that 95% of the districts in Uganda do not employ valuers. How then can they generate
district compensation rates?

Although customary tenure is a creation of statute, valuation methodologies currently applied do not
recognize the value of customary land. The owners of such land have only been compensated for the
improvements and developments on the land which is unconstitutional. This injustice has led for the
                                                                                                                       133
public outcry and campaigns that there be a Government program to issue certificates of title to the
land owners of customary land if that will give justice. People have incurred inconceivable losses
through the compensation for appropriation of land.

Rates for crops are determined on a net or an expected one season output. Where time allows, a
claimant should be given an opportunity to harvest crops that are due for harvesting. The “one
season” principle has caused financial loss to farmers of perennial crops and fruit trees where the life
of the crop is not factored into the compensation process.

It can be concluded that the valuation for compensation methods applied in Uganda are in
contravention to the constitutional provisions enshrined in article 26 (2) of fair and adequate
compensation.

Panellists affirmed that when a land owner has a certificate of title, he/she has better
bargaining power in the face of compensation. Compensation is paid for some unregistered
rights such as access to tree and forest products while other rights are never compensated
such as common lands. The reason often raised in this regard is the failure to identify the
person to be compensated or what form collective compensation should take.

Where communities are informed and are consulted they have negotiated for community
benefits in the form of reparations. Such as in the Albertine region some communities have
negotiated for boreholes and schools as compensation.

IIs then the recent past, compensation has taken different forms especially in light of the fact
that monetary compensation often does not restore the person to the same status s/he was
in before the taking of his/her property. In projects such as the Bujagaali project, some
people negotiated for alternative pieces of land with housing structure instead of monetary
compensation. In Buliisa where oil exploration is on-going, Total did not want to give the
government money to compensate the people affected. Instead, Total wanted to get a
reputable institution to pay and this payment regarded as a cost to the government. Whereas
this was a good ploy as the people would get adequate compensation through the process,
the government felt very vulnerable and not supportive of the idea.

There are concerns about the valuers. Ugandan valuation law is very porous as it gives the
valuer the premise to use his own sense of judgement and in instances where the
communities are not in position to bargain properly, especially in cases of collective rights,
lots of losses are realized by the communities.


LGI-12(ii) Land use change resulting in selective loss of rights is compensated for.
Uganda is experiencing an unprecedented growth of the extractive industry that is causing
excitement bringing opportunity and growth to the mineral and oil and gas rich areas. The
development and exploitation of natural resources requires extensive land holdings.
Associated infrastructure to service, supply and support the development of energy
resources further increases the requirement for land. Mining and Energy project proponents
require prudent commercially based arrangements with landholders that comply with and
recognise the statutory provisions relating to land resumption within specific fields.
                                                                                                    134
Landholders in these regions are subjected to increasing interest and activity by mining and
energy developers in their land impacting on rural enterprise. This is the biggest land use
change area in which compensation challenges have been brought to the spotlight.
A recent acquisition has been in Kabale Parish – Buseruka Sub –county Hoima district in
Western Uganda, along the Albertine Graben, a sub county surviving on subsistence
agriculture and pastoralism. Approximately 32Sq KM were acquired for Uganda’s oil refinery.
Through this process, 13 villages were affected with a total of 7000 people displaced by this
process. There were only 10 people with land titles. If the valuation methodology above was
applied, and which it was, only these 10 people were compensated for the value of land
because they were the registered owners. The rest were compensated for developments on
the land as if they were licensees. This has created tensions with the government and oil
companies as disgruntlement increases. To compound the poor compensation rates, the
compensation has not been paid in time. To date, approximately 2000 people are camping at
the sub-county due to lack of alternatives. Case Study 1 below elaborates this further.
Whereas these developments are happening, the valuation methods have not changed with
the times. Valuation principles applied currently are those intended to serve the real estate
market where the traditional methods of valuation apply. When appraising real estate, the
valuer considers two separate entities: land, which is the non-wasting portion of the real
estate; and improvements, which are the wasting portion subject to various forms of
depreciation. Land and improvements are frequently valued separately so that the trends
and factors affecting each can be studied. However, the final analysis for an improved
property must be as a unit.
The first step in this kind of land valuation is identifying the property. The valuer must know
the size and location of the subject parcel. Once the land has been properly identified and
described, an analysis of the subject can be made. The analysis should include the collection
of site-specific data, a study of trends and factors influencing the value, and the physical
measurement of the site. The term site means more than just “land”. A site is a parcel of land
that has been made ready to use for some intended purpose.
Once the subject is analyzed, the assessor must classify the land. Land may be classified as
residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural depending on its primary use. Zoning can
be important in determining land classification because zoning ordinances often prescribe
exactly what uses are permitted for the property.

Land, in a general sense, can be unimproved (raw) or improved (ready for development).
Land that is undeveloped or in agricultural use is considered unimproved. Land that has been
developed to the extent that it is ready to be built upon is considered a site. A site analysis
requires the collection and analysis of information about trends and factors affecting value.
The appropriate unit of comparison is typically determined by the marketplace as sites are
bought and sold. There are six acceptable methods of establishing unit land values.
1. Sales Comparison Method
2. Allocation Method
3. Abstraction Method (Also known as extraction or land residual technique.)
                                                                                           135
4. Capitalization of Ground Rent
5. Land Residual Capitalization
6. Land Build-up Method

The law governing compulsory acquisition does not consider land for investment as one of
those grounds that would warrant the taking of land. The constitution further provides that
where minerals are found under somebody’s land, there shall be benefit sharing between the
land owner, the local government and the Central government. This would therefore mean
that there is no taking of land but rather compensation for surface rights and the deprivation
of the use of the said land. The surface rights to land are privately owned in Uganda save
where they fall under the ambit of trust property vested in the state. This is significant,
considering the fact that the Constitution vests land in the citizens of Uganda. These surface
rights include farming rights, right to build, right to possess and enjoyment of economic
trees, both natural and artificial, right to alienate, etc. Compulsory acquisition for exploration
and extraction of mineral wealth and oil and gas is not constitutionally provided for. It means
that whereas the minerals, oil and gas would vest in the state or government respectively, the
ownership of land is not tampered with. The State therefore, can compensate the land owner
for surface rights which would comprise the development on the land but not for the land
value and for deprivation of use for the duration of the taking. Deprivation of the use of land
or a particular use of the natural surface of the land for the purposes of this discussion refers
to the prevention or denial of economic and beneficial use of land or restriction of use rights.
The deprivation can be either total or partial, depending on the scale of the curtailment.
There is total deprivation when all the use rights of land of an owner or lawful occupier are
affected, and partial deprivation is the curtailment of a particular use right or part of the
land.

A case Study 5: Compensation for land use change
More than 7,000 people displaced by the construction of the oil refinery in Kabale Parish in Buseruka Sub-
county, Hoima District have rejected the government’s valuation price for their land. They say the government
undervalued their land and the properties thereon and vowed not to leave unless they are paid the appropriate
price for their property.
Kabale Parish in the Albertine oil belt, comprises 13 villages. The government commissioned a Swiss firm,
Foster Wheeler, to carry out a study to establish a suitable place for constructing the refinery, which is expected
to cost at least $2b (Shs5.2 trillion). The firm recommended Kabale Parish as the most ideal site.
The government started the process of resettling and compensating the affected residents by paying them cash
or relocating them to an alternative land.
One of the affected residents, Mr David Besigye, 80, from Kyaplalonyi Village, said the government undervalued
their properties. “They are forcing us to give them the land and they can’t even allow us to bargain on how much
we want to be paid,” Mr Besigye said. The residents accuse the government of hatching a plan to underpay them.
Residents in various villages said suspected security and State agents had been threatening land owners to take
what the government has offered them and leave the area.
Several residents said the government did not consult them to discuss the valuation of their property. They said
the government consulted the district administration to decide the amount for each resident instead of
discussing with the land owners.



                                                                                                               136
Government then hired a consultancy firm, Strategic Friends International (SFI) to conduct the Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP) to guide the compensation process based on the prevailing market rate. In its report, SFI said
7,118 people and 221 households would be affected by the refinery project.
Refinery Project Communications Officer Bashir Hangi, said: “All valuations for property were set at the district
headquarters, but were approved by a chief government valuer. All preliminary outcomes from the components
of the RAP study were shared with the affected persons.”
The SFI has been re-contracted by the government to implement its recommendations. This has sparked off
suspicion of foul play. “If SFI erred in conducting the initial survey, it’s likely to err adversely during the
implementation stage,” said MP Theodore Ssekikubo, chairman of the par liamentary Forum on Oil and Gas
recently.

The affected communities have branded the exercise a “rip-off”. While a plot of land around Hoima Town is
valued at between Shs3m to Shs5m, residents have been either paid the same, less or more depending on the
developments on the said land. All valuations were approved by the district chief valuer. “What is even worse is
that the rates are based on the 2011/2012 financial year yet we are a year ahead,” said Mr Ezekiel Kabanda, a
resident.



Some of the displayed compensation rates, value an acre of banana plantation at between Shs350,000 and
Shs1.4m; an acre of maize between Shs330,000 and Shs1.2m and a coffee garden between Shs300,000 and
Shs2m. “If they don’t give our people enough compensation money we will mobilise them against the project,”
Mr Banarbas Tinkasiimire, (MP for Buyaga County in Bunyoro) warned during a recent meeting with the
affected people.

Failure of valuation to make this distinction has led to multiple grievances that may escalate
into conflict, a situation that can be averted by embracing valuation approaches
accommodative of the interest of the land owners. While communities affected by mining
and oil exploration activities hold companies responsible for a series of social, economic and
environmental changes, the lack of action by government agencies result in a surrogate
government capacity. Community consultation and appropriate compensation packages,
among others, can help prevent or effectively resolve land use conflicts in mining areas.
Though there are various forms of compensation for land taken, the determination of the
amount of compensation in monetary terms is by the process of valuation in which values
are not created, but arrived at through the application of relevant economic and legal
principles.
Compensation has neither been fair, nor prompt in the case of land use change. The ruling of
the High court Judge below demonstrates that Government overlooks its roles and
responsibility in the course of compulsory land acquisition
Case study 6: Sheema Cooperative Ranching Society & 31 Others Vs. The Attorney
General, HIGH COURT CIVIL SUIT NO.103 OF 2010
The Plaintiffs jointly and severally filed this suit against the Attorney General in his representative capacity as a
Statutory Defendant for allegedly illegal actions of the officials of Government of Uganda against them when
they allegedly grabbed their land and illegally and unilaterally parceled them out to other people without fair,
adequate and prompt compensation.

The Plaintiffs in their amended plaint sought for:-




                                                                                                                 137
(i)     A declaration that they are entitled to a fair, timely and adequate compensation for their respective
        tracts of land that was trespassed upon and permanently alienated from them by officials of
        Government of Uganda.
(ii)    A declaration that the valuers in the Valuation Report commissioned by the Chief Government Valuer
        as a basis for their compensation are neither fair nor adequate as basis for compensation.
(iii)   An order that compensation should be based on the more up to date Valuation Report commissioned
        by themselves.
(iv)    In the Alternative but without prejudice, that interest at commercial rate be awarded to them from the
        date of trespass to their land to the date of judgment.
(v)     An order that general damages for trespass and inordinate delay of compensation be paid to the
        Plaintiffs.
(vi)    Costs of the suit.

Justice Opio Aweri ruled as follows:
Issue No. I: Whether or not the taking over of the Plaintiffs’ land was lawful.

It is trite law that compulsory acquisition of land is a prerogative of the state. Elements of Land Law by Gray
and Gray 5th Edition puts this beyond doubt at page 1387:

“…. deeply embedded in the phenomenology of property is the idea that proprietary ri ghts cannot be removed
except “for cause”. The essence of “property” involves some kind of claim that a valued asset is “proper” to one; and
the “propertiness” of property depends, at least in part, on a legally protected immunity from summary
cancellation or involuntary removal of the rights concerned. Yet it is also quite clear that the modern state
reserves the power, in the name of all citizens, to call on the individual, in extreme circumstances and in return for
just compensation, to yield up some private good for the greater good of the whole community.

…. The exercise of powers of compulsory purchase for supervening community purposes constitutes, without doubt,
the most far reaching form of social intervention in the property relations of individual citizens. The public power
to requisition land – or the power of “eminent domain” as it is sometimes known, has been aptly described as “the
proprietary aspect of sovereignty”

The above principles are enshrined in the Constitution of Uganda and the Land Act.

Article 26(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda states:
“No persons shall be compulsorily deprived of property except where the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) Where the taking of possession or acquisition is necessary for
 public interest
 in the interest of the defence
 public safety
 public health
(b) Where the compulsory taking of possession or acquisition of property is made under a law which makes
    provision for
 Prompt payment of fair and adequate compensation prior to the taking of possession.
 A right of access to a Court of law by any person who has an interest or right over the property.”

Article 237 of the Constitution Government can only take over someone’s land if it is in the interest of the
public. In Bhatt & Another v Habib Rajani [1958] EA public interest was defined to mean the same purpose
or objective in which the general interest of the community as opposed to the popular interest of individuals is
directly and virtually concerned.

Thus Article 26 and 273 of the Constitution only allows Government to use its coercive power to force a
transfer in public interest and upon fair and prompt and adequate compensation. Thus in UEB v Launde
Stephen Sanya CACA No.1 of 2000, UEB which was a Government Corporation entered on land, destroyed
trees, crops and building materials and placed thereon survey marks and high voltage power lines thereon
                                                                                                                 138
without the consent of the land owners. Twinomujuni JA held the UEB could not just enter on anybody’s land
without first acquiring it and paying compensation thereby contravening Article 26(1) (2) and Article 237 of
the Constitution. The Court further held that UEB should have first notified the persons affected before taking
over the land which they did not do.

In the instant case the evidence on record clearly shows that the Plaintiffs’ Ranches were compulsorily acquired
following a Government policy to restructure ranches in the Government sponsored Ranching Schemes in
Ankole, Masaka, Singo, Buruli and Masindi for the purpose of resettling the landless people as indicated in the
General Notice contained in the Uganda Gazette of 12th October, 1990.

According to the establishing of the Ranches Restructuring Board Notice, 1990, Section 4(1) thereof, the
functions of the Board were to implement the Resolution of the National Resistance Council of the 24 th August
1990 in relation to Government allocation of Ranches in Ankole, Masaka, Singo, Buruli and Masindi with a view
of facilitating the following:-

(a) The revocation by the Government of leases of those ranches which have not been developed by the lessees
    in accordance with the prescribed terms and conditions of allocation;
(b) The restructuring and sub-division of existing ranches into appropriate units and;
(c) The orderly and harmonious re-settlement of squatters within the areas covered by the ranches.

On the face of the above objectives, it would be correct to say that the policy of the Government was lawful
because it was an issue of public interest. However the law requires that certain procedures ought to be
followed before compulsory acquisition can be lawful.

In the instant case, it was the contention of the Plaintiffs that before Government came out with the policy,
Government had already allowed squatters to settle on parts of their ranches with their cattle. Government
inspired the encroachers and even protected them from being evicted by the Plaintiffs. In a nutshell,
Government did not follow procedure of acquisition of the suit land. Such a procedure is regulated by the Land
Acquisition Act Cap 226.

Under Section 3(1) of the Act when the Minister is satisfied that any land is required by Government for a
public purpose, he is required to make a declaration to that effect by statutory instrument.

Pursuant to Section 3 (3) the Minister should then cause a copy of the declaration served on the registered
proprietor of the land specified in the declaration or the occupier or controlling authority.

Section 4 requires the land to be marked out by an assessment officer and measured and a plan of the land be
made if the plan of the land has not already been made.

Section 5 requires persons having an interest in the land to be given notice. The section requires the
Assessment Officer to publish the notice in the Gazette and exhibit it at convenient places on or near the land
stating that the Government intends to take possession of the land and that claims to compensation for all
interest in the land be made to him or her.

As per Section 6, the Assessment Officer upon publication of the notice then proceeds to hold an inquiry into
claims and rejections made in respect of the land and then make an award specifying the true area of the land
and compensation to be allowed for the land.

The Assessment Officer should then serve a copy of the award on the Minister and on those persons having an
interest in the land and the Government then pays and compensate in accordance with the award (Section 6
(4)).




                                                                                                            139
Under Section 7 the Assessment Officer shall take possession as soon as he has made the award. However the
officer may take possession at any time after the publication of the declaration if the Minister certifies that it is
in the public interest for him to do so.

In the instant case, the circumstances under which the Plaintiffs ’ land was taken was not in conformity with the
provisions of the Act and the Constitution. The instrument creating the Ranch Restructuring Board published in
the Gazette in September 1990 was published after the land had already been invaded. Even the Gazette did not
amount to a Statutory instrument as envisaged in Section 3 of the Act. The Gazette was actually dealing with
the after effects of the invasion as if to legalise the otherwise illegal occupation that had already been
perpetuated by government agents. In KULDIP KRATAURA v The Law Development Centre {1978} HCB
296, the Plaintiff in that case was a registered proprietor of land with a house therein. She let it out on rent to
the Defendant, in 1974 who paid rent up to February, 1976 and thereafter failed to pay and vacate the premises.
The Plaintiff brought this action for recovery of arrears of rent for mesne profits from November, 1976 till
delivery of possession, and the delivery of the premises.

The Defendant admitted that the suit property were let out to them for rent but stated that the agreement for
rent had come to an end when the Defendant notified compulsory acquisition of the property under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1965 by Statutory Instrument No. 2 of 1927 that for a public purpose and that the
instrument was deemed to have come into effect from 1 st April. 1973. Akhun J, J. held inter alia that under
Land Acquisition Act 1965, there was no power given to the Minister to make a declaration that any land is
required by Government for public purpose with retrospective effect. Therefore the said Statutory Instrument
was ultravires of the power of the Minister and was illegal.

As properly contended by the learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs, the Statutory Instrument which was made after
the invasion of the squatters was a mere mask to cloth the compulsory acquisition with legality. Otherwise
what transpired between 1998 and 1990 was utter arbitrary, ruthless, violent and abusive affront to the
Plaintiffs’ right to property as envisaged under the Constitution.

Furthermore, the process of compensation was also not transparent as provided by the Act. The persons
affected did not know what was taking place. They were not approached to air their stand and the award given
for compensation was not disclosed. Generally the process was a mere junk without following the clear
provisions of the Act and the Constitution.

In view of the above circumstances, I find that the taking of the Plaintiffs’ land by the Defendant was unlawful
although the Defendant had a noble objective to resettle the landless.

Issue No. 2: Whether or not the compensation offered by the Government pursuant to the Valuation
Report of August 2005 was adequate or whether the Plaintiffs’ are entitled to compensation on the basis
of their own Valuation Report.

Under Article 26 (2) (b) of the Constitution, compulsory acquisition of property can only be made under a law
which makes provision for prompt payment of fair and adequate compensation prior to the taking of
possession.

Upon restricting the Ranches, Government of Uganda committed itself to compensating the affected Ranchers
who had been allocated Government Ranches. The valuation exercise carried out by RESCO indicated that the
basis of the valuation for compensation was the market value.

In Buran Chandmary vs The Collector under the Indian Land Acquisition Act (1894) 1957 EACA 125 it
was held that the market value of land is the basis on which compensation must be assessed and the market
value of land as the basis on which compensation must be based is the price at which a willing vendor might be
expected to obtain from a willing purchaser. A willing purchaser is one who although may be a speculator is not
a wild or unreasonable speculator.


                                                                                                                140
I have noted the factors upon which the assessment of the market value were based. However, the said
assessments were made in 2005 while payments commenced in 2009. According to the Constitution
compensation must be fair adequate and paid promptly. It was admitted by Dw2 Solomon Balinda Birungi
that the valuation which he made in 2005 did not reflect the market value of 2010. It therefore becomes clear
that compensation which the Plaintiffs allegedly received in the year 2009 – 2010 did not reflect the market
value of the land, hence it was neither fair, adequate nor prompt.

Furthermore, the award did not consider disturbance allowance. The Plaintiffs testified that they were settled
on the Ranches where they were rearing cattle and goats. Some of them had added their developments on the
Ranches. They were accordingly entitled to disturbance allowance as they moved to leave the restructured
area. The Defendant contended that disturbance allowance was in built in the values awarded to the Plaintiffs
and they put it at 30% in their Report. Upon perusal of the Report I fail to see what percentage was inbuilt in
the awards. It should have been indicated that Amount awarded was x plus disturbance allowance of 30% to
total amount XY. That was not shown and I think that was a professional oversight by the Defendant in failing
to award the Plaintiffs disturbance allowance of 30%.

Another area of discontent was that the Defendant did not award the Plaintiff injurious affection. Injurious
affection is defined by Megarry’s Manual of Real Property 6th Edition as injury to other land caused by the
acquisition.

The Defendant argued that they did not consider injurious affection because it only applies when the land left is
too small to carry out the intended development. They contended that the land left after restructuring was
adequate for ranching. A sample look at the RESCO Report shows the original area of the land, land lost to
Government and land retained by the Ranchers:
(a) Ranch No. 1
      - Original area              -      1406 hectares
      - Land lost                  -                321 hectares
      - Land retained              -      1305 hectares
(b) Ranch No. 7
    - Original area                -      1688 hectares.
    - Land lost                    -               912 hectares.
    - Land retained                -        776 hectares.
The above clearly shows that the Ranchers/Plaintiffs retained sizeable chunks of their land which could still
sustain ranching activities hence there was no need for them to be awarded injurious affection.

In conclusion, I find that the compensation award offered by Government pursuant to the Valuation Report of
August 2005 was outdated and insufficient and inadequate since it was not based on the open market value and
disturbance allowances were never considered.

Whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to compensation award on the basis of their own Valuation Report:
The Plaintiffs engaged a one Dr. Ojomoko Pw2 who carried valuation of their ranches to determine the market
value of their ranches. However, the professional competency of Dr. Ojomoko was put in contempt by the
Defendant who argued that the said valuation surveyor was not a registered valuation surveyor. According to
Surveyors Registration Act every recognized surveyor must have a Practicing Certificate after registration
under Section 19 of the Act. The above section provides that no person shall engage in or carry out the
practice of surveying unless he or she is a holder of a valid Practicing Certificate granted to him or her.

The evidence that Dr. Ojomoko was not a registered surveyor and did not possess a Practicing Certificate was
not challenged. It therefore follows that without valid Practicing Certificate Dr. Ojomoko Pw2 could not carry
out the practice of surveying. Therefore whatever he purported to do in the form of valuation surveying of the
Plaintiffs’ ranches were illegal and contrary to the mandatory provisions of Section 19 of the above Act. As
rightly stated in Makula International v Cardinal Nsubuga & Another [1982] HCB 11 Court cannot sanction
what is illegal and illegality once brought to the attention of Court overrides all questions of pleading, including
admissions made thereon.

                                                                                                               141
In conclusion the law is that all surveyors whether working with Government or in private organizations must
register and be in possession of Practicing Certificate. Since the Plaintiffs’ valuation was surveyed by a person
not recognized by the Board of Surveyors according to the Surveyors Registration Act, that valuation could not
be a basis for the Plaintiffs’ compensation.

Issue No.3: Remedies available:

(a) Market value:
In view of my conclusions on the issues above, it is just and fair that a fresh revaluation of the Plaintiffs ranches
be done by an independent valuer chosen by Court (Registrar) whose work shall be confirmed by the Chief
Government Valuer. The value arrived at shall be less the amount which the Defendant had deposited in the
Plaintiffs’ accounts. The market value should be that of 2010.

(b) General Damages:
From the facts and circumstances of this case, it must be appreciated that the action taken by government was
to resettle the landless cattle keepers who were forced by circumstances to invade the Ranches and also to
streamline the activities of the Ranchers according to the covenants in the tenancy. Therefore in a way, the
restructuring was for the benefits of all the stakeholders and once prompt, fair and adequate compensation is
paid, it would not be necessary to award general damages. The spirit in the claims of the Plaintiffs and evidence
leans more on the inadequacy of the compensation award and not the injuries suffered. Once Government
committed itself to paying compensation my view is that this Court should ensure that the process is reopened
and harmonised to enable proper market value to be determined. It is also my view that the circumstances
under which Court awarded general damages in Rwanyarare v Attorney General, HCCS No. 95 of 2001 and
Byanyima v Attorney General HCCS No. 359 of 1996 were different. In the above cases the Plaintiffs proved
that the acts of the Government agents clearly called for award of general damages because of the injuries and
loss they suffered and they did not opt to be compensated.

It is therefore my conclusion that once the Defendant is made to comply with the law in regard to compulsory
requisition, there would be no need for the award of damages since the Plaintiffs would be entitled to get the
market value of the property they lost including disturbance allowance.

(c) Costs:
The Plaintiff is entitled to the cost of this suit and interest on the costs at Court rate until its payment is made.
In conclusion, judgment is entered for the Plaintiffs with costs in the following terms:

(a) A declaration that the Plaintiffs are entitled to a fair, timely and adequate compensation for the land
    alienated by Government.
(b) Valuation Report commissioned by the Chief Government Valuer as a basis for compensation was neither
    fair nor adequate as a basis for compensation of the Plaintiffs.
(c) An independent valuer appointed by Court (Registrar) be commissioned to carry out fresh valuation to
    determine the market value of the property as between 2009-2010. The amount determined to be less the
    amount paid to the Plaintiffs. The award to be confirmed by the Chief Government Valuer.

The vision of the National Land Policy 2013 is to consider land not just as property, but as a
development tool which results in a prosperous country through efficiency in land use. This
means that in the use of land the land owners should derive benefit and profitability that
propels them into prosperity. This however is not the experience in the areas with
extractives and investments of whichever kind.


                                                                                                                    142
The valuation approaches currently applied to compensation in the face of investment on
land does not reflect the true value of the land and neither does it give a land owner
continued and real benefit from the business enterprise. The principle around investments is
that they should leave the people better off than worse of, of which the reverse is true in
Uganda. Compensating surface owners commensurately does not have a significant impact
on the companies, but rather, creates a harmonious investment environment with averted
conflicts.

LGI-12(iii) Those expropriated are compensated promptly
The government of Uganda does not make prompt compensation in the case of expropriation
of land. Severally, there have been cases in court over this matter. In November 2013
particularly, a public interest litigation was filed through a petition was filed in the
constitutional court to get an overall interpretation of prompt compensation.

Case Study 7: Advocates for Natural Justice & 2 others Vs. The Attorney General a&
another Constitutional Petition no. 40 of 2013
That the Government of Uganda commissioned a project to upgrade the Hoima- Kaiso- Tonya road, Hoima
District, in order to ease and facilitate the oil exploration and exploitation activities in the area. The project is
being implemented by the 2nd respondent, a Government agency. The process of upgrading the road, it seems,
required or necessitated acquiring more land. The government then proceeded to compulsorily acquire land
from the people affected by the project under the Land Acquisition Act. The 2ndrespondent is one of the people
affected by the project. His main complaint is that his land situates at Kyeharo – Kabwoya was expropriated
without prior prompt payment of compensation. He is not complaining in this petition about the value of the
land as assessed or the quantum of the award.
The 2nd petitioner contends that the respondents’ act of taking over and acquiring his land prior to payment of
compensation was in contravention of his right as enshrined under Article 26 of the Constitution.
The 2nd and 3rd petitioners contend that the respondent purported to act under Section 7(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act which law they argue is inconsistent with Article 26 of the Constitution and therefore null and
void. For the respondents it was contended rather half heartedly that the impugned Section 7(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act is still good law. That it is not in any way inconsistent with Article 26 of the Constitution. Mr.
Kalemera argued that the Constitution must be looked at as a whole and that no one Article of the Constitution
ought to be interpreted in isolation of the rest of the Constitution. That in this regard court ought to take into
account the fact that the right to property as set out under Article 26 of the Constitution is not absolute. That it
is subject to the limitations set out in Article 43(2) (c) of the Constitution and therefore, he went on to
argue, Section 7(1) is one of the limitations envisaged under Article 43(2) (c). He contended that
interpreting Article 26 restrictively would hamper government projects. He also argued that land may be
acquired by government in emergency situations that would render it practically impossible to strictly comply
with the provisions of Article 26 of the Constitution, to wit: - Prompt prior payment for land before it is
compulsorily acquired by government.
The Judges of the Constitutional Court ruled as follows:
The Land Acquisition Act commenced on the 2nd July 1965, thirty years before the coming into force of the
current Constitution. It therefore falls under the provisions of Articles 274 of the Constitution which relates to
“existing law”. Article 274 stipulates as follows;
“Subject to the provisions of this Article , the operation of the existing law after the coming into force of this
Constitution shall not be affected by the coming into force of this Constitution but the existing law shall be
construed with such a modification , adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring it
into conformity with this Constitution”



                                                                                                                143
Since the Land Acquisition Act pre-dates the 1995 Constitution, it ought in my view to be construed in
conformity with the Constitution. The Land Acquisition Act as already noted came into force on 2nd July 1965.
It was therefore enacted under the 1962 independence Constitution. Under that Constitution, Article 22 thereof
provided as follows;
22(1) “No property of any description shall be compulsorily taken possession of, and no interest in or right over
property of any description shall be compulsorily acquired, except where the following conditions are satisfied
that is to say;
The taking of possession or acquisition is necessary in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public
morality, public health, town and country planning or the development or utilisation of any property in such a
manner as to promote the public benefit; and
the necessity therefore is such as to afford reasonable justification for the causing of any hardship that may
result to any person having an interest in or right over the property; and
provision is made by a law applicable to that taking of possession or acquisition,
for the prompt payment of adequate compensation”;
The Article goes on, but I will stop here since the rest of the provisions do no concern this petition. This Article
was reproduced in 1966 interim Constitution. It was again reproduced word by word as Article 13 of the 1967
Republican Constitution. However, it was substantially changed in Article 26 of the 1995 Constitution which
now provides as follows;
“26. Protection from deprivation of property.
(1) Every person has a right to own property either individually or in association with others.
No person shall be compulsorily deprived of property or any interest in or right over property of any
description except where the following conditions are satisfied-
- the taking of possession or acquisition is necessary for public use or in the interest of defence, public safety,
public order, public morality or public health; and
- the compulsory taking of possession or acquisition of property is made under a law which makes provisions
for-
- prompt payment of fair and adequate compensation, prior to the taking of possession or acquisition of the
property; and
- a right of access to a court of law by any person who has an interest or a right over the property.”
Clearly the 1995 Constitution departs from the earlier Constitutions in respect of right to property and
specifically on the powers of government to acquire land compulsorily. The 1995 Constitution is very restrictive
in this regard, it specifically provides for prior payment of compensation before taking possession or
acquisition.
We are inclined to think that this apparent modification of the right to property in the 1995 Constitution was
guided by the preamble to the Constitution itself which provides as follows;
“WE THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA:
RECALLING our history which has been characterized by political and Constitutional instability;
RECOGNIZING our struggles against the forces of tyranny, oppression and exploitation;
COMMITTED to building a better future by establishing a social economic and political order through a popular
and durable national Constitution based on the principles of unity, peace , equality, democracy , freedom, social
Justice and progress;”
The history of this country was characterized by compulsory acquisition of property without prior payment of
compensation. Most notably compulsory acquisition by government of properties belonging to the Kabaka of
Buganda and the government of Buganda in 1965 to 1966, the nationalization of foreign companies in 1969 in
what came to be known as The Nakivubo Pronouncements and the expropriation of Asians (citizens and non

                                                                                                                144
citizens) properties in 1972 to 1973 by the military government at the time. I am inclined to think that
in Article 26(2), the Constitution intended to put that history to rest and to firmly assert the people’s rights to
property.
The 1995 Constitution first and foremost limits the instances in which property can be compulsorily acquired
by government, to the following;
- Public use
- In the interest of defense
- Public safety
- Public order
- Public morality
- Public health
In every such instance where government acquires or takes possession of any persons property such an act has
to be made in a law which provides for,
“Prompt payment of fair and adequate compensation; prior to the taking of possession or acquisition of
property”
In this case it is common ground that the government indeed has taken over the second r espondent’s property
under Statutory Instrument Number 5 of 2013, The Land Acquisition (Hoima- Kaiso -Tonya road)
Instrument issued under Section 3 of the Land Acquisition Act Cap 226, and dated 8th February 2013.
The issue in this petition is whether Section 7 (1) of the Land Acquisition Act Cap 226 is a law that is in
conformity with Article 26(2) of the Constitution. We have already set out the provisions of Section 7(1) of the
Land Acquisition Act above. Clearly that Section does not provide anywhere for prior payment of compensation
before government takes possession or before it acquires any person’s property.
To that extent therefore i find that Section 7(1) of Land Acquisition Act Cap 226 is inconsistent with and
contravenes Article 26 (2) (b) of the Constitution.

We do not think however that this means that Section 7(1) of the Land Acquisition Act ceases to exist. In my
view, the impugned Section is saved as an existing law under Article 274 of the Constitution which i have
already set out above. The requirement under that Article is that the laws that pre-date the 1995 Constitution
ought to be construed with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary
to bring them into conformity with the Constitution.
The Constitution clearly envisages that existing laws would in one way or the other be inconsistent with its
provisions. It is therefore not necessary that every time a law is found to be inconsistent with the Constitution,
recourse is made to this court. Some of the inconsistencies such as the impugned Section 7 (1) of the Land
Acquisition Act are too obvious and require no interpretation by this court. The purpose of Article 274 of the
Constitution was to avoid a situation where each and every provision of the old laws, those that pre-date the
1995 Constitution, found to be inconsistent with the Constitution had to end up in this court, for interpretation
and for declarations to that effect.

This petition therefore succeeds. In the result we make the following declarations.
- That Section 7(1) of the Land Acquisition Act is hereby nullified to the extent of its inconsistency with Article
26(2) of the Constitution. That is to say, to the extent that it does not provide for prior payment of
compensation, before government compulsorily acquires or takes possession of any person’s property.

- It is hereby declared that, the acts of the 2 nd respondent complained of in the petition, to wit:-taking
possession of the 2ndrespondents land prior to payment of compensation contravened his right to property as
enshrined in Article 26(2) of the 1995 Constitution.

Panel discussions revealed that the promptness of compensation varies depending on the
project. Road construction works are usually promptly compensated because the financing is
usually 100% and supervision of the process is usually stringent. Where compensation is not
feasible due to cost, options are often derived. A case in point is the construction of the
Northern by-pass which was diverted to the swamps in a bid to avoid compensating land
owners.

LGI-12(iv) Independent and accessible avenues for appeal against expropriation exist
There is no legal mechanism in Ugandan law for appeals against expropriation. Section 13 of
the Land Acquisition Act provides for appeals to be made with regards to awards for
compensation in regard to the amount awarded or that she or he should have the
apportionment or be included in the apportionment the awards.

Section 14 only provides for the Attorney General to take a matter to court in relation to any
land. The proposed Land Acquisition act 2013 however, seeks to amend this to provide that
any person with interest in land to be acquired by government or local government can
access court.


LGI-12(v) Timely decisions are made regarding complaints about expropriation.
Resettlement Action Plans cater for handling complaints about expropriation, however, the
management of such complaints is highly variant given that there are national regulatory
frameworks.

Administrative decisions regarding complaints about expropriation are often not prudently
handled and degenerate into situations of conflict. Often times, the politicians take over the
mediation of such disputes. There are no administrative procedures in place or guidelines
for the mediation of such complaints.

Panel discussions revealed that there are complaints handling desks for most of the projects
and it takes 14-30 days for a complaint to be handled comprehensively. This is true for major
road infrastructure development projects. The challenge experienced in this process is
political interference that often raises issues way out of line and derails or makes the whole
process inefficient.


PANEL 5: TRANSFER OF LARGE TRACTS OF LAND TO INVESTORS
Uganda has fertile soils with 64.5% of its land area suitable for agriculture and 27%
currently under cultivation. The country also has relatively abundant water resources for
production and a thriving, increasingly market-oriented agricultural economy. Access to
productive land and water, however, is highly variable in different regions of the country and
among different population groups. Today's food and financial crises have triggered the new
global scramble for land, in some cases best referred to as `grabbing' because of the methods
of acquisition. Food insecure governments that rely on imports to feed their populations are
snatching up vast areas of farm land outside their own areas for food production, and yet
other governments are acquiring and converting farmland to produce enormous quantities
of bio-fuel. Although these may seem to be parallel agendas driving two kinds of land
                                                                                          146
grabbers, their starting points may differ but the tracks eventually converge. Food
corporations and private investors hungry for profits amidst the deepening financial crisis,
see investment in foreign farm land especially in less developed countries as an important
new source of revenue. As a result, fertile agricultural land and gazetted community
resources like forests are becoming increasingly privatized, given the power of public
domain. Since March 2008, high level officials from these countries have been on a treasure
hunt for land in such countries like Uganda putting into consideration issues of the available
land size, land fertility and water resources.

In Uganda, the land is mainly transferred to public and private sector investors. The
investors are basically Ugandan citizens that are not indigenous or Ugandan local elites who
have entered into agreement with the Uganda Government and the production is mainly for
export purposes. The public sector does it mainly for food security purposes while some are
for energy and investment opportunity. Whereas small holder farmers utilize small pieces of
land to meet their basic needs including food, shelter, health and clothing, commercial
farmers utilize large acreages of land with sole aim of accumulating wealth for the
individuals or corporate entities owning the investment. As a result, commercial farming
initiatives always address profit maximizing opportunities irrespective of the cost to either
the environment or the communities in which the initiative is implemented. However, it is
argued that large scale land acquisition for agricultural purposes can be beneficial for the
poor countries’ economic development through job creation and food security to some
extent. In this regard, International land acquisition refers to countries with insufficient land
for food production look beyond their borders to find land that they can use.

The agricultural sector is the most important source of income and livelihoods for Uganda's
predominantly rural population. Agriculture contributes 43 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), 85 percent of export earnings, and 80 percent of employment (Republic of
Uganda, 2000). Although food crop production dominates, only one-third of the food crop
produced is marketed. Major crops are bananas, cereals, root crops, pulses and oil seeds.
Export crops, including coffee, tea, tobacco and cotton, account for only 8 percent of
cultivated area. Because of the significance of agriculture to rural livelihoods, land is the most
important asset for many Ugandan households. Average land holdings are estimated at 2.2 ha
per household, although there are inter- and intraregional inequalities in this distribution,
and evidence suggests much of this land is not cultivated (McKinnon and Reinikka, 2000).

The Government of Uganda plays a significant role in facilitating large scale land transfers, in
that government’s mission to foreign countries attracts foreign investors through promising
access to land and other natural resources which may perpetuate land grabbing. The land
allocations are made on the highly productive lands and the foreign direct investments are
not subjected to the same safeguard policies which give lea way for corporations to disregard
social policies and communal user rights and this may in the end lead environmental
degradation. The Annex at the back of the report is showing this.

The Uganda Land Commission holds and manages all land vested in or acquired by the
government. It maintains records of leases on state land, and is engaged in the acquisition
and allocation of public land to the private sector for investment purposes. The commission
                                                                                              147
using its mandate to acquire and allocate land to the private sector has failed to put into
consideration the fact that the people displaced may be put in a worse condition than before.
A case in point is when the government of Uganda through the Uganda Land Commission
entered into an arrangement with Neumann Kaffee Grouppe for the establishment of a coffee
plantation in Kaweeri, Mubende district measuring 2510 hectares of which 1802 hectares
have been planted with Uganda Robusta coffee and 552 hectares or 22%, remain as natural,
indigenous tropical rainforest. By use of the army force, the government managed to evict
people that were occupying the said land and it is alleged that a total number of 2,041 people
belonging to 392 families in the villages of Kitemba, Luwunga, Kijunga and Kiryamakobe
were evicted. As if that was not enough, one primary school which was located in the estate
was relocated and its former premises host the offices of the plantation in addition to six
churches (two Anglican, two catholic, one Pentecostal and one seventh day Adventist were
also relocated.

Land has been given to multinationals under very mysterious circumstances. In April 2008,
during the World Islamic Economic Forum, the government of Kuwait launched a new 100
million US dollars called “Dignity Living” to be invested in food production and agri-
development in Uganda. In 2006, President Museveni provided Chinese investors 10,000
acres (4,046 ha) of land in Uganda, which is being farmed by 400 Chinese farmers using
imported Chinese seeds growing corn and rice. This project is overseen by Liu Jianjun, a
former Chinese government official and now head of the China – Africa Business Council.
The Uganda Government has leased 840,127 ha (drawn from various parts of the country) to
the private sector in Egypt to grow organic beef and rice for export to Egypt (see monitor
June 9th, 2009).

District Land Boards hold and allocate land that is not owned in the district, and facilitate the
registration and transfer of interests in land. In urban areas, land committees play an
advisory role to the District Land Boards. The district land boards can allocate such land to
individuals or to the communities on application to legalize the status of those occupying it.
However, if not applied for then it is owned by the district land board on behalf of the
government and it’s upon government to deal with it accordingly. Such a case applies to land
that is claimed to have been grabbed from its inhabitants and given to investors. About 4500
people are alleged to have been displaced from the 6500 hectares of land which government
leased to BIDCO. The 6500 hectares given to BIDCO was former public land on which people
were living illegally. However, the target is 10,000aces of land where 6500(ha) is the nucleus
estate while 3500 is the out-grower scheme. The project was intended to improve the
livelihood of the people of Uganda and Kalangala in particular, more so on the nutrition
status of the poor and reduction on the national cost burden of importation of vegetable oils.
This can be used as an example where it is alleged that land grabbing happens everywhere in
the country yet in some instances it’s the people occupying the area that are in the wrong and
they end up accusing the Government for stealing their land.

Several line ministries and government agencies are responsible for certain lands, such as
the Uganda Wildlife Authority and the National Forestry Authority which have jurisdiction
over protected areas. For example, forests, national parks, mountains etc. Such natural

                                                                                             148
resources have many advantages to both to human beings and the environment. However, at
some point the responsible government agencies have tried to give away some of these
natural resources to the investors for farming. A case in point is Mabira recently, there was a
proposal to give away part of the forest to the Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited (Scoul), a
sugar company owned by the Mehta Group, to increase cane production. One of the
arguments the Government fronted was that Mabira had already been heavily encroached
upon. The plan sparked off mass demonstrations in which three people lost their lives and
luckily the forest was spared. The forest plays an important role as a water catchment area
because it is located between two international lakes which are Victoria and Kyoga and two
rivers, the Nile and Ssezibwa. Mabira has a diversity of plants some of which are used by the
community to treat diseases and it helps in sinking waste gases from the atmosphere. The
forest stores carbon that is worth $315m per year and it contributes to the heavy rains that
are experienced in the surrounding areas throughout the year. Uganda wildlife Authority has
continued to gazette land as and when it is necessary and many people have ended up being
displaced.

The United Nations report on Investment opportunities and conditions stated: “ In general,
agriculture and agro-processing suffer from under-investment. Of the 18 million hectares of
available arable land, approximately 25 per cent is being utilized, leaving fully 13 million
hectares idle. Private investment is welcome in all aspects of agriculture including the
production of crops, beef and dairy products” (UNCTAD 2001:30).

LGI-13(i) Divestiture of public land transactions is conducted in an open transparent
manner.
Currently, there are two primary mechanisms through which investors can acquire land for
agricultural investment in Uganda: through direct negotiation with private land owners
(possibly with government facilitation) or through the acquisition of government land held
by various agencies, including the District Land Boards, the Uganda Land Commission, or the
Uganda Investment Authority (Stickler 2012).

Investors can lease land held by various government agencies, including the District Land
Boards, which are authorized to hold land on behalf of local governments, and the Uganda
Land Commission (ULC), which, according to Section 49(a) of the Land Act, is authorized to
“hold and manage any land in Uganda which is vested in or acquired by the government in
accordance with the Constitution.” As will be discussed below, a limited number of investors
have also acquired lands directly held by the Uganda Investment Authority. However, there is
currently no enabling legislation that specifies the procedures for any of these agencies to
allocate land to investors. There is also no legal definition of “public”, “government”, and
“local government” land, which makes it difficult to determine which agency has authority or
a given parcel of land (Bogere 2011).

There are also important on-going debates about the authority of the government to
compulsorily acquire land for the purpose of allocating it to investors. The Constitution
(Section 26(2)(a)), the Land Act of 1998 and the Land Acquisition Act Cap. 226 of 1965
prohibit the government from using compulsory acquisition to promote investment. The
government has tried to overturn these provisions, including most recently through the
Government can purchase or lease privately held land for the purpose of allocating it to an
investor.

There are no specific criteria or procedures for identifying government land that would be
suitable for a given investment. At a minimum, the ULC considers the project profile,
including the size of land required and the proposed use of the land, to determine which
properties might be suitable. Once a suitable property has been identified, then the agency
writes a letter to the ULC requesting them to permit the investor to lease the land (UIA
2011).

If the ULC approves the agency request, the ULC would then begin the process of transferring
the title to the investor as leasehold, typically for up to 49 years. As part of this process, a site
visit is required to determine the current land use and identify any “squatters” (i.e. tenants)
occupying the land. As described above, these tenants must either be resettled or
compensated before the land can be transferred to the investor. While the investor is
responsible for paying the compensation, various government agencies, including the ULC
and the Chief Government Valuer, facilitate this process. However, it is not clear which
Government department has ultimate authority over the resettlement or compensation.
Investors also typically pay ground rent for the land.



                                                                                                 150
Panel discussions revealed that Regulation 23 of the Land regulations provides for sale of
land by ULC or the Land board in 3 ways Public auction, Open bidding and land allocation.
This is however not mandatory. Parliament once asked the ULC why it was not transparent
in land allocations but it responded that the procedures stipulated in the law are not
mandatory. Because of this, ULC has decided to divest in whichever way it deems fit. There
are more of private auctions. The procedure now seems to be that an interested person
identifies the land and then applies for it. ULC decides whether or not to grant the
application.

Furthermore, discussions showed that most of the public land recently given away comprises
mainly of protected areas such as Namanve forest reserve, Butamiira forest Reserves and the
former government ranches. In all these processes, no advertisements were made.

Currently, for land under the management of the National Forestry Authority, formal
procedures are followed. In this case however, the purpose for which the investor acquires
the land must be forestry. No land use change applications are granted. For these lands
investors get lease period of up to sixty years. The first batch of licences were issued in
2005/6 while the 2nd Batch of licences were issued in 2008/9.

Land should not be auctioned for the sake of it but this should be based on the type of
investments that Government is attracting. As such, the investment plan should make sense
before an investor is made to express interest in a particular size of land. The pitfalls in
Uganda is the lack of an investment policy and the existence of an investment code Act that
is not very progressive. The existing code was for passed in 1991 and Parliament recalled it
in 2012. A draft bill has been prepared to amend the existing one but this process is not a
public process.

When land is not given under a public bidding process there is minimal control over what the
investor is doing. Examples of investments gone bad are the Shimoni and Nakasero land
where the investor changed even the company name in order to effect land use change.


LGI-13(ii) Leases of public land & real estate are in line with the market (unless
      justified on equity grounds) and collected.
Ground rent is often vigilantly paid because of fear to lose the properties. People are
therefore, self driven to make sure that these payments are done. Property rates however
face challenges in their collection. From available data, the most valuable sources of revenue
from the land sector are rental income tax at Shs.6.09 billion; stamp duty at Shs.5.18 billion;
land premium and ground rent at Shs.2.064 billion (exceptionally high in the FY 2004/05);
and land registration activities at Shs.315 million. Of all existing local revenue sources,
property rates have the highest potential in terms of yield and buoyancy. Kampala City
Council realized Shs.2.979 billion out of the budgeted Shs.3.772 billion in the FY 2004/05.
According to the current budget 2005/06, property rates have been projected to bring in
about Shs.10.67 billion in addition to the rates arrears of about Shs.4.7 billion. Property
rates revenue projected at Shs.14.7 billion is the single biggest revenue source of Kampala
City Council accounting for 44.5 percent of the total projected revenue of Shs.33.3 billion for
                                                                                           151
the FY 2005/06. The recent revaluation of all properties in the city is expected to raise the
annual revenue from property rates from a projected Shs.6 billion to Shs.16 billion (MWLE
2006).

Section 3(4) the Local governments Rating Act limits the ratable properties outside an urban
area to commercial buildings only as it reads “notwithstanding subsection (3) the rate may
be levied in any area outside the urban area in respect of a commercial building. While this
section extends property taxation powers to district local governments, it at the same time
limits them to taxing only commercial buildings. What about industrial properties in the
districts?

Owner-occupied residential properties are now exempted from property rates following an
amendment which was directed by the President just a few months after the new rating law
came into force. All along owner-occupied residential properties were liable to property
rates. It ought to be appreciated that the main aim of any property rating system is to raise
revenue for provision of services by the local authority. Rating is defined as a method by
which residents of a particular area contribute money to share the burden of the cost of
providing services to themselves within their area. Equity demands that the cost of local
services should be equitably shared between all classes of rate payers and fair as between
rate payers within those classes14. An equitable tax should take cognizance of the benefits
received by the rate payers as well as his ability to pay tax. People who decide to reside in
their own houses consume the same services as those who decide to rent out their houses.
This type of exemption is likely to induce evasion on the part of the discriminated property
owners (GOU 2010).

Panel discussions revealed that leases are one of the largest money collectors for the country
despite the failure to follow regulations to the letter. After 1995, following the constitutional
changes and the removal of the role of town councils in collecting fees, there were many
distortions about the leasing and collection of lease fees. Leaseholders tended to relax
because ownership was guaranteed by the constitutional pronouncement. In cases where
there is fear of losing the property in case of defaults in payment, leaseholders pay without
coercion.

Generally, lease payments are self regulating given the consequences and the need to
guarantee the state of ownership. Furthermore, in order to renew the lease, the leaseholder
needs to prove that’s/he has been making timely payments. There are always skimmers
waiting for defaulters in order to grab the land for which leases have expired or defaulted.

LGI-13(iii) unless justified by equity objectives, public land is transacted at
     competitive market prices.
The “government price” so determined sometimes varies slightly from the market price.
They are often much lower than the market price. On average, investors have paid
$291/acre premiums to acquire UIA agricultural properties, with a range of $16 to $693 per

14Property value is an indicator of a taxpayer’s net wealth or income. And most importantly the intangible
housing benefits which owner occupants enjoy have to be weighed against the visible flow of rents from rented
properties
                                                                                                         152
acre. Annual ground rents (exclusive of value added tax) vary from $0 to $676 per acre, with
an average of $197.

Notably, these premiums are generally below the cost UIA paid to acquire the properties.
Across all five properties for which both cost and premium data are available, the UIA lost
approximately $502,950 in the process of acquiring and allocating private agricultural lands
to investors. However, if annual ground rents are paid according to the terms specified17 for
the three properties for which all data are available, the total net present value to the UIA is
$4.1 million, or roughly 0.24% of net official development assistance and official aid received
in 2010 (World Bank 2012b). The assumptions that were used to calculate the net present
value were that for a lease term of 99 years, the discount rate applied was 14%, which is the
estimated rate used in 2010 by the central bank of Uganda (CIA 2012); annual ground rent
payments were summed over the total acreage for each investment; the cost of land
purchased by the UIA and the premium paid by investors to UIA occurred at the beginning of
the first term (Stickler 2012).

Panel discussions revealed that government usually transacts at less than market price in
order to offer incentives for particular land uses. The Uganda Investment Authority often
offers much lower prices than market price to offer incentives for agricultural land. The
benefits to the country are calculated not based on the price of the land but the other benefits
that accrue from the investment such as employment, increase in GDP, provision of social
infrastructure, utility bills e.t.c.

Investors rarely search for and purchase land on their own because of the distortions in the
land market in Uganda and the guarantee that the sale of land is a good sale free of fraud.

One of the panellists raised concerns over the implications of this on the East African
integration process. Land is central to all trade negotiations and a solution needs to be found
that works and binds the whole of East Africa.

Uganda is encouraging private investors through the use of the Public Private Partnerships
approach (govt= 51% and investor=49%) for purposes of acquiring land. When this is done,
investors often individualise the rest of the activities. They take advantage of the fact that the
registries are not linked and thus most of such information is lacking and there is no way of
knowing which investments are genuine and which are not. Lawyers are often at the centre
of helping the investors beat the long arm of the law.


LGI-13(iv) The public captures benefits arising from changes in permitted land use
The vision of the National Land Policy is to consider land not just as property, but as a
development tool which results in a prosperous country through efficiency in land use. This
means that in the use of land the land owners should derive benefit and profitability that
propels them into prosperity.

The valuation approaches currently applied to compensation in the face of investment on
land do not reflect the true value of the land and neither does it give a land owner continued
and real benefit from the business enterprise. The principle around investments is that they
                                                                                              153
should leave the people better off than worse of, of which the reverse is true in Uganda.
Compensating surface owners commensurately does not have a significant impact on the
companies, but rather, creates a harmonious investment environment with averted conflicts.

Benefits that could accrue to the public as a result of land use change could be numerous,
ranging from employment to infrastructure development. These however do not accrue
because there is no government policy governing minimum wage payment or even public
benefits from investments.

There is no regulatory framework to support these processes.

LGI-13(v) A policy to improve equity in access to and use of assets by the poor exists, is
     implemented effectively, and monitored.
The National Land Policy 2013 recognizes that mechanisms to deliver the right balance
between improving livelihoods, protecting vulnerable groups, and raising opportunities for
investments and development are needed. Furthermore, it provides that it is crucial to
determine sectors open to foreign direct investment. This is in a bid to promote equity.

LGI-14(i) Land to be made available to investors is identified transparently & publicly,
in agreement with right holders
There is an investment law, but the procedure is not streamlined due to lack of regulation.
The Uganda Investment Authority is legally empowered to promote investment in Uganda,
including by facilitating investor access to land. The first sub-section below briefly describes
provisions of the Investment Code Act (“the Act”), Cap 92 of 1993 and other legislation
relevant to the process of acquiring and allocating agricultural land for large-scale
investment. At just twenty-two pages, the Act is fairly concise. The Act creates the Uganda
Investment Authority.
Authority (UIA), whose functions are, inter alia:
   “to promote, facilitate, and supervise investments in Uganda;
   to receive all applications for investment licences for investors intending to establish or
    set up businesses enterprises in Uganda under this Code and to issue licences and
    certificates of incentives in accordance with this Code.
   to secure all licenses, authorizations, approvals, and permits required to enable any
    approval
     granted by the authority t[o] have full effect;
    to do all other acts as are required to be done under this Code or are necessary or
    conducive
   to the performance of the functions of the authority” (Part II, Section 6).
 In establishing the Uganda Investment Authority, the Act specifies that “The authority shall
be a body corporate…capable of acquiring and holding property” (Part II, Section 2(3)). It
appears that the UIA has chosen to broadly interpret this authority, which was meant to
empower the UIA to acquire land for its own use as a body corporate, to include acquiring
and holding property for allocation to investors. However, the UIA was not granted the
express power to acquire land and then either sell it to investors or otherwise allocate it to
them.
Given that the UIA is not explicitly legally authorized to acquire land on behalf of investors, it
is perhaps unsurprising that there are no rules or regulations governing the UIA’s
identification or acquisition of agricultural land for private investment. Neither does the Act
itself specify any rules or regulations governing the allocation of agricultural lands held by
the UIA for private investment. The UIA does, however, have criteria for allocating land
within its Industrial and Business Parks. In addition to meeting the minimum requirements
for an investment license, investments wishing to obtain “free land” from the UIA must meet
two out of three additional criteria: (i) total investment per acre must exceed US$ 1 million;
(ii) a minimum of 80 percent of the total product value must be exported as value added
products; (iii) local employment must support a minimum of 30 semi-skilled or 15 skilled
workers per acre (Stickler 2012).
Significantly, however, the Act does state unequivocally that “no foreign investor shall carry
on the business of crop production or acquire or be granted or lease land for the purpose of
crop production or animal production” (Part III, Section 10(2)). However, a company that is
49% foreign-owned could still register as domestic company and circumvent this rule.
Although the Act does not explicitly provide the UIA with the authority to acquire, hold, or
                                                                                              155
allocate land to investors, it does provide the UIA with the authority to facilitate investor
access to land:
       The executive director shall liaise with Government Ministries and departments, local
       authorities, and other bodies as may be necessary in order t [sic.] assist an investment licence
       holder in complying with any formalities or requirements for obtaining any permissions,
       authorizations, licences, land and other things required for the purpose of the business
       enterprise (Part III, Section 15(2)).

However, there are no codified rules or regulations governing the UIA’s authority to faci litate
investor access to land. The Act does not specify whether the UIA is responsible for helping
investors acquire land from private owners or from other government agencies that hold
land, such as the ULC or the District Land Boards. Neither does the Act specify how the UIA
should interface with the other government institutions that have played roles in recent land
acquisitions, including the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Forestry Authority.
The Investment Code Act stipulates that the UIA should appraise the capacity of the proposed
investment to contribute to “locally or regionally balanced socioeconomic development”
when considering an investment application (Section 12(e)). It also explains that a license
may contain provisions requiring the investor “to take necessary steps to ensure that the
operations of his or her business enterprise do not cause injury to the ecology or
environment” (Section 18(2)(d)). However, the Act does not specify any sanctions for non -
compliance with this optional provision. Beyond these two guidelines, the Act does not
stipulate any social or environmental safeguards that apply to agricultural investments in
Uganda. The Act also does not cross-reference relevant environmental laws and regulations
governing the project development in Uganda.


According to the UIA, the Authority can purchase land directly from individuals,
communities, or cooperatives wishing to sell land that is “unencumbered (free of squatters)”,
properly titled, and free of conflict (Mitti 2011). Once the UIA has purchased the land, the
titles are “automatically” converted to freehold. Since 1997, the UIA has purchased six rural
properties from private individuals using government funds. In total, the UIA has purchased
some 25,570 acres (6 parcels) of agricultural land from private land owners, of which 6,460
acres (4 parcels) were freehold; 12,800 acres (1 parcel) were leasehold; and 6,200 acres (1
parcel) were mailo land12 before they were purchased by UIA (Stickler2012).
The parcels range in size from just 20 acres to 12,800 acres, with an average of 4,262 acres.
The prices paid by the UIA for these lands vary widely and do not reflect average market
prices13. On average, the UIA paid private land owners $296/acre for these properties, with
a high of $728 for land in Kasangati and a low of $19 for Masindi farmland. According to an
interview with the UIA, the price of an acre of farmland varies between roughly $330 in
Mubende and $500 in Mukono. However, the UIA paid just $57/acre for acquiring 6,205
acres of farmland in Mubende.
Lands acquired by the UIA are not always unencumbered of legal or illegal occupants. UIA
works with the local council (local administrative authority) to identify tenants eligible to
receive compensation (Mitti 2011). The Chief Government Valuer determines the value of
compensation based on the values set annually by the District Land Board for crops and
                                                                                                   156
other property. The compensation value paid to tenants includes the value of crops and
improvements on the land (e.g. house or other structures), plus a disturbance allowance of
30% of the value of the compensation.
The total value assigned to any crops grown on the property depends on the terms of any
lease agreement governing the occupant’s rights. Where a lease agreement will be taken over
by the new investor, the current lessee is entitled to the value of their crops for the
remaining term of the lease. Where occupants do not possess a lease agreement or other
form of legal documentation of their rights (e.g. title), they are entitled to crop compensation
for the value of one year’s harvest.
This is however not always the case. In the delivery of the judgment in the case of Peter B
Kayiira & others Vs: Attorney General of Uganda Kaweri Coffee Plantations Ltd and
anor: Civil Suit No 179 of 2002 ; the Judge found that
Uganda Investment Authority did not undertake due diligence. The judge stated that The
Uganda Investment Authority bought the land subject to encumbrances mentioned in
Clause 6.2 of the contract but the court's finding is that those conditions were never
satisfied. Effectively Messrs Nangwala and Rezida waived the condition to purchase the
land with vacant possession when they failed to satisfy themselves that the conditions in
the contract had been fulfilled and they went ahead and negligently completed the
transaction. Hence the tenants were not compensated and the purchase was completed
without vacant possession; and without obtaining any valuation reports on the land sold,
evidence payment of compensation, payment of disturbance allowances and as well as
allocation of alternative land.
A deed of covenant to the title should have been executed before completion that would
have given such protection as is extended pursuant to six covenants namely covenan t of
right to convey; covenant of seisin; covenant of encumbrance, covenant of quite
enjoyment; covenant of warranty; and covenant of further assurance. “ These basic
procedures in a convincing were not followed. My findings are that James Nangwala and
Alex Rezida as senior partners of their firm were grossly, recklessly and deliberately
negligent in failing to complete the purchase of the land contrary to the conditions in the
sale agreement. They should have been more diligent because the overall quantum o f the
transaction including the compensation that was payable under the contract was in the
region of billions of shillings; and the issue of compensation of tenants in the contract could
not have been overlooked. They would have known full well the negligent implications of not
concluding the terms of the sale agreement.”


Panel discussions emphasized that the question is normally not land but the type of
investment that an investor seeks to do. Land becomes one the key factors of production. An
Example was given of the Vegetable oil project which is an investment in the Agricultural
Sector. For this project, Government identified the land for an agricultural based project and
set out the bid to investors (with the Investor having 90% share and local farmers =10%).
The Land owners and other interested parties were consulted to participate in the project
the palm oil project.


                                                                                            157
A second phase of the same project is being developed in Buvuma, a more populated island.
Here government is negotiating with the land owners. Land is valued and consent sought for
from the land owners to convert user to the oil palm growing. There have been instances
where some people have rejected the deals and government has respected their wishes.

The National Land Policy provides for a Land Bank to be managed by the Uganda Land
Commission and district land boards. Government should therefore buy land and store
(bank) it for investors. The National Forestry Authority for example should have a land bank
for forestry purposes. It is not proper for the Uganda Investment authority to hawk an
Investor in the villages in search for land as the law does not give it this mandate. The biggest
challenge is the lack of regulations for this.


LGI-14(ii) Investments to go forward are selected based on expected economic, socio-
cultural & environmental impacts in an open process
Investors must hold a valid investment license to be eligible to acquire agricultural land from
the UIA. The Act does stipulate the minimum information that an investor seeking an
investment license must provide in their application. This includes, inter alia, the proposed
business name and address, the legal form of the business, the nature of the proposed
business activity, the proposed location, the estimated number of persons to be employed,
the qualifications and experience of project management and staff, and “any other
information relating to the viability of the project” (Section 11(1)Investment code Act).
Before awarding an investment license, the Act requires the UIA to “carry out an appraisal of
the capacity of the proposed business enterprise to contribute to” a number of objectives,
including employment, advanced technology introduction, and “locally or regionally balanced
socioeconomic development” (Section 12Investment Code Act).

 Licensed investors are free to complete an online “Land Request Form” that specifies their
investment license number, intended land use (agricultural, industrial, or other), the size of
land required, the type of “terrain (e.g. highland, flat, swampy etc)”, preferred tenure status
(freehold, leasehold, or mailo), offer price, preferred location, service requirements (power,
water, telephone, other), and acquisition type (purchase, lease, joint venture).

Panel discussions emphasized the lack of impact studies as a major challenge to ensuring
compliance with environmental standards and actual analysis and understanding of the
social-economic impacts of these investments to Uganda as a country. This all hinges on the
absence of overall land use planning despite the fact that government is not the land owner.
No Environmental Impact assessments are done let alone environmental audits. This creates
a monster called the investor who then does what he/she deems fit irrespective of its long
e=term impacts on the host country.

Very few projects have had EIAs and Social Impact studies done some of these projects are
          o Karuma Hydro power Project - A Norwegian company was contracted to carry
             out impact studies and when the report was produced, a Chinese company was
             contracted to redo the EIA because the standards proposed by the Norwegian
             firm were extremely high.
                                                                                             158
          o Southern Bypass -the Chinese did their work without taking into consideration
            some specific requirements leveraging on cost reduction.
          o Murchsion falls- the road to Kayiso-toonya - Tullow proposed an underground
            passage in order to save the breeding grounds for the wildlife in the National
            Park but a Chinese firm was contracted and it went ahead and constructed the
            road through the breeding grounds

Consideration of economic, socio-economic and Environmental concerns are often
considered expensive by the Government which often seeks cheaper alternatives and thus
forfeiting environmental and social considerations for the sake of development.


LGI-14(iii) Public institutions transferring land to investors are clearly identified &
regularly audited
The National Land Policy provides that, “It is the duty of government to deliver land to
investors based on a transparent criterion with due process either from public land or
government land without displacing public utilities”
The Investment Code Act does explicitly authorize the UIA executive director to “liaise with
Government Ministries and departments, local authorities, and other bodies as may be
necessary” to help investors acquire land (Section 15(2) of the Investment Code Act).
However, no rules or regulations have been promulgated to govern the exercise of this
authority. Interviews with both the UIA and the Uganda Land Commission provided some
insights into the role of the UIA in helping investors acquire both government and private
land for agricultural production.

When investor requests UIA assistance in identifying land for an agricultural investment, the
UIA may liaise with other government agencies to identify land that may be suitable for the
investment. Several government agencies have recently been involved in allocating
agricultural land for private investment in Uganda. These include the Uganda Land
Commission, the District Land Boards, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Uganda Wildlife
Authority, and the National Forestry Authority (Tumushabe 2003, Tumushabe and
Bainomugisha 2004, Veit et al. 2008).
As previously mentioned, the Uganda Land Commission (ULC) is authorized to “hold and
manage any land in Uganda which is vested in or acquired by the Government in accordance
with the Constitution” (Section 49(a) of the Land Act). Prior to the 1995 Constitution, which
created the ULC (Article 238(1)), various government institutions held and managed
government land. For example, the government, through the Ministry of Agriculture,
previously maintained model farms of 1,000 to 2,000 acres at each of 52 District Farm
Institutes. This land, along with all other land vested in or acquired by the government, is
now held and managed by the ULC. As such, the UIA typically helps investors acquire
government land through the Uganda Land Commission.
The ULC considers that all national parks, forest reserves, and other protected areas are also
‘government land’ that can be allocated to investors. A thorough analysis of the legal
challenges inherent in allocating protected areas for crop or livestock production is beyond
                                                                                          159
the scope of this paper. However, the Constitution clearly states that the government is only
empowered to hold such lands “in trust for the people…for ecological and touristic purposes
for the common good of all citizens” (Article 237(2)(b)of the Constitution).
There have been recent legal challenges to the degazettement of protected reserves (e.g.,
Pian Upe Wildlife Reserve and Butamira Forest Reserve) to provide land for agricultural
investments have confirmed that the government’s authority as trustee of such lands does
not include the power to degazette them for private investment (Tumushabe 2003;
Tumushabe and Bainomugisha 2004).
In response to an investor’s request for land, the UIA may write a letter of recommendation
to the government agency that formerly managed lands suitable for the investment (e.g. the
Ministry of Agriculture) requesting that the agency authorize the ULC to transfer the title to
the investor as leasehold. The UIA recommendation is based on the information presented in
the investment license (e.g. financial qualifications, technical qualifications, and experience in
the sector). The ULC then consults its registry of government properties to identify
properties that might meet the investor’s needs.
The procedure for determining fees regarding the value of the land is not clear neither id
there clarity on the setting of ground rent and property rates. . However, transaction fees are
standard fees, the highest being the stamp duty which is 1% of the value of the land.

Panellists especially from government were clear that they only undertake financial audits
and rarely are performance audits carried out. Apart from the Public Accounts Committee of
the Parliament and the Auditor general, no other forms of audit exist to check Government
functionality.

LGI-14(iv) Public bodies transferring land to investors share information and
coordinate to minimize and resolve overlaps (incl sub-soil)
The Investment Code Act and the Land Act, among other relevant laws, assign unclear and
sometimes overlapping authorities to different government institutions that in practice play
a role in the process of transferring land to investors. There are no established procedures
governing the authorities of either the UIA or the ULC to manage government land (Bogere
2011). Nor are there any regulations to guide the interaction of different government
agencies, for example in identifying government land suitable for a particular investment.
Moreover, the District Land Boards also have the authority to “hold and allocate land in the
district which is not owned by any person or authority”, but it is not clear how the Land
Boards exercise this mandate with respect to the UIA or the ULC (Section 59(1)(a) of the
Land Act).




                                                                                              160
At a minimum, the lack of legal and procedural clarity on the duties of the UIA and other
government authorities in allocating government land to investors creates opportunities for
inefficiencies – and perhaps even corruption (Bogere 2011). In fact, a recent audit of the
Uganda Land Commission found several cases where the same parcel of government land
was allocated to two or three different investors with different lease titles (Bogere 2011).
Some investors apparently go directly to the President of the Republic to secure land.
There is no coordinated mechanism for sharing information within public institutions. Many
times, Institutions only discover that their lands have been divested.
The National Land Policy 2013 is silent on the institutional framework for land transfer for
investment. This leaves the matter grey. Panel discussions affirmed that there is no stand
alone policy but could be provided for in the different sectoral policies. The practice however
is that government coordination is the assignment of the office of the Prime Minister. This
has however not been institutionalised. This matter needs to be thought through by
Government departments concerned working together with the private sector and civil
society.


LGI-14(v) Investors’ compliance with contractual obligations is regularly monitored &
remedial action taken if needed
Currently there is no regulatory framework to monitor investors’ compliance with the
contractual obligations neither are there prescribed remedial actions for investor bad
behavior. Uganda operates a fully liberalized market economy and the investor determines
the rules of the game.
Peter B Kayiira & others Vs: Attorney General of Uganda Kaweri Coffee Plantations Ltd
and another: Civil Suit No 179 of 2002 ; The Judge realized that the terms of the contract
were not fulfilled and that the plaintiffs were being defrauded. He ruled as follows:
On examining Plaintiffs witness evidence with the terms of the contract I became concerned as to whether
the alternative land at 168 Kambuye where the tenants were to be relocated, was a reality or fiction:
Clause 2(a) the contract - US 50,000 dollars shall be paid into an escrow account to be opened in Kampala
with Standard Charter Bank and to which the joint signatories shall be Mr Urban Tibamanya
representing the vendor and Mr Alex Rezida representing the Purchase.. The signatories shall be joint
signatories for all the transactions on the account and shall only effect a withdrawal of funds upon receipt of
written instructions from their respective principals . The purpose of the payment is to enable the Vendor at his
request, handle the removal of all the encumbrances specified herein below and the money so paid into the
escrow account shall only be withdrawn in the following manners.
Clause 2(b)-Up to 500,000,000 shillings may only be withdrawn at any time for the purpose of purchasing
alterative land for the occupants of the land now being sold Provided that the vendor furnishes proof of
securing such alternative land. The sum under this Clause may only be withdrawn when the land title is kept by
the purchaser's representative herein above named (that is Alex Rezida).
I therefore obtained copies of the title of Block 168 from Mityana District Registry. . My reservations were
confirmed that the landlord had never acquired the said land either Mailo or leasehold in 2001, as was
promised. I enclose copies of the title marked Court Exhibit C 1. The promise and assurance of alternative land
at Kamabuye by the RDC's and the landlord were all lies, fibs and stories. They were deliberate lies to defraud
the tenants to evict them and violate their human rights. The plaintiffs evidence was therefore credible that
they had violently been evicted without any relocation or compensation. And the lawyers of both the vendor
and purchaser connived to facilitate legal fraud against the tenants. These lawyers were Urban Tibamanya,
James Nangwala and Alex Rezida. If they had religiously complied with terms of the sale agreement there

                                                                                                             161
would have been no fraud. : The scam involved a number of people including local leaders, RDC's, some
thugs hired as policeman and soldiers as well as the lawyers and the landlord. The German investors and
some officers of UIA cannot be ruled out.
As per the terms of the contract no alternative land was acquired; non of the encumbrances were cleared
as per page Clause 6.2a and 6.2 b of the agreement; title deed were not given to Mr Alex Rezida as there
was no land acquired, principal's consent to withdraws funds from the escrow could not be there if there
was no alternative land purchased . I am satisfied that this sale agreement drawn by Nangwala and Rezida
and signed by Alex Rezida,, Mr Tibamanya and the Assistant director of Uganda Investment Authority was
a bogus document intended to defraud the government and the tenants.
My findings are further confirmed when the cost of compensating 400 tenants is nearly l-6million dollars
and the purchase price was $351,658 dollars. The equation does not stack up. No right minded vendor
would have entered into such a transaction unless there was a hidden agenda or Pla n B which the
Government did no know but the Vendor might have been appraised of. Mr Rezida and Mr Nangwala who
prepared the agreement for sale should have been put on notice and should have made further enquiries
before they advised their client to sign a bogus contract that did not make sense.
Mr Francis Mugerwa solicitor acting for the estate of the deceased landlord informed the court that the
landlord did not have the capacity to pay such compensation and that his current estate was worth 100
million shillings.
The funds in the escrow account had Mr Rezida and the Mr Tibamanya as the joint signatories The funds
were provided by the UIA. These funds in escrow account could not have been applied for the purposes for
which they were meant because no alternative land was purchased to relocate the tenants; and there is no
evidence before this court that the monies in esc row account were reimbursed to the UIA, and hence there
was misappropriation of clients monies or theft of clients monies in broad day light . It is most serious
offence a solicitor can commit. This dishonesty by Mr Rezida, Mr Nangwala and Mr Tibamanya was
criminal dishonesty because of theft of client money. I should mention that Mr Tibamaya had sworn a
witness statement on behalf of the UIA but he did not come to the court to give evidence- he was the
lawyer for the landlord and acted for him in the sale of the land to UIA who were apparently defrauded and
ended up burning their fingers.

The National Land Policy 2013 provides as one of its policy statements under land for
investment that “Government shall put in place measures to mitigate the negative impacts of
investment so as to deliver equitable and sustainable development .” To achieve this, a strategy
will be formulated to guide the state and its agencies in the provision of land for investment
including measures to follow due process (evaluation, due diligence and approval of land use
change).


Panel discussions revealed that only the National Environment Management Authority
undertakes some monitoring applying the “polluter pays” principle and promoting cleaner
production. Environmental audits have not been effectively implemented. The other sectors
have not monitored compliance.

LGI-14(vi) Safeguards are used routinely and effectively reduce the risk of negative
effects from large scale land-related investments
Section 10 (2) of the Investment Act provides that “No foreign investor shall carry on the
business of crop production, animal production or acquire or be granted or lease land for the
purpose of crop production or animal production.” However, the Uganda Investment
Authority registry clearly indicates that it has allocated large areas of land to foreign
investors for crop production – which directly contravenes Part III, Section 10(2) of the
Investment Code Act. The UIA reports quarterly on the number of projects approved by
                                                                                                      162
sector (e.g. agriculture, forestry, etc.) and by investor country of origin. However, beyond the
UIA registry, no official data on government or private land acquired by approved domestic
or foreign investors are available. Thus, it is not possible to determine how much land
foreign investors have acquired for agricultural production in Uganda. However, recent
research suggests that there are several foreign companies operating agricultural production
investments in Uganda (Land Matrix Portal). Furthermore, by allowing companies that are
up to 50% foreign-owned to register as domestic entities, the Investment Code Act leaves
investors with ample room to circumvent restrictions on foreign land acquisition.

Panel discussions affirmed the above but highlighted that in Uganda, it is only environmental
safeguards that are pronounced and to some extent implemented although many times with
compromised quality. Examples were given of The Nile Power Project in Bujagaali where
safeguards were not respected at all. In the Karuma Hydro Power project, a credible process
was undertaken but the results compromised. Such political interference and
pronouncements that lead to destabilization of technical processes often flaws systems and
creates an atmosphere of uncertainty in the minds of technical staff.

Secondly, the cost of cleaning up after a detrimental act is often too high especially in the face
of oil exploration. It is important for the state to ensure that the available legal frameworks
are abided with. The Factories can mitigate their negative effects but there is laxity when no
one forces them to do so. Cleaner production remains a principle on paper and not in
practice. The polluters more often than not do not pay for the environmental degradation
and damage caused.


LGI-14(vii) The scope for investment leading to resettlement is clearly circumscribed
& procedures exist to deal with it in line with best practice
Uganda does not have a resettlement policy neither does it have an anti- eviction law. This
has left citizens prone to evictions without resettlement in the face of investments.

15   iv   Contractual provisions regarding           The majority of contractual arrangements do not include
          benefit sharing are publicly               information on benefit sharing
          disclosed



LGI-15(i) Investors provide sufficient information to allow rigorous evaluation of
proposed investments’ impacts
Investor information is not made public. There is no way of knowing whether or not the
information provided by the investor is sufficient to allow rigorous evaluation of the
proposed investment impacts. As such, the National Land Policy 2013 has proposed the
regulation of the amount of land an investor can access in consideration of the use that land
will be put to. This will compel the investors to avail the requisite information necessary for
the evaluation of the proposed investment impacts.

Panel discussions emphasized the lack of regulation as the main challenge to investor
provision of information. Requirements such as evidence of technical viability, community
consultation, and availability of resources should be mandatory yet evidence from the Amuru
sugar cane project reveals that all these requirements were absent when the deal was being
entered into between the government and Madvani .The communities in amurye did not feel
a part of the process and this led to the institution of a court case brought by the
communities protesting the taking of their land for cane growing.

Furthermore, most of the investors come with money/loans from banks and pension funds
such as HSBC or IFC, part of which funds are supposed to go for the community good. This is
never delivered. Focus is placed on profit at the expense of environmental and human rights
considerations, leading to failure to meet expectations of a host country. If the system was
clear and free of fraud and corruption, the investors would use the money for what it is
intended for e.g. community consultations and compensation.


LGI-15(ii) Approval of investment plans follows clear criteria with reasonable
timelines
Since it was never envisaged that there would be investors in the agriculture sector, no
regulatory or framework was developed setting the criteria for approval of investment plans.
However, the National Land Policy 2013 has as one of its strategies to establish a framework
for auditing land based local and foreign investment proposals to ensure that they are
aligned with the objectives of the National Land Policy.
Currently however, applications for agricultural land are considered on a case-by-case basis;
there are no standard criteria for determining which investors can acquire UIA land. Suitable
land is identified based on the specifications in the investment application, including the area
and type of land required.
In addition, since 1999 the UIA has been required to seek Cabinet approval for leases to
foreign agricultural investors above 50 acres for crop or animal production (US DOS 2011).
This requirement stems from the government’s interest in promoting skills transfer to
smallholder out growers through 50-acre model farms. Although the UIA has requested that
this requirement be repealed, it does not appear to have stopped foreign investors from
                                                                                                    164
acquiring land for agricultural production – which is explicitly prohibited by Part III, Section
10(2) of the Investment Code Act.
The six agricultural properties owned by the UIA have all been leased to investors, some of
them foreign, typically on 99 year leases. As specified in the UIA land registry, investors most
often pay a premium for acquiring the land in addition to an annual ground rent for the
duration of the lease. The UIA sets standard prices according to guidance from the Chief
Government Valuer.


Panel discussions revealed that time required to have a plan approved is between 5-6
months. However, the Investment Code Act is not standardized on procedures. The timing
therefore will depend on who the investor is. For example, the Rakai Free trade port
investment plan has never been approved.

LGI-15(iii) Right holders or their representatives negotiate land issues freely with
investors and access relevant information
Due to the absence of clear and transparent procedures for the UIA and other relevant
government agencies to facilitate investor access to land makes it difficult to monitor this
process and ensure it adheres to the letter and spirit of the law. For example, there are no
criteria for assessing the technical feasibility of proposed investments or determining which
investors should have preferential access to lands held by the UIA or other government
agencies. The UIA apparently consults with the Ministry of Agriculture on the feasibility of
agriculture projects, but details on this process were unavailable.
The lack of clear procedures for identifying and compensating legitimate claimants to either
private or government lands allocated for investment is particularly problematic. The
Investment Code Act does not specify how to determine who is eligible to receive
compensation, the criteria for determining the value of compensation, or the actor
responsible for implementing (or monitoring) this process. In practice, numerous actors are
reportedly involved in the compensation process, including the investor, the UIA, the ULC,
the Chief Land Valuer, and District Land Boards, and various other local authorities, including
the local council. The Land Act (Section 59(1)(e)(f) authorizes the District Land Boards to
“compile and maintain a list of rates of compensation payable in respect of crops, buildings of
a non-permanent nature and any other thing that may be prescribed” on an annual basis.
The situation is further complicated where investors acquire government land, as the
government authority with rights to use this land may also be involved in the compensation
process – despite lacking the legal authority or competency to do so. In some cases, the
compensation process has apparently been handled by the Office of the Prime Minister.
Regardless of which actors are involved, the lack of transparency and accountability
governing the identification and compensation of rights holders risks undermining the
legitimate rights of owners and especially occupants.

Then National Land Policy has as one of its strategies to protect the land rights, including
rights of citizens in the face of investments with measures for, but not limited to:
   i)     Clear procedures and standards for local consultation;
   ii)    Mechanisms for appeal and arbitration;
   iii)   Facilitation of access to land by vulnerable groups, smaller-scale land owners and land users
          in the face of large scale farming interests, and
   iv)    Protection against degradation of natural resources and sensitive eco-systems
                                                                                                   165
LGI-15(iv) Contractual provisions regarding benefit sharing are publicly disclosed
The Constitution in Article 244 provides for benefit sharing n regard to the extractive
industry only. The National Land Policy 2013 in its strategies provides that “ Government will
put in place measures to promote long-term benefit sharing arrangements rather than one-off
compensation for loss of land rights in respect of investment by supporting alternative
operational business/production models between the locals and investors (such as contract
farming schemes for small holder farmers, out growers schemes, equity sharing schemes, use of
leaseholds and joint ventures)” (GoU 2013: 29).
The overall lack of transparency that currently surrounds land acquisition for agricultural
investments in Uganda complicates credible analysis of investment outcomes and increases
opportunities for fraud and corruption. By making these data public, the government and
investors can manage expectations about investments, and citizens can hold both investors
and government authorities accountable to their responsibilities. This information can also
be used to inform policy debates about the contribution of domestic and foreign investment
to national policy objectives.

Non-proprietary information about all approved investments should also be made public,
particularly those involving government land acquisition. The Access to Information Act
requires this as a transparency measure. A recent global review of the information required
to improve transparency in large-scale land acquisitions (Global Witness, et al. 2012)
concluded that the information below should be made public about all approved
investments:

a) The identities and responsibilities of all Parties involved in the investment

      Names and affiliations of all parties involved in the investment
      Financial intermediaries and investors, capital investments and deposits

b) Rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the implementing Party

      Land area and location and nature of rights awarded
      Business plan (excluding any proprietary information)
      Terms for local employment and other forms of benefit sharing
      Cost-benefit analysis
      Value of land, rents, and fees
      Tax liability
      Monitoring and reporting obligations and penalties for non-compliance
      Dispute resolution mechanisms and jurisdiction(s) applicable for foreign investments
      Closure plans

c) Impact assessment and mitigation plans

      Environmental impact study/assessment and management plan
      Other impact assessments (e.g., socio-economic) and mitigation plans
      Resettlement and compensation plans

                                                                                              166

LGI-16(i) Information on spatial extent & duration of approved concessions is publicly
available
Despite lacking clear legal authority to acquire land for investors, the UIA has acquired
several rural properties for allocating to agricultural investors. Although the UIA does not
use the term “land bank” to refer to these properties, the National Land Policy (GoU2013: 29)
does envision creating such an institution. The UIA does maintain a registry of lands acquired
by UIA and allocated to investors. This registry specifies the terms of the land deal, including
the property name, name of investor, effective date, land area, location, period of lease,
premium paid, annual ground rent, and date the ground rental payment is due annually. UIA
registry data remains private except at the request of the investors.
There is lack of publically available data on the land acquisition process and its outcomes
undermine effective monitoring and increase the likelihood of abuse. The UIA does not have
sufficient resources to monitor even the most basic information about approved investments.
With the exception of the six rural properties the UIA has directly allocated to investors,
neither the UIA or the ULC collects data on the amount of land investors have acquired for
agricultural production or the processes through which investors have acquired farmland.
There is no map or publically available registry of government lands allocated to investors.
Nor does the UIA monitor the outcomes of these investments in terms of, for example, job
creation, income generation, or rural development. In fact, since its creation in 1991, the UIA
has not been able to determine whether approved projects were actually operational (Mitti
2011). This makes it impossible to determine whether approved projects have, at a
minimum, met the objectives specified in the Investment Code Act, including job creation and
“locally or regionally balanced socioeconomic development” (Section 12(c)(e)).
The lack of data on the land acquisition process and its outcomes also precludes effective
monitoring that could inform current policy debates on the role of foreign investment in
developing Uganda’s agricultural sector. It also obscures aggregate statistics on how much
farmland foreign investors have acquired in contravention of the Investment Code Act.
                                                                                                                           167
Furthermore, the lack of publically available data on the land acquisition process increases
the likelihood that such transactions will be subject to manipulation by powerful interests.
Making the land acquisition process more transparent – especially for government lands,
which should be used for the benefit of all Ugandans –will be particularly critical to ensure
that agricultural investment leads to sustainable and equitable development in Uganda.

LGI-16(ii) Compliance with safeguards on concessions is monitored & enforced
effectively & consistently
There is no clear regulatory framework for monitoring compliance. Panellists however
strongly proposed that in the absence of Government processes, which take a long time to
institute, NGOs should play a third party monitoring for compliance role as they have the
best interests of the citizens at heart. There may exist investors within the jurisdiction of an
NGOs area of operation. NGOs should take more responsibility and monitor compliance,
reporting widely to ensure the investors behave.

LGI-16(iii) Avenues to deal with non-compliance exist & allow to obtain timely and fair
decisions
Currently, there is no monitoring and auditing framework. It makes it difficult to assess non
compliance by investors. There is need to develop a regulatory framework to ensure that
avenues are availed for this exercise.




PANEL 6 - PUBLIC PROVISION OF LAND INFORMATION: REGISTRY AND
CADASTRE
Land administration is a function, which entails the mobilization of institutional mechanisms
and personnel for juridical, regulatory, fiscal and cadastral components development. Land
rights administration involves the process of determining, registering and availing
information about ownership, value and use of land and its associated resources.

Land Administration operates within two parallel systems comprising a) the traditional
customary/informal systems governed by customs and norms of given communities and b)
the centralized statutory/formal (state) system governed by written law. The two are not in
harmony and often lead to confusion as the institutional arrangements are not clearly spelt
out and the two systems are not at the same level of development (GOU-NLP 2013:32).

Land rights administration in Uganda has contributed to land rights insecurity as a result of
lack of proper record keeping, inaccuracies in land registry process, fraud and forgeries in
the land administration system.

This theme considers five (5) indicators with 18 dimensions.



17 MECHANISMS FOR RECOGNITION OF RIGHTS
The table below presents findings of the LGAF on rights recognition.

17   i      Land possession by the poor can be                         There is a clear, practical process for the formal recognition
           formalized in line with local norms                         of possession but this process is not implemented effectively,
           in an efficient & transparent process                       consistently or transparently
17   ii    Non-documentary evidence         is                         Non-documentary forms of evidence allow full recognition of
           effectively used to help establish                          claims to property when other forms of evidence are not
           rights                                                      available
17   iii   Long-term unchallenged possession                           Legislation exists to formally recognize long-term,
           is formally recognized                                      unchallenged possession but applies only to one specific type
                                                                       of land
17   iv    First-time registration on demand                           On-demand registration “does not include proper safeguards
           includes proper safeguards &                                to prevent abuse” or costs exceed 5% of the property value
           access is not restricted by high fees


LGI-17(i) Land possession by the poor can be formalized in line with local norms in an
      efficient & transparent process
Article 237 of the Constitution recognizes customary tenure and this is reinforced by the
Land Act Cap 227. This means that rights under customary tenure, in which over 80% of the
Ugandan population are found now vests in them as formal tenure and they acquire
ownership rights as such based on the customary norms and practices of their particular
communities. Apart from Acholi, Lango and Teso for whom practice directives have been
developed to improve transparency and efficiency in customary land administration, the rest
of the tribes of Uganda do not have codification of custom. Throughout Uganda’s history,
customary law was not codified but left to evolve and develop according to changes in
society. Codification has only begun in the last five years with land in northern Uganda.

Panel discussions delved into the lack of transparency and equality in the practice of
customary tenure which creates inequalities. For example, rights of a widow would not be
treated equitably as are the rights of a widower to land. These inconsistencies and
discriminatory practices need to be dealt with if transparency is to be achieved.

LGI-17(ii) Non-documentary evidence is effectively used to help establish rights
Approximately 20% of land in Uganda is registered (MLHUD 2013). This means that rights
recognition must apply informal mechanisms. Throughout Uganda, non-documentary
evidence is effectively used to help establish rights. Boundaries are demarcated using natural
markers such as ant hills, streams, hill tops, trees, shrubs or stones. These are respected and
known. Ascertainment of ownership is often witnessed by the clan/ council of elders or the
family head.

S.5 (1) of the Land Act provides that a person, family or community holding land under
customary tenure on former public land may acquire a certificate of customary ownership in
respect of that land. An individual, male or female, or a family may apply to the family or clan
to transfer to him/her/it, his/her/its portion of land and may cause that portion to be
surveyed and transferred to the applicant and registered (Section 22(1)). The holder of a
certificate of customary ownership may convert his/her holding to freehold (Section 9). A
customary Tenure Registry is non- existent. However, the Land Act provides that non
recordation of customary rights does not extinguish ownership under customary tenure.

                                                                                                                            169
LGI-17(iii) Long-term unchallenged possession is formally recognized
Article 237(8) of the constitution recognizes bon fide Occupants. The Land Act in Section
29(2) defines a bona fide occupant to mean a person who before the coming into force of the
Constitution had occupied, utilized or developed any land unchallenged by the registered
owner or agent of the registered owner for 12 years or more.

The Land Act further provides that any person who has purchased or otherwise acquired the
interest of the person qualified to be a bona fide occupant shall be taken to be a bona fide
occupant (Section 29(5) of the Land Act).

Panel discussions affirmed that the unchallenged occupation does not and is not permissible
on all lands. For land under trusteeship either as a public trust e.g land belonging to religious
bodies or tribal trust as is the case with Buganda, no alienation by long term occupancy can
happen. The dwellers on these lands are licensees and can only occupy such lands as long as
the bodies managing them on behalf of their constituents do not require the land for any
development.

LGI-17(iv) First-time registration on demand includes proper safeguards & access is
not restricted by high fees
First time registration undertakes a formal process clearly stipulated in the Land Act Cap
227, by application to the Area Land Committee who on receipt determines, verifies and
marks the boundaries of the land. This process involves the participation of all neighbors to
ensure that the land identified belongs to the rightful owner and there is permission for this
person to individualize or for a family to register it as family land. If it is communal, a
constitution must be in place to govern how the communal land will be managed and
administered. The process includes the demarcation of easements and rights of way, natural
resources found on the land that are of national importance of community collective use.
Adjudication is undertaken in accordance with and applying the customary law of the area.
The Committee sends its report to the District Land board and it is on that basis that the
district Land Board will determine the registration of the Land either as freehold, leasehold
or customary.

Panel discussions revealed that the high cost of registration arises from the high costs of
survey. This is the main reason why Government is promoting systematic demarcation, as a
way of government subsidizing the cost of registration.

LGI-18(i) The total cost of registering a property transfer is low
The total cost of registering customary tenure is UGX 20,000 less the 1% stamp duty which is
the value of the land and the cost of surveying which is privatized. The fees payable are listed
in the table below.

Panel discussions emphasized the need to consider the holistic picture of transacting in land.
There are non-official transaction costs such as legal fees, which are often high but not
factored in the transaction costs. When such costs are not included, it does not give a true
picture. These costs are however unregulated and are difficult to standardise.

 LGI-18(ii) Information in registry records is linked to maps that reflect current reality
There is a challenge with verifying the accuracy of land data because there is no complete
record of data in the land offices both at the central government and Local Government land
offices.

The Cadastral map below reveals that more than three quarters of the country has either no
cadastral information or incomplete sheets. This is exacerbated further by the fact that there
are no updates to these cadastral sheets. The existing data is more than 30 years old. This
therefore does not reflect the current realities.

The Computerization process whose phase one concluded in 2012 has to date captured
mostly Mailo data although the verification exercise is still ongoing. The table below
compares the titles entered in the data base and those sorted through the computerization
exercise. By 2010, the Mailo register was largely cleaned out although the constitutionally
recognized rights of tenants and spouses are still not covered, creating many gaps in the
system.

Through the PSCPII project, six pilot areas were selected and the maps in these areas were
scanned

Panel discussions revealed that although it is ideal for every title to be linked to the map.
There are some discrepancies in the data. Blue pages for example do not have deed plans,
thus, these titles have approximately 100 acres with a solid boundary (surveyed) but
subdivisions within the block cannot be clearly identified because they are not surveyed. A
consultancy was commissioned to address the issues of blue pages but the results are not out
yet.

It should be born in mind that only 16-20 % of the land in Uganda is surveyed. Even then, for
the surveyed land, here are minimal discrepancies between the data in Entebbe office and
what you find on the blue prints in lands. This is resulting from lack of regular updating of
the systems. The LIS made some efforts and a lot is yet to be done.



                                                                                                      172
LGI-18(iii) All relevant private encumbrances are recorded.
The common encumbrances registered are mortgages, caveats forbidding change in
proprietorship and caveats under the succession Act.

The Caveats on matrimonial land and property to be lodged by spouses are rarely registered
mainly because spouses have not lodged these caveats. This caveat does not lapse as long as
the marriage subsists and is mandatory (Section 39of the Land Act). But this is not enforced
as such.

Rights of tenants by occupancy on registered land must be entered onto the encumbrance
page of the certificate of title. These have neither been recognized in the newly developed
land information system nor has a mechanism been developed for their recordation.

LGI-18(iv) All relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded.
Not all relevant public restrictions are recorded such as easements, restrictive covenants and
Profits a` prendre are recorded. This is due to the absence of maps and land use information,
making enforcement of these restrictions difficult.

Panel discussions revealed that rights of way although the most common restriction included
in every certificate of title, it is only the districts of Mukono and Wakiso implementing it. This
shows that there is a challenge with enforcement and compliance.

LGI-18(v) There is a timely response to requests for accessing registry records.
As a result of the Computerization program, the time taken to complete a search (Accessing
registry records) has reduced from more than 15 days to between 1 day and 5 working days
(MLHUD 2013:4)

LGI-18(vi) The registry is searchable.
Following the Conclusion of Phase one of the Land Information System (LIS) project in 2013,
the registry is searchable and information is availed in the shortest possible time. A public
display of the LIS was made for one week from the 25 – 29th November 2013 in which
searches were carried out for the general public at no cost.

Panel discussions revealed that currently for a search you only need Block and plot number.
This is a special serialization that enables the identification of a particular parcel. This system
poses a challenge for documentation of customary rights to land, which tenure has no unique
identifier. The LIS is designed to use either the name or the parcel. However, staff are used o
searching using the parcel identifier number.

LGI-18(vii) Land information records are easily accessed.
The ongoing project to develop a Land Information system for Uganda aims at making land
records more accessible and thus reducing transaction costs.

The Kampala Mailo Registry operations were reorganized to improve the workflow in the
Registry to be more responsive to Clients’ needs. This improved Registry workflow
management and made Registrars more accessible to the Clients when necessary.

The land information records at the other offices still have challenges and are work in
progress.

19.1 Information in public registries is synchronized to ensure integrity of rights &
reduce transaction cost
Information in Public registries is not synchronized. The critical registries are the birth and
deaths registry, Marriage registry, and the Land Registry. These three registries need to be
synchronized to reduce fraudulent dealings on land and delays in land transactions. This
would also drastically reduce the transaction costs.


19.2 Registry information is up-to-date and reflects ground reality
Only the information in pilot districts through the zonal Offices are up to date. In the Ministry
of Lands, Housing and Urban Development report 2013, the following achievements are
registered.
 Updating of Titles and correction of problem Titles was completed for Jinja, Mukono,
   Masaka, Mbarara, Wakiso and Kampala

    Leasehold and Freehold Titles were transferred from Kampala headquarters to Jinja,
     Mukono, Masaka, Mbarara, Wakiso and Kampala MZOs

    All the Maps from the 6 MZOs were taken to Surveys and Mapping Department – Entebbe,
     to ease the updating and digital reconciliation of Cadastral Map Data.

    Digital Title and Cadastral Data was uploaded for the Jinja, Mukono, Mbarara, Masaka,
     Wakiso and Kampala Ministry Zonal offices.

    Digital Title and Cadastral Data was uploaded for the MLHUD Headquarters – which will
     for the time being handle titling for the rest of the country, except for Mailo titles which
     are being handled in Mityana, Fort-Portal, Bukalasa; Native Freeholds in Fort-Portal and
     Adjudicated Freeholds in Kabale and Rukungiri (MLHUD 2013:16).

LGI-20(i) The registry is financially sustainable through fee collection to finance its
operations
Fees for Land Services are charged to the consolidated fund and not re-invested in land
services delivery. This means that the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban development
depends on budget allocations from the central Government through the Ministry of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development to fund its budget. This is risky as the central
government has never in its history prioritized financing of the land sector activities. This
makes the registry not financially sustainable.


LGI-20(ii) Investment in registries & cadastre is sufficient to respond to future
demand for high quality services
All the developments in the registry and cadastre have been supported through project
funding by the World Bank. Should this funding cease, it will be impossible for the ministry to
support the delivery of high quality land services.

LGI-21(i) Fees have a clear rationale, their schedule is public, and all payments are
accounted for
All fees are payable into the bank and a receipt given to the client. They are made public and
are published in the Uganda Gazette, on the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban
Development Website, and on the notice boards of the Registry.

LGI-21(ii) Informal payments are discouraged.
The Land Sector has been marred by corruption, in which the informal fees are much higher
than the official fees. The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development has developed
a client’s charter and published the official fees in a bid to cub corrupti on. The Ministry of
Lands, Housing and Urban Development has further undertaken a public campaign to
sensitize the public on the official fees payable. Furthermore, the Whistleblowers Protection
Act and the Anti-Corruption Act have been used to prosecute corrupt officials in the Ministry.

Panel discussions revealed that despite the existence of all the above administrative
mechanisms, there is a tendency of group dynamics to override the intentions of the law.
Staff protect each other from the long arm of the law and this has perpetuated corruption as
the aspect of informal payments may be difficult to trace.

As a mitigation measure, the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban development has put
systems in place for 6 zonal offices that clearly restrict public physical access of the registers
by creating public areas and restricted zones. The public is not supposed to directly interact
with the Registrar. The system automatically assigns registrars to the different transactions.
This system is only functional in Mbarara, Masaka, Mukono, Kampala, Luweero and Jinja.

LGI-21(iii) Service standards are published and regularly monitored.
Service standards were published in 2012 on the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban
development. This website is currently under construction and not available. It is doubtful
that any changes have been made since then.

Panellists underscored the importance of having monitoring for compliance guidelines
instituted to improve effectiveness and efficiency.


PANEL 7: LAND VALUATION AND TAXATION
The fees and taxes relating to land services are charged with regard to various pieces of
legislation as outlined in the text that follows.

Article 191 of the constitution empowers the local governments to levy, charge, collect and
appropriate fees and taxes in accordance with any law enacted by Parliament. The Local
Government Act (1997) Cap 243 in line with the Constitutional provision and mandate in
its section 80 empowers local governments to levy, charge and collect fees and taxes
including rates, rents, stamp duties, registration and licensing fees, and taxes included in the
fifth schedule of the Act. Under regulation 11 in the fifth schedule, a district council and an
urban council shall impose under the provisions of the Local Government (Rating) Act, rates
on property that is within its area of jurisdiction. A district or urban authority may enact
laws imposing rates on persons owning, occupying or in possession of land or buildings in
any area to which the Local Government (Rating) Act (2005) does not apply. Under
                                                                                              176
Regulation 13 (c) of the Fifth schedule, local government revenue shall consist of rents from
lease of property owned by the Local Council.

The power to set land fees and other related charges under the Local Government Act is
vested with the Minister responsible for lands under the section 93(2) (b) and (c) which
provides that the Minister may, by statutory instruments, make regulations to fix fees to be
charged for the preparation of any documents for or in connection with any disposition or
dealing in land and to fix charges to be made by a board or commission in respect of
agreements or other documents for the occupation of land.

This theme analyses two indicators and six dimensions.


22 VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON CLEAR PRINCIPLES, APPLIED UNIFORMLY, UPDATED
REGULARLY, AND PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE

The table below presents findings of indicator 22 and its two dimensions.

          process of property              market prices, but there are significant differences between recorded values
          valuation                        and market prices across different uses and types of users; valuation rolls are
                                           updated regularly
22   ii   Valuation rolls are              There is a policy that valuation rolls be publicly accessible and this policy is
          publicly accessible              effective for most of the properties that are considered for taxation

LGI-22(i) There is a clear process of property valuation.
The process of property valuation in Ugandan law is clear. When appraising real estate, the
valuer considers two separate entities: land, which is the non-wasting portion of the real
estate; and improvements, which are the wasting portion subject to various forms of
depreciation. Land and improvements are frequently valued separately so that the trends
and factors affecting each can be studied. However, the final analysis for an improved
property must be as a unit.
The first step in this kind of land valuation is identifying the property. The valuer must know
the size and location of the subject parcel. Once the land has been properly identified and
described, an analysis of the subject can be made. The analysis should include the collection
of site-specific data, a study of trends and factors influencing the value, and the physical
measurement of the site. The term site means more than just “land”. A site is a parcel of land
that has been made ready to use for some intended purpose.

Once the subject is analyzed, the assessor must classify the land. Land may be classified as
residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural depending on its primary use. Zoning can
be important in determining land classification because zoning ordinances often prescribe
exactly what uses are permitted for the property.

                                                                                                                      177
Land, in a general sense, can be unimproved (raw) or improved (ready for development).
Land that is undeveloped, or in agricultural use, is considered unimproved. Land that has
been developed to the extent that it is ready to be built upon is considered a site. A site
analysis requires the collection and analysis of information about trends and factors affecting
value. However, environmental values are currently not taken into account in the course of
valuation. Furthermore, there is no clear procedure for considering the rights of secondary
and derived users of land. The system seems to be based on individualized primary rights
holders only.

The appropriate unit of comparison is typically determined by the marketplace as sites are
bought and sold. There are six acceptable methods of establishing unit land values.
1. Sales Comparison Method
2. Allocation Method
3. Abstraction Method (Also known as extraction or land residual technique.)
4. Capitalization of Ground Rent
5. Land Residual Capitalization
6. Land Build-up Method

Panellists affirmed that the valuation methods used today tend to leave most of the people
worse off than they were before. Examples were given of the compensations that happened
in Buliisa District over the oil exploration in 2013. Most people were still camping at the Sub-
county Head quarters by January 2014 because the value they got as compensation could not
enable them easily acquire land anywhere else.

The principle in valuation today is to leave those being compensated in the condition that
they were found but not necessarily to make them better off. Another project, the oil palm
project in Buvuma Island was considered where the government valuers were used and the
appropriate values are estimated. People who were compensated were able to purchase land
from the mainland. Furthermore, in Kalangala district, a road is under construction and this
has affected some farmer crops. Information on the expected returns from Palm oil was
provided to the chief Valuers office to facilitate the process. Proper rates were determined
and the compensation was successful. In Amuru however, valuation rates were very low as
compared to Hoima whose valuation rates were very high. The difference existed because of
the advocacy campaign against compensation rates that happened in Hoima. This means that
there is no hard and fast rule about valuation in Uganda.

It was however noted that new products and services are not captured immediately in
valuation for example carbon sequestration in the Forestry Sector.

The challenge identified with regard to this was that in Uganda, when information is given
about a proposed development, speculators rush to acquire land in those areas in order to be
compensated. This flaws the whole process.

                                                                                            178
LGI-22(ii) Valuation rolls are publicly accessible.
Valuation rolls in Uganda are outdated throughout the country and are not publicly
accessible. Property rating dates back to 1948 when the first valuation roll was produced for
Kampala. In the early 1990s, Uganda adopted a “valuation-pushed” strategy updating and
expanding the valuation roll in Kampala. Due to the lack of in-house valuation expertise, local
private sector valuers were hired through the World Bank First Urban Project 1993 (Roy
Kelly 2000: 8).
Beginning in 1994, the new valuation rolls were brought into use, creating a more complete,
up-to-date property tax base. Most of the new valuation rolls were compiled for the
unplanned peri-urban areas of Kampala. The reform also trained valuers within Kampala to
maintain the valuation rolls. The total technical assistance package was several million US
dollars over the 3-5 year period.
The new valuation rolls increased the revenue potential but property rates collections
actually declined from Ush2.9 billion in 1994/95 to Ush 1.9 billion in 1997/98, a decline of
over 30 percent. Thus, despite an investment of millions of dollars for new property
valuations, property revenues actually fell substantially, forcing a re-evaluation of the reform
strategy (Roy Kelly et. al 2000: 8).
In 1999, Kampala adopted a “collection-led” implementation strategy, expanding its focus to
overall administrative improvements on revenue collection, enforcement, taxpayer service,
and fiscal cadastre construction. Since August 1999 a pilot project has been testing simplified
field data collection procedures for updating the existing property tax information and
possibly introducing a simple mass valuation system. These innovations will provide the
basis for generating increased property tax revenue (Kelly and Montes 1999) and
(Okellokello and Nsama-Gayiiya 1996).
There is urgent need to develop a comprehensive and complete cadastre-comprising a
physical cadastre (cadastral surveying information and mapping), a legal cadastre
(ownership information) and a fiscal cadastre (for taxation purposes). The Cadastral map
below reveals that more than three quarters of the country has either no cadastral
information or incomplete sheets. This is exacerbated further by the fact that there are no
updates to these cadastral sheets. The existing data is more than 30 years old.
Valuation rolls exist in almost all municipalities and towns in Uganda bur the inclusiveness of
these cannot be determined as there is no complete cadastre on which these should be based.
There is also a very unclear framework upon which the valuation rolls are based.

The window of opportunity is the Land Information System (LIS) which is being developed.
The Computerization process whose phase one concluded in 2012 has to date captured
mostly Mailo data although the verification exercise is still ongoing.

Panel discussions revealed that all districts have valuation rolls for urban lands but that
there are no rolls for rural lands because valuation rolls do not apply to rural land. Valuation
rolls are meant for taxation and rural land is often not taxed. Valuation rolls are updated
regularly (only for urban areas) given that taxes are the main sources of revenue.


                                                                                            179
For cases where valuation rolls are missing, it is not by accident that they are missing. A lot of
influence peddling goes on in the taxation sector. It is not surprising that some properties are
paying values that were estimated 10 yrs ago irrespective of the land use change.

LGI-23(i) Exemptions from property taxes payment are justified and transparent.
The Exemptions provided for in the law narrow the tax base and increase the tax burden on
the poor and small businesses. This is therefore not justified.
According to the Government of Uganda Study on the Legal Framework for Land
Administration – focusing on the Local governments Rating Act, “Property” means
immovable property and includes a building (industrial or non-industrial) or structure of any
kind, but does not include a vacant site. So, vacant sites are exempt15
Section 3(5) provides that “for avoidance of doubts, no rate shall be levied in respect of a
residential building in a place not being in an urban area. This implies that all residential
buildings outside the city council, municipal council or town council are exempt even when
they are rented. This makes neither political sense nor economic sense. The implications are
that in Seeta (which is not an urban area by the definition of the law) owners of rented
residential properties do not pay property rates while those who own commercial properties
pay! Where is the equity principle?
Section 3(4) limits the ratable properties outside an urban area to commercial buildings only
as it reads “notwithstanding subsection (3) the rate may be levied in any area outs ide the
urban area in respect of a commercial building. While this section extends property taxation
powers to district local governments, it at the same time limits them to taxing only
commercial buildings. What about industrial properties in the districts?
Owner-occupied residential properties are now exempted from property rates following an
amendment which was directed by the President just a few months after the new rating law

15In many jurisdictions, vacant sites in urban areas are taxed for revenue purposes, as well as to prevent land speculation. Vacant and
underutilized land in urban areas should be taxed so that keeping land for speculative profits should be avoided.

                                                                                                                                  180
came into force. All along owner-occupied residential properties were liable to property
rates. It ought to be appreciated that the main aim of any property rating system is to raise
revenue for provision of services by the local authority. Rating is defined as a method by
which residents of a particular area contribute money to share the burden of the cost of
providing services to themselves within their area. Equity demands that the cost of local
services should be equitably shared between all classes of rate payers and fair as between
rate payers within those classes16. An equitable tax should take cognisance of the benefits
received by the rate payers as well as his ability to pay tax. People who decide to reside in
their own houses consume the same services as those who decide to rent out their houses.
This type of exemption is likely to induce evasion on the part of the discriminated property
owners (GOU 2010).
It ought to be appreciated that exemptions and favorable treatment for particular types of
property can remove significant contributors from the property tax base. If owner occupied
property merits favorable tax treatment, then the tax rate could be made lower than the rate
on equivalent renter-occupied property.

Panel discussions revealed that the practice of tax exemptions although done by Ministry of
Finance is not transparent process. There is no clear procedure or guidelines made public to
guide tax exemption. However, the budget speech 2013/14 suspended tax exemptions.

LGI-23(ii) Property holders liable to pay property tax are listed on the tax roll.
Section 20 of the Local Government (Rating) Act provides that “A valuation list shall come
into force with effect from the commencement of the financial year next after the one in
which the chairperson of the valuation court certifies it.”
The amendment to the new law, i.e. The Local Governments (Rating) (Amendment) Act, 2006
requires that the Chairperson of the valuation court shall certify and sign the draft valuation
list with the approval of the Minister.

Panellists underscored the high level of undervaluation of properties in Uganda causing
financial loss. The lack of mechanisms to check this has perpetuated the practice and it has
become the norm. Very few properties are actually paying the designated tax. Because of lack
of records, the information is difficult to verify.



LGI-23(iii) Assessed property taxes are collected.
The Ministry of Lands Study on Revenue generation in 2006 revealed from the scanty
information available, there is a large under realization of the revenue sources potential. It
was observed that through all the years and for most forms of revenue the realized/actual
revenues are at big variance with the projected/budgeted revenues. The performance is
estimated to be at less than 50 percent. The collection rates are extremely low and
enforcement against non-compliance is virtually nonexistent. Fiscal cadastre information is
incomplete and out of date. There is an over-reliance on individual parcel valuation—with no
use of simpler mass valuation techniques. Each country struggles with low property tax
administrative capacity and a lack of political will for property tax enforcement. The result is

occupants enjoy have to be weighed against the visible flow of rents from rented properties

low revenue yields, vertical and horizontal inequities and economic inefficiencies (GOU
2010).
Across the Districts various reasons were advanced with the most common being that
naturally people hate taxes, biting poverty exists among the population, difficulties
encountered in tax collection and political interference in revenue administration. Stamp
duty is collected and paid only in Kampala with no other outlet. Furthermore, the lessees are
reluctant to pay ground rent. On the contrary, there were other taxes that seemed easy to
collect with the common ones being premium fees, application fees, building plan fees,
Construction fees and application fees. The most and usual reasons cited were that its
mandatory for fees to be paid before one can build (MWLE 2006).
For Jinja and Kampala due to lack of capacity to collect rates from the existing large numbers
of property rate-payers, particularly in the case of Kampala where the number is estimated
to be around 40,000 Led to the contracting out the tax collection service. Jinja, Kampala,
Mbarara and a few major towns in Uganda have more and more properties springing up in
the peri-urban areas, often in unplanned neighborhoods, making it more difficult to collect
property rates. The new approach of contracting out collection of this tax might reduce the
burden on the administration of these urban authorities. In addition, the complexity of
property ownership, including the legal existence of customary tenure within urban centres
(as noted earlier) is one of the factors that make it difficult to collect property tax (MWLE
2006).
BOX 1: DEFICIENT PROPERTY TAX ADMINISTRATION IN KAMPALA
The seriously deficient administration of the property tax in Uganda exemplifies the difficulties this tax has in
providing substantial revenues to local governments in Africa. Although any local authority has the legal right to
levy property taxes, in practice they are levied only by municipalities and town councils.
Undeveloped land is not taxed, which inhibits the efficient use thereof. The property tax is based on seriously
outdated valuations, which are very low, although the law requires that valuations be carried out every five
years. Many valuable properties are not taxed at all, and many newly refurbished buildings have not been re-
valued. Systems of recording and valuing properties are seriously deficient. This is partly because the skilled
technical staff needed to organize and supervise valuation work is in short supply.
The city of Kampala also shows a phenomenon that is taking place in many other metropolitan areas in Africa.
Its urbanized area has expanded beyond its municipal boundaries, but neighboring districts are either not
allowed to levy property tax on residential properties, or abstain from doing so because they still have to
provide the basic urban services to these areas. Low revenue is also attributable to poor collections, huge delays
in payments, or simply to non-payments. Non-payments also derive from the high mobility of persons, frequent
property sales/exchanges, and the inadequate registration of titles.
(Odd-Helge Fjeldstad and Kari Heggstad 2012:15)

The panellists identified lack of transparency and corruption as the reason people do not
willingly pay taxes. People do not see what their taxes do and this is a deterrent to
compliance.

LGI-23(iv) Receipts from property taxes exceed the cost of collection
There is hardly any data on land revenue sources and revenue collection performance in the
local governments and this is one of the biggest problems as it makes revenue monitoring
and planning difficult. The local government budgets normally tend to group the revenues
from land under the code for miscellaneous sources of local revenue. This makes it difficult to
isolate land revenues from other revenues hence hampering the assessment of revenue
performance and projection (MLHUD 2006).

PANEL 8: DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Land related disputes are among the most prevalent types of disputes occurring with and
among communities in Uganda both in the rural and urban areas. These disputes are fuelled
by a number of factors, which include: population pressures, unfair land tenure regimes,
changes in land laws, lack of clearly demarcated boundaries, backward and discriminatory
customary laws and practices, inheritance practices, outdated statutory laws,
underdeveloped land markets, lack of a modern land information system as well as
inaccessibility to available land information.

Land disputes do not only stifle investment on land, they also divert scarce resources (labour,
time and money) to solve them, thus impacting negatively on productivity and household
income generation, resulting into heightened poverty levels. Quite often land disputes result
into destruction of property and, in extreme cases, even loss of lives. Very often, the disputed
land becomes a ‘no-go’ area and is not available for use while the dispute lasts, which results
in the withdrawal of a critical factor for wealth-generation from productivity. Thus, there is
obvious need to find effective ways of resolving and/or mitigating land disputes particularly
for poor households. Inadequacy and in many cases, lack of information and knowledge
about land rights is a cause of fraudulent land dealings due to ignorance and at times lack of
concrete information about a given land parcel and the attendant land rights, especially
within communities. Lack of information about land seriously impacts on poverty levels in
that communities do not have the basis on which to effectively protect their land rights and
to plan for the development of their land at optimal productivity levels (Obaikol 2007).

Land tenure on its own is relatively insignificant as a determinant of investment (relative to
credit supply, market access, etc.), but in conjunction with other economic, social and
political factors can influence investment levels. At the household level, insecurity of tenure
or the structure of tenure rights do impact on certain types of investment, for example the
construction of permanent structures or the planting of permanent income-generating trees.
A high prevalence of land disputes in the absence of an effective and equitable mechanism for
their resolution also leads to economic losses through delayed or deferred production and
investment. Even among groups whose tenure is believed to be relatively insecure (e.g.
customary landowners) the prevalence of land related disputes is clear evidence of
insecurity.

Lack of transparency and accountability which is perpetuated by inequitable systems and processes
in the Land Sector institutions contributes to the inequality of land distribution and land insecurity
due to lack of the appropriate mechanisms to resolve land problems. On titled land, and in particular
in urban and peri-urban areas, tenure security is undermined by the inaccuracy or incomplete nature
of land records as a result of poor record keeping, out-dated systems, processes and records which
result in the proliferation of land disputes. The situation is compounded by the fact that the Land
Register has got divorced from the real and current situation on the ground, which situation has been
exploited by fraudsters who impersonate landowners, declare living persons dead or vice verse, forge
certificates and illegally sell land to unsuspecting buyers etc.

A robust property system will always generate a fair measure of land disputes. For land held under
customary tenure, disputes are often part and parcel of social reconstruction in specific community
                                                                                                  183
     settings. The Land Act, 1998 under decentralization, established an elaborate structure of land
     tribunals (implemented under a circuiting model) and appointment of adhoc mediators, initially
     under Ministry of Lands, later transferred to Ministry of Justice. It is also common for dispute
     mediation to be undertaken by the offices of Resident District Commissioners, Local Councils and
     traditional organs (chiefs and clans) (MLHUD 2009).

     Therefore under the Land Act, new devolved machinery for land dispute resolution was
     established, consisting of dedicated Land Tribunals at district level. The role of Land
     Tribunals in land dispute resolution in Uganda is stipulated in the LSSP as being: “to provide
     for easier accessibility to justice by landowners and users, by moving away from the formal
     court structure whose ambience is intimidating, complicated and alienating”. The processes
     of the law courts system were seen as being too expensive and time consuming to the very
     often poor ordinary landowner and user, and are characterized by a high rate of case backlog
     and delays in the conclusion of land cases. Access to justice and dispute resolution in regard
     to the land sector was identified as having a direct connection with good governance and
     contributes to poverty eradication, and was therefore highlighted as a priority area for LSSP.
     The provision for Land Tribunals at district level was intended to combine easy accessibility
     with enhanced fairness of the system, as well as affordability and expeditiousness to the land
     owners, land users and the Government alike, in land dispute resolution, within the specific
     provisions of the Land Act.

     Accessible and fair land dispute resolution is critical to tenure security especially for poor
     and vulnerable groups. Under LSSP the dispute resolution system will be based on local
     courts at the lower level, strengthened to improve the transparency and fairness of their
     decisions, with an upper tier of impartial appointed Tribunals to consider higher value cases
     and appeals.

     This theme considers two indicators with their seven dimensions.

LGI-24(i) There is clear assignment of responsibility for conflict resolution.
According to a study carried out by Makerere Institute for social Research in 2003, over the
last 20 years, it has become apparent that multiple law regimes and dispute resolution
mechanisms are a precursor to land disputes. Apart from the multiple law regimes, which
create a different set of problems, the number of options available to decide the disputes
complicates matters. There are currently 5 different land disputes resolution mechanisms, 3
of which are basically quasi judicial organs set up under the 1998 land Act in an effort to
bring land services closer and more acceptable to the users. These are 1) The traditional
institutions (clan leaders and elders), 2) Local Council courts, 3). Magistrates courts, 4)
Mediators and 5) Land Tribunals.

Multiple dispute resolution mechanisms impede quick disposal of disputes, as the number of
the options available to decide any given dispute complicates matters by leading to a
tendency on the part of the litigants to resort to try all the available avenues, sometimes at
once, a phenomenon known as ‘forum shopping’. The study referred to Mijumbi’s (2002)
pertinent questions with regard to forum shopping as:
                     Nature of dispute;
                     The first level of contact for arbitration;
                     The reasons for the choice;
                     Whether or nor the dispute was resolved to the satisfaction of the
                      affected parties;
                     Cost, duration in solving the dispute;
                     Impact of the dispute to the households involved.
The study therefore concluded that the availability of options through which land disputes
can be resolved has dual effects on the operations of the dispute resolution mechanisms and
to the litigants, which are:
      the options provide choice to the litigants but,
      they are also used to create stalemates by staying execution of judgment, confuse and stifle
       the resolution of processes resulting in backlogs of unresolved cases.
Article 243 of the 1995 constitution of Uganda provides for establishment of a law which is
the Land Act (as amended),
       “to provide for tenure, ownership and management of land; to amend and consolidate
       the law relating to tenure, ownership and management of land; and to provide for other
       matters related or incidental matters”
This is contained in the preamble of the Land Act, 1988.
Whereas the Land Act consolidated, the law relating to tenure, ownership and management
of land, the then existing laws like Registration of Titles Act, Succession Laws, Local Council
(Judicial Powers statute the Local Councils Act No.12/2006 seem to have alienated them
instead. The inconsistencies eventually led to operational problems especially dispute
resolution. The same has been worsened when new legislation is made without due care to
Land Act that provided fundamental changes following the 1995 Constitution of Uganda.

                                                                                               185
Whereas the Land Act (S.76A) provided for Parish/ward LC.II) as Courts of first instance in
land matters with appeals to sub-county (LC.III); District Land Tribunals and High Court, S.32
of the Local Council Courts Act, No.12/2006 provides for LC.I (village) as court of first
instance with jurisdiction to try land matters [S.10 (1) e].Appeals lie here from to LC.II, III
and Chief Magistrates and High Court. This inconsistence leaves out tribunals in the appellate
structure of land matters. There is every need to harmonize these laws especially in
appellate jurisdiction.
Whereas, S.29 of the Land Act provided for lawful and bonafide occupant, it does not give
comprehensive definitions for each and more often than not, it confuses most people affected
later alone lawyers alike. A precise and clear legal definition should be sought to provide
simplified remedies to those affected in the two categories as distinct by removing the
ambiguity.
The controversial S.39 in the Land Act should actually be provided for under the domestic
relations law (bill) instead of hereof where it has proved impotent. Whereas the law is in
place, unless it is a court matter, spouses and other beneficiaries. Consent is omitted in land
dealings with the major reason being that it is hard to find, unless in a village setting, land
where both sustenance and residence are obtaining. The principles of tenancy in common
and joint tenancy should be left at will than legislation.
Common interests of communal land users; association is also not feasible as cost effective.
An amendment to the effect of compulsory, government systematic demarcation as was done
in Kenya would be a better option to clear this problem once and for all than selected areas
accessible to the land fund under S41 (Land Act).
Special powers of rectification of certificates of title or instrument, cancellation are so
arbitrary that in many occasions have occasioned miscarriage of justice especially that they
cannot be challenged in courts. An amendment should be targeted to having the District
Land Courts (Tribunals) reserve these powers of not only adjudicating but also orders of
matters of titled land that they will have heard and determined.
This will reduce on not only delayed justice but also backlog of cases at High Court where
each judge has over 400 cases per annum Chad Registry records. The Judicature Act (Ss.3 –
18) provided for the structure of courts of Judicature and had for under stable reasons as to
them having been under Ministry responsible for Lands and also for nomenclature of
“Tribunals”. Article 262 of the Constitution considers Tribunals whatsoever named as courts
under subordinate category.
In Masalu Musene & others vs. Attorney General; constitutional case No.5 of 2004 land
tribunals were excluded from judicial officers not taxable with a reason that they were quasi
judicial for operating under Ministry responsible for Lands. However, upon transfer to the
Judiciary, only change of nomenclature from “tribunal” to “court” should be done and Article
237 providing for land tribunals separately will be rendered redundant if not call for a
separate statute than Land Act to serve Land Tribunals as special Land Courts within the
Judiciary.
It is also common for dispute resolution to be undertaken by the President’s Officer (Director
for Land Affairs), and the offices of Resident District Commissioners. This situation has left
the justice-seeking public confused, delays in settlement of disputes and creates a backlog as
                                                                                           186
disputes escalate. It should be noted that the multiplicity can only be positive if it is creating
variety rather than confusion amongst users to the extent that they are viewed as
complimentary (both formal and informal). However the duplicity in roles, hierarchy and
jurisdiction needs systematization, while recognizing the values and incorporating the roles
of traditional institutions in defining the functions of statutory institutions (Rugadya
2009:21).
The Land Sector Strategic Plan (2001 – 11) sought to simplify the land dispute resolution
framework by modifying the version of the structure as provided in LA98. LC2 and LC3
Courts will handle the bulk of cases at parish level and below. Appeals will be to District
Land Tribunals which will operate on a circuit basis. Higher level cases will be handled
through the High Court and Court of Appeal as normal.
The sector supported land administration by strengthening the Land Police Protection Unit,
the High Court Land Division, and rolling out land courts in magisterial areas. The sector in
addition fast tracked the Registration of Titles Act together with the Ministry of Lands. This
has led to decongestion of registries through the creation of sub- regional offices (JLOS 2013:
14)
Furthermore, Land courts have been rolled out by the Judiciary to reduce backlog and
streamline the land justice delivery system (JLOS 2013:44)
Mediators
Mediators are provided for under the laws Land Act (S.89) procedure [Rule 6(6)] on adhoc
basis as a mandatory form of ADR before full scale hearing commences.
The legal position that is in line with the normal Civil Procedure Rules, scheduling conference
procedure (0.10) is well intended and a very acceptably short form of adjudication.
However, the remuneration of mediators is not forthcoming as funds have never been
provided save difficulty in maintenance of same mediators, being adhoc and to each case not
area. There is an apparent need to streamline this area and put ADR – (mediation) to
performance. Probably the two members could handle the mediation and later a full scale
hearing proceed at a quorum of 3 including chairpersons upon failure to succeed in the
mediation.
The Judicature (Mediation) Rules No 10 of, 2013 provide for mediation of all civil actions
filed in or referred to the High Court and any subordinate to the High Court. The court shall
refer every civil action for mediation before proceeding for trial. Where a civil action has a
question of law which may dispose of the civil action the registrar or authorized court officer
shall refer the civil action to a Judge or Magistrate, whichever applies, or determination.
Mediation under these rules may only be conducted by—
(a) a Judge;
(b) a registrar;
(c) a magistrate;
(d) a person accredited as a mediator by the court;
(e) a person certified as a mediator by CADER; or

                                                                                              187
(f) a person with the relevant qualifications and experience in mediation and chosen by the
parties.

LGI-24(ii) Conflict resolution mechanisms are accessible to the public.
The Legal Aid Baseline Survey and Needs Assessment (2006) found that there are specific
factors that impact on access to justice for the people of Uganda, especially the poor and the
factors include the high cost of litigation, lack of awareness of rights, technicalities in using
the formal justice system, attitudes and orientation of personnel in the justice system, lack of
co-ordination among legal and service providers, gaps in the monitoring the quality of
services provided, breakdown in the justice system in war affected areas, and aspects of
social difference as a basis of marginalization (age, health status and gender).
According to the 2004 National Service Delivery Survey Report (NSDS), 80% of the
households are located more than 19 km from the High Court; 66% are located more than 10
km from the District Land Tribunal and 48.8% from the Magistrate’s Court.
Regarding the quality of and satisfaction with legal services, NSDS inquired about the time it
took to resolve the issue/case as a proxy for effectiveness. Overall, 66 percent of the cases
took less than one month however, with significant variations depending on the institution
contacted. The District Land Tribunal, the High court and the Magistrate’s Court were
reported to have taken long to resolve cases. For all cases presented to the District Land
Tribunals 73 percent had taken more than six months; 46 percent of cases for the Magistrate
court an 59 percent for the High Court had taken more than six months to be resolved. The
District Land Tribunals had nearly 53 percent of cases pending while the customary courts
had the lowest percentage of pending cases 4.6%.
Regarding costs, 52.3% of the respondents in the survey reported that they had made
payment to District Land Tribunals (official and unofficial payments for the services they
received). The households that made payment before their issue/case was resolve were
asked the purpose of payment. Of concern is the payment of unofficial charges which is an
impediment to access and utilization of services. Bribery was highest (33.0%) in the central
police; 16% in the High Court; 16% in the Magistrate’s Court; 11% in the District Land
Tribunals; 7.3% in the LC1 Courts. Bribery was least common in the customary courts where
only 2.7% of the households paid a bribe.
Panel discussions revealed that the institutions are available but not empowered. The
dispute resolution structures are available by law but on ground they seem not to exist. This
is mainly due to lack of supervision and financing of these structures. The institutions that
are uniformly found across the country are the clan systems although their functionality
varies across communities.

The challenge with the lower local dispute resolution institutions such as the LC courts is
their lack of ability to actually document processes that they go through. The second
challenge lies in conflict of interest where the LC council may be comprised of relatives in a
given village. In the Land Act (amendment) of 2004 powers were shifted from LC1 to LC2 to
minimise conflict of interest. In practice however, LC2 is not very functional and in many
communities the structures are not existence. LC 1 and 3 are more vibrant. LC 2 courts are
supposed to be trained in dispute resolution, but the extent to which they do their work is

                                                                                             188
very questionable. Furthermore, the decisions reached by LC 2 courts should be executed.
This is proving impossible in practice with the absence of a formal registry. Most of the
decisions end up with no written records.

LGI-24(iii) Mutually accepted agreements reached through informal dispute
resolution systems are encouraged.
Alternative Dispute Resolution is encouraged through the use of mediators or the traditional
leaders. The courts of law now apply ADR for most cases before going into formal hearing.
According to the JLOS baseline survey 2012, public confidence in the enforcement of existing
laws stands at 29%, use of ADR generally is at 80% but only 26% of the cases in courts and
tribunals are resolved through ADR. The Services of legal aid are recognized by government
as crucial to resolving land disputes.
The Justice, Law and Order Sector is working to ensure that there is a functional legal aid system that
integrates the state brief; standards for legal aid provision and complements the pro-bono scheme;
and low cost models of legal aid. A legal aid policy was finalized and approved by the JLOS Leadership
Committee and only awaits Cabinet approval. In anticipation of the approval work commenced on the
proposed draft Legal Aid Bill to implement the policy
At the Uganda Law society, provision of legal aid services through the Legal Aid Project and
pro bono services continued following the opening of 3 new Legal Aid Clinics in the districts

through the legal aid clinic. Of these, 4,691 were new clients representing 56.1%. The male

Court while 774 cases were concluded through mediation. Also 804 cases are pending
mediation in ULS while 3,503 cases are pending in Court. In total 1,378 clients received legal
advice, 337 were referred to pro bono scheme while 57 cases were closed for lack of merit
(JLOS 2013:57).

centres focusing on specific issues notably on how to resolve land conflicts, family disputes especially
related with custody and child maintenance as well as criminal law.
Justice Centres Uganda continued to resolve disputes through Alternative Dispute Resolution. This
Period, 689 cases (329 female, 360 male) were processed through ADR/ mediation with 321 (151
male and 170 female) cases successfully resolved through ADR. 294 cases are in the final stages of
conclusion, while 74 cases failed because the parties failed to reach a compromise and as such they
were filed in court.
Most successful cases during the period have been family and land related matters. However,
even though most family matters have been addressed and a memorandum of understanding
signed during ADR, there is need for continuous monitoring to ensure that the memorandum
of understanding is being implemented (JLOS 2013:58).

and signed by the parties. The agreement shall be filed with the registrar, magistrate or
authorized court officer responsible for mediation in the court. The agreement filed with the
registrar, magistrate or authorized court officer responsible for mediation shall be endorsed
by the court as a consent judgment. Where there is no agreement on all the issues subject to
mediation, the mediator shall refer the matter to the court. There shall be no appeal to any
order granted under these Rules except as part of a general appeal at the conclusion of the
civil action in respect of that mediation.
Alternative Dispute Resolution is encouraged through the use of mediators or the traditional
leaders. The courts of law now apply ADR for most cases before going into formal hearing.
According to the JLOS baseline survey 2012, public confidence in the enforcement of existing
laws stands at 29%, use of ADR generally is at 80% but only 26% of the cases in courts and
tribunals are resolved through ADR. The Services of legal aid are recognized by government
as crucial to resolving land disputes.
The Justice, Law and Order Sector is working to ensure that there is a functional legal aid system that
integrates the state brief; standards for legal aid provision and complements the pro-bono scheme;
and low cost models of legal aid. A legal aid policy was finalized and approved by the JLOS Leadership
Committee and only awaits Cabinet approval. In anticipation of the approval work commenced on the
proposed draft Legal Aid Bill to implement the policy
At the Uganda Law society, provision of legal aid services through the Legal Aid Project and
pro bono services continued following the opening of 3 new Legal Aid Clinics in the districts
of Mbarara, Arua and Soroti. In the reporting period, a total of 8,359 clients were handled
through the legal aid clinic. Of these, 4,691 were new clients representing 56.1%. The male

Panel discussions affirmed that there are local mechanisms for dispute resolution that are
respected by society but difficult to adopt because they are not clear and accepted by all, for
example, they may seem alien to the youth. For these systems to gain legitimacy, they need to
be documented, and they themselves need to document the dispute resolution processes
undertaken, making them more transparent and known to everybody. These mechanisms
work well in customary communities with elders who are often respected and have
legitimacy to mediate and resolve disputes in a particular community. In Mailo land settings
and other registered land, this is not often the case. An institutionalized ADR system must be
established to resolve disputes over registered land.


LGI-24(iv) There is an accessible, affordable and timely process for appealing disputed
rulings.
Appeals are required to be filed within 14 days of passing of judgment. In the Supreme
Court, of the 40 cases filed, only 12 cases were disposed of. This was attributed to lack of
Coram. In the Court of Appeal, of the 963 cases filed, only 205 Appeals were disposed of due
to lack of Coram, bias on hearing constitutional petitions and failure to hold sessions outside
Kampala, a practice that had previously proved very successful (JLOS 2013: 17).

It is however, not possible to determine form the data available whether these courts are
accessible and affordable. It is evident thought that they are not efficient in disposing of land
maters.

LGI-25(ii) Conflicts in the formal system are resolved in a timely manner.
The Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs’ Integrated Study on Land and Family
Justice in 2008 found that Land disputes constitute the largest portion of disputes in the
formal courts. Many times they will be disguised in the criminal courts as trespass or arson,
while in the family court they emanate as succession and inheritance disputes. A baseline
survey carried out in 2002 by K2 Consult (U) and commissioned by the Justice Law and
Order Sector (JLOS) under the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, shows that land
and property disputes rank second highest (15%) among the cases received in 1998 in the
table below.

The findings from the Joint Survey on Local Council Courts and Legal Aid Services in Uganda
found out that land disputes ranked also highest (16%) of the disputes reported at the LC
level and this finding closely matches with findings from Criminal Justice Baseline Survey,
2002 (Table 4 below). According to the survey, land disputes were mainly related to
boundary markings, encroachment (particularly in Kibale district), eviction of ‘bibanja’
holders, sale without spouse’s consent, demand for access-ways, double selling, arising upon
separation and divorce and inheritance matters. The LC Courts have been found to be the
most utilized dispute resolution for a particularly in the rural communities where the
majority of Uganda’s population reside (LCC/Legal Aid Baseline Survey, 2006). The LCC can
therefore easily deal with some types of land ownership especially the customary because
these require natives of the village to identify land boundaries

LGI-25(iii) There are few long-standing land conflicts (greater than 5 years).
There is no readily available literature synthesizing the long standing disputes. However, in a
study by Godfrey Kaweesa (2012), the finding was that a civil case does not take less than
eight (8) years to move from the High Court, through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme
Court. This does not take into account cases that may have emanated from Magistrates
Courts to the Higher Courts. Litigating respondents were not only fatigued about the process
of litigation, but also decried the high costs involved.



PANEL 9: INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS & POLICIES
The Ugandan constitution was adopted on October 8, 1995 by the interim, 284-
member Constituent Assembly, charged with debating the draft constitution that had been
proposed in May 1993. Uganda's legal system since 1995 has been based on English common
law and African customary law (customary law is in effect only when it does not conflict
with statutory law). It is in this constitution that land tenure and land rights are enshrined.
The Ugandan judiciary operates as an independent branch of government and consists of
magistrate's courts, high courts, courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court. Judges for the High

                                                                                              194
Court are appointed by the president; Judges for the Court of Appeal are appointed by the
president and approved by the legislature. The decisions of the courts form the body of law
in Uganda by setting precedents.

Uganda embraced a decentralized system of governance based on the District as a Unit under
which there are lower Local Governments and Administrative Unit Councils. Elected Local
Government Councils which are accountable to the people are made up of persons directly
elected to represent electoral areas, persons with disabilities, the youth and women
councilors forming one third of the council. The Local Government Council is the highest
political authority in its area of jurisdiction. The councils are corporate bodies having both
legislative and executive powers. They have powers to make local laws and enforce
implementation. On the other hand Administrative Unit Councils serve as political units to
advise on planning and implementation of services. They assist in the resolution of disputes,
monitor the delivery of services and assist in the maintenance of law, order and security.

The Local Governments in a District rural area are:
  The District
  The Sub-county



The Local Governments in a city are:
    The City Council
    The City Division Council

The Local Governments in a Municipality are:
    The Municipal Council
    The Municipal Division Council
The Town Council is also Local Government

The Administrative Units in the rural areas are:
    County
    Parish
    Village

The Administrative Units in the urban areas are:
 Parish or Ward
 Village


The Local Government Act, 1997 gives effect to the devolution of functions, powers, and
services to all levels of Local Government to enhance good governance and democratic
participation in and control of decision-making by the people. The law also provides revenue,
political and administrative set up of Local Governments as well as election of Local Councils.

The powers which are assigned to the Local Governments include powers of making local
policy and regulating the delivery of services; formulation of development plans based on
locally determined priorities; receive, raise, manage and allocate revenue through approval
                                                                                           195
and execution of own budgets; alter or create new boundaries; appoint statutory
commissions, boards and committees for personnel, land, procurement and accountability;
as well as establish or abolish offices in Public Service of a District or Urban Council.

The central Government is responsible for national affairs and services; formulation of
national policies and national standards and monitoring the implementation of national
polices and services to ensure compliance with standards and regulations. Line ministries
carry out technical supervision, technical advice, mentoring of Local Governments and
liaison with international agencies.

Land administration is an important factor in the maintenance of community identity, i.e.
sovereignty. The State has a residual duty to ensure that its land resources are not used in
such a manner as to sabotage the public welfare. This more often than not is expressed in
legislation to regulate land use and defend public interest. The quality of land rights is often
enhanced and not eroded when account is taken of the overall goals and aspirations of the
judicial principles, which create and protect them. Thus, Land rights are only as secure as the
political and social context in which they are required, enjoyed and transacted. Land
Administration is an important factor in the constitution and enjoyment of property rights as
it converts tenure regimes into resource management, challenges and strategies.

The principle of good governance as applied to the stewardship of land resources has led to
the growth of participatory stakeholder designed and driven structures and infrastructure
operating on the basis of transparency and cost effectiveness. Land Administration function
is thus not merely the means through which State interest in private property is expressed; it
is also an incident of responsible stewardship of land resources.

Land administration is a function, which entails the mobilization of institutional mechanisms
and personnel for juridical, regulatory, fiscal and cadastral components development. The
review below highlights the significant achievements of law and policy toward land
administration in Uganda.

In Objective X, the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 imposes a duty upon the state
to take all necessary steps to involve the people in the formulation and implementation of
development plans and programs which affect them. In pursuit of this objective, Article 32
recognizes the significant role women play in society and imposes a duty on the state to take
affirmative action in favour of marginalized groups on the basis of gender for purposes of
redressing imbalances, which exist against them.

The Constitution decentralizes the land administration function. The lead ministry for the
delivery of land services is the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment, through the
Directorate of Lands. A number of branch offices around the country had been established to
provide local land services (surveying, mapping, valuation and registration). However, they
largely operated as a “post box” service for the headquarters since the center handles most of
the services. In light of the Constitution, The ministry remains with the functions of quality
assurance, policy formulation and offering of technical assistance.


                                                                                            196
     The Constitution under Article 238 – 240 establishes the land management institutions, thus
     the Uganda land Commission and the District Land Boards. It also prescribes the functions
     for each of these institutions. While the Constitution prescribes the membership, procedure

     LGI-26(i) Land policy formulation, implementation & arbitration are separated to
     avoid conflict of interest
     The Functions of Policy formulation, implementation and arbitration are clearly distinct and
     separate these are the Land Sector Reform Coordination Unit and; the Land Management
     Institutional Framework that supports the day to day delivery of land services at various
     levels. The mandates of each unit are clearly defined below. Arbitration is two pronged.
     There is the administrative disputes resolution which falls under the Ministry of Lands
     directly under the directorate of land management and then the Judicial dispute resolution
     which falls under the Mandate of the Ministry of Justice and constitutional Affairs and the
     ministry of Local governments.
     Land Policy Formulation: Policy formulation is a function of the Executive. The Minister
     responsible for lands holds this mandate. For operational purposes, the Minister is supported
     by the Land Sector Reform Coordination Unit. It is responsible for facilitation of policy, legal

                                                                                                                               197
and regulatory framework development and the promotion of good governance in the land
sector. It is responsible for strategic planning and visioning for the land sector through the
development of the Land Sector Strategic Plan.
Implementation: The Land Management Institutional Framework that supports the day to
day delivery of land services at various levels. It is also responsible for policy, legal and
regulatory framework implementation, administrative land dispute resolution (with
emphasis on alternative dispute resolution), provision of public information on land rights,
Geomatics and land information, promotion of good governance, effective and efficient
delivery of land services, and planning for implementation of land sector reforms
Arbitration: A distinction is made between judicial land dispute resolution and
administrative land dispute resolution. The former comprises disputes arising out of civil or
criminal wrongs that have a cause of action with remedies granted by a court or informal
dispute resolution system. This mandate falls with the Ministry of Justice and constitutional
Affairs for matters that go to formal courts of law and Ministry of Local government for
matters at the local level through the Local council courts. The later (administrative dispute
resolution) comprises of disputes arising out of the work and functioning of land rights
administration and these disputes require administrative remedies. This is the mandate of
the land management.

Under dispute resolution, there is often conflict between the Ministry of Local Governments
and Ministry of Justice over who has the supervisory mandate over the Local council Courts.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development understood
Alternative dispute Resolution as squarely falling under its mandate. The Ministry of Justice
considers this its mandate as well. This creates challenges in streamlining the land justice
delivery structure.

LGI-26(ii) Responsibilities of the ministries and agencies dealing with land do not
overlap
There is a clear definition of roles governing the functioning of the Ministry and other
agencies dealing with Land. All land agencies are statutory creations. The Ministry gives
policy direction to the following autonomous and semi-autonomous institutions.
Uganda Land Commission (ULC): The Uganda land commission (ULC) was established by
the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda. The constitution provides for the setting up
of Uganda Land Commission as an autonomous body; and at the commencement of the
financial year 2006/2007, Ministry of Finance Planning & Economic Development created a
vote for Uganda Land Commission.

The Vision of the Uganda Land commission is, “all Government land and property thereon,
secured, effectively managed and historical land injustices resolved”.

Mission Statement: The mission of Uganda Land Commission is, “to effectively hold and
manage all Government Land and property thereon and resolve all historical land injustices”.

Objectives

To ensure the effective and efficient management of all Government land & property thereon.
                                                                                          198
To develop & maintain an updated inventory and data base for all Government land and
property.

To ensure that all Government land is titled and secured

To ensure proper use and accountability of the land fund

To enable bona fide and lawful occupants acquire registerable interest.

National Housing and Construction Company: This is a Ugandan public enterprise that
was established by the National Housing Corporation Act of 1964. The act was later repealed
by the 1974 Decree to form National Housing and Construction Corporation.

The functions of the corporation were:—

 develop, build and manage housing                 sell upon deferred terms of payment or

  estates developed or to be developed or
                                                    corporation to any local authority or
  managed by the corporation and to let or
                                                    person willing to undertake such
                                                    management; and

In July 2002, the Corporation became a public limited liability company known as National
Housing and construction Company Limited.
The Company’s mandate is to increase the housing stock in the country, rehabilitate the
housing industry and encourage Ugandans to own homes in an organized environment. It’s
vision is "To transform people's lives and communities by providing affordable and well-built
housing."
On the 10th December 2009 National Housing and Construction Company rebranded
changing its image with a major objective of promising Ugandans Value for money as it seeks
                                                                                           199
to increase the housing stock in the country, rehabilitate the housing industry and encourage
Ugandans to own homes in an organized environment.
The company aims at creating the reality of home ownership in well-planned and permanent
built environments.
Housing Finance Bank Ltd: Incorporated as a private company under the Companies Act in
December 1967, the Bank has become a household name and has grown in leaps and bounds
with a good track record among the pioneers of a mortgage lending. National Housing &
Construction Corporation, a parastatal involved in real estate business has 0.82%, National
Social Security Fund (50%) and the government of Uganda (49.18%). It exclusively
undertook the mortgage business and for a long time enjoyed monopoly in the market. Later
on went on to acquire a commercial bank license on 9th November, 2007 and finally became
a fully fledged Commercial Bank on the 2nd of January, 2008.
The bank provides affordable financing options for home development and acquisition, and
promotes a culture of saving amongst Ugandans.
The National Physical Planning Board: Is created by Section 4 of the National Physical
Planning Act No 8of 2010. The Board is responsible for ensuring orderly, progressive and
sustainable urban and rural development through appropriate physical planning.
The functions of the Board are:—

In the absence of the Board, the Minister may perform its duties on the advice of the head
of the national physical planning department.
The Act sets up planning committees at the district, urban and local levels. At the district
level, section 9 of the Act establishes the District Physical Planning Committee with the
following functions: to cause to be prepared local physical development plans through its
officers, agents, or any qualified planners; to recommend to the Board development
applications for change of land use; to recommend to district council subdivision of land
which may have a significant impact on the contagious land or be in breach of any
condition registered against a title deed in respect of such land; to approve development
applications relating to housing estates, industrial location, schools, petrol stations,
dumping sites or sewerage treatment, which may have injurious impact on the
environment as well as applications in respect of land adjoining or within a reasonable
vicinity of safeguard areas; to hear appeals by those aggrieved by decisions made by the
district physical planner and lower local physical planning committees; to ensure the
integration of physical planning into the three year integrated development plan of the
district; and to exercise supervisory powers over all lower planning committees and to
ensure integration of social, economic and environmental plans into the physical
development plans.

At the urban planning level, section 11 of the Act establishes the Urban Physical Planning
Committees which are mandated with the following functions: to cause to be prepared
urban or local physical development plans and detailed plans; to recommend development
applications to the Board for change of land use; to recommend to the urban council,
subdivision of land which may have significant impact on contiguous land or in breach of
any condition registered against a title deed in respect of such land; and to determine
development applications relating to industrial location, dumping sites or sewerage
treatment which may have injurious impact on the environment as well as applications in
respect of land adjoining or within a reasonable vicinity of safe guarding areas and to hear
and determine appeals made against decisions of the urban physical planner or
subordinate local authorities.

At the local level, the Act recognizes that the sub-county councils shall constitute local
physical planning committees with the following functions: initiate the preparation of local
physical development plans; recommend to the district physical planning committees the
approval of local physical development plans; implement structure plans in close
consultation with the district physical planner and implement in close consultation with
the district physical planner, detailed plans and area actions plans which shall address the
matters such as the treatment of a particular planning aspect like residential,
transportation, water supply, sewerage, in part or as part of a long term plan; advisory or
subdivision plans, indicating permitted subdivision, use and density development; and the

                                                                                        201

The Architects Registration Board: The Architects Registration Board was established
by an Act of Parliament in 1996 to regulate the architects' profession in Uganda. It is an
independent, public interest body and our work in regulating architects ensures that good
standards within the profession are consistently maintained for the benefit of the public
and architects alike.

Section 4 of the Architects Registration Act Caps 269 enumerates the functions of the Board
as:
      To regulate and maintain the standard of architecture in the country;
      To register architects;
      To make byelaws for better carrying into effect the provisions of this Act;
      To prescribe or regulate the conduct of architects in Uganda;
      To promote training in architectural sciences.

Its work is overseen by a Board of 6 members. By law, two of the members are appointed
by the Minister of Lands, Housing and Urban Development while the other four members
are selected by the Uganda Society of Architects.

The Board is responsible for regulating and maintaining the standard of architecture in the
country through registering Architects, making Bye- laws for the better carrying into effect
the provisions of the Statute, regulating the conduct of Architects and promoting training in
Architectural Science.
The Surveyors Registration Board: The Surveyors Registration Board is created by
Section 2 of the Surveyors Registration Act Cap 275 of 1974 to regulate and control the
profession of surveyors and the activities of registered surveyors within Uganda, and to
advise the Government in relation to those functions. The board may do all such things as
are calculated to facilitate or are incidental or conducive to better carrying out its
functions.

The Board is responsible for regulating the surveying profession in the country. The Board
regulates surveyors through registration of surveyors, disciplining of surveyors and giving
practical licenses to surveyors.




                                                                                         202
The Act permits to Board to acquire hold and in any way dispose of any property movable
or immovable.

Because the agencies are statutory creations under the same Ministry, the role of the
Ministry is maintained as regulator and overseer of the functioning of these agencies
through the Minister responsible for Lands.

LGI-26(iii) Administrative (vertical) overlap is avoided.
The Land Sector is premised on two frameworks that are complementary. The Land Sector
Reform Coordination Unit and; the Land Management Institutional Framework that
supports the day to day delivery of land services at various levels. The mandates of each
unit are clearly defined below.

Land Sector Reform Coordination Unit

Land Sector Reform Coordination Unit (LSRCU) is responsible for reform of the land sub-
sector by implementing the Land Sector Strategic Plan II (LSSP II) which provides for the
operational, institutional and financial framework for the implementation of sector wide
reforms including the implementation of the Land Act. It is responsible for facilitation of
policy, legal and regulatory framework development, promotion of good governance in
delivery of land services, and planning for implementation of land sector reforms. The
following projects are currently in implementation.

Land Tenure Reform Project
The project aims at reforming the land sub-sector by implementing the Land Sector
Strategic Plan (LSSP), which provides the operational, institutional and financial
framework for the implementation of sector wide reforms including the implementation of
the Land Act. The specific objectives are:-

        Creating an inclusive and pro poor policy and legal framework for the land sector;
        Putting land resources to sustainable productive use;
        Improvement of livelihoods of poor people through equitable distribution of land access
         and ownership, and greater tenure security for vulnerable groups;
         Increasing availability and use of land information;
        Establishing and maintaining transparent, accessible institutions and systems for
         decentralized delivery of land services;
        Mobilizing and utilizing public and private resources effectively for the development of
         the land sub- sector.



Digital Mapping Project


                                                                                             203
Digital Mapping Project is responsible for providing topographic database as a source data
for use by Natural Resource Departments at district level. The data is used by district
planners in their day-to-day work during planning for economic and developmental
activities within the district. The Project has covered almost the entire country with
exception of the North and North East areas of the country.

Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development Zonal Offices
MLHUD is establishing 21 Zonal Offices (MZOs) in every cadastral zone of Uganda. All land
title records are being transferred from Kampala to the respective MZO where all land
transactions are to be registered, and new certificates of titles issued. The MZOs are to
provide the services of physical planning, land administration, land valuation, surveys and
mapping, land registration and housing at every cadastral zone. A cadastral zone
represents a service area within which customers will conduct business with a larger
district land office to facilitate service provision and minimize the costs of establishing
District Land Offices with all the required technical officers in each district. Consolidation
of services brings economies of scale whilst maintaining a decentralized land
administration structure in the country. The proposed cadastral zones will be used for the
implementation of Land Information System (LIS) servers (each zone will host a LIS
server) which will generate unique transaction and property codes on the basis of the
named cadastral zone.

                                                                                          204
Cadastral Zones and corresponding administrative districts

The creation of the 21 cadastral zones will enable MLHUD to maintain rigid unchanging
unique identifiers can be allocated to properties for ease of management of information
about the location of each piece of land and its attributes. Unstable property identifies tend
to create uncertainties in the description of land which may make the information about
land to be unreliable and prone to errors, misdescriptions and duplications of certificates
of title. It should be noted that the use of cadastral zones does not prevent the creation of
new districts (currently 112); if new districts are established they will be allocated to one
of the 21 cadastral zones listed in the table above.

 New purpose-built MZO offices are being constructed throughout the country in order to
improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. A Land Information System
(LIS) has been established in Uganda which is to be linked to every MZO. MZOs will be the
nodes of the LIS in each cadastral zone into which all information about land in each
district within the cadastral zone will be collected, processed and validated before the
information is to be transferred to a National Land Information Centre (NLIC), which is
centrally located in Kampala. With the establishment of MZOs, the role of DLOs is to
capture field data for processing and quality assurance by MZOs before the said
information can be transferred to NLIC for use by land registry customers.

MZOs are intended to have the following benefits


                                                                                          205
       Efficient and effective land administration service delivery nearer to the people at each
        cadastral zone, including issuing of certificates of title and registration of land transactions
       Reduction of land transaction costs
       Organized and well coordinated land registration processes
       Provision of a customer focused and healthy working environment

the MZOs in land registration and cadastral activities and serves as the main provider of
land information, assures land information data exchange with other agencies.

Land Sector Working Groups
In order to ensure smooth implementation of the Land Sector Strategic Plan (LSSP), all key
aspects of the LSSP objectives have Working Groups/Focus Groups that have an official
from the LSSP Implementation Division specifically assigned and charged with the
functioning and delivery of outputs. These are multi stakeholder groups of experts
representing the Private Sector, Academia, Professional bodies and Civil Society
Organizations. This was an attempt to ensure that

   a) The sensitization focus group, for provision of information of land rights, materials
      developments and mainstreaming the concerns throughout LSSP activities;

   b) The Rules and regulations Focus Group, responsible for the development of
      appropriate regulations under the Land Act and shall also be charged with other
      rules and regulations that may arise in the process of reviewing other land related
      laws. This shall be complemented by the presence of a law review working group
      that is responsible for reviewing and revising different laws;

   c) The Systematic Demarcation working group that shall spearhead systematic
      demarcation activities under LSSP, an activity that will ensure security of tenure and
      availability of information on land parcels. It is responsible for the development of
      regulations pertaining to Systematic Demarcation;

   e) Access to Justice/Dispute resolutions focus group. This will be established to
      strengthen and complement the initial Land Tribunals Focus Group that had been
      charged with establishing operations of Land tribunals. This working group will be
      also responsible for Local Council Courts;

   f) A central/local government planning forum charged with determining and
      coordinating project support to local government and the land administration
      institutions that have a major stake in these project activities. Workshops are
      arranged biannually for these stakeholders to determine priorities and to agree on
      issues relating to accountability and programming;

Decentralized Land Management Structure

District Land Boards
Under the Land act (Cap. 227) the District Land Board (DLB) performs the following
functions, to

    a) hold and allocate land in the district which is not owned by any person or authority;
    b) facilitate the registration and transfer of interests in land;


                                                                                               211

       former controlling authority;
    d) cause surveys, plans, maps, drawings and estimates to be made by or through its officers or
       agents;
    e) compile and maintain a list of rates of compensation payable in respect of crops, buildings

    f) review every year the list of rates of compensation payable in respect of crops, buildings of
       a non-permanent nature and any other thing that may be prescribed;
    g) deal with any other matter related to the above matters.

Under the National Forests and Tree Planting Act a DLB is required to maintain a register
in which all rights and interests of any nature in respect of private forests shall be kept,
including:

   The nature of the right or interest ;
   The manner in which it came into existence;
   The name of the holder or beneficiary of the right or interest, and
   Any other information as may be prescribed.

District Land Offices
The District land Offices (DLO) provide technical services to the District Administration
and District Land Board in terms of facilitating the registration and transfer of interests in
land, to coordinate surveys and map/plan generation and to assess and collect revenue.

Every DLO is required to have the following technical officers:

    1.   a District Land Officer,
    2.   a District Physical Planner,
    3.   a District Staff Surveyor,
    4.   a District Registrar, and
    5.   a District Valuer.

With the establishment of MZOs, the role of DLOs is to capture field data for processing
and quality assurance by MZOs before the said information can be inputted into the LIS
which is linked to the NLIC.

Area Land Committees
Area Land Committees (ALC) are established at sub-county or division level. Their role is
to adjudicate upon and demarcate land. During land adjudication an ALC may be required
to resolve land disputes over boundaries or conflicting claims over land. In hearing and
determining any claim, ALC is required to use its best endevours to mediate between and
reconcile parties having conflicting claims to land.

Recorders

                                                                                                212
The Recorder at the sub-county level is the sub-county Chief or assistant Town Clerk at the
division level. The role of the Recorder is to issue certificates of customary ownership and
certificates of occupancy and to register subsequent land transactions on the basis of the
said certificates.

LGI-26(iv) Land right & use information is shared by public bodies; key parts are
regularly reported on & publicly accessible
In its study in 2008, the Ministry found that there is no sharing of information within the
various land sector institutions. It prioritized Developing a Sector Wide Approach to
Planning (SWAP) and Establishment of Project Monitoring & Evaluation Framework as an
approach that would harness close collaboration and information sharing. For this to work
however, resources will be needed to facilitate the development of management plans,
monitoring tools, and other instruments that guide the programs being implemented and
private actors in the sector. The development of a SWAP for MLHUD Sector will provide an
opportunity for further rationalization of the roles that various actors can play in long-term
strategic planning. The specific focus will be on:
      Monitoring and evaluating the project with major emphasis on value for money
      Ensuring accountability to our partners and all stakeholders


LGI-26(v) Overlaps of rights (based on tenure typology) are minimal and do not
cause friction or dispute
Overlaps on Mailo land have historically created friction and tension. Despite being the
most legislated tenure in Uganda’s history, concerns around tenant – land lord relations are
escalating requiring a once for all solution. Then Land Fund has been applied to pay off the
land owners and settle the tenants but this was unsustainable as there was not enough
money in the fund to complete the exercise. The impasse created through the multiple of
rights on the same piece of land has taken on a political face, making this a potent area for
conflict. It is the tenure where large scale eviction of tenants is experienced.

Customary tenure is currently the tenure most susceptible to abuse and violation of human
rights. There are mass evictions without compensation for lack of proof of ownership. The
constitutional provision for the option to convert customary tenure to freehold undermines
the resilience and existence of customary tenure as equal to freehold. The provision for
conversion has led to the elite and land speculators especially in the oil and mineral rich
parts of Uganda to acquire large chunks of land in the pretext that it is free land that they
can obtain free titles over. The option to convert has further exacerbated conflicts over
land as the elite and speculative purchasers of land especially in the mineral and oil rich
areas have acquired huge pieces of land without the consent of the community.


                                                                                          213
The law is silent on the definition of family head and this undermines equality as defined in
Article 31(2) of the constitution. It means that the definition of household head as
understood by customs and traditions will be upheld.




                                                                                         214

Under Land Justice, the ambiguity is found in the land justice delivery mechanisms. Ministry of Justice and Constitutional
Affairs have a conflicting mandate with the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development over management of Land
Tribunals and the execution of the mediation function. This resulted in the non- funding of the Land Tribunals and their being
rendered redundant.
Furthermore, the Judiciary is challenged by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development’s response to
     Execution of court orders and decisions
     Appearance to court of technical officers especially Registrars of title as expert witnesses.
In this, the Judiciary finds the Ministry of Lands non-responsive and therefore obstructing justice.

     LGI-27(i) Land policies & regulations are developed and adjusted to new
     circumstances in a participatory manner involving all stakeholders .
     The Land Sector makes effort to ensure that consultative processes are applied to land
     policy and regulation development. Over the past ten years, the Land Sector has engaged in
     the development of the following:
                 The National Land Use Policy 2008
                 The National Land Policy 2013
                 The National Urban Policy (in the making)
                 The Land Act
                 Mortgage Act
                 Physical Planning Act.
     There are sixteen (16) land related laws under review.
     In order to ensure participation and representative views, Focus Groups with an official
     from the LSSP Implementation Division specifically assigned and charged with the
     functioning and delivery of outputs are created for each process. These are multi

                                                                                                                              227
stakeholder groups of experts representing the Private Sector, Academia, Professional
bodies and Civil Society Organizations. Other Working groups are composed as the need
arises. Some of these are:
      The National Land Policy Working Group
      The National Land Use Policy Working Group
      Law Review Working Group
The approach adopted is that an issues paper is developed by the Consultant. This group is
mandated to analyze the papers, collect more information and input from their
constituents to enrich the process. After the initial drafts are produced, these groups
undertake a national consultative process, taking into account the different interests
groups and stakeholders. This group also receives submissions from special interest groups
and individuals. The findings are fed back to the consultant in writing for incorporations.
The final draft is subjected to a national conference with a representation of the key
interest groups and
Whereas policies have been developed, regulatory frameworks are slow in getting
amended to match the changes in the policies.

LGI-27(ii) Land policies address equity & poverty reduction goals; progress towards
this is publicly monitored
The key issues addressed by the national land policy include historical injustices, border
disputes, and the ineffective dispute resolution mechanisms, disparities in ownership,
access and control over land by vulnerable groups, displacement, land grabbing and
landlessness. The policy further addresses the underutilization of land due to poor
planning and land fragmentation, environmental degradation and climate change, poor
management of the ecological systems due to their transboundary nature and
unsustainable exploitation of natural resources arising out of conflicting land uses and
inadequate enforcement mechanisms. It tackles issues of ineffective and inefficient land
administration and management systems.
Although developed, monitoring mechanisms for these policies have not yet been
developed. Therefore indicators for reporting progress have not yet been developed and
there is no mechanism in place for public accountability.
Currently, the Land Sector Strategic Plan II is being developed and it is only then that
government priorities will be confirmed for the next ten years. It is also against the LSSPII
that a monitoring framework will be developed.

LGI-27(iii) Land policies address ecological & environmental goals; progress towards
these is publicly monitored
The Land Policies have been keen on taking into account ecological and environmental
goals both in terms of land use planning and land tenure. The Land Policy in particular has


                                                                                         228
taken a stand to re-introduce the doctrine of public trust over natural resources in a bid to
prevent the potential abuse by the Government.
Furthermore, the land policy recognizes common property resources and the need to
harness and protect these. Under chapter 6, the National Land Policy provides for the
management of natural resources and the environment, climate change. In chapter 7, it
provides for the management of transboundary resources
As stated above, Chapter 8 of the National Land Policy provides for the development of
appropriate indicators for the monitoring of land sector performance and for periodic
reporting. This however has not yet been implemented as the National Land Policy was
only made public in August 2008.

LGI-27(iv) Implementation of land policy is costed, matched with benefits and
adequately resourced.
Although Chapter 8 of the National Land Policy recognized the importance of costing to
ensure implementation, financing will depend on political will to see this policy
implemented. The Land sector does not appear as one of the priority sectors. This means
that it will keep getting marginalized even when it is land that holds up the Ugandan
economy. It is therefore likely that the costing will not be matched with the resourcing
posing serious challenges in policy implementation.

LGI-27(v) There is regular and public reporting indicating progress in land policy
implementation
There is no reporting framework in place


LGI-27(vi) Policies are in place to help to improve land access & use by low-income
groups and those who suffered from injustice in the past
The National Land Policy seeks to address historical injustices and the rights of the poor,
marginalized and vulnerable. Specifically

      The Kibaale Land Question through the application of the Land Fund to compensate
       the absentee land lords and give the land back to the Banyoro.
      Rights of ethnic minorities (such as the Batwa, the Benet and Ik who are forest
       peoples) to their natural habitats by recognizing their tenure rights to their
       ancestral lands and documenting their defacto rights to prevent evictions or
       displacements.
      Rights of pastoral communities to their lands to be protected as common properties
       and protect these lands from appropriation.
      Land rights of women and children through regulating customary law and
       enactment of matrimonial property laws that guarantee equality and equity.


                                                                                         229
          Furthermore by ensuring that women are fully integrated in all decision –making
          structures and processes in access to ad use of land.
         Rights of dwellers in informal settlements and slums through the supply of
          affordable land in urban areas and providing a framework for regularizing land
          tenure for dwellers in informal settlements and slums
         Land rights of other vulnerable groups such as displaced persons, refugees and
          people living with HIV and AIDS

  LGI-27(vii) Land policies proactively and effectively reduce future disaster risk
  Chapter 5 and 6 of the National Land Policy provide for land regulation and management.
  This is in a bid to promote sustainable use and exploitation of resources without degrading
  the resource. In particular recognizing climate change and proposing adaptation and
  mitigation measures will reduce further desertification in Uganda and mitigate the effects
  of climate change.

  International Conventions

  Uganda has signed and ratified several conventions that commit to sustainability and
  climate change mitigation, including CBD, CITES, UNFCCC, Ramsar Convention and the
  Cartagena protocol on Biosafety. And for each of the conventions, there is an office in
  charge. For example, a climate change unit was established in the Ministry of Water and
  Environment with the objective strengthen Uganda’s implementation of the UNFCCC and
  its Kyoto Protocol. A climate change policy was approved in December 2013, but there is
  need to develop action plans to operationalise the policy. With regards to CITES although

                                                                                         230
the country is fairing relatively well in the implementation, there are still some gaps as
evidenced by the reports on exporting animal products as reported by the Immigration
department. There are several media reports have often indicated cases of illegal trade in
animal products especially ivory and snakes. However, it has often been claimed that
Uganda is more of a transit country than a source for these animal products especially
ivory. In relation to the Ramsar convention, several Ramsar sites have been gazetted and
there is evidence of implementing the action plans. However, other Ramsar sites are highly
abused. Further, in line with the CBD, implementation is fairly good, but there are
resources heavily threatened such as forestry resources.

During the panel discussions, there was a clear argument as to whether the choice would
be Options B or C. Option C lacked the aspect of “it is following most of them”. It was
reported that implementation is skewed given that for some commitments the country is
performing relatively well while it has no clear implementation plans for other. Two facets
of implementation were discussed including (a) rules and regulations in place (b) evidence
of activities on ground. Further, the role of the state as a regulator and an enforcer, and the
role of citizens and CSOs was emphasised. Further, citizens should play their role and cease
from expecting all actions from government. It was also noted that some of the actions do
contradict the expectations of the international conventions. Some of the actions cited
included reclaiming of wetlands and leasing of natural forests for commercial/plantation
forestry. These arguments made the choice between Options B or C difficult. However, the
reason for option B and not C was clearly about the fact that the Country is following
almost all the commitments. That is, the all treaties have been domesticated with action
plans developed but the main challenge has been translating the actions plans into
transformational activities on ground.

Use of incentives for promoting climate change mitigation

It is important to note that given that the country ratified several climate-change related
conventions such as the UNFCCC and its Kyoto protocol, it is mandated to promote climate
change mitigation activities, and thus should provide the required incentives. However, the
use of incentives such as PES and REDD+ are still in their infant stage in the country. There
are some interventions mainly implemented by NGOs such as Ecotrust. For example, for
PES-Carbon, Ecotrust is working with smaller holder farmers under the Tress for Global
Benefit project, where farmers are able to access carbon funds following tree planting
targets. Further, the National Environment Management Authority in collaboration with
CSWCT, WWF and other stakeholders, is implementing a PES-Biodiversity project with to
enhance biodiversity conservation in the Albertine rift. In this intervention, private forest
land owners are incentivised to sustainably manage their forested lands in order to
improve habitats for mainly the chimpanzees. In addition, NEMA has undertaken a forest
resource valuation in Budongo to ascertain the ecosystem services, and thus facilitate the
planning for PES schemes in this area. Therefore, the positive and negative experiences


                                                                                           231
from such interventions are expected to provide learning points and motivation for
government involvement in initiating and implementing PES schemes.

On the government side, a climate change unit was set up in the Ministry of Water and
Environment and this serves as the Secretariat for the Designated National Authority
(DNA) for the purpose of facilitating Uganda's participation in Clean Development
Mechanisms. With regards to REDD+, Uganda is in the early stages of developing a National
REDD+ strategy for readiness activities provided by the World Bank’s Forest Carbon
Partnership Facility. A REDD+ Secretariat, headed by the REDD+ focal person has recently
been set up and it is expected to guide the government on national strategies or action
plans, policies and measures, and capacity-building for REDD+ and carbon markets.
During the panel discussions, it was noted that the implementation of REDD+ is
constrained by delayed disbursement of funds from the World Bank FCPF. However, some
non-government interventions/pilots are in place. The panel agreed that although option C
was the most appropriate, the last part of the statement was questionable. That is, the
aspect of “not considered cost-effective” was not considered appropriate given that no
substantial research has been done to validate this statement. Further, the opportunity
costs of implementing incentive schemes were anticipated to be high and there is need for
funding from development partners in order to put more value on the Forestry resources.
Further, the panel revealed that for the cases where PES pilots have been set out, the main
concerns by participating communities/individuals include low payment levels, limitation
in scope/project areas, short time-frame and limited/lack of alternative livelihood options.

resources, including land, water, wetlands, minerals, oils, fauna, and flora on behalf of the

                                                                                         232
people of Uganda. Further, almost all the laws in the environment and natural resource
sector state that resources are managed for the benefit of all citizens.

That is, the legal provisions for the public trust aspect are clearly articulated. Even the
Physical planning Act provides for a natural resource officer as a member of the district
planning committee in order to protect the natural resources during the alineation and
privatization of land, as well as any other developmental activities.

The panel discussion emphasized that although the dimension was only considering the
recognition of public good aspects by law and thus a score of A, it is important to note that
the implementation of the legal provisions is highly limited. That is, protection of the
natural resources in order to benefit the public adheres to several challenges.

Forest Management Plans
The National Forestry Authority (NFA) is supposed to take care of the national forest
reserves, other forest reserves are under the mandate of the district forest service. Each of
these forests is expected to have a forest management plan which serves a road map to
managing the resource. However, the current stand in the development of forest
management plans is low. For instance, by 2011 out of 506 reserves under NFA only 22
had management plans approved. This implies that there is minimal commitment in
addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. Further, with regards to
budgetary allocations to address the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, there
is generally minimal commitment. It is important to note that although the forestry
department in many districts contributes a lot to the district annual funds, the amounts
ploughed back in the sector are often minimal.

The panel discussion revealed that the R-PP is the only document that the country can rely
on to clearly refer to the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. Further, for the
forests with management plans, most of the objectives and strategies are focusing on how
to enhance stock with minimal emphasis/attention on directly addressing the drivers of
deforestation and forest degradation. For example, if a part of the forest is heavily
encroached by cultivators, one of the key objectives for a 5 year management plan should
be a strategy to manage/evict the encroachers. Further, NFA has several reserves in the
charcoal corridor which have continued to serves as charcoal hubs. There is a big question
on how much has been committed to addressing these challenges. The panel also noted
that there are some NGOs and CSOs undertaking interventions that aim at addressing the
drivers of DD. However, given that the dimension considered forest management plans,

    Country’s Commitment to Forest Certification

    Uganda is a signatory to the United Nations Non-legally Binding Instrument on all types of
    Forests (2008). This Instrument encourages the private sector, civil society organizations
    and forest owners to develop, promote and implement instruments, such as voluntary
    certification systems or other appropriate mechanisms, to develop and promote forest
    products from sustainably managed forests.


    With the current increase in plantation development for timber due to the support from
    Sawlog Production Grant Scheme (SPGS), certification of timber is necessary to give a good
    premium to tree growers who are practicing sustainable forest management. Charcoal is
    the main source of energy in urban areas yet the processes of production are inefficient and
    may in the long run cause degradation of existing forests and woodlands. Certification of
    charcoal would regulate the industry to ensure sustainability. Non-timber forest products
    such as rattans are used in the furniture industry but there are no standards for harvesting
    them in terms of volume that is available. They are still treated as low value forest products
    and this may result into unsustainable harvesting.

    Under the draft forest regulations, there is an attempt to support certification although
    certification in itself is still a voluntary act. WWF and the Standard development Group,
    with a secretariat at Environment Alert are working towards developing a framework.

    The panel noted that a score of B was the most appropriate given that although
    government does not require certification, the area under certification is slowly growing.
    This was attributed to the several commercial tree growers in the country who are
    targeting international markets and therefore may require certification.
    Country’s commitment to SMEs

                                                                                              234
  Although the area of SMEs in the forest sector is private-sector led, there is government
  support under Uganda Investment Authority for SMEs. Further, government legal
  frameworks to support SMEs in the forest sector are available e.g. guidelines to set up
  ecotourism and access and NTFPs. It is however important to note that although legal
  frameworks are available, the current taxation regimes may stifle the development of
  cottage industries. The government should therefore work towards improving access to
  low interest loans, market opportunities and training e.g. enterprise Uganda. Further, tax
  holidays similar to what is provided for in Agriculture should be encouraged in the cottage
  industries. For example, if you are importing agricultural equipment, some taxes are
  exempted. One challenging aspect is the lack of clear documentation of the quantity and
  quality of the forest produce to support SMEs, that is, valuations of such resources is given
  low priority.

  The panellists noted that NFA does not have clear guidelines on accessing NTFPs, as they
  are still considered minor forest products, and thus low value attached to SMEs in this
  sector. Further, there was a concern on what is hindering the people in investing in SMEs in
  the forestry sector. The discussion revealed that there are no specific incentives or
  initiatives from government to promote SMEs. Most of the initiatives are by NGOs or CSOs.
  Further, some of the panellists noted that although existence of a good legal framework is a
  necessary condition, it is not sufficient to the development of SMEs in the forestry sector.
  One of the panellists was concerned by the fact that there is often a tendency of waiting for
  the government to do everything. A question was posed “To what extent do the people
  appreciate the forests and thus be able to turn them into economic opportunities?” It was
  agreed that other stakeholders must play their role in order to realise the country’s
  commitment to the development of SMEs. With regards to favourable taxation regimes, a
  specific sector/unit within the Ministry has to push for it. An example was given about the
  environmental levy that was advocated for by NEMA. Therefore NFA should come up with a
  strategy in order to achieve this and identify the right stakeholders. Further, it was noted
  that the government/relevant unit has not identified the roles and responsibilities of the
  different stakeholders, and for this matter, the second phrase of option B is very
  appropriate “the government could do much better”

          communities by law and
          implemented


    Recognition of Traditional rights

    The supreme law of the Country which is the 1995 constitution does not recognise
    indigenous rights. And as such, the Forestry and Tree Planting Act is quite silent on this.
    However, the land policy which was gazetted in August 2013 explicitly provides for the
    forest people. Therefore, the aspect of indigenous/traditional rights could be
    representative for forest-dwelling communities. Therefore, the area of focus for this
    dimension in the Ugandan context was forest-dependent communities.



    The National Forestry and tree planting Act, 2003 states that forests shall be developed and
    managed so as to promote fair distribution of their economic, social, health and
    environmental benefits. Hence, subject to the management plan, a member of a local
    community may, in a forest reserve or community forest, cut and take free of any fee or
    charge, for personal domestic use in reasonable quantities any dry wood or bamboo.
    However, it is clearly stipulated that no materials however may be collected in the strict
    nature reserves or from sites of special scientific interest. The wildlife Act to some extent
    provides for enclave communities that derive their livelihood from the forest. Further, the
    Act provides for wildlife use rights such as extractive utilization, where access is subject to
    conditions usually stipulated by the management authority.


    The panel discussion revealed that Uganda is not a signatory of the Convention on
    indigenous people and thus the Uganda government does not legally recognise indigenous
    rights. Therefore the area of emphasis was “guarantee security of access to forest-
    dependent communities”. In Uganda, forestry resources are linked to the different land
    tenure regimes. However, there is no legislation which states that “irrespe ctive of forest
    regime, the access rights for neighbouring communities are guaranteed”. Under the existing
    legal provisions, access rights are often stipulated by the management authority. The law
    provides for security of access but the practice is supposed to be regulated (conditional) by
    the management authority. For example, the Batwa (who are one of the forest-dwelling
    communities) are allowed access to the forest in a regulated manner but are not practised
    because the restrictions are too stringent. The Batwa claim that their rights are
                                                                                               236
  indigenous/traditional and therefore such rules are not easily implemented. Further, the
  Wildlife Act Section 29(1f) clearly stipulates the wild life use rights, and the National
  Forestry and Tree Planting provides for Collaborative Forest Management (CFM) in order
  to guarantee access for forest-neighbouring communities.

  Sharing of benefits from public forests
  The wildlife Act provides for benefit sharing for forests under the Uganda wildlife
  Authority. The Wildlife Act mandates UWA to pay 20% of the park entry fees collected from
  a wildlife protected area to the local government of the surrounding area (s) for economic
  development. In some cases communities have realized their share. In addition to the cash
  benefits, UWA signs Resource Use Agreements (RUAs) with some neighboring communities
  to participate in the management of the park. The agreements differ in scope, flexibility,
  and in the roles and responsibilities of the agreeing parties. It is however important to note
  that only gate collections are shared with community members and yet the bulk of the
  funds are collected from permits which are never shared with surrounding communities.


  The National Forestry and Tree Planting Act that that forests shall be developed and
  managed so as to promote fair distribution of their economic, social, health and
  environmental benefits, the law does not provide for benefit-sharing mechanisms for the
  communities participating in forest management activities. That is, for the higher ranked
  resources like poles and timber; without clear benefit guidelines, NFA cannot provide
  proportionate returns to the communities from the different concessions. Up till now, NFA
  is using a case by case unstructured method to provide returns to participating
  communities. However, forest regulations have been gazetted highlighting the need for
  clear guidelines about benefit-sharing, and the guidelines are under development.


  The panel discussion revealed that it is important to emphasize that benefits are beyond
  cash generated and shared from entry fees and concessionaires. Aspects such as improved
  access to various forest resources that satisfy the needs of the forest-neighbouring
  communities should be emphasized. However, there was a concern on the money collected
  from park permits such as guerrilla tracking permits which are never shared with the
  forest-neighbouring communities who participate in the protection of the wildlife.

          public input.                           finalization of the land use plans


    Boundaries, Ownership and Uses of the Country’s Forest Estate

    The National Forest Plan 2013 clearly indicates that forest cover approximately 24%
    (3,604,176 ha) of the total land area. Of this, 17% is designated as Central Forest Reserves
    (CFRs) managed by NFA, 18% consists of National parks and Wild life reserves managed
    by UWA, 0.85% is jointly managed by UWA and NFA, and 0.03% are Local Forest Reserves
    (LFRs) managed by respective Local governments. The remaining 64% of forested land
    includes the large areas of forest and woodland found on private and communal lands, and
    hence managed by private and local community forest owners.

    The uses of the different forested areas under the Permanent Forest Estate (PFE) are
    clearly stipulated including ecological and biodiversity protection as the main functions for
    NPs and WRs. These areas also play an important role of bolstering ecotourism. In CFRs,
    the functions include production of forest goods and services to meet economic and social
    needs of society. However, it also important to note that CFRs of ecological and biodiversity
    importance also provide goods and services under the zoning scheme that sets aside about
    20% of the natural forest as strict nature reserves, 30% as buffer zones and 50% as
    production zones. With regards to forests on private and communal lands, the owners are
    the responsible bodies for managing these forests as long as they are registered as it is
    provided for in the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act.

    While the ownership and uses are almost clearly known especially for the PFE, there are
    gaps regarding the demarcation of these areas. Out of the 506 CFRs only 22 have
    management plans approved by the minister as required by the law. These are the only
    reserves whose boundaries can be confirmed to be clear but they also to some extent lack
    physical features that demarcate them. They are defined on the digital maps but need
    ground truthing. Forests under UWA are well demarcated and have pillars physically
    identifiable at the boundaries. However, it is important to note that at the gazettement of
    the Forest reserves, boundaries were established and therefore exist on the cadastre.
    Regular re-opening and maintenance of the forest boundaries is greatly lacking. With
    regards to other forested areas including the LFRs and forests on private and communal
    lands, hardly any clear demarcation exists.


                                                                                             238
    The Panel discussion revealed that all reserves forest were surveyed and demarcated
    (before they were gazetted and declared as forest reserves) but the markers have often
    been removed by the people with an interest of claiming land ownership beyond the forest
    boundaries. This has also happened due to lack of regular boundary re-opening and
    maintenance activities by NFA. For the forested areas under UWA, there is evidence of
    clear boundary demarcation almost in all areas. Therefore, the most appropriate score was
    D given that only 36% of the forest estate is under government and yet the 64% of the
    forest cover is on private and communal land which is not surveyed or demarcated.


    Forest Land Use Plans
    Participation in planning and decision making is provided for in the Forestry Policy, 2001
    and the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act, 2003. The Forest Act provides for
    consultation in the preparation/revision of these management plans. However, only 4% of
    the CFRs have forest management plans and none of the LFRs or forested areas on
    private/communal land has an approved management/land use plans. The Forest reserves
    under UWA have to some extent had engagement of the communities during the revision of
    the management plans. The multiplicity of stakeholders may to some extent limit the
    consideration of all the inputs from consultations, and hence, there is no evidence in
    existing forest management plans that the views of the communities are incorporated

    The panellists noted that the whole idea of involving communities has not been
    popularized. That is, in many instance, people/communities are not aware that they have a
    right to participate in the development of these plans. In other instances, some of the
    contributions (especially in terms of demands/expectations) from the public are unrealistic
    and thus are never reflected in the documents. It was further noted that there are different
    actors in the sector, and hence it may be difficult to discern everyone’s contribution in the
    final document.

Control of forest crimes

NFA, UWA and Local governments are mandated to manage forest crimes in areas of their
jurisdiction. However, there is a problem of co-ordination given that different units such
NFA, FSSD and adhoc government groups/agencies are engaged in handling almost the
same forest crimes in terms of nature and location. However, UWA is performing relatively
well in monitoring and managing forest crimes. While the National Forest and Tree
Planting Act, 2003 provides for securing permission/a licence to extract forest products,
there are no regulations to enforce this. Further, only a few areas are considered for
monitoring illegal activities.


The panellists revealed that there is some effort in controlling illegal activities especially
illegal timber harvesting although there is evidence of different key players who are not
very well co-ordinated. It was also noted that data on forest crimes is
inaccessible/unavailable which is indicative of unsystematic efforts in controlling the
crimes. After lifting of the ban on timber harvesting, a regulation was set up and FSSD was
empowered to handle illegal logging and operationalization of CITES (recommend and
monitor).

On the side of forests managed by UWA, it was revealed that UWA to some extent has a
very lucrative system of monitoring forest crimes as well as recording them. This was
however attributed to the fact that monitoring/enforcement officers are armed and thus to
some extent are able to do their work. Further, while NFA has had some efforts into this for
the forest reserves, there are several challenges. For example, the officers are often
threatened or injured/killed during the process of monitoring and enforcement. This has
been quite evident in the cases of enforcing the ban on using power saws. The other aspect
of concern was the partiality in the process. It was noted that almost all efforts are
concentrated on illegal timber harvesting and charcoal burning while other forest crimes
are often neglected.
Inter and Intra Agency Efforts to Combat Forest Crimes
Despite the fact that for improved forest governance which may include effective control of
forest crimes may require a multi-stakeholder platform, there is no reported evidence of
such co-ordinated efforts. Such efforts would be expected to be co-ordinated between the
forestry agencies, that is, NFA and FSSD, and other agencies such as the environmental
policing unit at the districts, civil society and local communities. It is evident that there are

                                                                                             240
conflicting powers and actions within the forestry agency depending on the location and
nature of the resources under monitoring. Across agencies, there is hardly any
collaboration, with the exception of cases where NFA is engaged in CFM arrangements with
the neighbouring communities.

There is an umbrella framework referred to as the Environment and Natural Resources
(ENR) working group which meets monthly and all departments including CSOs, NEMA
share on several aspects including forest crimes. However, NFA may not be fully
conversant with all the agencies fighting forest crime. On the aspect of Judges and judicial
officers, only a few are knowledgeable about the effects of forest offences. Fortunately,
NEMA has produced a compendium of all environmental laws that judicial officers can use
to acquaint themselves.

The Panel discussion revealed that within the forest agency, there is an umbrealla
framework known as the ENR sector working group which includes CSOs that hold
monthly meetings to share on several issues including forest crimes. However, given the
multiplicity of players (with different power levels) in controlling forest crime, not much is
often shared on this issue. With regards to the judges and prosecutors, it was reported that
about 1-2% are knowledgeable about the nature, extent and effects of forest offences. It
was further reported that in the past NEMA had a prepared a compendium of all
environmental statutes which was used for conducting tailor-made training at the Law
Development Centre. However, these courses are no more and thus a big knowledge gap in
the judges and prosecutors.

6.0 CONCLUSION
The Land Governance Assessment Framework for Uganda was carried out at an opportune
moment when the land reform process is just began with the passing of the National Land
Policy, the Development of the National urban Policy and the National Land Use Plan, and
the review of 16 land related laws to synchronize them with the new policy framework.
This means that a new implementation framework must be developed to ensure the
implementation of all these reforms. The policy issues and recommendations therefore,
find their place in the changing land governance context of Uganda.

The findings of the LGAF can be categorised into four major categories.
          a) Streamlining the Regulatory framework
          b) Financing of the Land Sector
          c) Capacity Development to implement the said reforms.
          d) Sustainability of land sector reforms
          e) Stakeholder participation

Streamlining the regulatory framework
The Land Governance assessment has revealed that although Uganda has excellent policies
and laws, there are no practice directives, guidelines and procedures in place to implement
these provisions. Technical staff therefore, find their hands tied and decide to either do
nothing about the situation or take the law into their own hands to get some provisions
implemented, often creating challenges and giving rise to corruption. Prioritization of
putting in place these is critical to improvement of land service delivery. The critical areas
where this is much needed is the acquisition of land for investments, divestiture of
government land and taxation and valuation.

Financing of the Land Sector.
The intensions of land sector reforms cannot be achieved if there is no political will and
public investment in the land sector. Whereas technical departments make efforts to
implement reforms and programs within the existing budget, they often fall short.
Attention needs to be paid towards building on the gains of the Land Information system
development which should see the documentation of customary rights and the multiple
layers on parcels of land that are constitutionally guaranteed rights. The urban land
question cannot be solved without investment of public resources.

To date, the land sector has heavily relied on donor funding which many times do not take
projects to conclusion. An example is given of the Government Land inventory, a process
that aimed at protection of public lands from encroachment and abuse. This leaves the land
sector to various vulnerabilities including abuse by those in urban planning has
particularly suffered due to lack of funding.
                                                                                          271
Furthermore, it is not possible to fully operationalize the land rights administration
institutions and therefore have land registries function efficiently and effectively in a
sustainable manner if there is no public investment. There needs to be an approach for the
land sector to retain some of the resources it raises to support its own sustainability.

Capacity Development
Many of the challenges in this assessment hinged on lack of technical capacity and adequate
human resource capacity to implement the provisions in the law. The key areas identified
were the use of the Land Information system which has moved from the manual to a
computerised system, the lack of capacity in valuation especially where investments and
environmental goods are involved, capacity in property tax management, capacity in
documentation and/or recordation of customary rights, especially group rights and
communal lands. This is a constraining factor to realising the gains had in the law and
policy reform processes. Understanding of gender and other secondary rights and the need
to integrate these into the land registration system land remains elusive to the technical
staff.

Sustainability of Land Sector Reforms
All land sector funds are paid out of the consolidated budget. However, the land sector has
never been a priority sector despite being the 3rd income earner for the Government
through the offer of land services. There have been major investments by the World Bank
in the land sector reforms especially the functioning of the land registries. Infrastructure
has been put in place. This needs to be maintained and scaled up because land is key not
only to the economic life of Uganda, but to the political and social stability of the country,
ingredients necessary for a conducive investment climate and sustainable economic
growth. As such, the land sector needs to set up mechanisms to retain a portion of the funds
raised in service delivery to invest in the functioning of its institutions. This reduces the
fears around budget cuts and non-prioritisation of the sector. Further it makes the sector
less reliant on donor financing to run its affairs.

Stakeholder Participation
Uganda has performed particularly well with regard to public consultation and
participation in policy development. There is however a glaring gap when it comes to
acquisition of land for investment, expropriation of public land, urban and rural land use
planning and land use change. Protocols need to be put in place to guide participation and
this enables the institutionalization of participation. Furthermore, availing information to
the public enhances constructive participation. In this regard, deliberate efforts are needed
to improve performance in this regard. This is however only possible if political


                                                                                          272
interference in the functioning of the land sector is averted and technical staff feel secure in
the execution of their mandates.



6.2 WAY FORWARD
The LGAF has been a beginning in understanding the land governance situation in Uganda.
This process needs follow on actions especially in developing
          a) The monitoring framework for the Land Sector
          b) The reporting framework for land sector performance
          c) Public provision of land information.

The Monitoring Framework for the Land Sector
The policy matrix identifies key policy issues that the Land Sector needs to consider.
Although many, prioritization is key with the participation of all key stakeholders.
Indicators that are measurable within sector capacity need to be developed including third
party monitoring of the land sector performance. Results of the monitoring need to be
shared with all stakeholders.

Currently an opportunity to include issues in the policy matrix exists with the development
of the Land Sector Strategic Plan II and the Land Policy Implementation Strategy.

Streamlining the Reporting Framework
The Land Sector should move away from reporting activities in its budget framework
papers only, which reports are important for government business to institutionalizing
reporting for public information. An annual progress report that includes the activities of
al, actors would give a complete picture of sector performance. This has never been
quantified nor captured and it is important to create a complete understanding of what
sector performance is.

Public Provision of Land Information
Once monitoring and reporting frameworks are streamlined, information that should be
made public become easier to synthesize. There is need to make this happen and to
increase public knowledge and participation in the land sector.
