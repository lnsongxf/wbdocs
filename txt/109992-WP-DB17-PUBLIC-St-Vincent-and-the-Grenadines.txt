This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2016 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2016 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the econo my at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

       Search and reserve company name

       Pre-approval of a company name is obtained by filing a request for
       name search and reservation (form 26) with the Commerce and
       Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) in advance of the related application.
       To avoid unnecessary delays, statutory instructions for form completion
       are distributed at CIPO. A fee of XCD 25 is payable to CIPO. Form 26
       makes provision for the choice of 3 alternative names.

       On receipt of a request for name reservation, CIPO will conduct a
   1   comparative search of registered business and corporate names and             1 day             XCD 25
       will consider the overall suitability of the proposed having regard to the
       prescribed restrictions. Where a name is approved, it will be reserved
       for a period of 90 days from approval. It’s recommended that all
       applicants use the name reservation procedures to avoid the
       inconvenience of having to prepare a new set of forms should the first
       chosen name be declined.

        Obtain a location plan from the Land and Surveys
        Department

        One of the requirements to apply for a building permit is to
        provide a location plan which can be obtained either from the
        Land and Surveys Department or at the Office of the Planning
   1    Board. According to the new Building regulations, this location           1 day                  XCD 5

        Receive site inspection prior to the building permit

        The Physical Planning Unit (PPU) will conduct a site inspection
        once the application for a building permit has been received.
        Once the visit is over, a decision is made regarding the permit.          1 day                no charge

        This inspection is part of the permitting process.

        Agency: Physical Planning Unit (PPU)



        Obtain building permit from the Physical Planning Unit

        To obtain a building permit, BuildCo must first obtain an
        application form and a set of conditions and guidelines for
        building. BuildCo must then submit the application, along with
        the building plans and a location map.                                   40 days               XCD 300

        Upon receiving the application and building plans, the Physical
        Planning Unit (PPU) advertises the proposed plans in the local
        newspaper for a minimum of 2 weeks to officially notify the area
        residents of the proposed commercial construction. If no
        complaints are raised and the file is complete, the PPU grants

      Though inspections are required by law, they are rarely enforced
      in practice because manpower and resources are limited. There
      are two conditions under which an inspection would certainly
      take place:
      • If there is a complaint or the Physical Planning Unit (PPU)
      suspects noncompliance or an infraction                               1 day        no charge

        Obtain inspection certificate for internal wiring

        Before applying for an electricity connection, the customer should obtain
        an internal wiring Inspection Certificate signed by the Government
        Electrical Inspector (GEI). The customer's licensed electrician (the licenses
        are issued by GEI) is in charge of the internal wiring, and the GEI has to
        inspect the internal wiring. The request for the inspection can be filed as
        soon as the internal wiring is done. The construction company should fill 14 calendar days                XCD 85

        to schedule an inspection.

        After the application is submitted the external inspection is carried out
        by St. Vincent Electricity Services Ltd (VINLEC) to check whether the it is
        possible to add the requested load. The planning department of VINLEC
        inspects the site and specifies what is required of VINLEC to meet the
        additional load. There is no need for presence of someone from the
        applicant's party. After the inspection the customer signs a connection
        offer. To reduce the delay time the applicant can submit the Written
        statement of the required peak electricity demand before the

        Once the connection offer is signed VINLEC carries out the external
        connection works. The customer is required to pay the security deposit.
        The deposit is equivalent to the value of two months’ estimated
        electricity consumption. The deposit is expected to provide security for
        the payment of electricity account debts and it may be revised from time
        to time. Deposits bear interest at 4% per annum. Deposits and earned
        interest are refunded to customers after their supply is permanently
        disconnected and all outstanding bills are paid. Given the assumptions
        the most likely case is that the three phase supply exists in the area and

        kVA transformers. 3. Three (3) 15 kVA transformers will be recovered.
        The cost of the transformers is recovered by the utility; the value is
        reflected in the reduction to the customer.
        The customer has to wait for the completion of the connection works
        and the meter installation, thereafter electricity starts flowing.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       Search root of title at the Land Registry

       It is common practice for the lawyer or lawyer’s clerk to search the Index
       of Deeds at the Lands Registry for the root of title. This can take a long
       time if the title is not properly indexed- i.e. names of individuals not
       recorded accurately or omitted. If the indexing is not up-to-date, it may
       be necessary to search individual deeds for the relevant timeframe. Also,
       the indexing is done by hand and the quality of paper is diminishing,
       making the durability of the records more susceptible to wear and tear.                         EC$2 per day +

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.
       Has 60 employees.
       Is subject to collective bargaining agreements if

would have had before this approach was adopted in

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
