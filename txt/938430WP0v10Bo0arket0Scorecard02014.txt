Nearly all NCMs affect multiple modes of supply for the delivery of services
(Figure 3.1), as defined by the General Agreement on Trade in Services
(GATS)4. Most NCMs (86%) affect the free movement of trade in Mode 4                     Source: EAC CMP Annex 5 and World Trade Organization (http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/cbt_course_e/c1s3p1_e.htm).

presence), and more than half (54%) involve Mode 1 (cross-border supply).
No NCMs affect Mode 2 (consumption abroad).

Recommendations

All inconsistent measures identified through this legal analysis present
concrete opportunities for reform, focused on liberalizing legal restrictions
and aligning Partner States’ legislation with their regional commitments.

The analysis presented in this report offers only a partial view of the lack of
the Partner States’ compliance with their liberalization
commitments. The assessment should be expanded to cover all services
sectors and all legislation where such measures could be found.

For the EAC Partner States to further demonstrate their commitment to
advancing services liberalization and establishing a common services
market, they should bring their laws and regulations in line with the regional
agreements. This however will only be part of the solution. The bigger, and
much more challenging task is to ensure that the free movement of services
exists not only on paper, but also in practice. Consistent and full application
and implementation of the Partner States’ legislation is the only way of
achieving deeper services liberalization and promoting free movement of
services in the EAC.

In order to foster this compliance, the private sector, EAC Secretariat, and
the Partner States should agree on a practical agenda for addressing the
inconsistent measures. A working committee, for example EAC’s Judicial
