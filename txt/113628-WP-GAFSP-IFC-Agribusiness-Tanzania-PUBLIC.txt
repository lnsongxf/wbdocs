EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Cambridge Economic Policy Associates (CEPA) was appointed by the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) to identify investment opportunities that could be supported by the Private
Sector Window of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP PrSW/IFC)
in Tanzania’s agribusiness sector.
This is the public version of two reports originally delivered to IFC. The primary purpose of the
original reports were to inform GAFSP PrSW/IFC of potentially investable opportunities on
which it could follow up. The secondary purpose was to provide information on constraints
and issues facing the agribusiness sector (and individual sub-sectors) in Tanzania. IFC are
making a version of this report public to share any non-confidential information with other
individuals or organisations concerned with Tanzanian agribusiness.
ES.1   Background
The IFC manages the GAFSP - PrSW, which is a multilateral mechanism to assist in the
implementation of pledges made by the G20 in Pittsburgh, USA in September 2009. GAFSP
established a private sector window to provide long and short term loans, credit guarantees,
equity and advisory services to support private sector activities for improving agricultural
development and food security. Through the blending of IFC finance and GAFSP finance,
investments can be financed which are commercially viable, but have temporary higher costs
and/or higher risks than the investments which IFC normally finances, and justify a
concessional element in the financing package.
The objective of the IFC-managed private sector window is to address the following:
      Support and demonstrate new and innovative financing aimed at agribusiness
       companies and their supply chains,
      Help increase productivity, improve market access, support innovation and
       development of new ideas in financing and technology, reduce information
       asymmetries between small end users of capital and financial institutions, and reduce
       risks associated with financing small holders/companies in the agribusiness sector
      Support projects that foster research, development and innovations through entities
       operating in the ‘last mile’ and projects that can demonstrate higher productivity,
       lower use of water resources and inputs such as fertilizers
As a means to reach these objectives, IFC contracted CEPA to conduct an agribusiness sector
diagnostic of Tanzania to (i) analyse / identify the most promising sub-sectors for IFC/GAFSP
investment and advisory services and (ii) identify specific IFC/GAFSP investment opportunities
and related partners.
In practice, GAFSP PrSW/IFC is looking to support projects in developing countries of a
minimum size of US$5m and preferably higher. A US$5m investment would be at the bottom
end of IFC’s financing range, so any such project would need to have a strong developmental

                                                                                               vi
case. IFC can finance 15 - 35% of a company’s capitalisation (depending on the company’s
credit rating and size of financing), which can increase to 50% for expansion projects. There
is no limit to the proportion of a project that IFC can finance as long as the capitalisation
requirements explained above are met.
ES.2   Approach
CEPA undertook this assignment in two phases. In Phase 1 we carried out desk-based research
to identify three priority agribusiness sectors with potential to deliver development impacts
for Tanzania and investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/IFC.
In Phase 2 we conducted a two-week visit to collect more detailed information on the priority
sectors, and to identify investable opportunities by meeting with key stakeholders. We
consulted 29 companies and other organisations in total (a full list is provided in Annex H).
ES.3   Identifying priority sectors
We used a two-stage assessment process to identify the priority sectors:
      A long-list of sub-sectors was identified by reviewing FAOStat data and following
       discussions with the IFC.
      Each sector in the long-list was reviewed and assessed against a range of indicators of
       the scope to yield opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC.
The summary ranking of each sub-sector considered is summarised in Table ES.1. Overall, we
identified horticulture, rice and edible oils as priority sectors, though we considered
opportunities that arose in other sectors as well during our phase 2 consultations. This took
account of the areas that IFC already has good knowledge of / involvement in.

ES.4   Summary findings
Few locally based agribusinesses are large enough to carry out investments of the required
size, and many promising sub-sectors are at an early stage of development. Furthermore, IFC
are already active in agreeing mandates with a number of the relatively few major
agribusinesses that could support large investment in the target sectors, and a number of
other larger players are not likely to pass IFC’s due diligence tests. This limited our ability to
identify new opportunities in the grains and edible oil sectors (including milling).
Nevertheless, we identified several interesting opportunities. The majority of investment
opportunities identified were below the US$5m minimum target investment size (as
expected), though some do have potential to expand and offer additional scope for future
engagement. We were also able to identify a small number of larger-scale projects for which
discussions have been taken forward, though details are omitted throughout this report for
confidentiality reasons.
Table ES.2 below summarises our findings in each priority sub-sector and for tea and sugar -
where opportunities presented themselves during our visit. The first column provides our
initial view of investment opportunities in the sub-sector from desk-based research in phase
1. The second column gives our fuller opinion based on meetings with companies and other
stakeholders.

1.     INTRODUCTION
Cambridge Economic Policy Associates (CEPA) was appointed by the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) to carry out analysis of the agribusiness sector in Tanzania to support work
related to the GAFSP PrSW/IFC.

1.1.   Background to the assignment

GAFSP PrSW/IFC is a multilateral mechanism managed by the IFC. It is designed to assist the
implementation of pledges made by the G20. GAFSP PrSW/IFC provides long and short term
loans, credit guarantees, equity and advisory services with the aim of improving agricultural
development and food security in targeted developing countries. It targets agribusiness
investments across the value-chain which are commercially viable but have temporary higher
costs/ risks that would otherwise prevent them from attracting/ affording finance on more
commercial terms.
GAFSP PrSW/IFC is looking to support projects of a minimum size of US$5m in developing
countries. A US$5m investment would be at the bottom end of IFC’s financing range, so any
such project would need to have a strong developmental case. In practice the target
investment size is US$10m and preferably higher. IFC can finance 15 - 35% of the company’s
capitalisation (depending on the company’s credit rating and size of financing) this can
increase to 50% for expansion projects. There is no limit to the proportion of the project that
IFC can finance as long as the capitalisation requirements explained above are met.
For the purposes of the Tanzania study we have focused on investments that meet these
criteria, but have also included smaller projects where there may be scope for additional
investment in the medium-term. Given the size and level of development of the agricultural
sector in Tanzania, the number of suitable investment opportunities is likely to be quite
limited. Furthermore, IFC are already active in agreeing mandates with a number of the
relatively few major agribusinesses that could support large investment in the target sectors.
Our ability to identify opportunities and assess the value chain in the grains and edible oil
sectors was limited by IFC’s request that we should not meet with these organisations.
CEPA undertook this assignment in two phases. In Phase 1 we carried out desk-based research
using secondary sources of information to identify priority agribusiness sectors with the
potential to deliver development impacts for Tanzania as well as investment opportunities
for GAFSP PrSW/IFC. Overall the ranking analysis identified horticulture, grains and edible
oils as the highest scoring priority sectors.
In Phase 2 we conducted a two-week visit to collect more detailed market information on the
priority sectors, and to identify possible investment opportunities by meeting with key
stakeholders. We consulted 29 companies and other organisations in total (a full list is
provided in annex H).



                                                                                             1
1.2.   Objectives of this report

This is the public version of two reports originally delivered to IFC. The primary purpose of the
original report was to inform GAFSP PrSW/IFC of potentially investable opportunities on
which it could follow up. The secondary purpose was to provide information on the
constraints and issues facing the agribusiness sector (and individual sub-sectors) in Tanzania.
IFC are making a version of this report public to share any non-confidential information with
other individuals or organisations concerned with Tanzanian agribusiness.

1.3.   Structure of the report

The first half of this report presents the findings of desk-based research carried out in Phase
1 of CEPA’s Tanzanian Agribusiness Diagnostic.
      Section 2 provides an overview of the agribusiness sector in Tanzania
      Section 3 analyses a long-list of sub-sectors
      Section 4 presents our ranking analysis of the sub-sectors to identify a shortlist of
       priority sectors to be investigated in more depth during a country visit
The second half of this report presents findings from a series of consultations with companies
and other organisations carried out during a two week visit. Each of the following sections
provides a (i) sector overview, (ii) investment / advisory opportunities in the sector, and (iii) a
suggestion of next steps for GAFSP PrSW/IFC:
      Section 5 - Horticulture value chain
      Section 6 - Edible oils value chain
      Section 7 - Grain value chain
      Section 8 - Investment opportunities in other sectors
Parts of these sections are omitted for confidentiality reasons.
The following annexes are also included: Annex A summarises the agribusiness portfolios of
financial intermediaries; Annex B includes a summary of donor activity in agribusiness; Annex
C presents additional information on the oilseeds sector; Annex D presents additional
information on sugar; Annex E presents profiles of the dairy sector; Annex F presents
information on recent investments in horticulture; Annex G is the bibliography; and Annex H
lists the stakeholders consulted during phase 2 of this assignment.

2.      OVERVIEW OF THE AGRIBUSINESS SECTOR IN TANZANIA
This section was written during the first (desk-based) phase of our study and may not reflect
the most current or detailed information available.
This section provides an overview of the agribusiness sector in Tanzania. It then considers
the agribusiness sector’s main competitive strengths and weaknesses, discusses the enabling
environment, considers farmers’ access to inputs, access to finance, the main government

Agriculture contribute approximately 75% of Tanzania’s export earnings, with cotton, tea,
cashew and tobacco representing the key sources of foreign exchange. Other major cash
crops include coffee, sisal, pyrethrum and beans.
While maize is one of the largest crop sectors in terms of production, maize imports are also
significant. Other import-competing food crops include rice, wheat and sugar. Key subsistence
crops include cassava, sorghum, millet, Irish potato, sweet potato, cooking (green) bananas.
In addition, the livestock population in Tanzania is thought to be the largest in the SADC region
and is ranked third in Africa in this regard (after Sudan and Ethiopia).

                                                         and disincentives to private grain trade.

2.3.     Agribusiness enabling environment

Tanzania is ranked 139 out of 189 economies in the World Bank Doing Business 2016 Survey,
receiving particularly low rankings with regard to trading across borders, access to credit and
paying taxes.
The potential for scaling up commercialisation in agriculture is largely unrealised. Major
constraints identified by agricultural companies include climate change (given the
dependence on rain-fed production); limited access to finance; and an unpredictable tax
regime, particularly relating to ad-hoc export bans on crops and inconsistent policies around
VAT/ duties charged on inputs. For instance, while there is no import duty on fertilisers, 18%
VAT is charged on bags, services rendered at the port (e.g. bagging), and on transport services,
transmitting through to higher costs for farmers.
Reports suggest that GoT is trying to implement reforms to improve the ease of doing
business, with a focus on business registration, licensing, regulation and tax administration.
For instance, it has removed the requirement for inspections by health, town and land officers
to try to ease the process of starting a new business.
GoT is targeting the use of PPP arrangements to bring more investment in agriculture, with a
focus on value chains with nucleus and out-grower models. See the box below.
Box 2.1: Agribusiness PPPs in Tanzania
 GoT is aiming for PPP initiatives to develop 330,000 Ha of enhanced smallholder farmlands (out-
 grower) and 350,000 of new commercial farmland (not including areas occupied by out-growers),
 with the objective of achieving an increase in: sugar cane crop planting (by 150,000 MT); rice
 production (by 290,000 MT); maize output (by 100,000 MT); and involvement of 400,000
 smallholders in commercial and out-grower schemes. The expansion is to be achieved under the
 Big Results Now initiative (BRN) through:
  25 commercial farming deals for rice paddy and sugarcane;

                                                                                                      5
     78 professionally-managed collective rice irrigation and marketing schemes; and
     275 collective warehouse-based marketing schemes.
    TIC has already been issued 83,000 Ha of land to allocate to investors for rice and sugar production
    through an open and competitive process.

2.4.      Access to inputs

Although government has implemented some recent policy measures to increase access to
seeds, e.g. implementing regional agreements (SADC MoU) to quicken the registration of
improved seeds2. Overall liberalisation of the sector has been limited, with supply of improved
seeds still relatively low due to persistent policy institutional constraints including:
         Restricted-take-up of government released varieties,3 the Agricultural Seed Agency
          (ASA) has a limited capacity for foundation seed production, while companies don’t
          have timely access public varieties and lack sufficient processing capacity.
         Inadequate funding for Tanzania Official Seed Certification Agency (TOSCI), resulting
          in fewer than needed field inspections – e.g. just two field inspections of hybrid maize
          when four are needed.
The National Agriculture Input Voucher Program (NAIVS) is believed to have had some role in
increasing smallholder farmers use of fertiliser; however there are a number of issues with
the implementation of the programme that have reduced its efficiency.4 These include
inconsistency in the distribution of vouchers and delays in the redemption of vouchers by
banks; and a lack of finance available to agro-dealers and inadequate number of trained agro-
dealers and extension staff to supervise the program.
Another important issue with the regulations and policies affecting the fertiliser sector
include the requirements for any new fertiliser blends to undergo three consecutive seasons
of testing at a cost of $10,000 per season for each new fertilizer product, paid by the importer/
blender. According to data received from the Tanzania Fertiliser Registration Authority (TFRA)
is that there are currently just 37 different types of fertiliser currently registered for use in
Tanzania, this compares to countries in the region such as Zimbabwe and Zambia where
reports suggest that around 250 different types of fertiliser have been registered for use by
farmers. The lack of access to blends means that farmers cannot use the fertiliser varieties
that are suited best to their soil characteristics, as a result their yields suffer as do their
potential incomes. For instance, one stakeholder suggested that maize farmers in Tanzania



2
  Verification of a variety released in another Eastern African country is only required one season, enabling the
faster release of foreign plant varieties
3
  Approx. 80% of government-released varieties have been made available to the private sector
4
  Under this input subsidy program, eligible farms are those cultivating maize/ rice on area of 1 Ha or less;
smallholders are provided with a 50% subsidy of the input market price (and must pay for the remaining cost);
with subsidised seed and fertiliser provided for 0.5 Ha of land.

                                                                                                               6
continue to use DAP and Urea, but could experience an increase in yield of around 30% - 40%
if they switched to using fertiliser blends.

2.5.     Access to finance

Tanzania is ranked 152 out of 189 countries in terms of access to credit, under the World Bank
Doing Business 2016 survey. Limited access to finance is particularly a constraint for the
agriculture sector – according to the Tanzania National Council for Financial Inclusion (NCFI),
the level of access to formal financial services in rural areas is only 8.5% relative to 23% in
urban areas; while 60% of the rural population is completely excluded from financial access,
relative to 45% in urban areas.
As illustrated by Figure 2.2 below, usage of formal financial services by agribusinesses is also
very low. The 2011 Agriculture Finance Markets Scoping Survey (AgFiMS) indicates that only
32% agri-business small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)5 accessed financial services,
with over half of surveyed agribusinesses excluded from any form of financial services.
Furthermore, agriculture-related loans account for just 15% of the commercial bank lending
portfolio in 2011.
Figure 2.2: Usage of financial services by SME agribusinesses




Source: AgFiMS Survey, 2011 in Tanzania National Council for Financial Inclusion
The key constraints impeding access to financial services for agriculture identified by the NCFI
include the unstable macroeconomic environment; the difficulty in enforcing contracts; the
lack of understanding of financial products; the limited range of financial products that are
designed for the agriculture sector; and the costs in reaching agribusinesses located in remote
locations.
The NCFI has targeted an increase in the share of agribusinesses with access to formal
financial services from 32% to 50% by 2016. Key activities include:


5
 Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the agri-business sector are defined as entities with $600 dollars turn-
over per annum or 5 acres of land; that is, agriculture producers, processors, and service providers with turnover
of USD $600 or more

                                                                                                                7
   Increasing proximity of financial access points to where people live and transact (from
    5% to 25%), such as through extending financial institutions branch networks, ATMs, POS;
    with a focus on branchless banking mode.
   Ensuring robust electronic information infrastructure, for individual and business
    profiles, credit history and collateral.
   Ensuring that customers are informed and protected, in terms of their means of payment
    and stores of value.

3.       SECTOR ANALYSIS
This section was written during the first (desk-based) phase of our study and may not reflect
the most current or detailed information available.
This section provides a summary analysis of the following twelve agribusiness sectors in
Tanzania, the sectors were identified following consultation with the IFC:
        Edible oils
        Sugar
        Maize
        Flour milling
        Cashew nuts
        Coffee
        Cotton
        Dairy
        Horticulture
        Tea
        Sisal
        Rice
The following subsections provide a review of each of the above agribusiness sectors. We
provide an overview of the current size and identify the main agribusinesses operating in each
sector, discuss the competitiveness strengths and weaknesses and conclude by presenting an
initial view of the scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment.

3.1.     Edible oils

It is estimated that close to 4m farmers are involved in growing oilseeds in Tanzania. The
figures below use FAOstat data to illustrate the increasing trends in production, area under
cultivation and yields of the oilseeds sector,6 indicating an overall output of ~940,000 MT of
oilseeds in 2013 on an area of ~3.4m Ha. Production levels have increased rapidly over the
period, growing at a CAGR of over 11% per annum driven by a combination of increased yields
and land used for producing edible oils.

Figure 3.1: Trends in production and yields of the oilcrops sector.

The key oilseed crops are groundnuts (40%); sunflower (36%); sesame (15%); cotton (8%); and
palm oil (1%) (RLDC, 2008), with Tanzania ranked as one of the top ten sunflower oilseed
producers globally according to the FAO. Annex C presents further detail on these sub-sectors,
including in terms of areas of cultivation and production.
Processing in rural areas is mainly on a small-scale via manual oil presses, with large-scale
processing limited to Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Arusha and Mwanza. Overall, there are
around 26 manufacturing plants producing edible oil – 22 for sunflower and oil seeds; and
five dedicated to refining palm oil to produce cooking oil and soap. An overview of the major
companies is provided as part of Annex C.
In general however, there is considerable variation in the data on production 7 (particularly
sunflower and sesame) and consumption of edible oils – estimates of domestic demand for
edible oils range between 200,000 and 500,000 MT.
Domestic production is estimated to meet only 40-50% of total requirements, with the
country reliant on imports to supply the remainder. Imports are mainly in the form of crude
or refined palm oil, with total imports valued at between $120m-$230m each year. The figure
below presents the breakdown of the overall edible oil sub-sector.




7
  TEOSA (2012) indicates a total production of over 800,000 MT of sunflower seeds and 130,000mt for sesame
in 2011/12, yielding ~240,000 MT of sunflower oil in the market; while more recent estimates from FAO indicate
a production 350,000 tons of sunflower oilseeds, yielding ~90,000 tons of oil.

                                                                                                           11

                                          28%




The sector is supported by the Agriculture Development Policy of Tanzania, which articulates
GoT’s commitment to: (i) facilitate formation of traders’ associations; (ii) provide quality
control services for oilseeds; (iii) set up an information system to link producers and traders;
and (iv) strengthen research and extension services. In addition, the sector is covered through
the CAADP framework, SAGCOT, Kilimo Kwanza Resolve and Agricultural policy (2012), with a
focus on oilseeds in the pipeline for Big Results Now Initiative.
A number of development partners have also targeted value chain development. The United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has been working with the Ministry of
Industry and Trade to upgrade and modernise the agro-industry and competitiveness of
locally processing including sunflower oil, on both national and international markets.
Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) has also targeted commercially viable and pro-
poor value chain development in sunflower and sesame, through: (i) influencing district and
national level policy development and public services; (ii) promoting inclusive business
arrangements between small-scale producers and the processing industry such as through
up-scaling contract farming arrangements and impact investments; and (iii) facilitating
knowledge development.

3.1.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in edible oils

The desk-based research suggests that there may be scope to develop the sector with a
particular opportunity to increase the production of oilseeds, particularly for sesame and
sunflower8, as well as to explore investments in oil seeds processing.


8
  TEOSA (2012) estimates that introduction of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) has the potential to double
sesame and produce 4-5 times more sunflower (per acre).

                                                                                                                    14
However, preliminary research indicates that the scale of the sector could be an issue. The
Tanzania window of the AECF has financed a number of projects in the oilseeds sector
(summarised in the table below) at quite low investment sizes; we have not found any
evidence of larger scale investments in the sector through the desk-based research.

3.2.    Sugar

Sugar is thought to be the largest agro-processing industry in Tanzania, accounting for 35% of
gross output by volume of food manufacturing and 8.5% of the total value-added in
manufacturing.




                                                                                                           15
FAOStat data indicates that while there have been increasing trends in the area used for
sugarcane cultivation and in production levels, sugarcane yields have exhibited a significant
decline – as discussed in section 3.2.2 below; key underlying constraints include the lack of
irrigation and adequate water storage facilities; in addition to prevalence of sugarcane ratoon
stunting disease. Overall production was estimated at close to 3m MT in 2013, with a total
area of 58,500 Ha under cultivation.

Sugarcane production is mainly on four major sugar estates, having a total of 31,000 Ha under
plantation management and average yields of 68 MT/ Ha. These are: (i) Kilombero Sugar
Company (KSC), accounting for ~42% of total output; (ii) Tanganyika Planting Company (TPC),
owning two sugarcane estates and factories respectively, and contributing ~25% of sugarcane
output; (iii) Mtibwa Sugar Estate (MSE); and (iv) Kagera Sugar Limited (KSL).
Three of the four estates – KSC, MSE AND KSL – work with ~18,500 small-scale cane
outgrowers, having a total of 27,000 Ha of land under cultivation and producing ~710,000 MT
of cane at an average yield of 27 MT/ Ha. Annex D presents further detail on the activities on
each of the four major estates, including a case study on the outgrower scheme adopted by
KSC.
Domestic sugar consumption is estimated at ~520,000 MT (including 120,000 MT of refined
sugar used for industrial purposes), exceeding the combined raw sugar production by the four
large estates, which is estimated at around 300,000MT. The deficit of ~220,000 MT is met
through sugar imports (mainly from outside the East Africa Region), which are valued at
approximately ~US$132m annually. Reports indicate that import licenses exceed
requirements, resulting in a raw sugar surplus imported annually. Sugar smuggling is also a
key concern.
As Tanzania is a sugar-deficit country, exports from the sector are relatively low; official STB
Annual Reports indicate sugar exports of 59,950 MT in 2012/13, with a total exported quantity
of 98,950 MT estimated over the period between 2010/11-2012/13. Existing reports cite high
transport costs and difficulties obtaining export permits, as some of the key constraints to
expanding exports.

Increased sugarcane production (including outgrower schemes) is a key component of the
SAGCOT project; in addition, GoT has been promoting large scale investments under the BRN
Initiative given strategic importance of the sector to food security and import substitution.
New greenfield projects in sugar have been planned in Kilombero District, under both these
projects. However despite these developments and the introduction of the five-year industry
development plan in 2010/11, there is perceived to be weakly organised government support
for the sector including limited capital provided.
The sector is regulated by the Sugar Board of Tanzania (SBT) under MAFC. GoT recently also
announced the establishment of a new sugar procurement entity under the SBT, to involve
both local producers and importers. The sector is perceived to have had a successful PPP
arrangement between SBT and the private sector centred on a research program undertaken
by the Kibaha Sugarcane Research Institute (KSRI)9, whereby GoT provided the infrastructure
and paid researchers’ salaries, with research funds contributed by private sugar processing
companies.10 In addition, a number of donor programmes have provided support for training
and inputs to outgrower programs.

3.2.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in sugar

The desk-based research suggests that there is a need for investments to target a more long-
term expansion in production to meet both the local and regional demand and supply gap,
supported by GoT’s recent focus on promoting development of new greenfield sugar projects.
Specifically, TIC has been allocated 40,000 Ha of land for coordinating investment in large-
scale commercial farming for sugar in Mkulazi area (two farms of 20,000 Ha each, with TIC
reporting interest of global players such as Illovo and Tereos in pursuing these opportunities).
Other strategic areas identified for cane farming expansion include Rufiji Valley, Kigoma,
Kilosa, Ngerengere and Bagamoyo.
Rabobank have also identified a number of investments in new sugar estates, involving
organisation of outgrowers into larger units (block farming) to facilitate economies of scale.
For instance, Indian investors are collaborating with local Tanzanian entrepreneurs to
establish a large sugar estate in the Rufiji area, with cane cultivation on ~10,000 Ha to produce
~125,000 MT of raw sugar annually. There is significant scope for further expansion, with the
project eventually aiming to produce 250,000 MT of sugar annually, making it the largest
estate in Tanzania. Out-growers would operate in blocks of 100 Ha.
Other projects identified include the rehabilitation of the Mohenda estate on Zanzibar Island,
with potentially ~1,500 Ha under cane production and a mill capacity of 25 MT of cane/hour.
Currently, the estate has ~400 Ha under rain-fed cane and potential to produce 8,000 MT of
raw sugar annually. Development of large-scale sugarcane greenfield operations near Lake
Tanganyika in the Rukwa/Kigoma region have also been proposed by a Dubai-based group.


                                                                                                      19
In addition, there have been a number of private sector commitments to the sugar sector
through the New Alliance framework, notably for the Bagaomoyo EcoEnergy (BEE) project,
(summarised in the box below). Yara is reportedly exploring new partnerships in the sugar
value chain. There might be scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC to provide support to some of the
existing investment activities in the sector.
Box 3.1: Bagaomoyo EcoEnergy Project
 Under the BEE project, Agro EcoEnergy (an African company) aims to produce sugar and renewable
 energy sustainably through development of a $425m agro-energy project (in a JV with GoT and
 supported by the African Development Bank (AfDB)) encompassing a sugar mill and bio-refinery via
 a 7,800 Ha sugarcane estate and 3,000 Ha out-grower programme, both fully- irrigated. The
 objective is to produce 125,000 MT of sugar, 8-15,000 m3 of ethanol, and 100,000 MWh/year of
 renewable electricity to the national grid.
 Under the arrangements, government and local communities will be provided a 10% stake in the
 project company as ordinary equity (with further 15% in B-shares to be granted after 18 years), in
 exchange for land free of encumbrance, as a site for the facility. Further, there will be supplier
 contracts and off-taker agreements for sugar and power from ethanol.
 However, the project appears to have been held up, with recently reports of the Prime Minister
 stating that the Bagamoyo project was unlikely to go ahead as it border’s the Saadani Game
 Reserve, and so its implementation would affect the area’s ecosystem.

3.3.    Maize

Maize is one of the most important food crops in Tanzania, accounting for approximately 20%
of agricultural GDP, 30% of overall food production and 40% of the total calories consumed.
Figure 3.4 below indicates an expansion in production, driven largely by increase in planted
area rather than increased yields. The country is thought to have one largest planted areas of
maize in Southern and East Africa, estimated between 4-5m Ha, with a production close to
6m MT in 2014 according to a recent report commissioned by BMGF.
Figure 3.4: Trends in production and yields of the maize sector.

While maize is produced in all 21 regions in Tanzania, around 50% is concentrated in Southern
Highland regions of Morogoro, lunga, Mbeya, Rukwa and Ruvuma. An estimated 85-95% of
production is via small-scale farmers on an average landholding of ~0.7 Ha under low-input
and rain-fed conditions. Overall, ~3.5-4m households (60% of farming families) are involved

                                                                                                 20
in production, in addition to a limited number of large-scale farms, mainly in the Southern
Highlands (30-50), which do not produce large quantities given unfavourably perceived
market conditions.
The figure below presents the market share breakdown of the maize sub-sector, indicating
that ~75% of maize production is consumed on-farm (including saved seeds12) or is purchased
by non-farming domestic households.13 Overall household consumption was estimated at 3.8-
4.5m MT in 2014, mainly in the form of ugali stiff porridge made from maize flour.

The value chain is weakly organised and fragmented, with trade mainly through informal
unregulated channels. As with other sub-sectors, there is a question around the accuracy of
official statistics on maize production, marketing and exports – the share of production
marketed through commercial channels is estimated to vary between 20-35%, while the farm-
gate/ rural market is estimated at $665-900m (BMGF). In terms of processing, only around
12% of total maize production is milled into flour, with small-scale rural operations accounting
for over 90% of milled maize – this segment of the value chain is discussed further as part of
the sub-sector analysis on flour milling.
As Figure 3.5 above indicates, exports account for approximately 12% of maize production. A
USAID Report (2012) indicates that while official exports are minimal (estimated at just 3,000
MT), there is much higher informal trade with exports thought to have totalled 114,000 MT
in 2011 (of which 95,000 MT were directed to Kenya). BMGF’s estimates are higher still; based


12
   It is estimated that over 70,000 MT of maize seeds are used by farmers in Tanzania each year, with ~80% of
these seeds retained from the previous harvest.
13
   With regard to consumption by domestic households, the maize is sold as grain to millers or markets, with
households purchasing this either as flour or grain to mill themselves

                                                                                                          21
on interviews with traders, they estimate that at least 200,000 – 400,000 MT of maize exports
are directed to Kenya each year.
The sub-sector is prioritised as part of TAFSIP, SAGCOT, BRN and CAADP framework. Previous
efforts have targeted PPPs, with TAP outlining six district-level maize Commodity Investment
Plans (CIP) operations in the Southern Highlands. The Collective Warehouse-based Marketing
Schemes (COWABAMA) also targeted a significant increase in maize output by 100,000 MT by
2015, as well as other key objectives including 275 warehouse marketing schemes operational
by 2015 (first 50 being funded by BMGF), with 165,000 SHF participating (across all crops).
In addition, the sub-sector has benefited from the support of donors and a few large-scale
operators in the Southern Highlands. For instance, Clinton Development Initiative’s (CDI)
Anchor Farm Project (2012) has integrated commercial farming and smallholder outreach
through establishment of Ruaha Development Company to manage the operations of
Ngongwa Farm, a 900 Ha commercial farm owned by the Tanzanian Agricultural Seed Agency.
It has been working with over 4,000 farmers on improving agronomy and access to inputs and
markets.

3.3.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in maize

The analysis commissioned by BMGF projects a CAGR of 8% for maize between 2014-20, with
production increasing from approx. 6m MT to 9.1m MT. Correspondingly there is scope for
investment targeted at expanding the maize processing sector. Scope for agro-processing
activities relating to flour milling are discussed in Section 3.4 below.
           Demand from feed sector. The livestock sector (around half of which is dominated by
            poultry) is estimated to be growing by 3-4%, with a corresponding increase in the
            demand for maize used for poultry feed, supported also by opening up broiler and
            hybrid poultry market. There are already a number of large agribusinesses processing
            100,000-150,000 MT of maize annually and are keen to find a reliable source of maize.
            E.g. Interchick and Hill Feeds are feed processors based in Dar es Salaam, purchasing
            5,000 MT and 20,000 MT of maize respectively annually each year. The latter have
            expressed interest in being connected to farmers to ensure quality. Kijenge Animal
            Products Ltd is a medium sized feed processer based in Arusha, which has recently

                                                                                                                     24
       been expanding facilities to increase animal feed production. There is also significant
       undeveloped potential to introduce and expand yellow maize production.
      Expansion of exports. Given the growing regional demand and East Africa deficit,
       exports could be more broadly targeted beyond Kenya to Zambia, Malawi, Burundi,
       DRC, Southern Sudan, Somali, Djibouti and possibly Ethiopia. Key issues at present
       include the fragmented nature of the market – weakly organized foreign traders and
       separation of surplus from demand.
There could be scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in maize to target consultations with
the main processors to determine the scope to support additional investment in the sector.

3.4.   Flour milling

Maize flour is the largest segment in the flour milling industry of Tanzania. The flour milling
industry also consists of wheat flour and to a lesser extent, rice, sorghum and cassava.
Tanzania’s exports of flour has increased dramatically in recent years, rising to US$43m in
2010 from just US$2m in 1997. An overview of the key sub-sectors identified is presented
below.

Maize flour production

Maize flour milling accounts for 12% of total maize production in Tanzania. The processing
industry is highly fragmented with ~30,000 flour mills of all sizes, the majority of which
operate at less than 5MT/ day:
      Small-scale local milling operations in rural/ urban areas. Over 90% of maize milling
       is at village based posho & small hammer mills, where households can have their
       maize milled for a fee (converted into low-cost and low-quality flour). These mills
       account for the majority of milled maize bought by Tanzanian consumers.
      Limited number of medium/ large sophisticated (roller) millers. These commercial
       mills provide a higher-quality product for middle and upper-income middle urban
       consumers. Reports indicate that many are operating below capacity (~10-15 MT/
       day) and/ or leaving the industry given consumers’ preferences for flour derived from
       smaller mills, which impede profitability of commercial operations. Recent
       government regulations also require large millers to fortify maize flour with vitamins
       and minerals. The large players include Mohamed Enterprise and Export Trading Co
       (which trade in maize as well as exporting maize and its products); Bakhresa/Azam
       and General Mills of East Africa.
Maize flour is used to make ugali, a staple starch consumed by both urban and rural
populations.




                                                                                            25
Wheat flour production

The wheat sector in Tanzania is relatively small, with an estimated production of 170,000 MT
in 2014, mainly by smallholder farmers in the Southern Corridor, cultivating a few acres of
wheat each. There is also some wheat production in northern Tanzania, which is sold to the
millers in Arusha and Dar es Salaam.
Unlike the maize flour industry, wheat flour milling is dominated by large commercial players
such as Bakhresa, Azam and ANZANIA. Local wheat production competes with wheat
produced from FSU, Canada, Australia, USA and Germany, which is imported by the millers
through Mombasa and Dar es Salaam.
Wheat is mainly consumed in the form of flour in urban areas (with urban consumption
accounting for 83% of wheat flour market). However, consumption has been recently
declining due to high world wheat prices. Around 75% of wheat exports are directed to DRC,
with the remainder going to EAC partners.
While wheat flour is used in baked goods and breads, more traditionally, wheat flour is used
for ugali (though less frequently than maize-based ugali). Fortification of iron, folic acid and
vitamin A is becoming increasingly prominent, seen by some large millers as a form of CSR.

Cassava flour

Although cassava is not traditionally consumed in flour form, it presents a viable alternative
to wheat or maize flour. Cassava is the second most produced food crop behind maize,
supporting the livelihood of 37% of farmers in rural areas. Cassava flour is most commonly
consumed as ugali through a blend with maize flour for a desirable texture. Cassava flour
could play a significant role in food security given the periodic shortage of maize and the
reliance on wheat imports.

                  COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS                                 COMPETITIVE WEAKNESSES
    Private     investments     have      targeted         Low margins in maize milling due to competition
     improvements in the nutritional value of maize          from 30,000 flour millers, with commercial
     meal; e.g. soya- enriched maize meal product            expansion impeded by erratic nature of supply
     introduced by Powerfoods Ltd.                           and demand.
    Potential for growth in commercial maize sector        Small local millers are inefficient, unregistered
     is evidenced by increasing commercialisation in         and un-licensed. Cost-effectiveness of milling
     neighboring countries with similar consumption          facilities is constrained by unreliable electricity
     patterns.                                               supply.

     animal feed                                             transportation costs and corruption increase
    Fast growth in flour exports to neighboring             costs of sourcing maize; in addition, maize
     countries                                               processors have costs and barriers associated

    Importing wheat flour is prohibited, protecting
     the wheat flour milling industry. Imported             Medium maize millers have had to focus on
     wheat tariff of 10% was removed in 2008 to              producing their own maize due to unreliable and

3.4.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in milling

Reports suggest that large maize flour processors have been pushed out of the market by
small and medium millers (who can produce flour tailored to consumers’ demand) and are
shifting their focus to wheat. However, given recent trends towards commercialisation of
maize flour milling in neighbouring countries, there may be an opportunity to capitalise on
industry consolidation in the future if millers can connect with smallholders and develop the
technology to produce maize flour to consumers’ taste, at scale. For instance, Tofauti Sembe,
a medium-sized mill which uses its own maize for flour processing, has indicated interest in
connecting with small-scale farmers, provided quality is assured. Equally, there may be an
opportunity to backward integrate along the maize value chain given Tanzania’s potential for
local maize production.
Other areas with scope for investment include agro-processing to expand into the market for
animal feed (cattle, pigs and local breeds of poultry) and quality maize meal. For instance,
USAID’s ‘Feed the Future’ initiative, the Tuboreshe Chakula Projects will work to support
fortified maize flour. The PE firm Fanisi Capital, has also reportedly bought a $65m minority
stake in Tanzanian agro-processing company, Kijenge Animal Products Limited (Kijenge), a
mid-sized maize flour milling, animal feed milling and poultry production firm.
However, in the nearer-term, there may be more potential for investments in wheat milling
given the presence of several large domestic players in this sub-sector, as well as to increase
value-add, especially to increase the nutritional content to might malnutrition. Although, we
note that this would need to be considered against key constraints, particularly the reliance
on wheat imports, compounded by existing policy risks surrounding the absence of import
tariffs.

3.5.     Cashew nuts

According to the African Cashew Alliance, Tanzania is Africa’s fourth -largest producer of
cashew nuts (behind Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau). However, the sector accounts
for a small share of total agricultural production in Tanzania, with significant volatility

                                                                                                           28
observed in FAOStat data, particularly in terms of area used for cultivation and cashew nuts
yields, which could in part be attributed to increasing disincentives to production (discussed
further in sub-section 4.4.3 below). As Figure 3.6 below indicates, production of raw cashew
nuts (RCN) appears to have declined from a peak of 160,000 MT in 2012 to ~128,000 MT in
2013, with a total area of ~410,600 Ha estimated under cultivation.
Figure 3.6: Trends in production and yields of the cashew net sector.

According to the Cashew Nut Board of Tanzania (CNBT), at least 700,000 households rely on
the crop for 75% of their annual income. Smallholder farmers typically cultivate 1-2 Ha of
cashew nut trees, at times inter-cropped with food crops such as cassava, grain staples and
legumes. Close to 80% of total area and production of cashew nuts is concentrated in
southern coastal regions of Mtwara, Lindi, and Ruvuma.
Following introduction of the Warehouse Receipt System, all exports must be marketed
through Agricultural Marketing Co-operative Societies (AMCOS) before being sold via auction,
where exporters and processors bid for raw cashew nuts.
Approximately 88% of production is exported as raw nuts for processing abroad, mainly to
India, with the sector estimated to account for 10% of total agricultural exports. The desk-
based research indicates that cashew exports were valued at $133.5m for the year ending
May 2014, as compared to $150m in the previous year, with the decline in earnings attributed
to falling global prices and lower production.
Only 12-20% of production is processed. The country’s processing capacity in 2013 was
estimated at ~136,700 MT at 25 plants, with per plant capacity ranging between 300 –12,000
MT. However, reports suggest maximum estimated processing of 30,000 MT in 2012.
Olam Tanzania is the largest processor with a capacity of 25,000 MT p.a., followed by Export
Trading Company (Tunduru) and Mohammed Enterprise (Dar es Salaam), which have a
maximum processing capacity of 5,000 MT p.a. each; while. Jumbo nut (Dar es Salaam) and
Perfect cashew nut (Masasi) are medium-scale, processing a maximum of 3,000 MT p.a.
The CNBT is the main sector regulator. It is involved in policy formulation and quality control,
as well as being the main coordinating body in the sector

3.5.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in cashew nuts

Given the increasing global demand for cashews (estimated at 9% p.a.), a number of private
players are pursuing expansion activities in Tanzania, with a view to accelerating exports of
processed cashews through backward integration. For instance, Mo Cashew (under METL) is
currently expanding its own plantations, with a target production level of 30,000 MT.

                                                                                                                 31
Key projects supported by development partners include 3ADI’s Value Chain Development
Support Program (VCDSP), which has aimed at doubling cashew nut production by 2020,
accompanied by an increase in domestic processing (to 80%), with 30% of production sold on
domestic and African regional markets.
In general though, our initial findings suggest that is a limited pipeline of GAFSP PrSW/ IFC
investments in the cashew nut sector, given for instance, the greenfield risk for investors
associated with establishment of new cashew nut orchards. In practice, it also seems difficult
to develop value addition activities in the sector – including modernising and/ or expanding
processing plants – due to the inherent competitive advantage currently enjoyed by India in
this regard.

3.6.    Coffee

Although Tanzania is not a major producer of coffee on a global scale (accounting for just
~0.6% of the world market), the sector represents 24% of the value of traditional cash crops
and is one of the largest export crops in the country.
Overall, production of coffee beans was estimated at ~71,000 MT in 2013, with approximately
224,000 Ha under cultivation. According to the FAOStat data, production has increased in the
last few years, but as shown in the figures below, the longer-term trend suggests that
production has been stagnant.
Figure 3.7: Trends in production and yields of the coffee sector.

One of the underlying factors identified for this trend is the declining production in the
Northern Highlands, where production has been largely based. Other regions of coffee
cultivation include Southern Highlands (Mbeya, Ruvuma and Ludewa Regions), and the
Western Lake Zone (in Kagera Region), in addition to Tanga, Iringa, Manyara, Morogoro,
Kigoma, Mwanza, Rukwa and Mara Regions.
Most production (~90%) is by ~450,000 smallholder families, typically operating on 0.5-1 Ha
of land; with the remainder output accounted for by largest estates (over 110 have been
estimated). Overall, approximately 2.4m individuals are supported by the coffee sector.
Arabica coffee contributes around 70% of total coffee production and is almost entirely wet-
processed; the remainder 30% of production is of robusta, grown only in the Kagera region.

                                                                                           32
There are thought to be around 15 coffee and hulling plants, with production capacities
varying between 1.5-8 MT/ hour. Larger plants typically operate with older equipment and
are owned by cooperative unions, while most smaller plants are owned by multinational
coffee companies with modern technologies and fewer employees. In addition to coffee
processors, the value chain also includes coffee roasters and blenders.
Domestic coffee consumption is relatively low (per capita consumption of ~0.06 kg p.a.), with
over 90% of production directed to export markets – mainly to the E.U., but also Japan and
the U.S.A. As such, coffee is one of the largest agricultural export commodities, valued at
US$162.4m in 2013 (FAOStat).
Marketing of coffee exports is largely through a centralised auction in Moshi (Northern
Tanzania). Historically, purchases at Moshi have been concentrated in terms of four key
traders – Mazao; Tchibo; Dorman; Taylor Winch.
In addition to sector prioritisation under the ASDP, the Coffee Industry Development Strategy
2011–16 has been introduced by the Tanzania Coffee Board to establish a framework for
expanding production and improving quality. Further detail is provided in Box 3.2 below.
Box 3.2: Coffee Industry Development Strategy 2011–16
 Key objectives of the Coffee Industry Development Strategy include: (i) expanding production (from 50,000
 MT to at least 80,000 MT by 2016 and 100,000 MT by 2021); (ii) improving quality of output by 2016 (by
 increasing share of coffee sold with price premiums on export markets from 35% to 70% by 2021); (iii)
 improving the business environment; (iv) increasing farmer incomes and price premiums (increasing farmers’
 share of net FOB price on coffee exports to at least 75% by 2021); and (v) increasing value addition throughout
 the coffee value chain.
 The strategy is based on the following key strategic thrusts: (i) increased productivity; (ii) enhanced internal
 marketing process and business environment; (iii) improved quality; and (iv) development on new markets
 including sustainable coffee. Key areas of GoT support will include:
       Progressive replacement of old trees with improved varieties, combined with application of GAP to
          support +100% increase in average yields from current level of 225 kgs/ Ha of clean coffee to 450
          kgs/ Ha of clean coffee by in 2021 (+55% in 2016);
       Expanding area under production, with a total of 10,000 Ha planted by both small holders and large
          scale investors by 2021 (at least 1,000 Ha per year).
       Support from TaCRI seedlings multiplication program, whereby ~20m seedlings will be availed
          annually on this period.
       Increased coffee agronomy extension support on the field, through Training of Trainers and capacity
          building of extension officers to provide village-based training and facilitate technology transfer to
          farmers in their groups.
 Expected outcomes include additional revenues (at a national level) of at least US$150M annually through
 export earnings, of which at least 75% would be redistributed to coffee farmers. This is expected to almost
 double the coffee incomes of an estimated 400,000 households, contributing to a sustainable capacity for
 self-improvement of the coffee industry in Tanzania.

The sector has also benefited from introduction of innovative financing mechanisms,
including the WRS and KILICAFE’s financial linkage, supported by TechnoSe rve. GoT is in
process of establishing a commodity exchange, which would eventually cover coffee & tea.

3.6.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in coffee

While the Coffee Industry Development Strategy has set ambitious targets – including a two-
fold expansion in production by 2021 – preliminary findings suggest that the industry is still
constrained by low quality and productivity due to a factors including limited use of inputs
and insufficient replanting; inefficient marketing and lack of value addition. In this context,
any investments to expand the number of processing units, would need to be accompanied
by support targeted at agronomic improvements and increasing farmers’ adoption of these
CPUs.
Indicative examples of the types of investments required in the coffee sector include a $14m
loan provided by FMO to Aviv Tanzania (a subsidiary of Olam International), a 1,200 Ha
greenfield coffee plantation and a wet and dry mill processing facility in the Songea district
(South West Tanzania). The project provides training to outgrowers to improve yields, as well
as supporting development of roads and energy services in the region and implementation of
an Integrated Water Resources Management Plan, facilitating drip irrigation for coffee
production. Under the New Alliance Framework, Armajaro (a global soft commodity trading
house and supply chain manager), is also supporting development of smallholder coffee
farmers in the Mbeya and Mbinga regions by providing access to finance, improving
productivity (e.g. through training in GAP and increasing processing in the wet mills); and
strengthening market linkages.
Given that there is currently limited processing beyond the curing plant, other opportunities
highlighted by the available research relate to an expansion of value addition activities.
However, at present it is unlikely that such investments would be sufficiently large and of the
scale typically required by GAFSP PrSW/ IFC. For instance, Tanzania Instant Coffee Company
Ltd – which is among the few instant coffee factories in East and Central Africa – has a
relatively low annual production of 500 MT of instant coffee and sales of ~US$1.9m in 2010
(of which ~US$1m were exports). Another identified player, Afri Tea and Coffee Blenders Ltd.
Is the only East African producer of instant coffee exporting to Japan. However, again, it has
a small capacity of 300MT p.a. for instant coffee powder and 750 MT p.a. for roasted and
ground coffee.

3.7.   Cotton

Cotton is one of Tanzania’s largest sources of export revenue. Cotton products (including
cotton lint, seed, cake and cotton seed oil) brought in over US$96m in 2013. The crop is
mainly grown on small scale farms ranging from 0.5 to 10 Ha, with average farm size being
1.5 Ha.
97% to 99% of Tanzania’s cotton is grown in the northwest of the country near Lake Victoria.
Simiyu, Shinyanga, Mwanza, and Geita are the largest cotton producing regions in Tanzania,
with Simiyu region producing over 40% of the national output. Production is dominated by
smallholder farmers who use rain-fed techniques/ basic technology. In total it is estimated

                                                                                            36
that between 350,000 and 500,000 smallholder farmers are involved in producing cotton on
around 400,000 Ha of land each year. Cotton yields in Tanzania are reported to average 0.55
MT/ Ha, which is well below global averages of around 0.8 MT/ Ha; in addition the poor quality
of Tanzanian cotton has meant that traders have had to sell the product at a discount on the
world market.
As Figure 3.8 below shows, cotton seed production has been quite volatile over the past 15
years, varying from around 75,000 to 225,000 MT, but with no real extended period of
sustained growth. According to USDA estimates, around just 120,000 MT of cotton seed was
produced in 2015/16, with current forecasts suggesting that this will increase to 140,000 MT
in 2016/17. The decline in production in 2015/16 was attributed to lower than expected
levels of rain during the February - March 2015 period, which are important months for cotton
production.
Alongside changes in the global price of cotton, erratic weather conditions is reported to be
the main factor behind the level of volatility in production of seed cotton. More structural
factors constraining the growth of the sector include a lack of affordable and quality inputs
for smallholders and the lack of trust/ working relationship between cotton producers and
ginners, which has helped to prevent the growth of contract farming arrangements and has
continued to constrain the level of seed cotton production in Tanzania.

The Tanzania Cotton Board, which is the institution responsible for regulating the quality of
cotton production in Tanzania, sets an indicative seed cotton price each year that is
announced at the beginning of June each year. The actual market price that is received by
smallholders depends on multiple factors such as the quality and quantity of the cotton that
smallholders end up producing and the level of market demand for the good in the Tanzanian
market.
According to the government’s Cotton Advisory Committee 28 ginning companies obtained a
licence to trade in cotton lint production by mid-way through 2015/16. Overall, there is
estimated to be capacity to gin 400,000 bales of cotton (around 72,400 MT) per month in

                                                                                           37
Tanzania, suggesting that there is currently excess ginning capacity in the country – which
subsequently can lead to significant competition amongst the ginners to acquire sufficient
supplies of seed cotton and exacerbates the issue of side-selling, which has undermined
contract farming arrangements in the country.
Table 3.2 below sets out some statistics on cotton lint production in Tanzania. It shows that
cotton lint production has been falling in recent years, due to low production of cotton seed
and the recent decline in prices for lint exports. Around 80% of cotton lint production is
exported, with countries such as Bangladesh, India and China being the main destinations.

3.7.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in cotton

The government has a stated ambition to support the development of the cotton sector in
Tanzania. There is a target to increase the production of cotton seed to 1.5m MT mainly by
increasing yields by 2020 (however, a similar target had been set for 2010). The TCB recently
finished implementing the 2009 – 2015 Cotton Sector Development Strategy, it is not yet clear
what impact the strategy had or what policy framework will be in place going forwards.
It is clear that if efforts to develop the sector are to be achieved, more needs to be done to
improve smallholders’ access to improved inputs, in particular seeds and fertiliser as well as
their access to training; in addition to improving returns through facilitating price stability.
Some of the programs developed to address the issue – e.g. by the Gatsby Foundation –
initially failed due to the inability/ unwillingness of government to regulate effectively the
ginners. There are reported to be ongoing efforts to re-establish the contract farming model
alongside other efforts to develop the sector by providing capacity building to farmers/
farmer groups directly.
Given the highly competitive and diffuse structure of the ginning sector in Tanzania it would
seem that there is very limited scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in the cotton processing
sector – reports suggest that investors have been put off the sector due to factors such as the
unreliable power supply and the disputes between ginners and smallholders, which have
negatively affected sector competitiveness. Unless there is potential to support the provision
of inputs on credit alongside an established partner such as Olam or together with the Gatsby
Foundation it is unclear that there will be much scope for investment in the sector.

3.8.   Dairy

Consumption of milk in Tanzania is measured to be around 43L per person each year, which
is significantly below the 200L recommended by the World Health Organisation, but is a
similar level to other countries in the region (though notably consumption in Kenya is more
than double the level in Tanzania). Most studies suggest that demand for milk is growing
significantly driven by population growth, urbanisation and the recent economic growth
experienced in Tanzania.
Milk consumption is quite common in Tanzania, though there is a general preference for local
raw milk over processed milk. Consumption of processed dairy products such as cheese,
yoghurt etc. is quite marginal. Most estimates suggest that imports of dairy products, mainly
in the form of milk powder, butter and cheese are roughly the same size as Tanzania’s
processed dairy sector. The available data suggests that imports of dairy products have grown
at over 10% per annum to over US$25m in 2014 (though this is driven partly by a considerable
increase in the last year of over US$10m).

                                                                                                 40

Tanzania is thought to have one of the largest cattle populations in Sub Saharan Africa. The
most recent data put the number at almost 22m (Tanzania Investment Centre (2013).
Tanzania Investment Guide 2014-15). Over 95% of the cattle population are estimated to be
the indigenous breeds (the shorthorn East African zebu), which is low milk yielding compared
to crossbred and exotic breeds (mainly Friesian and Ayrshires). The overall milk production
yield is estimated to be around 2L per cow per day, which is significantly lower than that
achieved in Kenya (around 5L per cow per day).
It is estimated that over a third of all rural households own cattle (over 2m households), of
these around 70% keep between 1 and 10 cattle. The majority of cattle are kept in the
following regions: Shinyanga, Mwanza, Arusha, Mara, Manyara, Singida and Dodoma, which
are mainly lowland and humid regions. The improved dairy breeds are concentrated in the
Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Mbeya regions – the cooler highland regions.
Milk production has been growing at over 7% per annum over the last 14 years driven by
increases in the cattle population. By 2013, close to 2m MT of milk were produced. Around
80% of production is consumed at the farm level by subsistence farmers; between 15 and
20% is sold through informal channels as and when smallholders have excess milk that they
want to sell; the remainder – less than 5% of total production – is sold through formal
channels.

The processing sector is small and focused mainly on the pasteurisation and production of
dairy products, most of the companies have small and medium sized plants with the capacity
to process between 500 to 30,000L per day; the overall capacity in Tanzania is approx.
400,000L. Examples of the largest companies are Tanga Fresh (which has received investment
from CDC in the past), which is the largest dairy company in the country (50,000L per day
capacity and annual turnover in region of US$4m); Asas; Musoma dairies; Mara milk and Tan
dairies. The processors typically source over half their milk from smallholder farmers, with
the remainder coming from commercial farms.

3.8.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in dairy

The largest milk processing company has a turnover of around US$4m so, unless an
international firm is considering entry into the market, there seems to be limited scope for
the sector to yield a pipeline of opportunities of the size under consideration by GAFSP PrSW/
IFC.
Although not of large scale, there have been several recent investments in the sector through
investors such as AECF-TZAW, the New Alliance Framework and a collaboration with TDCU
and Dutch investors. For instance, AECF-TZAW has provided $450,000 in funding to Mgolole
Agro-Processing Co. Ltd to develop an integrated dairy project to produce and sell quality
heifers to farmers in Morogoro region. Further detail on these investments is provided in
Annex E.
If there is a desire to get engaged in the sector, it may be necessary to explore opportunities
around the provision of credit to groups of farmers in partnership with the processors/ an
existing financial intermediary.

3.9.     Horticulture

The Tanzania Horticulture Association (TAHA) defines horticulture as being any agricultural
activity that: involves production, processing or packaging of flowers, fruits, vegetable seeds,
spices and roots and tubers. The sector therefore includes quite a wide range of different
goods that are individually quite small, but are combining to make horticulture an important
part of the agricultural sector in Tanzania.
The sector is reported widely as being the fastest growing agribusiness sector in Tanzania,
achieving growth rates of 9 – 12% per annum over the past five years (2008-2013). Overall,
the sector is estimated to provide employment for 500,000 individuals, with women making
up around 65% of the workforce. Most of the farmers in the sector, around 70%, control
landholdings of less than 2 Ha.
Horticultural products are produced mainly in three parts of the country:
        Southern highlands – Morogoro, Iringa, Mbeya and Ruvuma.
        Northern corridor – Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga and Manyara.

The horticultural sector has grown to become the second largest source of export earnings
for Tanzania, according to Tanzania Bureau of Statistics data. As shown in the figure below,
the Tanzania Revenue Authority estimates that between 2010 and 2014 export earnings from
horticulture have more than doubled from US$212m to US$447m.

                                                                                             44

Figure 3.12 shows that the growth in horticultural export earnings has occurred primarily due
to the growth of the vegetable sub-sector. Vegetable exports have increased by over
US$100m between 2010 and 2014.

Interestingly, according to a study by Mashindano et al (2013), only around 5% of the
horticultural products produced in Tanzania are destined for export markets. The remainder
are produced for own consumption, sold in the domestic market or go to waste. This suggests


                                                                                          45
that there may be considerable scope to continue to grow the sectors export earning
potential.
Tanzania has less than 30 large scale growers/ exporting companies operating in the sector.
These agribusinesses are based mainly in Arusha and Manyara. These companies are an
important source of employment in their respective regions. Many of the agribusinesses are
owned by international players. For instance, Hortanzia Farms has an overall turnover of over
US$1bn and employs 450 people; its main product is cut roses which it exports to the
Netherlands, Norway and the UK, with lower quality roses sold on the domestic market.

3.9.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in horticulture

The combination of the size of the sector, recent growth in export earnings and presence of
a number of international commercial agribusinesses suggest that there is a relatively strong
potential for the horticulture sector to yield some investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/
IFC but potential is that individual investment opportunities might be small. Many investors
are already involved in production and marketing of horticultural crops, primarily for export
markets.
Moreover, there appears to be strong policy and donor support for development of the
sector; the horticulture sector has been earmarked as one of the potential fast-growth areas
in the TAFSIP and SAGCOT. The GoT objectives include establishing modern vegetables, fruits,
flowers, spices and horticultural seed business operations for domestic, regional and
international markets.
Meanwhile, international players such as Unilever and Syngenta are also involved in the
horticulture sector Alongside the recent investment in high tech cultivation equipment by the
AfDB-managed AFT Fund, there have been several investments made recently by AECF-TZAW
ranging between US$100,000-$1,000,000, with the objectives of supporting smallholder
production and expansion of fruit processing operations. Further detail is provided in Annex
F.
AgDevCo has also made a number of investments in Tanzania’s horticultural sector. It recently
invested US$400,000 in EA Fruits and Farm Ltd to enable them to purchase a refrigerated
delivery vehicle and a central pack house to support the expansion of their business. AgDevCo
also invested US$1.5m in Rungwe Avocado Company (RAC) to fund the installation of 100 Ha
of micro-jet irrigation systems on their commercial farm, update their cold storage supply
chain infrastructure and support their ongoing smallholder farmer outgrower scheme.
                                                                                                              47
Sasumua Holdings Limited (a commercial banana and pineapple producer) received US$2m
of investment to develop a dam to secure a supply of water for 100 Ha of irrigated land for
the company and support investment in capital expenditure for the in-field irrigation.

3.10. Tea

Tea has traditionally been an important crop for Tanzania. It has long been one of the
country’s leading export earners and is thought to have an indirect impact on the livelihoods
of around 2 million Tanzanians.
According to FAOStat data, tea production has grown at a steady CAGR of 2.8% between 2000
and 2013, with this slow growth rate attributed to the very slow improvement exhibited by
yields (with exception to the spike observed between 2010 and 2012), which over the period
have only increased from 1.2 MT per Ha to 1.6 MT per Ha.
Figure 3.13: Tea production in Tanzania

Tanzania is the fourth largest tea producer in SSA, after Kenya, Malawi and Uganda, producing
approximately 1% of the world’s tea production. The vast majority (over 75%) of tea
production is for export, with the sector one of Tanzania’s top-five largest export earners,
bringing in revenue of over US$50m in 2013. Over the period since 2000, export earnings
growth has been similar to the increase in overall production.




                                                                                          48

There are three main tea growing areas in Tanzania: the Highland zones of Mufindi, Njome
and Rungwe district; the North East Zones of Lusotho, Korogwe; and Muheza districts and the
Northwest Zone areas of Bukoba and Muleba districts. Overall, approx. 22,000 Ha of land is
used to produce tea, which is split roughly 50:50 between land under production by
smallholders and land used by the commercial tea estates.
Around 50,000 smallholders are involved in the production of tea, relying on rain-fed
production and making limited use of inputs. The smallholder yield is estimated at less than
1 MT/ Ha, whilst the estates have been achieving close to 2 MT/ Ha. Unilever and Mufindi,
which are both growing under irrigation, are reportedly achieving 2.8 – 3.5 MT/ HA.
The main tea estates include Unilever Tea Tanzania (which is reported to account for around
40% of tea output), Tanzania Tea Packers (which has received significant CDC investment in
the past) and Mufindi Tea Company (which exported around US$7m in 2010). The processors,
such as Unilever, have their own commercial tea estates and also purchase/ process the tea
produced by the smallholders. In 2013 Unilever signed an MoU with the government as part
of the SAGCOT to create an additional 5,000 jobs linked to its Mufindi tea estates and support
the development of 6,000 Ha of smallholder tea farms.
Primary processing of tea is carried out mainly by agribusinesses that are dispersed
throughout the growing areas. Around 20 of these are owned by the different commercial
producers and 4 are owned jointly by the smallholders and the farmers. On average they are
estimated to produce 33,000 MT of processed tea annually. 75% of the tea produced is
exported, the remainder of the tea is packaged and sold in the domestic market. The
packaging and marketing of tea is carried out by five licensed factories such as Afri Tea and
Coffee Ltd., Chai Bora Ltd., and International Food Packers.

3.10.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in tea

Based on the desk-based review it could be interesting to explore the scope for GAFSP PrSW/
IFC to support provision of finance to smallholders to enable them to purchase increased
inputs, as well as exploring opportunities in the packing stage of the value chain. Beyond that,
there are some established international players in the sector (such as Unilever), which could
be potential partners for investment, although the desk-based research suggests that there
is limited need for investment in increased processing capacity until supply constraints are
addressed. AECF-TZAW has made a couple of small investments in this regard recently,
including provision of US$450,000 to Kagera Tea Company Limited in 2015 to support scaling-
up of technology used by farmers and improvements in the transport system, with a view to
increasing quality and production of green leaf tea sold to the company for processing.
Furthermore Tanzania Tea Packers has recently received over approx. US$3.5m to finance
investment in a new hydropower plant to enable it to boost production.
Key donor-supported interventions include the Chai Project launched by the Gatsby
Foundation and Wood Foundation Africa, with a view to transforming the sector through
providing matching grants with private factories (to address specific local constraints);
strengthening a farmers’ association; and working with the Tea Board to introduce a new

market-based pricing mechanism for all 30,000 smallholders, and with the Tanzania
Smallholder Tea Development Agency to pilot a land titling project.

3.11. Sisal

Sisal is grown to produce fibre that can be used in a range of products such as rope, cloth,
paper, and carpets. The plant typically has a 7 – 10 year lifespan and takes a number of years
after planting before it is ready for harvesting. Only 2% of the sisal plant is made up of the
fibre. Recent studies have shown that the waste can be used to produce biogas. UNIDO and
the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) helped to support the establishment of a
demonstration biogas from sisal leaf waste plant. Other uses of sisal waste include the
production of bio-fertiliser and for animal feed.
The statistics that are available on the sector are produced by the Tanzania Sisal Board (TSB),
which is responsible for a range of functions across the sector, such as issuing the licences
that all producers, traders and exporters in the sector require to operate, developing and
enforcing regulations relating to quality of production, marketing and export; collecting data
on the sector; and providing advice to government on policy matters.
According to data from the Tanzania Sisal Board (TSB), sisal fibre production has increased by
around 4% per annum between 2000 and 2011. Total production has reportedly grown to
around 40,000 MT by 2015. Tanzania is in the top-five global producers of the product; Brazil
has the largest share of global production (it produces in excess of 150,000 MT). The TSB has
a target of trying to overtake Brazil as the world’s largest producer within the next ten years.
Approx. 45% of the fibre produced is exported, key destinations include the UK, China and
Saudi Arabia. The remainder of sisal produced is either sold on domestic markets or goes to
waste.
In total around 60,000 Ha of land is used to produce sisal each year. As of 2012 around a
quarter of sisal produced came from smallholder farmers. Smallholder production of sisal
was established by Katani Ltd in the Tanga region of Tanzania, through a contract farming
scheme that includes around 2,000 farmers. Most other smallholder production was
developed through NGO/ government based programmes. Commercial production takes
place on large plantations of between 3,000 to 7,500 Ha.

There are four sisal spinning mills operating in Tanzania. Reportedly only 35% of installed
capacity is being utilised. The mills were established back in the 1960s/ 70s, but some of them
have been modernised in the last 10 years. Katani is the largest firm and accounts for approx.
30% of the share of production. Ruhinda and Co ltd and Mohamed Enterprises are other
prominent firms operating in the sector. The process of extracting the fibre from the sisal
leaves requires considerable use of power and water; problems accessing reliable power is a
significant constraint for the producers.

     Year Sisal Crop Development Plan (2011-2020),
     the Mlingano Agriculture Research Institute
     planned to initiate a sisal characterization
     program for developing a protocol for the
     production of ethanol and citric acid from liquid
     effluents.

3.11.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in sisal

The total export earnings for the sector are in the region of US$10-15m, and a rough estimate
suggests that the leading firms in the sector most likely turnover a maximum of US$5m. This
suggests that the sector is potentially too small to support investments of the size targeted
by GAFSP PrSW/ IFC.
That said a biogas plant developed by Katani Ltd. with support from the likes of Unido in 2007
cost approximately US$4.5m. Going forward, there could be scope for some of the existing
producers to undertake additional investments in this area, to increase utilisation of sisal and
increase value addition of the sector, whilst addressing the key constraints associated with
limited supply of power in Tanzania.
As such, there may be some value in consulting with some of the larger firms operating in the
sector, such as Mohamed Enterprises Tanzania and Sagera Estates. But in practice the sector
is unlikely to have the capacity to yield a robust pipeline of investment opportunities.

                                                                                                            54
3.12. Rice

According to data from FAOStat, rice production in Tanzania has more than doubled over the
past 14 years with production growing at a CAGR of 9% p.a. This growth has been driven by
both an increase in rice yields, which have grown from 1.9 MT/ Ha to 2.8 MT/ Ha and an
increase in the amount of land under rice production.
Figure 3.16: Rice production in Tanzania

Rice is an important crop for both subsistence and commercial farming in Tanzania, and
consumption has been increasing in recent years. Rice is more expensive than other cereal
crops including maize (Tanzania’s chief staple crop) but similar to a number of other countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the combination of increasing urbanisation and household
income has led to households consuming more rice and substituting away from the cheaper
cereals.
Dar es Salaam market is the largest market for rice in Tanzania and is responsible for
approximately 40% of the country’s rice consumption. According to a BMGF commissioned
study, Tanzanian consumers are willing to pay a 21% premium for Tanzanian rice, over
cheaper imported rice, because of their inherent preference for its flavour, aroma and
freshness. Further, consumers are brand conscious, with Kyela and Mbeya rice regarded as
the best quality rice, followed by Morogoro rice.
In order to meet growing demand, Tanzania imports rice (e.g. Pakistani long-grain non-
basmati white rice IRRI-6, 5% broken and 25% broken varieties). Historically imports
constituted as much as 30% of domestic supply. But since the introduction of the East African
Community’s Common External Tariff (EAC-CET) in 2005, which increased the duty on
imported rice from 25% to 75%, rice imports have fallen to roughly 10% of domestic supply.
However there has been some inconsistency with respect to the government’s policy on rice
imports. In 2013 the government made the decision to import 175,000MT of rice from
Pakistan duty free. The impact of this policy on the local rice market was to depress
significantly local rice prices, causing the domestic agribusinesses and smallholder rice
producers to loose significant revenues.



                                                                                            55
Rice is produced mainly in the Morogoro, Shinyanga, Tabora, Mwanga and Mbeya regions of
Tanzania; with production dependent on smallholder farmers. It is estimated that between
1.2m to 1.8m smallholder farmers are engaged in the production of rice on farm sizes
between 0.5-3 Ha. The majority of smallholder production relies on traditional rain-fed
production (either lowland flood or upland dry), which makes very limited use of technology,
fertiliser, seeds etc. Yields achieved by these farmers are as low as 0.4 MT/ Ha (in rain-fed
upland production) to 2.5 MT/ Ha (rain-fed lowland).
Only 6% of rice is produced by large-scale commercial farms. The commercial farms can
achieve yields in excess of 8 MT/ Ha. Each of the producing regions have their own wholesale
market, all of which use the Dar es Salaam price as their benchmark wholesale market price
(less cost of transport). Examples of commercial processors include Kilombero Plantations Ltd
(KPL) which is the largest commercial producer in the Tanzania; Kapunga Rice Plantation
Limited and Mbarali Rice Farm, both in Mbeya.

3.12.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in rice

The size and continued growth of the sector should open up the sector for investment
opportunities that could be considered by GAFSP PrSW/ IFC. Government support for
reducing policy barriers in the sector is evident through promotion of investments in the rice
sector under BRN, and strengthening the Tanzania Rice Partnership to represent private

                                                                                                             57
sector stakeholders. In particular, GoT has allocated 20,000 Ha of land for investment in large-
scale commercial rice farming, with transactions coordinated by TIC.
In recent years a number of investments have been completed and agribusinesses from
outside of Tanzania have shown interest in the sector. For instance,
      AgDevCo has invested over US$11m to fund the construction of a biomass gasifier
       plant to facilitate the roll-out of a 3,000 Ha irrigation scheme. AgDevCo is also working
       with them to develop further KPL’s outgrower scheme to enable input credit packages
       and off-take contracts to be provided to smallholders.
      Bhati Bangla Agrotec, owned by the Al Falah Group in Bangladesh, has been trying to
       develop a US$5.5m 30,000 Ha project to support increased rice, maize and pulses
       production.
      Reuters reported that the Indian Bank – Yes Bank has been pursuing the acquisition of
       30,000 to 50,000 Ha of land for rice and wheat production in Tanzania, and the
       construction of a processing plant near the farm.
      AGCO, the US-based global manufacturer for farm equipment has conducted
       exploration visits to Tanzania evaluating existing opportunities with SAGCOT and MOA
       and other partners like AgDevCo and Agrica/KPL.
Whilst some of the projects have yet to be completed, with the uncertain policy environment
one of the key factors limiting progress, the available desk-based evidence suggests that there
could be a potential pipeline of investment opportunities in the rice sector for consideration
by GAFSP PrSW/ IFC.

4.     PRIORITY SECTORS AND NEXT STEPS
This section was written during the first (desk-based) phase of our study and may not reflect
the most current or detailed information available.
Section 3 presented an overview of selected agribusiness sectors in Tanzania to identify three
to five sectors to take forward for the second phase of the project. Phase 2 identified the key
stakeholders and specific investment opportunities that could be suitable for support from
the GAFSP PrSW/IFC in the priority sectors.
It is important to emphasize that this does not preclude any GAFSP PrSW/IFC investments in
the sectors not taken forward – we note in particular that some interesting cross-sector
opportunities might present themselves during the country visit.
It is necessary to identify some priority sectors to guide the Phase 2 analysis. It is probable
that through the process of consulting with multiple country stakeholders additional
opportunities in non-priority sectors will be identified.

4.1.   Approach to identifying the priority sectors

To identify the short-list we have reviewed each sector against five criteria, summarised in
the Table 4.1. Each sector is scored out of five for each indicator – the maximum score
possible is 50.
Table 4.2 then sets out the data gathered for each of the sectors.

  The data has been pulled together from a range of different sources. We have tried to use the most up to date information where possible, on occasion we have made
use of back of the envelop estimates where data was not available.

                                                                                                                                                                 62
4.2.   Priority sectors

We ranked each of the twelve sectors in the long-list against the different criteria described
in the table above. The final scores for each sector are shown in Table 4.3 below.
Overall the analysis suggests that the Phase 2 work should focus on the horticulture, rice and
edible oil sectors.

4.3.   Next steps

For phase 2 of the assignment the team will visit Tanzania to meet with key private and public
sector stakeholders primarily in the potential priority sectors but will also take advantage of
the chance to meet with potential GAFSP PrSW/IFC opportunities in other sectors as they
arise.
The objective of this visit will be to update the information available on the key stakeholders
present along each stage of the value chain for the priority sectors and to identify a pipeline
of investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/IFC.

5.      HORTICULTURE VALUE CHAIN
This section provides an overview of the horticultural value chain in Tanzania, and concludes
by presenting the investment and advisory opportunities identified during consultations with
some of the larger agribusinesses operating in the sector.

5.1.    Sector overview

Tanzania’s horticultural sector is reported to be one of the fastest growing sectors in the
economy, with estimated growth rates of 9% to 12% per annum. Overall, the sector is
estimated to provide employment for 500,000 individuals, with women making up around
65% of the workforce. It is dominated by smallholder farmers, own landholdings of less than
2 Ha.
The vast majority of production is either for home-consumption or local markets. According
to a study by Mashindano et al (2013), only around 5% of horticultural products produced in
Tanzania are destined for export markets.16
Horticultural production takes place throughout the country, but it is concentrated nearby to
the larger towns or where the climate is most suited to a particular crop. The export industry
targeting the EU tends to be based in the cooler climate around Arusha whereas Southern
Highlands and Coastal zones produce for the main local conurbations. The main horticultural
export products are fruits and vegetables such as avocados and green beans; whilst flower
exports remain an important part of the sector.
Hence we targeted the Arusha area for the majority of our consultations in the horticultural
sector as the exporters are much larger organisations and therefore represent a much better
market opportunity for the IFC.

5.1.1. Export performance of the horticulture sector

Estimates provided by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and quoted by the Tanzania
Horticulture Association (TAHA) suggest that Tanzania makes around US$500m from
exporting horticultural products each year, which is around 40% of the country’s agricultural
export earnings. It is reported that fruits and vegetables (such as green beans and avocados)
make up over 50% of horticultural exports, with spices and flowers (roses and cut flowers)
the other key export earning segments.
However, these figures are probably inflated by including the export of pulses and possibly
cashew fruits to Asia, which would not normally be counted as being horticultural exports.
According to most anecdotal evidence, up to 80% of Tanzania’s horticultural exports are

meant to be destined for EU markets; hence we reviewed EuroStat data to see what
information there is on Tanzanian exports to this market.
According to the EuroStat data, Tanzanian exports of fruit & vegetables, flowers and spices
amounted to €28.7m Euros in 2015, with around €21.1m Euros of that total coming from
fruits & vegetables, just over €6.6m from flowers and around €1m from the export of spices.
If even just 50% - as opposed to the 80% commonly quoted - of Tanzanian horticultural
exports are to the EU, it suggests that the US$500m quoted by the industry is a significant
overstatement of realised export earnings. Further the data from Eurostat is a bit closer to
the export information that we received from the agribusinesses operating in the sector.
Though it is also possible that EuroStat data understates Tanzanian exports by including some
Tanzanian exports within Kenyan export figures.
The figure below shows that Tanzania has had some success in growing horticultural export
earnings, achieving a CAGR of around 4% since 2002. That growth has been driven by
increases in the exports of fruits and vegetables. However the flower sector has declined – it
achieved exports of over €10m Euros in 2008, but has fallen back to €6.6m since then. This is
attributed to the fact that some of the flower companies that were active in Tanzania exited
the sub-sector following a decline in prices per stem post 2008, e.g. Hortanzia that has moved
from producing cut roses to chives and Arusha Blooms that now exports green beans.

Our consultations and desk-based research suggested that green beans and avocados are two
of the most important fruit and vegetable export crops. The figure below shows that the
exports of the two commodities was over €10m Euros in 2015 with over €7m comin g from
the export of avocados, which has grown quickly to become one of the larger horticultural

Kenya and Ethiopia are the two largest horticultural exporters to the EU so it is useful to see
how they have performed in recent years compared to Tanzania. The figure below shows
that both Kenya and Ethiopia achieve a much higher level of horticultural exports to the EU –
Kenya achieving €750m Euros and Ethiopia around €150m Euros – compared to Tanzania.
But it is most interesting to see how Ethiopia has achieved rapid export growth in the sector,
growing at a CAGR of 21%, since 2002. Ethiopia used to have a similar level of exports to the
EU as Tanzania but has been able to achieve a much higher level of growth.

Why have Kenya and Ethiopia outperformed Tanzania?

The above export data highlights the fact that Tanzania has been much less successful in
developing the horticulture sector than its regional competitors Kenya and Ethiopia. This is
despite the fact that it targeted the sector at about the same time as its neighbours. It is
therefore important to understand why it has been less successful. The Tanzanian
Horticultural Association (TAHA) and a number of stakeholders in the private sector
emphasise that the Kenyan Governments support of exports and the private sector allowed
its exports, initially mainly green beans and other fine vegetables to become established.
Kenyan growers also have much greater areas of good land and varying altitudes, which
means it is a much better position to grow horticultural crops at their optimum temperatures
(for example, different types of roses require different temperatures, therefore sweetheart,
spray and t-hybrid roses are grown in different parts of Kenya; the sample applies to
vegetables where green beans and mangetout are grown at different altitudes).
The addition of a wider range of crops added more volume to exports and facilitated the
establishment of a freight aircraft service out of Nairobi; today there are often 15 to 25 wide-
bodied freighters/week taking off from Kenya to Europe each with a capacity of 120 to 140
tonnes. This volume has enabled Kenyan exporters to build more effective cargo handling
facilities around the airport perimeter and negotiate very competitive freight rates.




                                                                                             69
The situation in Ethiopia was slightly different in that its Government made a determined
effort to attract investors by providing a conducive policy environment and subsidised loans
to investors. This accounted for the very significant expansion, especially in rose production
in green houses. Ethiopia does not export the wide range of products that Kenya does, but it
has a very significant rose-export industry. This does show that if the growing conditions are
correct and a Government adopts supportive policies and the correct incentives, it could be
possible to significantly expand perishable horticultural exports.
Today, the key to Kenya’s success compared to Tanzania is probably based on its very
significant economies of trade; for example Kenya’s green bean exports are 20 times larger
than Tanzania’s. Furthermore, interviews with the floriculture industry suggest that rose
production in Tanzania is at a much lower scale compared with over 3,000 Ha in Kenya and
over 1,000 Ha in Ethiopia. This tends to suggest that if the World Bank Group wants to support
the Tanzanian horticulture industry, it would be best to focus on supporting the entire
industry rather than individual producers.
TAHA has been vocal in advocating for policy changes to improve competitiveness compared
to regional rivals. We discuss some of the main outstanding policy constraints highlighted by
the industry below.

5.1.2. Key policy constraints in the horticulture sector

TAHA articulated a number of the policy-related constraints that are specific to the
horticulture sector in its position paper on incentives in the horticulture sector which was
produced back in 2011. We understand from our consultations that these issues continue to
affect horticulture in Tanzania, suggesting that the government is still not providing sufficient
support to the sector.

Excessive taxes, levies affecting the competitiveness of the sector

One of the issues raised by exporting companies is the problem of double taxation. In
particular companies have to pay tax which is included on the price of purchasing inputs but
then have to pay produce cess, which is charged as a proportion of total earnings (3 – 5% of
the producers’ farm gate price – though most Districts charge the maximum 5% rate).
According to the Local Government Authority (LGA) Finance Act, produce cess is meant to be
levied on the buyer rather than the producer. The local government has targeted horticultural
producers because they know that much of their produce is destined for export, which is not
consistent with the terms of the Finance Act.
In addition to produce cess, horticulture firms are being charged a 0.3% levy on their turnover.
The 1999 Finance Act is also clear that firms should not have to pay both the service levy and
produce cess.




                                                                                              70
Payment of VAT and receipt of refunds on VAT claims

Another issue related to tax payment is the extent to which agribusinesses in the sector have
to pay VAT on agro-inputs such as seeds and plant materials. Horticultural planting material
is charged a 25% tariff and 18% VAT. Many of the inputs that the horticulture sector needs
are not available locally so have to be imported. These additional taxes limit the
competitiveness of Tanzanian horticultural products.
Horticultural exporters are meant to be able to reclaim VAT payments from the Tanzania
Revenue Authority (TRA); however the companies report that they face significant time delays
when trying to do so – often as long as a year.

Air freight charges and facilities at Kilimanjaro airport

As we discuss in the agribusiness profiles below, most of the exporters in Tanzania’s
horticulture sector have to rely on Nairobi to export their produce. This is because the
provision of cargo plane services at Kilimanjaro airport has never really taken off. A number
of consultees suggested that this was because of the excessive charges in place for using
Kilimanjaro airport. We heard that there used to be a regular dedicated cargo service landing
at the airport, but which was stopped as landing fees increased. The scope for other players
to benefit from the airport is therefore limited. Given that a number of the large horticultural
firms are located in and around Arusha there would be potential benefits for the sector if the
government could coordinate some joint action to improve the cost effectiveness of service
provision at Kilimanjaro airport. Though the ongoing work to develop the road link between
Arusha and Kenya will also help to reduce the travel time and cost for exporters in the
medium-term.

Fertiliser registration laws

According to the Tanzania Fertiliser Regulations, 2011, any new fertiliser in Tanzania has to
be registered by the Tanzania Fertiliser Regulatory Authority (TFRA). The regulations state
that the new fertiliser has to go through three consecutive seasons of testing (which can take
three years), at a total cost of US$30,000 (US$10,000 per season).
The existing regulations are disproportionate when compared with other countries in the
region. The available evidence suggests that the length of time required to register new
fertilisers specified in the regulations is too long and the cost are too high. In other countries
such as Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana and Zambia it typically takes less than 1 year to register new
fertiliser with total registration costs estimated to be less than US$2,000.
The regulations have restricted severely the availability of new fertiliser blends to Tanzanian
farmers. There are currently just 37 different fertiliser varieties registered in Tanzania
compared to over 200 in countries such as Zambia. The constraint also reduces investment in
fertiliser blending, which has limited the growth of a local blending industry in Tanzania.


                                                                                               71
This constraint is reportedly having a material effect on the sector - in particular the emergent
commercial farmers that need access to a wide range of blends to optimise yields. We
understand that horticulture requires lots of different varieties of fertiliser in quite small
quantities. Given current registration laws it is not financially viable for a firm to undergo the
three seasons of testing and US$30,000 costs to register a new blend because the size of their
potential sales would not cover registration costs. The small varieties of fertiliser available in
Tanzania is reported to be significantly affecting the ability of emergent farmers to access the
fertilisers that they need for their crops.

Developing a programme to address the policy constraints

The above highlight some of the main policy constraints highlighted as limiting the growth of
the horticulture sector. Horticulture was included as one of the priority areas in the Kilimo
Kwanza back in 2009, and following on from that the Horticultural Development Council of
Tanzania (HODECT) developed the Tanzania Horticultural Development Strategy, which was
published in 2010.
However, the view from the range of consultees is very much that the sector lacks genuine
commitment from government to support its development; reading the strategy it is clear
that many of identified actions have not been implemented. As a result the sector is
characterised as having lots of potential, with some individual success stories – some of which
such as Africado, have individually been able to benefit from supportive government policies
(it has Export Processing Zone status).
Despite the numerous government strategy documents that have been developed in the past
there is a sense from the feedback that we received that there is almost a need to start from
a blank sheet of paper when considering the steps to develop the sector.
      First, as alluded to in the discussions above there is a need for Tanzania to stop
       focusing on trying to compete with/ mimic the Kenyan horticultural sector. The
       agronomic conditions for the horticultural sector in Tanzania are distinct from those
       in Kenya; there is a need to develop something that takes best advantage of Tanzanian
       conditions, rather than just copying Kenya at a smaller scale and less efficiently.
           o For instance, although a number of flower exporters are operating in Arusha,
             the area does not offer the same range of altitudes that Kenya has to enable
             the production of a broader range of varieties. This partly explains why the
             flower sector in Tanzania has stagnated with a number of companies leaving
             the industry as they didn’t have their own niche which enabled them to
             compete when there was more price pressure in the sector.
      One of the first steps is to refresh the sector strategy and identify what products are
       best suited to Tanzanian conditions. Again at the moment this seems like a process
       that is being led by some of the individual agribusinesses such as Rijkzwan Afrisem and
       Africado are actively in the process of testing conditions to identify which types of

                                                                                               72
       crops have potential. There is scope for an advisory programme that brings together
       government policy makers and these type of companies to help develop a more
       Tanzania-focused horticultural development strategy.
      Once it is more focused strategy is developed government will need to identify the
       steps that will be needed to create the enabling environment for the sector to grow.
       Tanzanian policy makers could be supported to determine how to provide a
       sustainable package of incentives for the sector. Tanzania could learn from how the
       Ethiopian government went about designing and then implementing successfully its
       horticultural sector development plan.
The above describes a set of actions that could support the medium-term development of the
sector. In the short-term central government and local government need to work together to
address the issues around the more effective implementation of existing laws and
regulations. TAHA has tried to advocate on these issues on multiple occasions and could
potentially benefit from support from development partners to make more progress.

5.2.   Investment/ advisory opportunities in horticulture for GAFSP PrSW/IFC

Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons.
Overall, our assessment of the horticulture sector in Tanzania is that there is limited scope for
the sector to grow in the coming years unless government takes a much more proactive
approach to supporting the growth of the sector. Whilst there is reportedly high and growing
demand for horticultural products in the EU markets it is not clear that Tanzania has much of
a competitive advantage in many of the products, particularly given the competition provided
by Kenya.
However, we did identify a number of professionally managed farms that are having varying
degrees of success in exporting to the EU and other developed markets. Most of the
companies that we consulted with are achieving a turnover in the US$3m to US$10m range.
They indicated a desire to invest to expand their operations over time, but noted that most
agribusinesses in the sector do not have the capacity to absorb one-off US$5m + investments
at the moment. Instead they need investments in the US$500K to US$5m range to support
more sustainable growth, given the supporting infrastructure and human resource needs
associated with any expansion.
As a result the immediate investment needs for the prospective companies is in general less
than the intended US$5m project size [with one exception omitted for confidentiality
reasons]. However, with the right partner, there could be potential to complete a number of
investments to support expansion over the coming years.
The scope for advisory support with potential to lead to investment activity also seems more
limited at this stage apart from the opportunity identified to support the pilot wholesale
market. Most of the existing firms that could benefit from investment in the coming years are


                                                                                              73
already operating in partnership with technical advisors or are able to manage their activities
in-house, though this would need to be explored with the target agribusinesses in more detail.

5.2.1. Scope to establish a risk-sharing facility

One possible area for intervention raised during consultations was the scope to establish a
risk-sharing facility focused on supporting the growth of emergent farmers in the horticulture
sector [details are omitted for confidentiality reasons].
It is unlikely that the overall size of the horticulture sector is large enough to justify
development of a dedicated risk-sharing facility, but there is some scope to follow-up with
existing initiatives to link them to the IFC’s interventions with the Private Agricultural Sector
Support Trust (PASS).

5.2.2. Scope to support companies to scale-up out-grower programmes

There could be potential for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC to provide advisory support to agribusinesses
that want to increase the scale of their out-grower programmes. We consulted with three
horticultural companies that could present an immediate advisory opportunity; however they
are all at different stages of development so would require a tailored approach [details are
omitted for confidentiality reasons].

5.3.   Next steps for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in the horticulture sector

There are some potential individual investments for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC to consider in the
horticulture sector in Tanzania [details are omitted for confidentiality reasons]. Depending on
the extent to which IFC wants to engage with horticulture we have also identified a range of
other businesses which it may wish to consult to review their stated investment needs.
However, our overall assessment is that, apart from some individual success stories, the
horticulture sector in Tanzania has failed to take advantage of the opportunity to develop.
While Kenya has some agro-climatic advantages over Tanzania, it is striking to look at the way
Ethiopia has been able to achieve such rapid growth in export earnings since starting from a
similar base as Tanzania through proactive government measures to develop the sector.
Engagement with government to address the sector’s various policy and infrastructure
constraints may be more important than making individual investments. Furthermore, one
of the potential issues with the sector is that it has yet to really develop a niche that is
designed to make best use of Tanzanian conditions and market access rather than simply
mimicking what takes place in Kenya at a smaller scale.

6.           EDIBLE OILS VALUE CHAIN
This section provides an overview of the main edible oil sub-sectors in Tanzania. The section
concludes by outlining the projects identified during the country visit.

6.1.         Sector overview

The edible oil sector is growing at over 10% per annum according to FAO Stat statistics on
domestic production levels. The main edible oilseeds produced in Tanzania are sunflower,
groundnuts, and cottonseeds which account for over 85% of production. Domestic production
of edible oils is about 200,000 tonnes to 250,000 tonnes, with sunflower oil accounting for
around 160,000 tonnes, both cottonseed and sesame oil production at around 20,000 tonnes,
and 15,000 tonnes of palm each year.
Tanzania’s total demand for edible oil is estimated to be up to 500,000 tonnes. At the moment
around 50% to 60% of Tanzania’s edible oil consumption is impo rted (as illustrated in Figure
6.1), suggesting an opportunity for import substitution. It is estimated that over US$120m is
spent on edible oil imports each year, with oil palm the most imported product, though
domestic production of oil palm is very low.

We present a review of sunflower, palm and cotton oil sectors below, before presenting our
findings on investment opportunities.

6.1.1. Sunflower oil

Global exports of sunflower oil are greater than US$10bn. The sub-sector has been growing
at over 10% per annum over the last ten years, driven by increased consumer demand. The
global price for sunflower oil has increased from around US$700-900 per tonne a decade ago


                                                                                                                75
to its current level of around US$1,000 per tonne. Over the last twenty years, global
production of sunflower seeds has nearly doubled from around 20m tonnes to close to 40m
tonnes. The leading global producers of sunflower seeds are Russia, the Ukraine and the EU
block. In SSA Tanzania is second to South Africa as the leading sunflower seed producer,
though African countries account for only around 5% to 6% of world output.
In Tanzania sunflower seed production has increased rapidly in recent years. Between 2010
and 2014 production has reportedly more than doubled. This has been driven by a significant
improvement in yields and an increase in the planted area. Sunflower seeds are grown across
a range of different regions in Tanzania.
Figure 6.2: Sunflower seed production in Tanzania




Source: FAOStat

Sunflower oil production in Tanzania has mirrored the increase in seed production, growing
by over 200% since 2010. Most sunflower oil produced in Tanzania is consumed domestically
– exports of sunflower oil products are estimated to be around US$6m a year. However, there
is an important trade in sunflower cake (a bi-product of the oil production). Exports of cake
have grown to over US$60m, with the vast majority exported to India.

Sunflower oil value chain

The production of sunflower seeds in Tanzania is dominated by smallholder farmers which
make up around 95% of production. Smallholders typically operate on farms of less than 2 Ha
and have no access to on-farm machinery or storage facilities. The farmers use primarily
recycled traditional seed varieties – though in some cases get access to seeds distributed by
the Agricultural Seeds Agency (ASA). Overall it is estimated that around 35% of farmers are
using improved seed varieties.
It is estimated that around 8m smallholders are involved in producing sunflower seeds in
Tanzania. The crop is usually grown as an intercrop together with maize, sorghum and
cowpeas.
The sunflower seed produced by smallholders is sold to local traders, agents or collected by
the Agricultural Marketing Cooperatives operating on behalf of local processors, though a


                                                                                          76
proportion is sold directly to the large processors. Sunflower seed produced by medium and
large-scale producers is generally sold directly to processors.
The largest processors are Mount Meru Millers (IFC is already in discussion with them and
asked us not to meet them for this assignment), Sunshine Industrial Limited (a sunflower
processing company located in Dodoma) and Murzah Oil Mills. The majority of sunflower oil
produced by the large processors is for export markets. It is estimated that despite the rapid
increase in sunflower seed production there remains significant spare processing capacity in
Tanzania. There does not seem to be much scope for additional investment in processing
capacity at present, efforts to develop the sector will need to focus on improving smallholder
productivity by increasing use of improved seeds and other inputs.
An overview of the sunflower oil value chain is presented below.

                                                                                                77
Input-costs faced by sunflower oil farmers

As mentioned above one of the main development opportunities for the sunflower sector is
to continue efforts to develop the productivity of sunflower farmers. One option could be to
work with one/ a group of processors to help them provide finance to smallholders so that
the farmers can make use of improved inputs and so increase productivity levels.
Based on some existing studies we present a simple back-of-the envelop analysis to give an
idea of the potential size of such a scheme.
      The rough cost per Ha of the inputs required to produce sunflower seeds is around
       US$250 to US$500 per Ha, this is to achieve yields of around 1 tonne per Ha.
      Fertiliser (around 23%) is estimated to be the largest cost in the study, with labour,
       ploughing, packing and transport costs also significant.
      As we describe in more detail in the profile below, Murzah Oil is interested in investing
       to develop a sunflower seed processing unit which has the capacity to process 500
       tonnes per day.
      Depending on the level of capacity utilisation this might mean that it needs between
       100,000 to 150,000 tonnes of sunflower seed a year.
      Given the input cost per tonne of US$500, this implies that input costs would be within
       the US$25m to US$75m range.
      If a scheme were developed in which smallholders had to pay half of the input costs
       up-front and where then provided with the remaining input costs on credit this would
       still involve a financing requirement in the region of US$10m to US$40m to support
       an expansion in processing capacity similar to that suggested by Murzah.

Key constraints in the sunflower sub-sector

The government’s recent sunflower strategy document highlights the following as the main
constraints facing the sector:
      The need to improve farmers’ access to improved seeds and inputs. In addition, there
       is a need to train more farmers in GAP practices so that their produce can be exported
       to international markets.
      Improving coordination and transparency between the smallholder farmers, traders
       and processors.
      The processors have indicated that they face a complicated tax regime including VAT,
       produce CESS and other duties on their imports which creates uncertainty for their
       business and can reduce the competitiveness of domestic production compared to
       imports.



                                                                                             78
6.1.2. Palm oil

Tanzania produces very little of its own crude palm oil. In 2013 it imported 256,000 tonnes of
crude palm and palm kernel oil, compared to smallholder-based domestic production of only
14,000 tonnes. The imported oil is fractioned and refined in one of five-or-so plants around
Dar es Salaam. The largest refiners include:
      East Coast Oils and Fats Ltd (MeTL Group subsidiary). Has a single plant with a refining
       capacity of around 200,000 tonnes. MeTL is reportedly acquiring 25,000 Ha of land for
       large-scale palm cultivation, with an estimated eventual yield of 118,000 tonnes of
       crude oil.
      Murzah Wilmar East Africa Ltd. A joint venture between the Murzah Group and
       Wilmar International formed in December 2015. Owns two major refineries with a
       joint refining capacity of 108,000 tonnes per annum, but is currently planning to
       consolidate operations onto a single site.
      Bidco Oil & Soap Ltd. Has a single plant with a refining capacity of around 120,000
       tonnes.
As well as the major MeTL expansion referenced above, plans are underway for a 10,000 Ha
“Integrated Oil Palm Project” in the Ruvu River Basin near Dar Es Salaam. The project is being
undertaken by TB Tanagro Ltd - a joint venture between the state-run National Development
Corporation (20%) and Singapore-based Nava Bharat Pte Limited (80%). At the moment 6,000
Ha of land has been secured. NDC predicts eventual yields of 7.7 tonnes of crude oil per
hectare per year (up to 77,000 tonnes, assuming 100% of the proposed area is used).
In July 2016 the GoT introduced a 10% import tariff on crude palm to incentivise domestic
production. This was a departure from the 0% tariff which still holds in other EAC countries.
The effect on refiners is unclear, but it raises the chances of increasing domestic palm
production or substitution towards other oilseeds.

6.1.3. Cotton oil

According to existing data around 400,000 Ha of rain-fed land in the Lakes zone are sown each
year by around 400,000 smallholder farmers who sell to ginners. Ginners separate out cotton
lint as the primary product, of which 80-85% is exported as raw lint rather than being
processed in-country. Cottonseed is produced as a bi-product, but which is increasingly being
crushed for oil and oilseed cake rather than being sold back to farmers for sowing.
Our consultations have suggested that Tanzania’s cotton sector is struggling. Tanzanian
smallholders are finding it difficult to compete in what is a highly competitive global market.
In 2014/15 Tanzania had an estimated average yield of 200 kg lint / Ha, compared to 475 in
Burkina Faso (Africa’s leading producer) and 550 in India. As a result, the sector is reported to
be shrinking. We have heard that Tanzania’s cotton mills are operating at about 20% of full
capacity, with only 20 of around 32 ginners with installed oil mills currently operational. This

                                                                                              79
is in line with a similar picture of decline in several African countries in the face of competition
from synthetic fabrics and mills operating in Asia.
Oil production from cottonseed crushing, on the other hand, is reported to have doubled
between 2010 and 2013 as world prices jumped. In Tanzania, crude oil prices reportedly rose
from around 250 to 720 TZS/kg. Exports of cotton by-products were negligible until 2014, at
which point they jumped from US$4.7m in 2013 to US$32.7m (of which 93% was crude
cottonseed oil). The sudden increase appears to have been almost entirely due to a buyer in
Switzerland.17
During our consultations we spoke to several stakeholders (including Sumaria - owner of S&C
Ginning Ltd.) who confirmed that cotton ginners have been struggling in recent years, are
heavily indebted and are not looking to expand. Some of the larger ginners or crushing and
refining plants (e.g. Mount Meru Millers, Kahama Oil Mills, Birchand Oil Mills, Olam Tanzania)
may seek to expand their crushing capacity at an appropriate scale for IFC. Although we are
not aware of any current expansion projects, we understand that Cooperative Rural
Development Bank (CRDB) are providing working capital credit to several ginners: including
KSH35bn of credit to a major Chinese-owned miller based in Shinyanga.

6.2.       Investment/ advisory opportunities in edible oils for GAFSP PrSW/IFC

Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons.
Overall, our consultations have indicated that the most likely sub-sectors to yield investable
opportunities are sunflower seed oil and, more speculatively, domestic palm production. The
cotton sector is generally in decline, although seed crushing appears to be defying the
downwards trend. The introduction of a 10% crude palm import tariff may generate
opportunities in domestic palm production, though could also dampen appetite for additional
refining capacity.

6.3.       Next steps for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in the edible oils sector

With respect to identifiable investment opportunities, the following represent opportunities
that are worth following up on: [details are omitted for confidentiality reasons].
More broadly, there may be an opportunity to meet the high demand for working capital
among growers and millers in the edible oils sector, possibly through a bank such as CRDB.

7.     GRAIN VALUE CHAIN
This section covers the grains value chain in Tanzania. We provide an overview of the main
grain sub-sectors and then discuss the investment opportunities identified for consideration
by GAFSP PrSW/ IFC. It is important to note up-front that we were asked not to cover the
grain milling sector in any detail given existing IFC activity in this area.

7.1.   Sector overview

The main grains produced in Tanzania are maize, rice and wheat. We have focused our
analysis on rice and wheat value chains given the general lack of commercial activity in
Tanzanian maize production (smallholders were reported to account for 95% of production
in 2013). The only large-scale maize producer we are aware of (Kilombero Plantations Ltd.) is
profiled below under rice - its main crop.

7.1.1. Wheat

Wheat is Tanzania’s fourth most important crop after maize, cassava and rice. Over 90% of
production comes from the northern highlands (Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Manyara regions)
and the southern highlands (Iringa, Mbeya regions). Production in the southern highlands is
predominantly small scale and large scale in the northern highlands. Wheat production has
grown to 167,000 tonnes, from around just 43,000 tonnes in 2008 driven by increases in land
allocated to wheat production. Wheat yields have remained stagnant at just below 1 tonne
per Ha over the last ten years.

The wheat milling industry is dominated by two companies that are based in Dar es Salaam –
Bakhresa (2,500 tonnes per day milling capacity) and Mikoani (650 tonnes per day capacity),
though there are a number of smaller millers operating in the sector such as Coast millers.




                                                                                          81
Wheat consumption is higher in urban areas and the growth of the major cities of Dar es
Salaam, Mwanza and Arusha will further spur demand for wheat products. The main growth
categories for the wheat industry are pasta, biscuits, and breakfast cereals.
The current production of wheat is estimated to account for approx. 10% of total domestic
consumption; the country is reliant on imports to meet demand, with wheat imports costing
between US$225m to US$300m per annum.

7.1.2. Rice

According to data from FAOStat, rice production in Tanzania has more than doubled over the
past 14 years with production growing at a CAGR of 9% p.a. This growth has been driven by
both an increase in rice yields, which have grown from 1.9 tonnes per Ha to 2.8 tonnes per
Ha and an increase in the amount of land under rice production.
Figure 7.2: Rice production in Tanzania

Rice is an important crop for both subsistence and commercial farming in Tanzania, and
consumption has been increasing in recent years. Rice is more expensive than other cereal
crops including maize (Tanzania’s chief staple crop) but similar to a number of other countries
in SSA, the combination of increasing urbanisation and household income has led to
households consuming more rice and substituting away from the cheaper cereals.
Rice is produced mainly in the Morogoro, Shinyanga, Tabora, Mwanga and Mbeya regions of
Tanzania; with production dependent on smallholder farmers. It is estimated that between
1.2m to 1.8m smallholder farmers are engaged in the production of rice on farm sizes
between 0.5-3 Ha. The majority of smallholder production relies on traditional rain-fed
production (either lowland flood or upland dry), which makes very limited use of technology,
fertiliser, seeds etc. Yields achieved by these farmers are as low as 0.4 tonnes per Ha (in rain-
fed upland production) to 2.5 tonnes per Ha (rain-fed lowland).
Only 6% of rice is produced by large-scale commercial farms. The commercial farms can
achieve yields in excess of 8 tonnes per Ha. Each of the producing regions have their own
wholesale market, all of which use the Dar es Salaam price as their benchmark wholesale
market price (less cost of transport). The largest commercial rice producer is KPL. Our

                                                                                              82
assessment from a number of consultations is that they are the only rice producing company
that has potential to partner with GAFSP PrSW/ IFC, but not at present. The other large
producers are Kapunga Rice Plantation Limited and Mbarali Rice Farm, both located in Mbeya.
We consulted with KPL as part of this project and present findings below.

Rice imports vs. domestic production

Dar es Salaam market is the largest market for rice in Tanzania and is responsible for
approximately 40% of the country’s rice consumption. According to a BMGF commissioned
study, Tanzanian consumers are willing to pay a 21% premium for Tanzanian rice, over
cheaper imported rice, because of their inherent preference for its flavour, aroma and
freshness. Further, consumers are brand conscious, with Kyela and Mbeya rice regarded as
the best quality rice, followed by Morogoro rice.
In order to meet growing demand, Tanzania imports rice (e.g. Pakistani long-grain non-
basmati white rice IRRI-6, 5% broken and 25% broken varieties). Historically imports
constituted as much as 30% of domestic supply. But since the introduction of the East African
Community’s Common External Tariff (EAC-CET) in 2005, which increased the duty on
imported rice from 25% to 75%, rice imports have fallen to roughly 10% of domestic supply.
The combination of forecasts for continued growth in demand for rice, combined with a
strong preference for domestic supply suggests that there may be scope for supporting
investment in increased rice production.
However there has been some inconsistency with respect to the government’s policy on rice
imports as is discussed in the box below.

 Box 7.1: Importation of rice duty-free, inconsistent with existing trade policy
 In 2005 the East African Community imposed a Common External Tariff (CET) on rice imported from
 outside of the community of 75%. The presumable intention behind this policy was to help stimulate
 the growth of the region’s domestic rice sectors – indeed in Tanzania rice domestic rice production
 has doubled in the past ten years.
 However in 2013, the government of Tanzania made the decision to import 175,000MT of rice from
 Pakistan duty free, based on misleading local price information (pricing data was used only for the
 premium market segment, which does not reflect pricing for the majority of consumers). The impact
 of this policy on the local rice market was to depress significantly local rice prices causing domestic
 agribusinesses and smallholder rice producers to lose significant revenues.
 Impact on private investment:
 Since 2008, after $40m of initial investment, KPL has become East Africa’s leading rice producer
 with a 5,000-hectare nucleus commercial farm and a transformative satellite smallholder
 programme lifting 5,000 farmer families from subsistence to surplus.
 KPL recently attracted around US$11m of investment from AgDevCo to support an expansion in its
 business, which will benefit the company and the farmers attached to the scheme. The financial
 viability of the investment would be undermined if government were to dump duty free rice on the
 market again thus highlighting the uncertainty faced by an investor in the sector.

Although the figures are dated, the 2012 BMGF analysis shows that domestic rice production
is not competitive with imported rice absent the imposition of the 75% tariff. This is due to

                                                                                                      83
high labour costs involved in rice production, resulting from labour intensive production
practices and high transportation costs. While consumers are thought to be willing to pay a
premium for domestically produced rice, available evidence suggests that the commercial
case for investment in the sector is highly dependent on the continued imposition of the
common external tariff and the ability to export within the region. Rice producers in Tanzania
are currently of the view that the EAC tariff is working and that the government retains
commitment to enforcing it – though there is obvious wariness that government has shown
in the recent past that it will dump imported rice on the domestic market. Also it should be
noted that there are significant issues with cross-border smuggling of rice from outside the
EAC region given the price incentive created by the external tariff.
Our consultations have suggested that Tanzania is currently enforcing the common external
tariff on rice. However, Rwanda and Burundi still impose a 75% tariff on Tanzanian rice (see
Box 7.1 above). As a result, Tanzania is now in significant surplus (500,000 tonnes of paddy).
Market prices are accordingly low, and can fall below break-even point for growers with larger
overheads.

7.2.   Market information on the grain sector

7.2.1. Brewing - wheat, barley and sorghum

Tanzania lacks wheat or barley farms of a sufficient size to be of interest to IFC. Mountainside
Farms Ltd, the largest of only four commercial producers, made US$2m of revenue in 2012.
Although its scale may have increased since then, it is unlikely to be able to take a loan greater
than $US5m.
Large investments in these sectors are most likely to be viable at the processing level. Both
major breweries in the country, Serengeti and Tanzania Breweries (SBL and TBL), are
reportedly planning to source locally more wheat, barley and white sorghum. They would
ideally wish to engage with a commercial operation such as Mountainside Farms Ltd (which
was originally formed in 2000 as a joint venture with SBL), although finding the requisite land
would be difficult, or to partner formalised outgrower programmes (tax incentives make out-
growing through smallholder farmers reasonably economical). We have also heard that grain
storage is likely to be a focus area for expansion.

7.2.2. Milling

As the IFC is already in close contact with most of the major millers operating in Tanzania, we
were directed not to engage with milling companies. This restricted the potential for finding
new investable opportunities in the grains sector. We have therefore explored other areas in
more depth - namely, brewing and rice - the only grain for which commercial growers of a
suitable size exist in Tanzania.




                                                                                               84
However as part of our discussion with Murzah Wilmar East Africa (MWEAL) on edible oils we
identified an opportunity to develop a rice and a flour mill (profiled in Section 7.3). We
understand that the IFC has not yet made contact with this company.

7.2.3. Rice farming

Other than KPL (described in Section 7.3 below), the two other commercial rice operations in
Tanzania are:
      Kapunga Rice Plantation Ltd, owned by ETG and Duxton Asset Management; and
      Mbarali Rice Farms Ltd, owned by Highland Estates Ltd.
Both companies are based in the Mbeya region and mostly now rely on smallholder
production. Our consultations have confirmed that both estates had large donor sums
invested into their establishment through the National Farming Corporation (in the region of
US$60-80m each). Our contacts do not expect either estate to be an IFC investment
opportunity. Mbarali in particular was not considered likely to pass IFC’s social criteria due to
land dispute issues.

7.3.   Investment/ advisory opportunities in grain for GAFSP PrSW/IFC

Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons.
Our consultations have confirmed that grain producers in Tanzania are too small to be
recipients of IFC financing with the exception of the three major rice producers. Of these
three, none appear to have a current need for additional external finance, and at least one
would not be likely to meet due diligence requirements. We have identified one company
that is seeking significant finance for multiple projects [details are omitted for confidentiality
reasons]. Although neither brewery is looking for external finance themselves, there is
potential to explore opportunities to provide credit to their grain suppliers either through the
breweries, or through an intermediary.

7.4.   Next steps for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in the grains sector

Our ability to review the value chain and identify the investment opportunities in the sector
was limited because we were asked not to see the major grain milling companies. Despite this
we were able to identify some opportunities that could be worth following up with: [details
are omitted for confidentiality reasons].




                                                                                               85
8.       INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER SECTORS
In addition to the analysis of the priority sectors we identified opportunities that we came
across during our country visit. They cover the following sectors, which we present below:
        tea;
        sugar;
        financial services; and
        one individual project opportunity in the sisal sector.

8.1.     Tea sector

8.1.1. Tea value chain

There are three main tea growing areas in Tanzania: the Southern highland zones of Mufindi,
Njome and Rungwe district; the North East zone of Lusotho, Korogwe and Muheza districts;
and the Northwest zone of Bukoba and Muleba districts. Overall, approx. 22,000 Ha of land is
used to produce tea, which is split roughly 50:50 between land under production by
smallholders and land used by the commercial tea estates, though estates account for around
two thirds of made tea production.
Around 50,000 smallholders are involved in the production of tea, relying on rain-fed
production and making limited use of inputs. The smallholder yield is estimated at less than
one tonne/ Ha, whilst estates have been achieving close to 2 tonnes/ Ha. Unilever and Rift
Valley, which are both growing under irrigation, are reportedly achieving 2.8 – 3.5 tonnes/
Ha.
Tanzania’s production of made tea has climbed gradually over the last ten years - reaching
around 37,000 tonnes in 2014, but dipping back to 32,000 tonnes in 2015 following a
prolonged dry spell in Rungwe District and uneven rainfall in Mufindi District. In both years
around 30,000 tonnes were exported, generating $52m of export earnings in FY15/16. The
remainder is packaged and sold to domestic markets. Packaging and marketing of tea is
carried out by five licensed factories run by Afri Tea and Coffee Ltd., Chai Bora Ltd., Chai Amani
Ltd., International Food Packers, and Rift Valley Tea Solutions.

The Tea Board of Tanzania has forecast that both local sales and export of tea will continue
to climb over the next 7 years. Our consultations have suggested that producers continue to
invest in improving and expanding their plantations despite suffering from low world prices
in recent years. Part of the investment rationale for tea in Tanzania is that domestic
consumption is expected to grow as population and household wealth rises. Kenyans
reportedly consume four times as much tea per capita as Tanzanians, which industry
stakeholders tend to attribute to the larger disposable incomes of Kenyan consumers.

There are four companies currently operating in Tanzania at a scale that might yield
investment opportunities appropriate for IFC (not including METL). These are:
        Rift Valley Corporation. A Harare-based group of mainly agricultural businesses owned
         by the Höegh and von Pezold families. In Tanzania, Rift Valley owns and operates three
         tea estates through Mufindi Tea Company / Mufindi Tea Estates with factories in
         Itona, Luponde and Kibena (ex CDC), and a factory in Lupembe for processing tea from
         smallholders. It also started a trading and blending business based in Dar in 2013.
        Unilever Tea Tanzania Ltd. Unilever owns and operates estates in the Mufindi district
         of southern Tanzania, with three factories at Lugoda, Kibwele, and Kilima. Unilever is
         currently undertaking a c. €47m project to build a new factory and estate in the
         Njombe area and to establish a service company serving smallholder farmers in the
         region. Project partners include DfID (£7.5m), the Wood Family Trust, and the Gatsby
         Foundation as part of their “Chai” project.
        Tanzania Tea Packers Ltd (Tatepa). Tatepa is a tea and avocado producer, majority-
         owned by Maris Capital. It owns and operates the Katumba tea estate and factory
         through Wakulima Tea Company Ltd (WATCO).
        East Usambara Tea Company Ltd (EUTCO). EUTCO, which is 50% owned by MAC
         Group, operates on 14,164 Ha of land in Muheza District with factories at Kwamkoro
         and Bulwa.

8.2.       Sugar sector

Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons.
We also had consultations with Coca Cola Kwanza and Sumaria - two coke bottlers and major
sugar consumers, we combined these discussions with some research to present some initial
findings on the sugar sector.
Industry and government stakeholders alike recognise the potential for expansion of
Tanzanian sugar production. There are several different estimates of Tanzania’s sugar
requirement were quoted (up to 600,000 tonnes per year), but there is agreement that it is
not currently being met by domestic production which fluctuates around 300,000 tonnes. As
shown in Figure 8.2 below, Tanzania is therefore importing large quantities of sugar each year,
mostly from Thailand, Brazil, India and Indonesia. Most of this is white refined sugar for
industrial purposes. We understand that Tanzania currently has only one refined white sugar
factory - Kilombero’s K2 factory at Ruhembe.

Sugar is an issue of growing political concern in Tanzania. In February 2016, President
Magufuli ordered the restriction of sugar import permits in a move to protect domestic
producers from highly competitive world prices. We understand that this ban was lifted in
early September. This has heightened interest in adding production capacity, but the
investment environment remains challenging.
The Bagamoyo EcoEnergy project to plant 8,000 Ha of sugar cane for sugar, ethanol and
power production has been trying to put up a refinery for the last 5 years. However, we have
heard reports that the project may not now go ahead, which may be explained by the

difficulty of securing land rights. Existing sugar farms’ access to land for expansion is also
restricted without securing further land grants from the government.
The government has reportedly directed two pension funds to invest in government part-
owned farms. Although we are not aware of the specifics of these plans we have heard that
the investment may be in the region of US$50-75m, but that they are not actively looking for
private sponsors.
There may be opportunities to co-invest in schemes with government backing such as these.
This could require sustained political engagement and may not be within the remit of GAFSP.

Box D.1: Case study on KSC
 Given limited potential for horizontal estate expansion, KSC has increased the number of outgrowers from
 2,000 in 1998 to 8,000 in 2013, contributing 43% of cane crushed by two mills as of 2013. KSC outgrowers
 must join a cane growers’ association and register with the TSB. A Cane Supply Agreement (CSA) is signed
 between the company and the 15 farmers’ associations – under the CSA for 2013-16 period, KSC pays
 outgrowers for the weight and sucrose content of their delivered cane, less the costs of harvesting, transport,
 processing, marketing and distribution.
 Outgrowers were estimated to have earned US$35.6/ MT for the year 2013/14, before adjustments for
 sucrose levels and actual sales. Although expansion of the out-grower scheme has benefited smallholders,
 recently the situation has deteriorated with incomes declining due to a fall in producer price, low sucrose
 levels and some some sugarcane remaining unharvested.

ANNEX E          PROFILES OF TANZANIAN DAIRY COMPANIES
The boxes below provide a brief profile of the major agribusinesses operating in Tanzania’s
dairy sub-sector. This annex was collated during the first (desk-based) phase of our study and
may not reflect the most current or detailed information available.

 Tanga Fresh – A leading dairy foods company, contracting 4,5000 farmers to supply milk to its plant; annual
 turnover estimated at $4m. The company produces fresh milk, fermented milk, plain and flavoured yoghurt,
 mozzarella cheese, butter and ghee. Company meets international hygiene standards and uses state-of-the-
 art European equipment and methods. In 2010, Tanga Dairies Cooperative Union (TDCU) collaborated with
 Dutch and local partners, to set up a breeding unit and a dairy farm in the Tanga region to increase the supply
 of heifers to TDCU farmers and to expand the supply of milk to the Tanga Fresh factory; in addition, the
 company introduced text messaging service for farmers and milk collection centres to facilitate information
 flow about market, new industry developments, animal husbandry practices etc (used by 2,000 of 4,500
 farmers). Processing capacity doubled from 15,000 L/day in 2008 to 31,000 L/ day in 2010, with plans to
 expand capacity to 50,000 L/day in 2015. Tanga Fresh is also investing in services of Virtual City, to automate
 the recording of milk collection and payments to farmers, with the objective or ensuring the farmer is paid
 the correct amount. In 2014, AfDB- managed AFT fund has provided a grant of USD$150,500 to Tanga Fresh
 UHT Milk Factory top expand production capacity.



 Mgolole Agro-Processing Co. Ltd – Received funding of $450,000 in 2015 from AECF-TZAW to develop an
 integrated dairy project to produce and sell quality heifers to farmers in Morogoro region, specifically by
 adopting and using improved breeding methods; utilizing locally available feed resources supplemented with
 innovative feeding techniques; forming mutually beneficial and sustainable partnerships with financial
 institutions, smallholder farmers, milk processing companies and other stakeholders along the dairy value
 chain. The project is expected to directly benefit 2,139 households with an annual income of US$1,448 per
 household, resulting in a total benefit of US$ 3,097,272 at the end of the project.



 Shambani Graduates Enterprises – Milk-processing company founded by 3 graduates of Sokoine University
 of Agriculture in Tanzania) have committed to contributing to national increased annual milk production
 targets by investments in expanding their milk collection, processing and marketing; and building
 quality/hygiene capacity of around 400 milk producers to supply 4,000 L/day, to create additional $900 in
 annual income per farmer.

 Key progress updates as of Year 3 (2013): (i) development of business plan and focused strategy, with unique
 value proposition for expansion; (ii) investment of $62,500 in renovating facilities, including milk collection
 centres; (iii) discussions with two firms for financing but no commitment secured to date; (iv) 1,500 L/day of
 milk sourced from around 120 smallholders; and (v) near-completion of installation of a new boiler to enhance
 processing capacity.
