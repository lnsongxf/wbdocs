In this edition of Trade Watch, we address three questions concerning recent trade developments:
What is happening? Why? Does it matter?


                                                                                 What Is Happening?
2016 is the fifth consecutive year of sluggish trade growth and the year with the weakest trade
performance since the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis (figure ES1a). Current estimates
of growth in the volumes of trade in goods and services range from 1.9 percent to 2.5 percent, but
preliminary high-frequency data suggest that merchandise trade volumes may have grown by only
about 1 percent. The year 2016 is different from the other post crisis years, in that trade sluggishness
is a characteristic of both advanced and emerging economies.

Since 2008, trade values of services and trade values of goods have followed different trajectories,
with growth in services trade more resilient during the global financial crisis and the global trade
slowdown of recent years (figure ES1b).

Trade developments in 2016 continued to reflect enduring structural determinants, such as the
maturing of global value chains (GVCs) and the slower pace of trade liberalization, and cyclical
factors, notably slow global growth, the trough in commodity prices, and macroeconomic rebalancing
in China (figure ES2).

The increase in policy uncertainty may also have contributed to trade slowing down further in 2016
(figure ES3). The negative association between economic policy uncertainty and trade growth that
emerges from the prima facie evidence is confirmed when we look at a broader sample spanning 18
countries over 30 years (figure ES4). The regression analysis in Chapter 1 indicates that a 1 percent
increase in uncertainty is associated with a 0.02-percentage point reduction in goods and services
trade volume growth. This implies that the increase in uncertainty in 2016 may have reduced trade
growth by about 0.6 percentage points, which is equivalent to 75 percent of the difference between
trade growth rates in 2015 and 2016.

Recent research indicates that trade agreements have contributed to trade growth and that recent
growth would have been even lower in their absence. The evidence presented here suggests that even
the threat to unravel such agreements may hurt trade growth by adding to policy uncertainty.


                                                                    Does It Matter?
The trade slowdown, insofar as it is attributable to the stagnation of GVCs, may also help to explain
part of the recent productivity slowdown. The slower pace of GVC expansion could be diminishing
the scope of productivity growth through a more efficient international division of labor and diffusion
of technologies.

Analysis of manufacturing data according to country and year reveals a link between labor productivity
and GVCs. The data point to a positive association between growth in real labor productivity per
employee in manufacturing and growth in vertical specialization (figure ES5). A formal econometric
analysis based on a panel estimation covering 13 sectors in 40 countries over 15 years suggests that
participation in GVCs is a significant driver of labor productivity. An increase of 10 percent in the
level of GVC participation increased average productivity by 1.7 percent.

                             Chapter 1: Trade Developments in 2016
Overview of Trade Developments
2016 is the fifth consecutive year of sluggish trade growth and the year with the weakest trade
performance since the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Current estimates of growth
in the volumes of trade in goods and services range from 1.9 percent to 2.5 percent; preliminary
high-frequency data suggest that merchandise trade volumes may have grown by slightly above
1 percent. The year 2016 is different from the other post crisis years, in that trade sluggishness
is a characteristic of both advanced and emerging economies.

World trade performance in 2016 appears to be the weakest since the aftermath of the 2008 global
financial crisis. The latest estimates of growth in the volume of trade in goods and services range
from 1.9 percent to 2.5 percent.1 Despite the differences in magnitudes of the reported statistics, there
is a consensus across data sources that 2016 will register the lowest growth in trade volumes since
the Great Recession of 2008–2009.2,3 Figure 1 illustrates this trend using data from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook.

    Estimates of growth in world trade volume vary by data source for a variety of reasons. These include: different
cut-off dates and estimates for missing quarterly national accounts data, different aggregation methods, or use of
alternative indicators for goods and services trade volumes when national account data is not available.

High-frequency statistics also point to slowing growth in world merchandise trade for most of 2016,
whereas services trade was more dynamic. Preliminary high-frequency data from the World Trade
Monitor that the Central Planning Bureau Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis (CPB)
has issued suggest that merchandise trade volumes may have grown by only 1.1 percent in the first
11 months of 2016 relative to the corresponding 11 months in 2015 (figure 2a)4. High-frequency data
available from the World Trade Organization (WTO) for the first three quarters of 2016 indicate a
fledgling recovery in the growth of service trade values after the decline in 2015. Since 2008, trade
values of services and of goods have followed different trajectories, with growth in services trade more
resilient during the global financial crisis and the global trade slowdown of recent years (figure 2b).

Trade sluggishness in 2016 is a characteristic of advanced and emerging economies. In 2012 and 2013,
the dynamism of emerging economies largely sustained world trade growth as advanced economies
struggled to recover from the financial crisis. This situation was reversed in 2014 and 2015, with
declining commodity prices and macroeconomic rebalancing in China affecting emerging economies

future as new information arrives (see also footnote 2 for a list of reasons why estimates from various sources

more strongly (Constantinescu, Mattoo and Ruta 2016a). Different from the other post crisis years, in
2016, trade sluggishness is a characteristic of advanced and emerging economies (figure 3). Within
each group, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity, with some countries or regions doing better
than others, as illustrated by the breakdown of contributions to the growth in global merchandise trade
volumes by region provided in the Annex (figure A3).

                                Understanding Trade Developments
Trade developments in 2016 continued to reflect enduring structural determinants, such as the
maturing of global value chains (GVCs) and the slower pace of trade liberalization, as well as
cyclical factors, notably slow global growth, the trough in commodity prices, and macroeconomic
rebalancing in China. The increase in policy uncertainty may account for up to 75 percent of the
worsening of the trade slowdown in 2016.

Recent trade developments should be seen in the context of a deceleration in trade growth since
the early 2000s and particularly since the global financial crisis. In previous work (Constantinescu,
Mattoo, and Ruta 2015), we estimated the relationship between world trade and gross domestic product
(GDP) in the last four decades and found that the long-term trade elasticity rose significantly in the
1990s and then declined in the 2000s. Trade appears to have grown more slowly not only because
global growth is lower, but also because that growth has become less trade intensive.

Structural factors continue to contribute to the trade slowdown, including a slower pace of trade
liberalization and maturation of GVCs. First, the slower pace of trade liberalization may have
contributed to the decline in growth of world trade relative to world output in recent years. Box 1
shows the contribution of trade agreements to trade growth. Second, changes in international vertical
specialization underlie the slowdown in world trade. Trade growth raced ahead of output growth

as production fragmented internationally into GVCs, leading to a rapid surge in trade in parts and
components. As this process matured, trade growth decreased.5 Chapter 2 provides new evidence of
the evolution of GVCs and its effect on productivity growth.

The two mutually reinforcing factors driving weak trade growth in 2015, lower commodity prices and
China’s transition to a new growth path, although still at work, were attenuated in 2016.

•	 Prices of commodities, particularly fuels, which experienced large declines starting in mid-2014,
   bottomed out in early 2016, arresting the deterioration in the terms of trade of commodity exporting
   countries. However, prices remained low throughout the year, preventing a significant increase in
   the export and hence import values of these countries (figure 4).

•	 China’s transition to a new growth path that is less dependent on exports, investment, and industrial
   production continued. Export and import levels remained below the pre-2015 trend. Exports in
   2016 were also slightly below the level in 2015, a reflection of weak global demand (figure 5).

A surge in economic policy uncertainty in 2016 may have contributed to trade sluggishness. Economic
policy uncertainty may influence trade through two main channels. First, a rise in economic policy

uncertainty reduces trade by reducing GDP growth. In a less-certain environment, firms may choose
to postpone investment decisions, consumers may cut back spending, and banks may increase the cost
of finance.6 Second, to the extent that the surge in economic policy uncertainty is due to trade policy
uncertainty in particular, this may affect trade directly. Handley and Limao (2015) find that trade
policy uncertainty delays firms’ entry into foreign markets.

The pattern of world trade is closely associated with economic policy uncertainty.7 Figure 6 shows that trade
growth from 2012 to 2016 tracks economic policy uncertainty with a lag of a few months.8 The negative
association between economic policy uncertainty and trade growth is visible when examining a broader
sample spanning 18 countries and up to 30 years (figure 7). Regression analysis confirms a statistically
significant relationship between economic policy uncertainty and trade growth: a 1 percent increase

as the high-import intensity of the latter.

   The measure of economic policy uncertainty used is from Baker, Bloom and Davis (forthcoming), who
developed an index for the United States and other large economies using frequency counts of newspaper articles
that contain terms pertaining to the economy, policy, and uncertainty. The data and additional information can be
accessed at http://www.policyuncertainty.com.

    In Baker, Bloom and Davis (forthcoming), Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models fit to United States data as
well as to an international panel indicate that industrial production and unemployment rates deteriorate rapidly
during the first 6 months after policy uncertainty shocks.

in uncertainty is associated with a 0.02-percentage point reduction in goods and services trade volume
growth (see table A1 for estimation details).

A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on our regression analysis indicates that policy uncertainty
may explain 75 percent of 2016’s decline in trade growth relative to 2015. Knowing that the global
economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index increased by approximately 30 percent during November
2015–October 2016 relative to the same period in the previous year, we obtain that increased policy
uncertainty may have reduced growth in goods and services import volumes by 0.6 percentage points
(i.e., 30*0.02). The most recent revisions and estimates by the IMF World Economic Outlook suggest
a difference of –0.8 percentage points between the growth rates of global goods and services import
volumes in 2015 and 2016, which implies that the policy uncertainty may explain 75 percent of the
last year’s decline in trade growth.

Protectionism cannot explain the trade pattern in 2016, but it is likely that trade policy uncertainty
contributed to the surge in overall policy uncertainty. According to the WTO, the flow of new trade-
restrictive measures for the first 10 months of 2016 was in line with that of previous years (figure 8).
This evidence suggests that it is not a surge in protection that accounts for the exceedingly weak
performance of world trade in 2016 although trade policy may have been a contributing factor in two
ways. First, the stockpile of trade-restrictive measures is undergoing a steady increase that may be
clogging world trade. Second, although there is no direct evidence on trade policy uncertainty in 2016,
it is likely that the spike in economic policy uncertainty in part reflected uncertainty in international
trade relations.

       Box 1: How much have trade agreements contributed to the growth
       of world trade?9
       This box investigates the extent to which trade agreements have contributed to the growth
       of world trade since 1995. The key finding is that if no trade agreements had been signed in
       the last two decades, the annual average growth rate of world trade would have been close to
       2 percentage points lower.

       Drawing on Mattoo, Mulabdic, and Ruta (2017), we use trade data from the World Input-
       Output Database (WIOD) and World Bank data on the content of preferential agreements10
       to estimate a gravity equation augmented with a measure of depth for the period from 1995
       to 2014. By including dummies identifying the year of entry of a country into the WTO, we
       can also quantify the effect of trade agreements separately from that of WTO membership.
       We find that the deepest preferential trade agreements have more than doubled trade between
       members over the period. WTO membership increased trade by 65 percent.

       We then used these estimates to build counterfactual scenarios. Specifically, we assumed that,
       no trade agreement was signed and no new member joined the WTO from 1995 to 2014 and
       analyzed what the effect on world trade would have been. We found that trade agreements
       (preferential and multilateral) accounted for approximately 40 percent of world trade growth
       for the period (table 1). We can break this number down to account separately for the effect of
       WTO membership and preferential trade agreements. The annual growth rate of world trade
       for this period was 6.5 percent. If no new member had joined to the WTO during this period
       (e.g., if China had not entered the WTO in 2001), world trade would have grown 1 percentage
       point less between 1995 and 2014. If no new preferential trade agreements had been signed
       (e.g., if no Eastern or Central European countries had joined the European Union in 2004),
       world trade growth would have been 0.8 percentage points less. The combined effect of no
       preferential trade agreements and no new WTO members would have been to reduce the
       annual growth rate of world trade from the actual 6.5 percent to 4.7 percent.

Chapter 2: Trade and Productivity Slowdowns: The Role of Global Value Chains
We are witnessing a decline in the growth of trade and productivity. World trade grew at approximately
3 percent per year from 2012 to 2016, which is much lower than the pre-crisis average of 7 percent
for 1994 to 2008. Productivity growth also has declined, to 1 percent per year after the crisis from an
average of 2 percent from 1994 to 2008 (figure 9).

Consider now the development of global value chains (GVCs) over broadly the same period.11 One
measure of the importance of GVCs is the share of foreign value added embodied in gross exports.
Data on this measure from the recent update of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD 2016)
point to stalled or even negative growth in vertical specialization since 2011 (figure 10). World GVC
participation had been increasing throughout the 2000s but at a slower rate than in the 1990s. The
share of import content in manufacturing exports, an alternative measure of vertical specialization
computed using a simplified methodology applied to trade data from UN Comtrade (via WITS) and
sectoral output data from WIOD, suggests a similar dynamic.

Previous research has demonstrated that the slowing expansion in GVCs can partially explain
the current trade slowdown (World Bank Group 2015; Constantinescu, Mattoo and Ruta 2015).
Specifically, research has shown, first, that world trade is growing slowly not only because GDP

growth is sluggish, but also because the long-run relationship between trade and GDP is changing.
The elasticity of world trade to GDP was greater than 2 in the 1990s but closer to 1 and declining
throughout the 2000s. Second, the varying pace of the expansion of GVCs is a key contributing factor
of the changing long-run relationship between world trade and GDP. Changes in GVC participation
from 1990 to 2014 at the world level account for approximately half of the decline in trade elasticity
to income.12

This chapter investigates whether changes in vertical specialization, as manifested in GVCs, can help
explain the current productivity slowdown. Trade in general can lead to productivity gains through
multiple channels that are the object of a large body of research.13 As far as participation in GVCs is
concerned, recent theoretical models have shown that productivity gains associated with offshoring
and GVCs may accrue from the finer international division of labor, which is isomorphic to factor-
augmenting technical change (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008), as well as from increased

(Li and Liu 2014; Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud 2014). Despite this wealth of arguments, empirical
research in support of the theoretical predictions linking GVCs to productivity is limited.14

We begin by inspecting whether manufacturing data by country and year reveal a link between
labor productivity and GVCs. Labor productivity is computed as real value added divided by
number of persons employed. Vertical specialization in manufacturing industries is defined as
the sum of the foreign value added embodied in exports (backward linkages) and the domestic
value added in exports that the direct importer exports further or that returns home as imports
(forward linkages). The data (figure 11) indicate a positive association between growth in real
labor productivity per employee in manufacturing according to country and year and growth in
vertical specialization.

    Contributions include older strands of work focusing on benefits to countries that initiate offshoring (Feenstra
and Hanson 1996; Egger and Egger 2006; Amit and Wei 2009; Winkler 2010) but also recent efforts that analyze
the effect of vertical specialization on all countries participating in the GVC (Formai and Vergara Caffarelli
2016; Kummritz 2016; Taglioni and Winkler 2016).




                                                                                   15
Although suggestive, the correlation in figure 11 does not demonstrate a causal relationship.
Therefore, drawing on Constantinescu, Mattoo and Ruta (2016b, 2017), we report the findings of a
more formal econometric analysis of this relationship. Results based on a panel estimation covering
13 sectors in 40 countries over 15 years suggest that participation in GVCs is a significant driver of
labor productivity. An increase of 10 percent in the level of GVC participation increased average
productivity by 1.7 percent.

To obtain these results, we empirically investigate the link between GVC participation and productivity,
by regressing labor productivity on variables capturing the intensity of GVC integration while
controlling for a number of other determinants of productivity.15 Two conventionally used indicators are
considered as measures of vertical specialization (Hummels, Ishii and Yi 2001; Koopman, Wang and
Wei 2014). The first captures the extent of backward participation in GVCs and consists of the foreign
value added embodied in gross exports. The second indicator captures the forward participation in
GVCs and includes the domestic value added embodied in gross exports that direct importers export
further or that returns home as imports.

The first step of the analysis determines that labor productivity is significantly associated with overall
imports and overall exports of goods and services. This result is consistent with the literature, which
identifies multiple routes through which trade affects productivity: enhanced competition through
imports at the same stage of production, greater access to better-quality or more-diverse imported
inputs (e.g., Amiti and Konings 2007; Goldberg et al. 2010), and learning by exporting (De Loecker
2013). Next, we split imports and exports according to types of goods and services. The results reported
in figure 12 highlight the relative importance of the imported input channel. A 10 percent increase in
the level of imports of intermediates increases labor productivity by 2 percent.16 Coefficients of other
types of trade are not significant or weakly significant.17




15
    The two main sources of the data are the 2013 Release of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD 2013)
and WIOD Socioeconomic accounts (Timmer et al. 2015). WIOD 2013 covers 40 countries, 35 sectors (ISIC
rev. 3), and 17 years (1995–2011). Estimations are based on a subsample of 13 manufacturing industries, and
span 1995 to 2009 because missing real capital stock caused 2010 and 2011 to be dropped from the sample.
All trade-related measures were deflated to eliminate price effects. The analysis focuses on the productivity
of manufacturing industries because these are more GVC intensive. The fact that the participation of services
industries in GVCs is more difficult to quantify fully further motivated their exclusion.
16
    The magnitude of the effect is the result of averaging across countries and sectors that vary widely in their
propensity to import intermediates. These compositional aspects may explain why country-specific and firm-
level studies typically find larger effects (Amiti and Konings 2007; Blaum, Lelarge and Peters 2014).
17
    The lack of significance of final goods imports and exports of intermediates may result from multicollinearity
because imports of intermediates embodied in exports are included in the import and export covariates.

foreign value added embodied in exports is an instrumental variable (IV) estimate.


Finally, we dig deeper into the relationship between intermediate imports and labor productivity
by separating GVC-related imported inputs from non-GVC-related imported inputs. As discussed,
the proxy for GVC-related imports of inputs is the foreign value added embodied in exports, the
conventional measure of backward vertical specialization. For imports that are not related to GVCs,
we use the foreign value added absorbed domestically. Results suggest that imported inputs that are
GVC-related matter for productivity. Specifically, a 10 percent increase in the level of GVC-related
imports of intermediates increases labor productivity by 1.7 percent.

This chapter provides evidence that GVCs increases productivity. Although many factors determine
the rate of productivity growth, this evidence suggests that the slower pace of GVC expansion is
contributing to slower world productivity growth. In turn, the slowing down of GVC expansion may
in part be the result of policy choices, as the benefits of past trade reforms have matured and new
reforms have languished. Indeed, recent research shows that the deepening of trade agreements has
underpinned the rise of GVCs in the last quarter century by reducing trade costs and providing the
institutional infrastructure for the smooth functioning of cross-border value chains (Osnago et al.
2016). Preserving and expanding the reach of trade agreements, rather than backtracking on existing
commitments, would help to sustain the growth of productivity.
