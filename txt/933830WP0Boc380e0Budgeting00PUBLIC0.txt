  Central finance and planning agencies initiate the budget process six to nine months before the start of the fiscal year by preparing a pre-budget
  policy document that lays out the macroeconomic framework and proposes the broad allocation of resources in line with government plans and
  policies (1). This policy statement is generally approved by the government (2). A budget circular is issued with instructions and policy guidance
  and lays out the resource allocations that spending agencies should use for budget formulation (3). Spending agencies prepare budget propos-
  als that allocate resources among departments, programs, and projects in line with sector policy and submit them to the central agencies (4).
  Central agencies assess whether each spending agency proposal is within expenditure limits and aligned with overall policy objectives. Usually,
  negotiations follow (5). Central agencies consolidate agency budgets into a state budget (6) that is approved by the government (7) and then
  submitted for legislative appropriation (8). In most parliamentary systems, the legislature has limited authority to alter the budget proposal. Once
  approved, funds are released to spending agencies according to the availability of funds in the central treasury account and rationed as neces-
  sary (9). Spending agencies execute the budget and implement plans, providing periodic reports on progress (10). Allocations are adjusted
  through a mid-year budget review or on an ad hoc basis as needs arise. Financial statements are usually prepared within three to six months
  following the end of the fiscal year (11) and are subject to independent audit within six to 12 months of year-end (12).

             OECD Recommendations on Good Practices on Public Environmental
      Box 3: 
             Expenditure Management
      The OECD Council adopted the Good Practices for Public Environmental Expenditure Management in 2006. These recommendations were
      derived from the reviews of many years of diverse practical experiences with different public environmental expenditure programs both in OECD
      member and non-member countries.
           The objective of the OECD recommendations is to encourage member countries to ensure that public environmental expenditure
      programs are environmentally effective, economically efficient, and managed in accordance with sound principles of public expenditure
      management. The recommendations define specific steps that public authorities need to take when establishing and managing public
      environmental expenditure programs. They further stipulate that countries should make use of the checklists of specific recommendations
      organized under the three main headings of (1) environmental effectiveness, (2) budgetary good practice; and (3) management efficiency.
           The document was adopted by the OECD Council, which is the highest OECD governing body, after a careful review by all OECD com-
      mittees, including Committees for Fiscal Affairs and Environmental Policy.

       National climate funds allow governments to enter long-term commitments by ring-fencing resources so that they remain outside the govern-
       ment’s budget process. They can be financed by specific revenues earmarked to the fund, one-time government transfers, or deposits from
       external donor sources. In climate actions that rely on private co-financing, income generating funds, especially funds structured to maintain
       assets, provide more certainty that governments intend to meet its financial obligations. Climate funds designed to mobilize and blend financ-
       ing, especially from external sources, can form a critical part of the government’s response to climate resilience and adaptation needs. Being
       outside the budget process implies less control in the overall efficiency of public resource allocation, as there will be limits in the government’s
       ability to re-channel resources in extra-budgetary mechanisms. To maintain good governance, national climate funds should be established
       with clear provisions on performance expectations, and for a review or expiration of mandate.
