                                           Building for “Acceptable Risk” in Post-earthquake Haiti
A “transitional-shelter” solution was heavily promoted early on in the wake of the Haiti earthquake. The “T-shelter”
approach was framed as a disaster risk management initiative, securing the population against the impending hurricane
season. This also set the standard for T-shelter design, a structure able to withstand three Category 3 hurricanes, and
costing as much as US$10,000 including design, materials, labor, shipping (plywood was imported), warehousing, etc. (Haiti
Shelter Cluster, April 20, 2010, Transitional Shelter Parameters).

From a risk management perspective the T-shelter standards should have arisen from a proper discussion of “acceptable
risk,” and properly weighing other potential “transitional solutions”. An engineer who participated in the T-shelter
working-group meetings explained that the working group went straight to “design”, without explaining clearly the
“design assumptions” or “acceptable risk”. In fact the high-level standards proposed led to very expensive shelters, while
other options for shelters meeting “acceptable risk” criteria were not discussed.
