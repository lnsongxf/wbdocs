 This brief is a result of a one year collaboration between CAS and the World Bank team. The authors of the report are Najwa Yaacoub
and Mayssaa Daher from CAS, and Dean Jolliffe and Aziz Atamanov from the World Bank.
This brief is based on analysis of the 2011-12 household budget survey (HBS) implemented by Central Administration for
Statistics (CAS) with technical assistance from the World Bank. The survey was conducted during the period of September
2011 to November 2012, and was stratified across nine regions. The sample was designed to cover 4,805 households, but
due to high non-response, it only includes 2,476 participating households. Poverty numbers presented in this note are not
comparable with poverty estimates for other years due to differences in the instruments, fieldwork implementation and to
some extent sample design; and also due to differences in the methodology for constructing welfare aggregate and the
poverty line.2 All regional estimates in this report should be viewed with caution given concerns about significant levels of
nonresponse and relatively small sample sizes within regions. CAS and the World Bank are working together to improve the
quality of future surveys.



According to the most recent estimates obtained by the Central Administration for Statistics and the World Bank, the average
level of consumption per person in 2011-12 was about 7,788 thousand LBP per year in Lebanon. The data indicate that in
2011-12, 27 percent of the population were poor. This implies about one million people had levels of consumption that were
below the annual poverty line, which was set at the level of 4,729 thousand LBP per capita per year. The Gini coefficient of
per capita consumption, which measures level of inequality, was estimated to be 0.32. The poorest 20 percent of the
population were found to consume about 8 percent of total consumption, while the top 20 percent of the population consumed
about 40 percent.
Confidence intervals for the regional poverty estimates are wide and overlap with each other, indicating that many of the
observed regional differences in poverty are not statistically significant, but some comparisons are. In particular, poverty in
Beirut is significantly lower than the average in the country, and poverty rates in the poorest North Lebanon and Bekaa
regions are higher than in Beirut and Mount Lebanon (Figure 1). Geographically, the highest poverty count is observed in
Mount Lebanon, North Lebanon and Bekaa which account for about 77 percent of all poor people in the country (Figure 2).
The regions with the lowest counts of poor people are Beirut and Nabatieh: about 58-59 thousand people in each.

Notes: Population weights were adjusted for non-response.

Around seven percent of households in the HBS have non-Lebanese heads, but are Lebanese residents. The poverty rate for
this group of the population is very high: 55 percent compared to 26 percent for the population from households headed by
Lebanese citizens. Households with a non-Lebanese head are more likely to be found at the bottom of the distribution.
Fourteen percent of households in the bottom quintile (i.e. poorest one-fifth of the population) are headed by non-Lebanese
resident, while among the richest quintile this share is only about 3 percent.

The data indicate that in 2011/12, 45 percent of individuals 15 years of age and above were in the labor market and
employed. Fifty-one percent of the population in this age range were inactive (i.e. not in the labor force). The unemployment
rate, defined as the ratio of unemployed to total active population in the labor force, was about 9 percent. 3 Largest sectors of
employment are in education, health and public administration, trade and services (Figure 3). There are substantial
differences between employment rates among men and women which widens after age 34 (Figure 4). Participation in the
labor market is closely correlated with education level. Thus, among those with some tertiary education, the share of
employed is 61 percent. Among the population with less than primary education, the employment rate is about half the rate at
31 percent.

There is no clear pattern in the relationship between employment and poverty at the individual level. Employment increases
somewhat across quintiles, but drops for the richest quintile. If only heads of household are analyzed, employment is much
higher for the poor heads than the rich. For example, share of households with employed heads is 72 percent in the bottom
quintile versus 51 percent among the richest households from the top quintile. There can be several reasons for this, including
the possibility that the poor simply cannot afford to be without any sort of work.

In contrast to the rate of employment, the sector in which one works is closely associated with economic wellbeing (Figure
5). For example, poverty rates in agriculture and construction are particularly high, while poverty rates for those working in
the public sector or in services are much lower. In addition to sector of employment, the contractual type of employment is
also associated with higher poverty (Figure 6). Poverty rates among weekly or daily employees are much higher than the
rates for those who are monthly paid employees.

 A person is considered unemployed if he or she did not work during the past 7 days and was not temporarily absent. In addition, he or she
should be available and actively search for work.

Education is also a strong predictor of poverty. People with some university education have significantly lower poverty rates
that average. Nine percent of people with some university education are poor, while about one third of the people with
primary schooling or less are poor (Figure 7). Enrollment rates drops dramatically for children aged 7-21 from the poorest
quintile of the population after reaching age of 13. For example, enrollment for the poorest quintile drops from 92 percent to
72 percent between age 13 and 15 (Figure 8). The drop in enrollment is more pronounced for men and non-Lebanese
population. For example, overall enrollment rate among Lebanese children ages 7-21 is about 83 percent compared to 43
percent among the non-Lebanese reference group.

Access to health services depends on availability of health insurance. The proportion of the population covered by health
insurance is far from universal in Lebanon with the poor being particularly less protected. For instance, only 28 percent of
household members are insured in the bottom quintile of the distribution compared to 67 percent among the wealthiest
quintile. Similarly, only 19 percent of households in the bottom quintile have all members insured compared to 52 percent of
households in the top quintile.

There is a substantial gap between poor and non-poor households in Lebanon in terms of access to such assets as flat TVs, air
conditioners, microwaves, computers, washing machines and cars (Figure 9). The poorest households have lower access to
basic infrastructure as well. For example, households from the bottom quintile are more likely to have unprotected sources of
drinking water, and to use open sewage sources for drainage, both of which can cause health problems (Figure 10).

Access to mobile lines is relatively high in Lebanon. Around 85 percent of households had at least one family member with
access to mobile line (Figure 11). This share does not change much across the distribution. However, when examining the
total number of adults with mobile lines, the picture changes (Figure 12). On average, one adult from two in the poorest
quintile has access to a mobile phone, while among the richest quintile two of every three adults have access to a mobile line.
In contrast to cell phones, household-level access to the internet is quite low. Only 28 percent of households report having at
least one member with access to internet. This ratio is much smaller for the poorest households. In particular, 11 percent of
households report access to internet versus 41 percent among the richest quintile (Figure 11).
