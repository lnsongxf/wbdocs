THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulatio n exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

Portugal is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Sociedade por Quotas

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,            Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Register at the one-stop shop

       There are two ways of starting a business in Portugal:

       1) ""On the Spot Firm"" (Empresa na Hora). This service enables to set
       up a company in less than an hour at a single contact point:
       The Decree-Law nº111/2005 of July 8th approves the On the Spot Firm
       service which allows to set up a business in less than an hour, all the
       procedures are carried out in one place and as long as the partners
       have all of necessary documents, the company is set up immediately at
       one of the desks of the On the Spot Firm, available throughout the
       country, regardless of the location of the company’s headquarters.
       The first step is to choose a name from the list of pre-approved names
       available at the website On the Spot Firm or 2 to submit a name of its
   1   choice to the RNPC, which will issue a company's name certificate. This       1 day       EUR 360 or EUR 300
       certificate of approval may be requested online, is valid for 90 days and
       may be renewed only once. If the name of the company is composed
       by the name of its shareholders, it may now be approved at the
       moment of incorporation of the company at the one-stop shop (ex.
       James & Smith).

       Then entrepreneurs need to choose one of the pre-approved standard
       memorandum and articles of association packs, available at On the Spot
       Firm and in the portfolio of packs available at the desks.

       The following documentation needs to be submitted at the On the Spot
       Firm’s desk:
       In case partners are legal enterprises/corporations:
       - Corporate tax identification or identity card;

                                                                                     Time to
No.   Procedure                                                                                     Cost to complete
                                                                                    complete
      - Current extract of the entry in the Commercial Registry; and,
      - Minutes of the Inaugural Meeting of incorporation.

      At the service desk, it is possible to get both the articles of association
      and commercial registration. Partners will receive a certificate of
      incorporation, the corporate identification card, the Social Security
      number, the deed, and a business registration certificate.
      For tax purposes, the declaration of commencement of activity can be
      submitted at the help desk, duly signed by the accountant. If this is not
      submitted right away, it must be done within 15 days of the
      incorporation.

      2) ""Online company setting up” (Empresa Online):
      This service enables to set up a company through the Internet in 1 to 2
      days. The Decree-Law nº 125/2006 June 29th, has defined the
      procedures to set up a business through the internet. The access to the
      service On-Line Company (‘Empresa Online’) can be made through the
      Business Portal (www.portaldaempresa.pt).

      The costs are the following:
      Incorporation under ""Empresa na Hora"": EUR 360; Incorporation
      under ""Empresa on-line"": (i) EUR 360 if not incorporated with pre-
      approved by-laws, or (ii) EUR 220 if incorporated with pre-approved by-
      laws.

      The employers shall communicate the admission of employees to the
      Portuguese Social Security services of the area of the employee's
      workplace, by any written means, or online at www.seg-social.pt, within
      (i) 24 hours preceding the employment agreement’s entry into force; or
      (ii) 24 hours following the beginning of the activity, whenever – due to
      exceptional and duly justified reasons in connection with the conclusion
      of very short term employment agreements or due to shift work – such
      notice cannot be served within the set out deadline. The non-
      compliance with this obligation implies the assumption that the
      relevant employee started to work for the company on the 1st working Less than one day
2     day of the sixth month prior to the occurrence of the infringement. In                           no charge

      case the relevant employee is receiving sickness or unemployment
      benefits there is also an assumption that the employ started to work for
      the company on the date in which those benefits were granted,
      whereby the company will be severally liable for returning the whole
      amounts unduly received by the employee by the Portuguese Social
      Security. Moreover, the non-compliance with the above mentioned
      obligation may result in a minor or a serious misdemeanor, depending
      on its compliance within 24 hours after the deadline or after that,
      corresponding to a fine from € 75 up to € 4,800. Pursuant to the
      enacted Law No. 83-C/2013, of 31 December 2013, the
      abovementioned communication will now have to be mandatorily made
      online.

      Apply for occupancy permit and pay fees

      Once the building has been completed, BuildCo requests the
      municipality to issue an occupancy permit for the building. There is a
      statutory list of submission requirements to request an occupancy
      permit. If the actual construction works executed on the site differ from
      the approved designs, an updated set of design documents must be
      presented to the municipality with the request for the occupancy
      permit. The construction log book, and a liability declaration by the
      construction director must be presented as well. In this declaration, the
      construction director states that the construction works were carried
      out according to the approved design, and, where applicable, changes
      comply with the relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
      Within 10 days of the submission of the request the municipality
      informs BuildCo if the occupancy permit will be granted on the basis of
      the liability declaration mentioned above. No site inspection is
      required, unless the municipality has doubts about whether the
8     construction works comply with the approved design. If a site                 1 day        EUR 356
      inspection is determined, it takes place within 15 days.

      Obtain water and sewerage connection

      The steps for obtaining a water and sewerage connection are as
      follows:
      – BuildCo informs the utility until 5 days 48 before the beginning of the
      construction works on the water and sewerage networks.
      –During construction, the utility, directly or through a certified entity,
      can carry out site inspections whenever deemed appropriate and
      without notifying the developer beforehand.
      –BuildCo informs the utility when the construction works on the water
      and sewerage networks are complete and asks for a final site
      inspection. Liability declarations of the technicians responsible for
      construction of the water and sewage networks must then be
      submitted.
      – Within 7 days 49 the utility, or a certified entity on its behalf, carries
      out a final inspection of the water and sewerage networks. Pipes must
      not be covered before being inspected.
      –If construction was done according to the approved design and the             31 days       EUR 7,571

      network met the test conditions, the utility considers the construction
      works on the water and sewerage networks complete.
      –BuildCo demands the permanent connection to the public water and
      sewerage networks. The water connection is carried out by the water
      utility within 15 days. The sewerage connection is carried out by
      BuildCo.
      –BuildCo and the water utility celebrate a water supply contract and the
      water meters are installed within 3 days.
      Usually these tasks are carried out before the construction of the
      building is complete. A water and sewerage connection is required to
      get an occupancy permit.

      BuildCo must pay a total of EUR 7,570.50 to obtain water and sewerage
      connection. The cost breakdown is the following:

      1. Connection to the water network:

        architectural design, updated with any modification carried out during
        construction, is attached to the official form. The tax authority updates
        the description of the property in the tax authority registry. A site

       It is possible to register a property transfer in Portugal at any of the
       locations of the one-stop shop “On the spot house” (Casa pronta,
       www.casapronta.pt) in person. In April 2010, there were 33 locations in
       Lisboa, and 346 locations in all of Portugal. Banks can request that a
       public employee comes with a laptop with secured access to the
       database to complete the property transfer in the bank (for free) without
       going to a Casa pronta location. Also real estate agents can request that
       a public employee comes with a laptop with secured access to the
       database to complete the property transfer in their office. At the one-                       6.5% of the of the

       Identity of parties • Powers of attorney (stating that the individuals are                    value or sale price,

       submitted to the Predial. Predial has 307 property registries (in each

        In addition to «On the spot house» (that works as describe above), land
        registry requests can be performed online. Whenpeople prefer to

        aply for the registry seending the deed through a web site (
        http://www.predialonline.pt/PredialOnline/). In this case the applicant
        needs to be authenticated with a qualifyed digital certificate, as the one

        however may take up to a week to be processed.

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
