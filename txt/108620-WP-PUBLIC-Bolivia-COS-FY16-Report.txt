I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Bolivia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Bolivia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Bolivia
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
In April-May 2016, 600 stakeholders of the WBG in Bolivia were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management Units
(PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-
supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs/community based
organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups;
youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other
organizations. A total of 230 stakeholders participated in the survey (38% response rate).

Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier; other respondents
completed the questionnaires online. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing
Bolivia; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the
WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in
Bolivia; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’14 (response rate is 48%, N=210). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’14 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 89).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations; and
       respondents from NGOs/community based organizations, private foundations, and faith-
       based groups were combined in the “CSO” category. Few respondents from the office of
       a parliamentarian, local governments, independent government institutions, and the
       judiciary branch were included in the “Other” category. Note that there were no
       respondents from trade unions and youth groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’14 Country
        Survey indicated statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean
        in FY’16 = 6.4; weighted mean in FY’14 = 6.8)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Bolivia, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Bolivia, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from the media were significantly more likely to
       attribute failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to “the WBG being not sensitive
       enough to political/social realities on the ground”, and respondents from the private
       sector were significantly more likely to indicate that “the Government works
       inefficiently” compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors on WBG-
       supported projects had the highest mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the
       twenty six COS indicator questions, whereas respondents from the media had
       significantly lower mean ratings. Responses for individual indicator questions by
       stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (page 61).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 7.0) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 5.8). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix F (page 94).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Bolivia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty two specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Bolivia. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Bolivia, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability and resilience to climate
               change; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year21
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2014
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2014 COS report.

FY 2014 Number of comparable respondents = 149  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 221

By weighting, the FY 2014 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
