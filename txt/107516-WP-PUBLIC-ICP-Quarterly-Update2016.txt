  The Future of Price Statistics
On March 30, 2016, the World Bank hosted
“The Future of Price Statistics: Innovations
in Data, Technology, and Methods” seminar
at its headquarters in Washington, DC.
The seminar was organized in the wake of
the September 2015 United Nations
General Assembly that saw the historic
ratification of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), and the World Bank
commitment to improve data for the post-
2015 development agenda. It brought
together key actors from national statistical
offices, private sector, international
agencies, and academia to discuss how
technological advancements and new data
sources can be used to generate a fuller
range of price statistics to better measure
economic activity.                                   Lawrence H. Summers delivered the keynote speech at the Future of Price Statistics
