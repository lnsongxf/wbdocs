The Toolkit is a diagnostic and planning tool intended to provide recommendations for action
based on existing good practice. It does not constitute technical or legal advice and no

Introduction
Many countries that are interested in implementing a cloud platform are either uncertain
where to start or are focused on building a national data center, or equivalent; however, a
government may not be ready to leverage the cloud, even if they have one available. In order
to assist governments with this gap, the World Bank Cloud Readiness Assessment Toolkit
provides a series of questions that determines where a country is in terms of overall readiness,
what deployment model they may wish to pursue based on their current regulatory
environment, and recommendations on how they can better position their government to take
advantage of cloud computing. Once a government is ready to implement a cloud platform, the
application and infrastructure assessment can be used to build out a roadmap both at the
department/ministry level and the application level.


Cloud Computing
According to the National Institution of Standards and Technology, cloud computing is a model
for enabling ever present, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources (i.e., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service
provider interaction (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). In other words, cloud computing
can also be referred to as on-demand computing. It is a way for users to get continual access to
shared computing resources, such as servers, storage, and sometimes services, as needed.

environment, and recommendations on how they can better position their government to take
advantage of cloud computing.

The toolkit is comprised of five documents, two of which are the assessments that are the
foundation of the recommendations. Each assessment should be answered accurately to the
best of the individual’s knowledge. It is important to have someone who can understand and
fully answer the questions complete the assessments. Incomplete or inaccurate responses will
skew the results. As a result, the roadmap and recommendations provided by the toolkit may
not be applicable.

The aim of this Government Cloud Readiness Toolkit is to assist countries by:
   - Identifying policy and regulatory gaps
   -     Providing recommendations around next steps to take towards implementation of a
         cloud computing system that meets a country’s specific needs
   -     Recommending a deployment model (private, hybrid, public, or local public)
   -     Providing recommendations around applications that might be good candidates for
         migrating to the cloud
   -     Providing some guidance on how to ensure transactions using the cloud would be
         enforceable and that an individual’s data will be protected

This toolkit will not:
    - Provide an in depth assessment of country’s legal and enabling environment for cloud
        computing
   -     Replace an in depth assessment or business case
   -     Provide steps for building a private data center or selecting a public cloud provider
   -     Provide estimates for migrating to the cloud
   -     Provide guidance on budgeting for migrating to the cloud
   -     Recommend a specific cloud provider
   -     Recommend a service model

Cloud Overview
This Word document provides a high level overview of the basics of cloud computing and key
considerations for a government when considering migrating to the cloud.

This Word document provides a high level overview of the various toolkit components along
with guidelines on who might be the best choice to complete the various sections.

Cloud Readiness Assessment Instruction Guide
This Word document provides detailed instructions on completing the Country Assessment and
the Application and Infrastructure Assessment.

Country Assessment
The country assessment is a questionnaire used to assess the government’s overall cloud
readiness. By answering the questions around regulation, security, infrastructure, etc. the
assessment identifies gaps in a country’s policies, regulations, or current IT infrastructure that
would impact a migration to the cloud or prevent a country from fully realizing the potential of
such a migration. Research on government cloud migrations show that countries frequently do
not see the full expected savings or benefits when migrating to the cloud due to gaps in
readiness.

The country assessment is broken down into seven key categories. Different sections can be
filled out by different individuals based on their area of knowledge. Recommendations are
provided in the table below.

                    Section                Best Person to Complete         Estimated Time to Complete
     General                             IT Director or Equivalent         20 minutes
     Resources                           IT Director or Equivalent         15 minutes

                                                                                                         Page 5 of 6

     Security                          IT Director or Equivalent          30 minutes
     Regulations                       Legal                              45 minutes
     Governance of ICT Systems         IT Director or Equivalent          30 minutes
     Data                              IT Director or Equivalent          30 minutes
                                       Ministry or Department of
     Infrastructure                                                       45 minutes
                                       Telecommunications

The assessment also contains a recommendation section that highlights where a country falls
along the road to cloud readiness as well as recommendations for three key phases along that
road – walk, run, fly.

Application and Infrastructure Assessment
The application and infrastructure assessment is a questionnaire used to assess the
government’s overall application landscape. By answering the questions for each application
being considered for a migration to the cloud, and any servers associated with those
applications, the assessment helps determine the fitness, effort and recommended deployment
type.

This assessment is broken up into two sections – application and infrastructure. The questions
in the assessment cover both functional, application level questions, as well as in depth
infrastructure, server level questions.

The application section is geared towards application owners, whereas the infrastructure
section is geared towards the infrastructure team.

How long it will take to complete the assessment for each application owner or infrastructure
lead will depend upon the number of the applications and servers for which they are
responsible.

      Section                 Best Person to Complete                         Estimated Time to Complete
  Application    Application Owner(s) (May be multiple individuals)           20 minutes per application
  Infrastructure Infrastructure Lead(s) (May be multiple individuals)         10 minutes per server
