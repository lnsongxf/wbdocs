        Foreword




        The Metro Manila Greenprint 2030 is a timely initiative. The country's economy
        continues to trend upwards and our cities continue to receive new investments in major
        infrastructure and industries. Now is the time to plan how we will move forward, and to
        leverage these investments for positive gains. As we live through the daily challenges,
        and strive to create a different story for ourselves and our cities, it is also the time to
        envision the Metro Manila that we want, and set a roadmap on how to achieve that
        vision.


        In 2011, President Benigno Aquino instructed the Regional Development Council in
        the National Capital Region (RDC-NCR) to craft a long term plan for Metro and Mega
        Manila. In response, under the leadership of the Metropolitan Manila Development
        Authority (MMDA), the RDC-NCR has spearheaded a strategic planning process
        called the Metro Manila Greenprint 2030, which seeks to address the challenges that
        impede development of the metropolis and make our cities more competitive, resilient,
        and inclusive in the coming decades.

What is the Metro Manila of 2030?

•	 The Metro Manila of 2030 is an economic powerhouse in East Asia: where good policies and
    investments help us stay economically competitive; where we continue to develop livelihood
    opportunities for a growing population; and where we can find decent work at home that
    allows us to utilize our talents and skills to the best of our abilities.

•	 In the Metro Manila of 2030, we can move safely, affordably, and comfortably between our
    homes and places of work, education and play, allowing us more time to spend with the
    ones we love, avoid delays in our day-to-day lives, increase economic productivity, and even
    explore new places within our cities.

•	 The Metro Manila of 2030 is a green metropolis; it uses resources more efficiently and provides
    a livable urban environment for its citizens. Better connectivity and mobility help us use less
    energy and generate less pollution.

•	 In the Metro Manila of 2030, we can afford a decent home for our families and access basic
    services; there will be more public space where we can play, exercise, and relax; where areas of
    interest, and places of history, culture, and heritage are fostered.

•	 In the Metro Manila of 2030, our lives, properties, and livelihoods are protected from
    disasters; we are better prepared to meet the challenges related to climate change; and our
    infrastructure continues to serve the public, even in the face of adversity.

•	 Most importantly, Metro Manila of 2030 is a unified metropolis, without borders. Even
    though the region is made up of many localities, our lives are not limited to any one place; we
    live, work, study and play in numerous places which make up our metropolis.

We do not have to wait until 2030 to see the vision become a reality, the process has already begun.
I am pleased to present this first step towards the Metro Manila of the future, the home where we
all enjoy a better quality of life.

The Greenprint 2030 brings together stakeholders across all sectors to deliberate Metro Manila's many challenges and discuss
avenues for moving forward.

Achieving the Vision

The vision will be achieved through a two-pronged approach which divides goals into strategic areas. The first strategic area
identifies major economic opportunities that could improve livelihoods in Metro and Mega Manila. The second strategic area
focuses on physical interventions that will attract and sustain competitive industries and talent by making Metro Manila an
inclusive, connected, and resilient metropolis. These strategic areas complement and reinforce each other. Together, they are
the foundation for the spatial strategies that will be developed in Phase 2.

The goals in each area are supported by principles established through best global practices, as well as opportunities where the
principles can be applied in Metro and Mega Manila. The two strategic areas are discussed in Section Two.


Strategic Area One: Fostering a metropolis of opportunity           Strategic Area Two: Building a green, connected, and
                                                                    resilient metropolis for all
Metro Manila enjoys emerging global competitiveness in three
key areas: information technology and business processing           The second thematic area focuses on large-scale city-
outsourcing (IT-BPO), regional tourism, and high-value              building, particularly in creating a green, connected, and
service industries. These three areas performed exceptionally       resilient metropolis for all. Under-investment in Metro

1. 	 Leveraging Opportunities in Information Technology and
	 Business Processing Outsourcing


   Goal

   Be a global center for knowledge processing, through continuous wide scale upgrading of
   human resources and the provision of global leading urban environments and infrastructure for
   information technology and business processing outsourcing (IT-BPO) activities, the combination
   of which will position Metro Manila to provide world-class services at home and abroad.


   Background


   Metro Manila and parts of Mega Manila enjoy an                  This industry cluster has significant potential to continue
   undisputed global competitive advantage in terms of             to boost the economy and provide employment at scale
   the IT-BPO services cluster. Information technology             (Figure 2-3). With continued strong support from both
   (IT) enabled services and business processing                   the public and private sectors, the IT-BPO industry
   outsourcing (BPO) are broadly defined including voice           could generate USD25 billion in revenue and account
   and non-voice BPO, knowledge process outsourcing                for as much as 8.6 percent of the country's GDP by 2016.
   (KPO), legal process outsourcing (LPO), government
   process outsourcing (GPO), and other information and
   communications technology (ICT) related services.

   In 2013, Metro Manila had more people employed in
   the BPO industry than any other city in the world and
   accounted for 10% of its labor force. The Philippines
   overtook India in 2011 to become the number one
   provider of voice-based outsourcing services in the
   world (by value) and is ranked second globally in
   non-voiced based outsourcing activities in terms of
   employment and revenue earnings. The IT-BPO export
   industry has been a source of new wealth, income, and
   employment in the Philippines. The IT-BPO sector has
   a multiplier effect of about 2.5, meaning that for every
   direct job created in the industry, 2.5 more indirect
   jobs will be created in supporting service industries.
   A significant number of these jobs, about 0.8 million
   in 2012, are employing people in low income groups
   (Figure 2-1).

   The industry is primarily located in Metro Manila
   (Figure 2-2). The dominance of Metro Manila in IT-
   BPO industry can be attributed to the concentrated
   pool of human talent, local and international industry,
   government, and international communications in the
   country. As of 2012, this area accounted for 75 percent
   of all employment and more than 82 percent of total
   revenues of IT-BPO growth in the Philippines.

2. 	 Unleashing Metro Manila’s Tourism Potential and Attracting Newly Rich Neighbors



   Goal

   Make Metro Manila the first-choice destination for the newly emerging affluent citizens of
   East Asia for shopping, cultural tourism, visits to heritage sites, conventions, meetings, and
   entertainment.



   Background


   East Asia, home to the Philippines, is the world’s largest
   economy, containing the world’s second (China) and
   third (Japan) largest national economies. The over 600
   million people of the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations (ASEAN), of which the Philippines is a member,
   are enjoying an economic resurgence, facilitated by
   wide-scale implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade
   Agreement in 2015. Unlike in the West, money is in the
   hands of the middle-aged (with the exception of Japan)
   people, with a high propensity to travel, shop, sightsee,
   eat, gamble, participate in conventions, exhibitions and
   meetings, and to discover their Asian culture and roots.
   This mobile affluent East Asian population will total
   approximately 1 billion people by 2020 and 2 billion by
   2030; leading consumer analysts, such as McKinsey &
   Company, all agree that this traveling consumer class is
   growing substantially faster than previously forecasted.
   At present, more than 46 percent of international
   tourists (nearly two million people) to the Philippines
   come from the East Asian market, with the largest
   groups being Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese. For the
   first months of 2013, the East Asia market increased by
   almost 15 percent.

   Metro Manila in the 1950s to early 1980s was among
   the leading destinations for Asia’s elite, but has fallen
   abruptly in attractiveness over the last three decades.
   Nevertheless, Metro Manila has the potential to bounce
   back based on the widespread use of English, its unique
   (to Asia) Spanish-influenced culture, its geo-strategic
   position (the eastern gateway to East Asia), and the
   inherent hospitality and cheerfulness of its people.

  Identity Districts as an Integral Part of
  Singapore’s Urban Master Plan

  In 2000, Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority
  (URA) for the first time brought together a series of
  focus groups to gather input for its ‘Concept Plan
  2001’, a predecessor to the 2003 Master Plan. What
  came out of this participatory planning process was a
  focus on urban Singapore’s ‘identity’- whether at the
  neighborhood, district, or national level. The URA
  emphasized the elements of ‘place’ that would make
  a highly mobile Singaporean population feel at home.

  Singapore has recognized the value of heritage
  conservation in its urban development strategy since
  the mid-1980s, when the URA rolled out a conservation
  master plan and Chinatown became the first major
  focus area for conservation. (Since then, over 7,000
  buildings have been protected from demolition, which
  had been the status quo since independence in 1965.)
  But the new focus on ‘identity’ was designed to go
  further than conservation alone. Tan Yong Soon, CEO
  of the URA in 2001, said: “Beyond the hardware, we
  seek to identify the charm of various places, the things
  which make them appealing to ‘us’ and how planning
  can give a helping hand so that these ‘characteristics’
  remain and evolve to give us a sense of belonging,
  rootedness, and identity.”

  To do this, the URA developed ‘identity plans’ for 15
  areas in Singapore, sorted into four clusters (Old World
  Charm, Urban Villages, Southern Ridges & Hillside
  Villages, and Rustic Coast). The plans featured maps
  highlighting buildings, activity areas and gathering
  places, social landmarks, heritage roads, and urban
  vistas. Each plan also detailed the appropriate planning
  mechanisms to foster identity-driven development
  in the areas. The tools varied according to the areas,
  but generally featured protection for iconic buildings,
  variability in plot sizes, promoting pedestrianism,
  increasing outdoor retail space and greening efforts.

  If the measure of success of an urban planning
  initiative is repetitive usage, the focus on urban
  identity in Singapore has been a success: in 2010 the
  URA again convened focus groups on this topic the
  dual foci of ‘cherishing and keeping the places we love’
  and ‘enriching the experience of our built and natural
  heritage’ for its 2011 Concept Plan.

3.	 Reclaiming High-Value Services and Promoting High-Potential Economic Clusters



   Goal

   Reclaim Metro Manila’s past role as a leading high-value services center in Asia in areas such as
   higher education, medical services, tourism, and the cultural economy, and promote economic
   clusters having high potential to create jobs for lower-income populations.



   Background


   In the post-World War II period, Metro Manila was
   a leading higher-education center in the Asia Pacific
   Region, known for elite institutions such as the
   University of the Philippines, the Asian Institute of
   Management, and the International Rice Research
   Institute (IRRI). A generation of Asian leaders were
   educated in the Philippines. Similarly, Metro Manila
   was once a leading medical center in the Asia Pacific
   Region, based around a cluster of still functioning
   quality medical institutions in the area of Quezon
   Memorial Circle in Quezon City, such as the Philippine
   Heart Center and the National Kidney Transplant
   Institute.

   Considerable potential exists to revive this golden era
   of Metro Manila as a center for high-value services, and
   hopeful signs are already appearing. The advertising and
   animation industries have maintained their viability
   over the years, although with diminished Asian market
   share. There are prospects for development and growth
   of a serious digital media cluster. Specialized English
   language education is booming, especially in the case of
   the South Korean market. The new St. Luke’s hospital in
   Fort Bonifacio Global City is receiving excellent reviews
   worldwide (e.g., Business Traveler magazine) and is
   fully US-accredited.

In order to fully realize Greenprint objectives that include
poverty alleviation and improving livelihoods for the region’s
lower-income residents, it is necessary to breathe new life
into the manufacturing sector by focusing on key sub-sectors
with high job creation potential.

At present, the most obvious opportunities are to target
increasing the competitiveness of agri-business, small
electronics manufacturing and assembly, and segments of
the automotive industry. For example, food processing is
the third largest manufacturing subsector (by employment)
in the country. With strong public support, the Philippines
could rival Thailand as the “Kitchen of the World” by
focusing on unique, branded products for export markets.
Small electronics manufacturing and assembly is the largest
manufacturing subsector (by employment). With new
investment in logistics-related infrastructure, initiatives
that support skills-upgrading, and national government
(e.g., PEZA and BOI) support, the Philippines (largely
Mega Manila) could draw foreign investment away from
other ASEAN nations. Lastly, the Philippines is emerging
as a leader in electric vehicle parts production, which may
employ as many as 50,000 people within a few years (with
most of the investment planned to take place within Mega
Manila).

4.	 Connecting to Metro Manila



    Goal

    Build on the potential of Metro Manila’s multi-centered spatial structure to be green and time
    saving, by enhancing connectivity among and within urban centers, and by selectively designating
    new urban centers as Metro Manila integrates with its peri-urban hinterland.



    Background

     “Since World War II Metro Manila has seen enormous
    shifts in its spatial structure, with the pre-War,
    Manila-centered monocentric spatial structure being
    replaced by a poly-centric form with Makati as the
    CBD and EDSA (the former circumferential bypass
    road) as the main thoroughfare of the metropolis (see
    Map 3-1). Other centers include Pasig and Alabang,
    with Fort Bonifacio Global City, Makati, and the
    immediate Bayshore potentially coalescing into a new
    CBD. The growth of these centers is being driven by
    large-scale, private sector-led development, which is
    emerging as the leading force in shaping the spatial
    structure of Metro Manila. More recently, large new
    suburban developments have also sprouted outside of
    these central areas. Factors leading to the suburban
    development include cheaper land, proximity to labor
    pool, and higher levels of congestion in CBD areas.

     Traffic congestion is a challenge in most of the region,
    not only in the urban centers but also the emerging
    suburban centers (such as Las Piñas and Muntinlupa)
    and peri-urban areas (such as Cavite and Laguna).
    The region is in immediate need of a transportation
    system that provides reliable, efficient, and affordable
    connectivity among the various centers in Metro
    Manila, as well as between the core city and the peri-
    urban areas. Creating such a system, through a well-
    developed road network integrated with rapid transit,
    will make a significant contribution towards reducing
    inefficiencies related to congestion and enhanced
    livability in the region.

 Metro Manila possesses a large number of existing urban
 and peri-urban centers that can be characterized as 'nodes'
 or concentrations of various kinds of activities. Urban nodes
 typically feature dense concentrations of economic activities
 such as in Makati and Eastwood, cultural activities such as
 the 'Identity Districts' put forth earlier, and leisure activities,
 including shopping, dining, and entertainment, such as the
 node along MRT3 at Trinoma / SM North. Mixed in with
 these dominant uses are a range of other elements, such as
 residential areas and community services. In creating a green
 metropolis, these nodes and hinterlands must feature variable
 population, job, and activity densities.

5. 	 Making Metro Manila Inclusive



   Goal

   To create inclusive communities through mixed-use, mixed-income, and variable density nodal
   development capitalizing on opportunities to engage stakeholders and utilize land readjustment
   practices across Metro Manila’s existing socio-economic spatial structure.



   Background


   Major opportunities lie in redeveloping underutilized            industries. Redeveloping underutilized land provides
   lands in Metro Manila. There is an urgent need to                an opportunity to address the current housing backlog

   unlocking value land for other uses. Development of
   housing and other infrastructure in turn creates a job
   market that can be an important driver of the urban
   economy as seen in other countries such as China
   where nearly 50 percent of the GDP is generated by
   investment in infrastructure, property, and production
   facilities. Employment in urban construction activities,
   particularly during times of rapid city-building, can
   account for nearly 10-12 percent of employment
   worldwide. City building efforts on a wide scale will
   require land readjustment policies. These policies can
   help unlock around USD200 billion in underutilized
   land across Metro Manila.

   Large-scale in-situ redevelopment has the potential
   to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the regional
   economy by unlocking land value through the sale and
   development of under-utilized land, corresponding
   jobs that will be created by new construction activities,
   and the potential industries/services that could locate
   to these areas. Investment in housing produces high
   returns; it is estimated that for every PHP1 invested
   in housing development, the multiplier effect is
   two times in terms of other investments in related

7. 	 Key Synergies



    In order to achieve the Vision, several key synergies between the economic / livelihood and city-
    building strategic areas must be realized. The key synergies are described below:



    1. 	Create a Well-Connected and Inclusive                        2. 	 Upgrade Informal Communities, Unlocking
    	   Multi-Nodal Metropolis                                       	Land Values, and Improving Livelihoods

    To fully realize the Vision, Metro Manila must focus             Informal communities occupy a significant portion of

    all socio-economic classes.

    On top of substantial job creation and economic
    development created by the real estate and
    construction industry, coordinating such city-building
    efforts will create enormous economic benefits across
    other key sectors. With a safe, green, and efficient
    urban environment, it will be possible to attract new
    investment in IT-BPO and high-end services, while
    potentially attracting millions of new tourists every
    year, leading to countless job opportunities. These
    efforts will allow current residents to live higher-
    quality lives by spending less time in traffic, breathing
    cleaner air, and having improved access to education,
    healthcare, and jobs.

8. 	 Moving Forward

    The next step is to develop a spatial strategy to make the
    Vision a reality.

    In the next phase of this project, MMDA will be
    working with global experts, national agencies, local
    government units, and the public to develop long-term
    strategies towards common goals related to inclusivity,
    connectivity, and resiliency.

    Over the next year, MMDA will host workshops,
    consultations, and events to coordinate with and listen
    to stakeholders. This process will play an important role
    in the development of the Greenprint 2030, which will
    be released in 2015.

former President of the Institute for Urban Planning and
Research in Curitiba, Brazil shared the Brazilian experience
tackling transportation issues, focusing on the process of
creating a rapid bus transit system. Luis Felipe Sequeiros a

recipient for best local practices, and the current head of the
Guadalajara 2020, shared metropolitan planning experiences
in developing the long-term strategy for Guadalajara.

“Metro Manila: Welcome to YOUR Megacity”

Associate Director for Urban Development at the Rockefeller
Foundation, Benji de la Peña, gave a talk for a group of
government and private sector agencies on August 23, 2013
at the MMDA Office in Makati City. The talk focused on
how to solve pressing urban problems through bottom-
up innovative processes and reframe them in a dynamic,
complex-adaptive context. Pena showed that Metro Manila
is not experiencing its urban challenges in a vacuum; other
cities around the world are struggling to address transport,
informal settlements, and other quality of life issues. Pena
advocates for a renewed perspective of how to approach
these issues and shared his thoughts on how to make Metro
Manila a successful megacity.

CLUP Review: Common Themes / Elements

•	 Most LGUs base future LU on existing situation & trends
   – Most LGUs are accepting Passive LU Development
     Roles; not actively shaping the future
•	 Zoning Ordinances are primary method of controlling LU
   – Major Interventions (Catalytic Infrastructure /
     Development) are left to external / higher actors
•	 LGUs largely adopt planning roles independent from
   other LGUs
   – Primary / Metropolitan Role: Makati, Manila, Pasay
     City, Quezon City, Taguig etc.
   – Secondary Role: Las Pinas / Caloocan City, Muntinlupa,
     Marikina
•	 Many commonly mentioned LGU Initiatives require
   Higher Level Government Coordination and Investment
   – E.g., Intermodal Transfer facilities, River / Waterway
     Rehabilitation, Establishing and promoting Identity
     Districts, etc.

Green spaces:
•	 Disconnected
•	 Dwindling
•	 Opportunities exist but will require:
   – Purposeful planning and a moderation of short
     term revenue maximization objective (government
     properties)
   – Incentives for private development of public spaces
•	 CLUP data suggest that the MMR has about 6.1 m2 of
   green / open space per person
•	 Recent Comparative Study, Asian Green Cities Index,
   suggests that figure is 4.5 m2 per person
