1. Introduction
The governments of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan share a common goal of using the
mining sector as an economic catalyst for their respective industrialisation processes. They also
share the same determining factors in capturing benefits of the mining sector and translating
them into a broader socio-economic development:
      •    Fiscal linkages, by generating economic development through revenues collected from the
           mining sector;
      •    Consumption linkages, by providing a stimulus to economic development as local workers
           and businesses spent their mining sector incomes in the national economy; and
     •     Production linkages, by supplying inputs into the mining sector (backward linkages) and by
           processing commodities (forward linkages).
This study has focused on the third factor, specifically, the creation of local benefits through
supplier linkages. The World Bank commissioned a ‘pilot’ study to inform the nature and scale
of potential support to the three Central Asian countries, with the goal of mining-related
domestic procurement serving as an instrument to increase employment and industrialisation.
This document presents on the findings of the study, undertaken by Community Insights Group
during the period May to July 2013. The report starts with an overview of current global trends
with respect to domestic procurement by mining operations. Sections 3-5 describe the situation
in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan with regard to company legal obligations and practices,
and government programs and capacities to support domestic SMEs supplying the mining
industry. The situation analysis is followed by a summary of case studies (Section 6) undertaken
with mining operations to determine their current procurement needs, current local
procurement efforts, and barriers to increasing procurement. The case studies also included the
perspective of local suppliers and potential local suppliers. The report closes with a set of
recommendations for World Bank consideration, to guide future interventions.


2. Approach
The approach to the pilot study involved a mix of desktop review, stakeholder engagement and
case study research methods.
Desk Study
An overview of global trends in domestic procurement within the mining sector was developed
based on desktop review of recent studies and publications provided, and academic and
applied experience of our team members in developing and developed markets. The resultant
framework guided data collection and analysis of trends in the contexts of Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
The global scan of policy and practice and ‘lessons learnt’ drew, to a large extent, on a recent
publication by members of the project team and commissioned by Revenue Watch Institute
(Esteves et al. 2013) and covered topics such as:
      •    Conceptualising ’domestic procurement’: range of definitions and scope
      •    Domestic procurement in the context of total mining contributions to host nations and
           communities
      •    Overview of trends in government policies and legal instruments
      •    Trends in mining industry initiatives
      •    Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships
      •    Aligning timeframes for mine development, domestic procurement development and local
           economic development
      •    Partnerships drawing on comparative advantages of different stakeholders
      •    Mechanisms for monitoring and transparency

The review served to guide the design of an analytical framework for the study. Key trends
were evaluated in the context of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The social and
economic benefits, either realised or potential, were identified across the three target
countries. Specific challenges affecting the success of domestic procurement policies and
strategies were also identified, drawing on themes such as the presence of strong national level
industry development policy, the ease of doing business, volatility in commodity prices, long
term economic booms and busts, and unpredictability and uncertainty of revenues of SME
suppliers. These are only a few examples of the wide ranging issues that can impact on
successful domestic procurement outcomes.
In examining the current situation in the target countries, we considered what opportunities
might exist for regional or cross-border cooperation for increasing domestic procurement.
Likewise, we examined if particular emphasis is being placed on supporting gender specific
programs, either stemming from mining company activities, or from SMEs working in mining
supply chains.
The information collected during this phase helped identify case study data collection tools to
ensure they were relevant and appropriate to the interviewees.
Stakeholder Engagement
For each country, a sample of interviewees was selected so as to broadly represent the four
sectors: Private Sector, Government, Civil Society Organisations, and Donors. We worked
closely with the World Bank in Washington DC and in the countries to identify such
stakeholders and initiate contacts. (A list of stakeholders interviewed is provided in Appendix 2,
Stakeholders Consulted.)
Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured, standardised format to ensure consistency
and comparability and to allow for flexibility in the types of questions relevant to different
groups of stakeholders. (See Appendices 3-4, Key Informant Interview Questionnaires). We also
facilitated small group discussions on (1) barriers and enablers for domestic supplier
development, (2) drivers and priorities of stakeholders in participating in domestic
procurement initiatives, (3) ideas for practical and innovative interventions, and (4) indicators
of success.
Case Studies
The mining company case study research involved representatives of the following functions:
Contracts and Procurement, Government Relations and Community Relations, as well as a
representative of the Government Shareholder. Semi-structured interviews were conducted
using a questionnaire (see Appendix 3) to collect and analyse procurement spend by category of
goods and services procured by industry.
The case studies included the following components:
      •    Demand analysis
      •    Mapping of company procurement practices for domestic and local suppliers
      •    Mapping of regulatory and contractual obligations affecting domestic procurement
      •    Interviews amongst a sample of local businesses in proximity to the mine

Reporting findings and developing recommendations
Findings have been presented by key factors which contribute to increasing domestic
procurement, as identified in the review of global trends. Recommendations are also proposed
for consideration by the World Bank. These recommendations include the type of intervention,
e.g. further study, baseline survey, capacity building, new project, new activity within existing
World Bank programs, as well as potential partnership models.

3. Global Trend Review
This section provides an overview of various policies and practices currently adopted by
governments and industry to realise the benefits of domestic procurement in mining sectors. It
should be noted that there appears to be a marked absence of analysis of the effectiveness of
domestic procurement policies applied to date, and which type of policy and legal instrument is
more effective in what context. The literature that exists on the topic, which is dominated by
case studies of ‘good’ industry practice and discussions of potential pitfalls, is also summarised
in this section.

3.1 Framing Domestic Procurement: definitions and scope
Policies designed to promote domestic procurement aim at extending or expanding the
benefits of mining activities to the national economy. As such, they attempt to give local
stakeholders greater access to economic opportunities related to participation in supply chains
and the provision of related support services. This is enabled through mechanisms such as, but
not limited to, targets for local suppliers, preference schemes for local businesses, industry or
greater access to finance for local businesses.
This section frames the perspective applied in this study, and explains the use of certain
terminology and assumptions.
Definitions of domestic procurement
Throughout this document, the term ‘domestic’ or ‘local’ refers to ‘the national level’. The term
‘community’ is used to refer to the subnational level, specifically those host communities or
regions which are directly impacted by mining activities
The issue of what constitutes ‘domestic procurement’ is the subject of different interpretations.
In different contexts, a company may be deemed domestic if it demonstrates any of the
following characteristics (Paul and Pierre, 2010):
      •    domestic registration - legal entity registered under national law
      •    domestic ownership – a certain percentage (for example 50% or more) of the company
           owned by citizens of the country or by existing domestically owned and registered entities
      •    domestic value added –a specified percentage of goods/services is produced within the
           country
     •     joint venture between a foreign and a domestic company - the domestic company owns a
           specified minimum percentage of a partnership with a foreign company
Contemporary approaches to domestic procurement practice provide examples of where blind
adherence to definitions of ‘domestic’ or ‘local’ can lead to undesirable consequences. How
definitions link back to public policy objectives is important, whether enhanced local industrial
capacity, broad-based economic development or increased local employment. A company that
maintains a local branch office which is simply a conduit for bringing in goods and services from
outside the country may not realise the desired policy objective. On the other hand, a foreign-
owned firm entering a joint venture, consortium or taking ownership positions in local firms
could make an important contribution to local economic capital particularly if profits are
reinvested locally and not repatriated.
Contemporary domestic procurement policies in the mining activities vary widely in scope and
level or type of regulation applied. The level of complexity and uncertainty attached to different
interventions varies with the number of stakeholders expected to benefit from the
intervention; the initial state of the local economy relative to expected outcomes; the
alignment of domestic supplier interventions with other industrial and developmental policy
interventions; and the expectations gap, being what benefits can be generated from local
content strategies versus the desired outcomes by local communities.

Definition of linkages adopted by this study
The relationships connecting a mining industry with the producer firms in its supply chain are
often referred to as upstream linkages. These linkages include interactions amongst producer
firms, manufacturers, input providers, agents, distributors and providers of services. The extent
of local economic diversification also depends on linkage development between the first level
of suppliers supporting the mine directly (Tier 1s) and suppliers supporting them. As each of
these suppliers grows, its dependence on other supplier firms also grows. The multiplier effect
increases with each additional linkage (UNECA 2011).
The diagram below shows how linkages arise at each step of the value chain.
Fig. 1. Opportunities for procurement along the mining value chain (UNECA 2011)




Scope of domestic procurement at the national vs local level
One approach to domestic procurement policies is to focus on the national level. Another
approach (sometimes referred to as ‘local-local’, ‘localised’, or ‘community’ content) is to focus
on the smallest administrative unit, or combination of units, where the natural resource
extraction projects take place, be it the village, the town or the municipality. There are two
spatial dimensions to consider
The first spatial dimension is one of natural resource extraction activities. Although the actual
extraction of resources is fixed in space, being entirely dependent on the actual location of the
resource, a large part of the rest of the value chain activities is unattached and flexible. In fact,
the actual extraction process, as a highly capital intensive process, may not actually make use of
local resources other than land, water, power and public infrastructure such as roads, rail or
port facilities. Mining companies operate in highly integrated global value chains (GVCs), in
which the local economies do not necessarily participate. This is partly explained by the
existence of higher scale economies in the production of inputs in other locations,
concentration of ownership along the chain, the level of risk and uncertainty and lack of
specialised knowledge and capital in the local economy.
The second spatial dimension to consider is the distribution of economic activity within the
country in question. Agglomerative forces at work make population and economic activity
concentrated across space. New businesses are drawn to dense places because of the
availability of inputs, services, specialised labor and customers. For instance, for the case of
Ghana, Bloch and Owusu (2011) report that the large majority of the firms making up the
mining inputs cluster are concentrated in the Accra Metropolitan Area and in the adjoining
metropolitan area of Tema, where they are in close proximity to the headquarters of the
-




Page 10 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




producing mining companies. This implies that even for activities taking place within the same
country, there is a significant effect of distance. A similar phenomenon has been observed in
Peru by Nava (2011).
The implication of this is that because of the concentration of economic activity in selected
places, the bulk of the creation of new businesses derived from mining linkages may entirely
bypass the local-local, or even the regional economy. For suppliers that could benefit from
supply chain linkages with mining companies, the only way to operate may be by locating in an
already dense location, implying that the suppliers have to incur transportation costs, which are
often prohibitive for small producers in a country with poor infrastructure.
Firms can exploit their unique advantage of being at close proximity to the mining project site
by being part of larger competitive undertakings happening at the regional and national levels,
such as the creation of industrial parks, clusters and growth poles, or building technological
capacities and shaping governance for the upgrading of local businesses in global value chains
(Fessahaie 2011).
With this perspective, the role of stakeholders at the subnational level is to work actively in the
design of such projects to ensure they maximise the benefits of mining activities for the nearby
population. Policy makers can attempt to stimulate economic development through domestic
procurement at the subnational level by identifying key sectors with higher-than-average
backward and forward linkages compared with other sectors in a subnational region, and the
highest sectors in terms of mining industry multipliers. Local economies will grow more rapidly
if those sectors are encouraged to grow and the mining companies are encouraged to focus
their domestic supplier efforts with companies within those sectors (Esteves and Ivanova 2013).

3.2 Domestic procurement in the context of total mining industry
    contributions to host nations
In broad and simple terms, governments have two sets of (complementary) instruments open
to them in ensuring mining industry contributes to the expansion of the national industrial
base.
      •    Royalty and tax revenue maximisation: As mining industry profits become part of the
           government’s tax base tax revenues available to government are maximised. This is
           expected to provide the government additional revenue to invest in infrastructure and other
           initiatives that can support the development and expansion of the industrial base. This
           industrial economic activity adds broader value to the economy through employment,
           investment and additional tax revenue for the government. The benefits are intended to
           flow to other sectors of the economy and contribute to greater national prosperity. The
           benefits from this instrument are realisable in a longer term horizon.
      •    Local content maximisation: With this strategy, relatively higher priority is given to the
           employment of locals and sourcing from locally-based firms in the short term. The host
           government requires the share of national content to be greater than would have resulted
           from the procurement of goods and services in an open market with no interventions of any
           sort, such as training programs, increased access to finance, etc. The aim of imposing
           ‘preferential’ measures, such as requiring a price premium for domestic suppliers when
           evaluating tenders (as is the case in Kazakhstan), is to encourage local workforces and
           businesses to work with leading international mining firms and their large contractors, and
           benefit from training and transfer of technology.
For governments, a balance between the two strategies requires that industrial development is
stimulated through local content requirements, while mining companies are appropriately
taxed to provide the financial resources for the government to support industry development
initiatives. In seeking the point of balance, trade-offs are sometimes made in confidential
agreements with companies regarding royalties, taxes and their commitment to domestic
procurement targets. Such trade-offs may include changing the mix and/or timing of royalties
-




Page 11 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




and taxes in exchange for the mining industry’s financial support for the development of the
local private sector.
A strategic approach to domestic procurement has realistic targets that contribute to lasting
benefits. Targets that are beyond the existing capacity of local industry or the absorptive
capacity of particular assets may create market inefficiencies.
There are further unintended consequences. Unethical behaviours can lead to community
discontent. Some examples include domestic procurement interventions being closely aligned
with public officials’ or investors’ other local businesses; targets resulting in selection of
contractors unable to meet prequalification without falsifying capabilities; extortion of fees to
be part of a tender list; authorisation of single/sole sourcing without appropriate governance
arrangements; bid rigging between contractors to increase prices; or bribery of officials to
provide certification.
Setting inappropriate targets for domestic procurement can encourage perverse behaviour,
presenting governance risks. One example of this is ‘fronting’ where companies are established
with the prescribed local ownership or address, but the decision-making and benefits are held
by individuals other than those who are not targeted beneficiaries of the local procurement
policy (Esteves and Barclay, 2011). Nepotism and corruption can be associated issues, as
observed in Angola and Nigeria (Mwakali and Byaruhanga, 2011).

3.3 Trends in domestic procurement policies adopted by governments
The mechanisms available to ensure that domestic procurement provisions are implemented
are usually specified in national local content legislation and regulations outlining domestic
procurement requirements. Mining companies can also commit to certain domestic
procurement requirements under the terms of individual concessions, supplier agreements,
production sharing or framework agreements with governments. The consequences for mining
companies, in the event of non-compliance, will vary depending on the relevant national
legislation and regulations. A broader challenge is that many governments lack the institutional
capacity to monitor or accurately assess or measure local content outcomes. This also presents
an issue for companies being held to account for their local content commitments.
Definitions of domestic procurement and the scope and regulatory mechanisms available vary
across countries. Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) are bound under the
National Treatment Obligation (NTO) clause under which foreign companies cannot be forced
to buy from local suppliers or hire local service suppliers if a better alternative in terms of price
or quality exists abroad. In line with this obligation, some country level laws do not specify any
type of sanction for non-compliance, but instead, suggest to mining companies that
preferential treatment should be given to local suppliers and workers. WTO rules also limit
member countries’ policy discretion to impose performance requirements. The WTO
Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) specifically prohibits the
application of trade restrictions that are incompatible with the obligation to provide national
treatment or that constitute quantitative restrictions (such as the imposition of local content
requirements).
The following types of government policies, legal instruments and practices are discussed
below:
      •    Requirements for minimum domestic procurement targets
      •    Requirements for companies to produce domestic procurement plans
      •    Requirements to give preference to locals without specifying targets
      •    Requirements to build local enterprise

3.3.1 Requirements for minimum domestic procurement targets
Table 1 contains a description of existing local content legislations in different countries.
Currently, the 31 countries that are WTO members and are also considered Least Developed
Countries (LDCs), can introduce measures that deviate from the NTO clause for a defined period
of time on the grounds of their “individual development, financial or trade needs, or their
administrative and institutional capabilities”1. Out of this group of 31 countries, only Angola has
introduced explicit local content requirements.
In countries with a small or weak industrial base and a limited skilled workforce, it is difficult to
achieve short term local content objectives, whether legislated for or not. In a LDC context,
there are at least two main reasons why most LDCs countries have not enacted local content
regulations: the very prominent mismatch between international companies’ requirements and
local supplier’s capabilities on the one hand, and the limited capacity that LDCs have in
introducing, implementing and regulating legislation on the other.
As can be seen in Table 1, existing local content legislations vary greatly in their scope and
targets. For instance, while Angola’s legislation is limited to establishing a 10% preferencing
margin for local suppliers and does not establish overall targets for Angolan content,
Kazakhstan’s Subsoil Law establishes a target of 50% local procurement from Kazakh suppliers
by 2012. While some legislation is specific for certain sectors (e.g., Russia), or for a specific
component of the mining value chain (e.g., Indonesia), others are meant to benefit specific
population groups (e.g. South Africa and Zimbabwe).

3.3.2 Requirements for companies to produce domestic procurement plans
There is more ample evidence on the tightening of approval and regulatory processes to
require extractive companies to produce domestic procurement plans that include enterprises
and workforce participation in resource-producing areas that are aligned with the regional
economic development plan. Some examples from South Africa, Indonesia and Philippines are
summarised in Table 2. These plans often include a subnational dimension because they
require mining companies to specify impacts and benefits for local communities. For instance,
in the Philippines, the law requires mining companies to draw a Social Development
Management Plan which should describe “the programs, projects and activities that would be
undertaken by the mining operator to promote the general welfare of the inhabitants of the
barangays where the mining area is located as well as neighboring barangays.”

3.3.3 Requirements that give preference to locals without specifying targets
Some countries bound by the NTO clause have adopted a number of domestic procurement
policies within the parameters established by international trade and investment agreements.
These policies aim at directly increasing the participation of local workers and suppliers without
establishing legally binding national local content legislation and regulation. Enforcement in
these cases rely on mechanisms with different degrees of power, that range from specific
commitments in Production Sharing Agreements to general agreements on the need to support
domestic procurement that do not impose any sort of restrictions on mining companies, a best
endeavors approach.
-




Page 16 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




Examples of these types of policies include: ensuring ‘full, fair and reasonable’ access to
opportunities for local suppliers initiated by national or subnational governments (such as The
Australian Industry Participation National Framework); compiling a list of ‘capable’ local
suppliers by local government agencies (see for instance the supplier registry system developed
by the Industrial Association of Antofagasta and mining companies in Chile); and harmonising
supplier requirements and encouraging the implementation of certification systems for local
suppliers by local government agencies or mining companies (such as in Atacama mining
cluster, Chile). A particularly relevant policy for local Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is
the requirement for ‘unbundling’ contracts (Canada, for example, established this under
Participation Agreements between locally affected Aboriginal communities and mining
companies). Unbundling contracts involves breaking packages of work or supply agreements
into smaller parcels that are within the capabilities of targeted businesses to fulfill.
The advantages of these types of initiatives are that they can be readily implemented because
they do not depend on enacting regulatory tools, and that they can be flexible to the needs of
the local economy and the mining companies. Their main disadvantages are that their
effectiveness depends on the existence of a pool of competitive potential local suppliers, and
that compliance cannot be legally enforced.
3.3.4 Requirements to build local enterprise
Given that policies aimed at increasing access to opportunities have only limited impact on the
size of the local supply of goods, services and labor; some countries have adopted
complementary policies aiming at increasing the size of the local supply and workforce
availability. Examples of this type of policy include increasing local participation via specific
requirements to transfer know-how and skills related to mining operations to benefit local
enterprises and workers; and requirements to train the local labor force.
A related strategy is the requirement to form joint ventures with local public or private
companies, in order to ensure, in a more direct way, the transfer of knowledge and technology
from foreign mining companies to local companies.
At the subnational level, countries such as Philippines, India, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
Kazakhstan and South Africa have mandated spending on enterprise and skills development as
part of social funds that companies are required to set up. In the Philippines, for instance, the
law mandates companies to not only produce development plans for the host and neighbouring
communities, but also to contribute to “self-sustaining income generating activities, such as but
not limited to, reforestation and production of goods and services needed by the mine and the
community” (Act No. 7942, Philippines, Section 136).
3.3.5 Government-led initiatives with voluntary industry participation
There are also examples of non-mandated, voluntary approaches to subnational government
and company collaborations to increase visibility and access to opportunities. One of them is C-
Res, in Queensland, Australia, a subsidiary of the Mackay Whitsunday Regional Economic
Development Corporation (REDC). This entity was specifically established to deliver a mining
company’s (BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance’s (BMA)) Local Buying Program. The program aims
to provide opportunities for small businesses with less than 25 full-time employees to
competitively supply goods and services to BMA in townships throughout the Bowen Basin
region. In addition to providing supply opportunities, the Local Buying Program, through the
establishment of a Community Foundation, aims to deliver community and economic
development programs to enhance and build local business and community capability. The
Foundation aims to enhance the economic viability of the wider community and region through
programs targeting new business, existing business growth, employment programs and
benchmarking of economic performance with other regions.
Another example is ePilbara. ePilbara is an online Business Capability Register for the Pilbara
region in the state of Western Australia managed by the Pilbara Development Commission, and
supported by a number of mining companies and Chamber of Commerce and Industry. To be
listed in ePilbara, companies must meet the following criteria: a Pilbara postal address,
-




Page 17 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




employees permanently based in the Pilbara and the ability to provide products or services
from the Pilbara location. The website also provides access to ProjectConnect- a service
provided by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia which links project
developers and their major contractors with their own categorised electronic library of
suppliers. Mining companies use ePilbara to publish information on upcoming tenders and
recipients of recent tender awards.
3.3.6 Concessions on import tariffs and duties
Legislation on investment in many countries provides for customs duty exemptions for
imported goods of mining companies e.g. equipment and spare parts. Whereas such provisions
are designated for priority investment projects, they often create discourage mining companies
from buying locally. There are several measures that can promote mining investment and
promote domestic procurement with regard to concessions on import tariffs and duties:
      •    Regulations to extend customs exemptions, based on a regional mining list, to domestic
           suppliers that predominantly supply the mining sector, so that suppliers do not have to rely
           on mining contracts to apply exemptions, and are not at a cost disadvantage when supplying
           services to mining companies where these may be supplied internally by the mine (e.g.
           drilling and mining);
      •    Regulations that provide for customs exemptions to be applied based on a central product
           list. This is applicable to countries which currently extend exemptions on the basis of lists
           agreed with each mine;
      •    Regulations that provide for development of a tiered mining list and application of the list to
           the phasing out of exemptions (e.g. in the case where a product is available, but may not yet
           be produced at the required scale or quality); and
      •    A process for updating the mining list and providing a reliable channel for mining suppliers to
           make applications for removal of products from the mining list, and communicating the
           process to regional organisations. This could include developing a process for querying and
           applying for products to be removed from the various tiers of the mining list (including
           investigation into local production/ service delivery, timings for investigation and removal).

3.4 Trends in industry ‘good practices’
Within industry, there are evolving attitudes towards local content, as evidenced in the shift in
the way the business case is communicated. In many instances, the initial motivation for
investing in local content was a need to comply with formalised commitments, either to a host
government, an investment partner such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), or an
Indigenous community, or in pursuit of a social license to operate. Compliance was deemed
necessary in order to secure access to resources. Case study research on local procurement
amongst 23 companies by Esteves et al. (2011) found that these companies had become
increasingly motivated by the desire to establish and maintain enduring partnerships with local
suppliers for mutual benefit. Table 4 provides examples from this case study research of
extractive companies engaging in a range of local procurement interventions that are designed
to increase local business access to contract opportunities. Strategies include: assigning higher
preference weightings to local businesses in competitive bidding processes; sole sourcing
arrangements with local suppliers; price matching, that is allowing local suppliers to match the
price of other suppliers; breaking large contracts into smaller ones (unbundling) to create
opportunities for smaller local suppliers; requiring non-local suppliers to sub-contract locally or
to enter joint ventures with local suppliers; providing technical and management training and
mentoring; and linking local businesses to other service providers and agencies that promote
technological innovation and provide access to finance.

                                  businesses located within the prescribed areas. All tenderers are required to show the
                                  actual cost of their local or regional content.
OZ Minerals, South          Established a website on The Industry Capability Network (ICN) site, through which
Australia                    suppliers were invited to lodge an expression of interest for packages of work. The ICN
                             undertook a first round of screening and the Engineering, Procurement, Construction
                             and Management (EPCM) contractor followed with a short listing process.
Developing strategic partnerships and agreements

Century Mine, MMG,               Signed the Gulf Communities Agreement (GCA), an agreement between Century, the
Gulf region of                    Queensland Government and the four Native Title Groups of Waanyi, Mingginda,
northern Queensland               Gkuthaarn and Kukatj.
                                 Tenderers are first evaluated for their eligibility as a Native Title GCA party, prior to
                                  the technical assessment. The GCA Department facilitates support to provide
                                  tenderers with information regarding business set up requirements and ongoing
                                  business management, e.g. preparation of BAS statements, payroll, training, health,
                                  safety and environment procedures and human resources policy.

Rio Tinto Argyle                 Argyle’s policy for local Aboriginal contracting is driven by its Mine Participation
Diamond Mine,                     Agreement with Traditional Owners, and is supported by a Management Plan

Australia                         and all else being equal, Argyle commits to giving preference to tenderers who bring
                                  the greatest opportunities to Traditional Owners.
                                 The company is obliged under the Agreement to notify the Business Development
                                  taskforce (comprising Traditional Owners and company representatives) of company
                                  intent to let any contract over AUD$ 250,000 in a year, relating to the provision of
                                  goods or services to Argyle at the mine site. Any request for tender over this value
                                  requires the tenderer to demonstrate how they will involve Traditional Owner
                                  businesses in the contract, how they will employ and/or train Traditional Owners, and
                                  how they will provide benefits to Traditional Owners.
Rio Tinto                        Encouraged the establishment of a joint venture (ESS Gumala) between Compass

Oil & Gas Case Study: BP Azerbaijan Regional Development Initiative
BP and its co-venturers in a large oil & gas project implemented a multi-stakeholder, long-term,
large-scale, Regional Development Initiative(RDI) in Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Georgia. The goal
of the RDI was to enhance local enterprise development, access to energy and good
governance.
The 2006-2010 iinitiative was based on principals of multi-stakeholder dialogue. Its key features
included:
      •    A multi-sectoral forum
      •    Provision of coordination and coherence (government, multilaterals, private companies,
           international NGOs, donors, IFIs)
      •    Identification of gaps/obstacles and strategies to overcome those
      •    Implementation activities drawn on core competencies (complementarity)
      •    Comprehensive information resource on investment opportunities

3.5 Domestic Procurement Initiatives: Best Practice
The previous section demonstrates the existence of a wide range of policies and industry
practices at different stages of implementation. In the absence of empirical data on the
outcomes, conclusions cannot be drawn as to their application to all settings seeking to boost
local content. There are, however, some common themes that emerge through case study
research, pointing to certain elements of success albeit difficult to quantify.
      •    Build partnerships and develop linkage programs
      •    Ensure systematic identification of opportunities
      •    Adopt a common, integrated approach across stakeholders
      •    Establish strong mandated implementation body


3.5.1 Linkage programs and the role of partnerships
Partnerships between industry, governments and development agencies are particularly
evident in local supplier development programs, with a view, for example, to enabling SMEs to
access financing and skills development programs, technical mentoring and support for the
development of business management skills (Deloitte 2004, Jenkins et al. 2007, Nelson 2007,
Rufffing 2006, UNCTAD 2001). Some linkage programs focus heavily on institutional
strengthening activities to encourage an enabling environment for SME development. Other
programs have given particular focus in assisting women to establish their own small businesses
by providing them with access to legal, business and financial systems, thereby reducing the
gender gap that prevents many women from participating in economic life (ODI 2005, Wyse
and Shtylla 2007). Generally speaking, civil society organisations have not paid a dominant role
in linkage programs.
      •    Company role: It is important to consider the drivers and obligations of each sector in
           considering their potential contribution to policy design. Beyond the explicit licencing
           agreement associated with a given mining concession, the company needs to establish and
           maintain a social licence to operate within the communities around the project site and
           beyond. Optimising domestic procurement opportunities within its supply chain is practical
           and can potentially be commercially attractive for the company. Practical challenges
           however exist in achieving this goal. In a developing country context, the most common
           challenge is the lack of underlying industrial capacity in the given geography. Building local
           supply capacity is in the interest of all but needs to be a medium to long-term objective. A
           skills development and supplier development program should be designed with a longer
           time horizon in mind. In the short term, the company has other important obligations in the
           operation of its mine that include meeting set standards in health, safety, social and
           environmental management. They must meet regulatory obligations to the government and
           contractual obligations in off-take agreements, and maximise financial returns for
           shareholders. Obligations for strict short term targets for domestic procurement can
           threaten the foundations that make a mine or oil and gas project commercially viable.
      •    Government: The role of central government versus subnational government varies greatly
           in terms of domestic procurement policy development and practice. In most cases, central
           governments have far more discretion and capacity to make and implement laws compared
           to subnational governments. Their respective authority and capacity to pass laws, and
           establish and monitor agreements with resource companies can determine their
           contribution to local economic development outcomes. One role that is frequently held in
           common, however, is creating a business-enabling environment through positive policy
           frameworks; creating side-stream linkages, through infrastructure (power, logistics,
           communications, water), human resources development and R&D); strengthening
           institutions and investing in industry development, as well as constructive oversight of
           companies’ local content plans.

        •     Civil Society: CSOs are defined in this context as organised, independent (preferably
              politically non-aligned) groups who have an externally focused role in communicating with
              business including domestic suppliers, the community and public or private sector. This
              includes industry bodies (business associations) NGOs (international or national), and the
              media. Many of the roles played by CSOs require supplementary funding support, as
              typically their own operational budgets are meagre.
        •     International Donors can play an important role in brokering partnership, promoting best
              practice in domestic procurement and ensuring transparency and accountability.
              International donors often provide technical assistance, capacity building and loan finance
              to local suppliers.

Some examples of domestic procurement policy design elements that should be informed by a
consensus-building, multi-stakeholder deliberative space, to be led by different stakeholders
(government, companies, CSOs and international donors), are provided in Figure 3 below):

3.6 Clusters and Cluster Initiatives
Mining sector linkages and industrial policies have been successfully implemented through
cluster initiatives in many developed and developing economies. Cluster initiatives are
organised efforts to increase growth and competitiveness of clusters within a region, involving
cluster firms, government and the research community. They include the creation of industrial
parks, clusters and growth poles. Cluster initiatives present a model to organise economic
policy as a collaborative effort of different branches of the government, the private sector,
trade associations, civil society, etc.
Stimulating economic development through domestic procurement requires governments and
companies to work together to identify key sectors with higher-than-average backward and
forward linkages compared with other sectors in a subnational region, and the highest sectors
in terms of mining industry multipliers. Local economies will grow more rapidly if those sectors
are encouraged to grow and the mining companies are encouraged to focus their domestic
procurement efforts with companies within those sectors, and if cluster initiatives are targeted
towards those sectors. Some key elements of cluster initiatives are as follows:
        •     An increased focus on the microeconomic business environment as opposed to a traditional
              macro focus
        •     A long-term agenda to improve competitiveness of clusters rather than individual firms or
-




Page 24 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




           broad sectors
       •   An emphasis on regional and local areas
       •   Improved networking among cluster firms, trust-building and enhanced dialogue to create
           spill-overs
       •   The provision of seed money rather than large subsidies
       •   A balanced input of resources from government and industry
       •   A selection of dusters through a process of competition
       •   A mix of competition and cooperation as underlying drivers of learning and innovation
       •   A mix of SMEs and large firms participating
       •   Partnerships involving not only cluster firms and government, but also the academic
           community
       •   Learning and innovation based on a systems-view rather than on isolated firms
Some prominent examples of mining linkages and cluster initiatives are provided below – from
Chile, Australia, Brazil, Mozambique and South Africa. The common thread across all cases is
that the government’s role has been crucial for success, by providing logistics and
infrastructure; providing a stable legal and regulatory framework; and attractive fiscal
packages. The examples from southern Africa demonstrate spatial development initiatives, in
using a resource or development corridor approach to optimise spatial linkages provided by the
anchor project infrastructure. Such initiatives require a solid institutional space for
implementation.
Chile
Chile’s mining has strong links with a large number of companies that provide inputs, from
equipment and engineering consulting, to power, logistics, communications and financial
services. According to a study by the Technical University Federico Santa Maria (2009), 84% of
mining suppliers are Chilean. While there are no formal commitments in Chilean law, Chile’s
government institutions have worked together with the private sector in supporting domestic
procurement and supplier development.
Region II in Chile is one of the most successful examples of an industrial cluster built around the
mining industry2. In the development of this cluster, centered on Antofogasta, mining
companies and governments have worked together to maximise the positive linkages from
mining for local development. In 2002 Antofagasta established an executive committee to
encourage the development of a mining cluster in the region. This public-private partnership
deliberately targets and fosters local suppliers, helping them adjust their practices in
accordance to the needs of mining companies operating in Chile and overseas. Ongoing
initiatives in the cluster aim to transform 250 Chilean-based firms into world-class suppliers by
2014, training 28,000 people and developing Chile’s capacity to expand its human capital by
December 2015. Earlier initiatives in the cluster included:
       •   A program to develop suppliers for the industrial growth of Region II, which provided a
           subsidy to large companies in Region II who participated in supplier development, requiring
           the companies themselves to take responsibility for the training and integration of local
           suppliers.
       •   A program designed to address the qualification needs of SMEs supplying the mining
           industry, through credit programs, capacity building technical consultancy, subcontracting
           exchange, management training, and marketing and export assistance.
       •   Various government measures to support mining suppliers’ expansion, including an R&D
           centre focusing on mining at the University of Chile and a scientific park in Antofagasta city.

Brazil
An example of collaborative attempts to greater economic integration of mining with other
sectors is found in within Pará State, Brazil. A supplier development program REDES is managed
by the Pará State business association FIEPA. As FIEPA/REDES wish to be seen as a non-partisan
technical initiative, it does not obtain funds directly from the state government. REDES receives
funding support from 15 large companies, operating in various sectors (such as mining, energy,
food). The industry partners also participate by setting targets for local purchases and
monitoring. REDES also reports on expected future demand, provides information to would-be
suppliers of how to access large buyers, and offers training through service providers.
Membership of REDES grew from 216 in 2004 to 1,640 in 2010. The absolute amounts of
procurement from within Pará also increased (from R$ 379 million in 2001 to R $4.161 million
in 2010). The proportion of total procurement from firms with their principal business
operations in Pará increased from 41% in 2001 to 49% in 2010 (ICMM 2013).
Mozambique
Supported by the World Bank, the Government of Mozambique is implementing the Integrated
Growth Poles Project (Project), as part of its strategy for inclusive and broad-based growth. One
of the two project areas is Nacala Corridor, which is experiencing rapid growth fuelled largely
by mining (mainly coal) operations in Tete province. Initial focus on the Nacala growth pole will
involve support for the Nacala Special Economic Zone (SEZ) (US$ 43 million). Activities are
focused on upgrading infrastructure (water supply system and an access road); and supporting
privately-executed public investments to increase smallholder production, link smallholder
farms to emerging supply chains, and increase agro-processing activities. The latter will draw on
an Innovation and Demonstration Catalytic Fund (IDCF) (Government of Mozambique 2013).
South Africa
The Richards Bay industrial cluster is a further example. The industrial hub started with the
development of the Richards Bay Harbour and Coal Rail Line in the 1960s. South African
government policies and incentives were designed to establish industrial development nodes
outside the Johannesburg area. This led to the Industrial Development Corporation and Rio
Tinto establishing Richards Bay Minerals to exploit and process the nearby heavy mineral
deposits, which in turn triggered the development of Richards Bay into a heavy industrial
cluster. A suitable base in terms of infrastructure, logistics, power supply and skills was
available to support the development of other large-scale, capital intensive and resource-based
industries such as Billiton Hillside Aluminium, Indian Ocean Fertilisers, Mondi Kraft, Bell
Equipment. Due to the outsourcing of non-core activities and the impact of the government’s
Black-Economic Empowerment policies, a cluster of specialised SMEs is emerging in the greater
Richard’s Bay area.
Western Australian mining cluster
The mining industry is the backbone of Western Australia’s economy. According to analysis of
the largest mining companies in Western Australia, every job created in the mining and
petroleum industry creates three more in other sectors throughout Western Australia (van
Eenennaam 2011).

3.7 Timing of Domestic & Local Procurement Initiatives
A key policy question is how best to implement domestic procurement policies, taking into
consideration the timing of opportunities available in the extractive life cycle. Governments
need to make sure there is alignment of the mining project development timelines, timelines
set by local content regulations, and timelines required to build local capability.
Typically, for local businesses to be able to participate in the Construction phase, supplier
capability interventions need to start approximately three years before construction starts.
Companies can take roughly one year to identify local businesses, undertake supplier capability
gap assessments, and integrate domestic procurement commitments into tenders of larger
contractors. They can spend two years undertaking training and seeking other improvements to
meet project requirements. Therefore, the dominant practice of waiting for the Feasibility and
Planning Phase to develop strategies for supplier and workforce development does not allow
for sufficient preparatory time. However, it is often at this stage that companies require the
large EPC/M (Engineering, Procurement, Construction/Management) contractor to consider
local content. EPC/M contractors tend to operate in a highly competitive market and unless
specifically incentivised to develop local capability, will make procurement and employment
decisions based on cost, quality and timing considerations.
-




Page 27 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




For the above reasons, domestic procurement opportunities should be identified and local
community capability assessments should be conducted at Exploration, Conceptual and Pre-
feasibility phases. At each of these phases, the requirement of companies should be to engage
communities, manage expectations, and to identify which skills and businesses should be
developed that can be applied to other sectors in the local economy if the project is not
approved.
From a government perspective, a point of leverage in influencing domestic procurement
commitments lies in the regulatory processes of providing exploration concessions (prior to the
Exploration/Identification Phase) and permitting approvals for mining projects (during the
Feasibility and Planning Phase). Through these approvals processes, governments can
incentivise mining companies to start early, involve other parties and thus contribute more
effectively to subnational development. In developing guidelines for the development of Local
Content Management Plans, governments could articulate their expectations on the level of
analysis and stakeholder dialogue.

3.8 Monitoring of domestic procurement initiatives
Monitoring is a component of domestic procurement practice currently being examined by the
World Bank, EITI and international NGOs such as Revenue Watch Institute. While there is
evidence of dialogue, this has not yet converted to implementation. There are calls for clear
targets on the basis of which mining companies make commitments, and transparent reports
on results on the basis of which interested parties could evaluate and report on the progress of
domestic procurement policies.
In reality, the goal of monitoring domestic procurement practices is plagued with obstacles,
including vagueness and lack of uniformity in definitions and targets, lack of transparency in
reporting results, lack of indicators on the true extent of local value addition, and
confidentiality issues. Much of the data on price of goods and services paid refers to a
commercial transaction and is not disclosed by firms as it affects competitiveness.
Communicating price levels encourage others to accept the market price as what is
communicated, rather than basing their prices on cost structures unique to different business
models. Local SMEs are drawn into pricing wars which they are unable to sustain.
Communicating the price can also encourage some businesses to collude to set higher market
prices, creating inflationary pressures. On the other hand, disclosure of process, by
communicating who tenders are awarded to and the criteria for selection, provides a level of
oversight without adding to the risk of market distortion.
The NGO Revenue Watch Institute has offered guidance for effective monitoring of the mining
industry, which can inform the design of monitoring frameworks for a mining company’s
domestic procurement performance. Monitoring is referred to as encompassing four broad
activities undertaken in collaboration with a range of stakeholders (Smith and Rosenblum,
2011):
      •    Reviewing laws and contracts to understand a mining company’s obligations.
      •    Monitoring companies’ activities to determine compliance with those obligations.
      •    Communicating information to address any areas of non-compliance.
      •    Enforcing laws and contracts when companies fail to comply.

A range of mechanisms is available to enable monitoring of domestic procurement (Smith and
Rosenblum, 2011):
      •    Government accountability for monitoring company obligations in legal frameworks.
           Wherever a company’s obligations are defined, whether in legislation, regulations or
           company-specific contracts, it can be specified which government ministries will be
           responsible for ensuring compliance with specific obligations.
      •    Clearly defined legal obligations of companies. Objective local requirements are easier for
-




Page 28 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




           government and civil society to monitor and enforce. This involves clear and unambiguous
           definitions for domestic procurement and performance measures.
      •    Uniform frameworks for all mining projects. Monitoring efforts are simplified by establishing
           a company’s obligations in law, rather than in individually negotiated contracts. Where this
           is not possible, model contracts with a set of common requirements for domestic
           procurement development present another option for uniformity.
      •    Requirements for companies to self-report. KPIs can be updated with the life of the domestic
           procurement development strategy, i.e. on average every three years. This is to reflect the
           changing business drivers over the life of the mining project, and the changing community
           context. Reports can be transparent and auditable by independent third parties prior to
           submission to government and open to requests for additional detail. Reports can also be
           regular and timely and based on internationally accepted reporting standards. For example,
           initiatives such as the EITI require public disclosure of revenue information and flows from
           mining to governments. EITI is currently considering including domestic procurement as part
           of a voluntary agenda.
      •    Government oversight institutions. Parliaments and the judiciary can assist in enforcing
           domestic procurement obligations in situations of noncompliance. For these mechanisms
           to be effective, adequate training of government personnel is required.
      •    Community monitoring. This can take the form of corporate –community partnerships that
           identify areas of concern to the community related to domestic procurement and jointly
           monitor the company’s efforts to address those concerns; government-trained community
           monitors; and independent monitoring by communities who report their findings to the
           company or government to address instances of non-compliance.
      •    Civil society monitoring and advocacy. CSOs play a role in monitoring government and
           company strategies and plans related to local content. In instances of non-compliance with
           legislated local content commitments, anti-corruption laws or human rights violations, CSOs
           can use the media to leverage public opinion and company concerns with reputation; raise
           concerns directly with the mining company through company grievance mechanisms;
           influence government agencies and mining home countries responsible for enforcing the
           companies’ obligations to conduct independent investigations and sanction as appropriate.

    The economies of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan differ widely in size, structure and level
    of development. Kazakhstan is a dominant economic player in the region, with market size of
    almost 30 times the markets of Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan3. A large producer of oil and gas,
    Kazakhstan has been successful in attracting foreign direct investment and stimulating
    manufacturing.

    the Soviet era. Many patterns of mining, processing, shipping, and trade that were in effect
    during that period continue and influence current conditions. All three countries are highly
    depended on the production and export of commodities.
    The mining sector is larger and more developed in Kazakhstan as the country is a one of the
    world’s leading producers of several mineral commodities. The linkages of Kazakh mining sector
    and the rest of the economy are better developed then in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
    Government policy has a strong focus on the development of industrial linkages through
    promotion of local content and supplier development.
    In Kyrgyzstan, there is only one large mining enterprise, Canadian operated Kumtor gold mine.
    However, due to its prominent role in the economy of Kyrgyzstan there is a growing
    appreciation of the benefits that mining production linkages might create for the economy.
    There is also an understanding of technological complexity of modern mining operations and
    the related issues of supplies and domestic procurement development. However, this

understanding is yet to be translated into policy in the context of building an industrial base
that can service the demand of the mining sector.
The mining industry in Tajikistan is nascent, with only a few small-scale and artisanal mining
projects which maintain a low profile due to overly complex regulations and public concern
about corruption. Recently, the government has placed effort into attracting investment in the
development of large-scale mining projects, such as the Konimansur silver deposit. At present,
there appears to be little focus on production linkages and local content in mining projects.
Moreover, due to the absence of large modern mining operations in the country there is little
understanding of the complexity and quality of supplies that are required by such operations. A
vision for mining sector linkages is yet to develop both within government and the private
sector.
The mining of mineral commodities is important and makes significant contributions to GDP
and export revenues of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan as well as in other countries of
the Former Soviet Union (FSU). The FSU countries led by Russia and Kazakhstan are major
international suppliers of raw and processed minerals. The region produces mineral
commodities mainly for export, and the output of mineral commodities is significantly
influenced by economic conditions in the rest of the world. China and the European Union (EU)
are particularly significant target markets (United States Geological Survey (USGS) 2012).
Kazakhstan is a leading supplier to Europe and Central Eurasia of uranium (36% of the world
production); the third ranked producer of chromium (13%); and the fourth ranked producer of
titanium sponge (17%), rhenium (6%), and magnesium metal (3%). It is also a significant
producer of other mineral products including barite, cadmium, copper, ferroalloys, lead,
petroleum, and zinc (USGS 2011). Kyrgyzstan is a significant producer of gold, antimony metal,
mercury ore and metal and uranium amongst countries in the region (USGS 2011). Tajikistan is
a significant producer of antimony ore (USGS 2011). Both countries produce a range of other
mineral commodities as details below in Table 4.
There is a counter-intuitive trend occurring in coal production in the region. While all countries
in the EU have reduced their combined coal production, the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) countries increased their coal production by 14.7% (USGS 2011). Moreover,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan made concerted efforts to switch their energy-intensive enterprises
to coal from natural gas, in part because natural gas is more costly and entails regular conflicts
with gas producer Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia.

4.1.1 Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan’s mining industry accounts for approximately 27% of the Kazakhstan’s GDP.
Kazakhstan ranked second only to Russia among the countries of the FSU in the quantity of its
mineral production. The country is the leading uranium producer in the world (36% of world
output), and its production volume amounted to 22,939 t (U3O8 content). As of 2011,
Kazakhstan had 629,000 t of known recoverable resources of uranium, or 12% of the world
resources and the second largest supply of uranium resources after Australia.The reserves of
the country are rated fourth in the world in copper, sixth in zinc, seventh in cobalt and
cadmium, eighth in gold and manganese ore in gross weight (USGS 2011).
In 2012, subsoil users comprised 215 mining enterprises (Ministry of Industry and New
Technologies (MINT) 2012).
Mining Sector Contribution in the National Economy
The mining sector of Kazakhstan is oriented towards exports of raw materials and primary
metals. The value added by mining and quarrying made up 18.2% of the GDP. Total industrial
production was valued at USD$109 billion, of which USD$ 68.8 billion (63%) was from mining
and USD$ 13.2 billion (12%) was from metallurgy (including USD$ 5.4 billion from ferrous
metallurgy). Mineral commodity (including hydrocarbons) exports made up 91% of the value of
Kazakhstan’s total exports. Mineral products accounted for USD$ 68.3 billion (78%) of total
exports, to which metals and metal products contributed USD$ 11.6 billion (13%) (Kazakhstan
Agency of Statistics 2012).

Local Content contribution
The total value of the procurement of all goods, works and services by mining companies (215
companies) was 766.2 billion tenge (US$ 5 billion) (MINT 2012). The local content or local
purchasing component of this expenditure for goods was 57.6 billion tenge (US$ 376 million)
being nearly 14% of the total spend on goods (416 billion tenge, US$ 2.7 billion). On works and
services the local content component was 303 billion tenge (USD$ 1.98 billion) being 86.6% of
the total expenditure of 350 billion tenge (US$ 2.29 billion).
Sector Development Challenges
One of the key problems in the sector is a low reserve replacement rate compared with the
mineral reserves depletion rate (Government of Kazakhstan 2010). The reserve replacement
rates are a particular concern for priority metals such as gold, copper, lead and zinc.
Kazakhstan ores are generally of a lower quality than that of the other major producers. As a
result of these low quality reserves only 35% of the explored reserves are being exploited. To
address this, the government has set as priorities for the sector to develop or acquire
technologies for the reprocessing of mineral resources and anthropogenic mineral formations.
Other issues facing the development of the sector, as identified by the government, include:
          Lack of geological infrastructure, including specialised service organisations in research,
           design, engineering, airborne geophysical, geochemical, core storage and other;
          Lack of quality analytical geological information. A large amount of geological reports
           remain classified and are closed to public access;
          Shortage of qualified mining sector professionals; and
          Lack of technical standards for exploration, and scientific and applied research.
Major players
The Government holds a stake in all significant and strategic mining projects. Its shareholding in
particular enterprises is usually held by the Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk Kazyna and its
mining subsidiary Tau Ken Samruk. Some of these investments are included below together
with other major companies operating in the sector.
Kazakhmys is a UK-registered copper mining company whose main assets are located in
Kazakhstan. It’s headquartered in London, United Kingdom but its main subsidiary, Kazakhmys
Corporation, is located in the city of Karaganda, Kazakhstan. Kazakhmys is the largest copper
producer in Kazakhstan and one of the world’s largest. It had a market capitalisation of US$ 6.6
billion as at 31 December 2012. Kazakhmys listed in London in October 2005 and their shares
can be traded in London, Hong Kong and Almaty. The holding company has a market value of
US$ 1,546 million as at 31 December 2012 and contributed US$ 548 million to the Group’s
EBITDA. Kazakhmys has two significant shareholders, Mr Vladimir Kim, the Chairman, holds
28%, and the Government of Kazakhstan holds 26%.
Kazakhmys is the dominant producer of copper ore and metals in Kazakhstan. The company
operates 17 mines, 10 concentrating plants, and two smelting and refinery plants. In 2011,
303,000 t of copper contained in concentrate and 301,000 t of refined copper cathodes were
produced, which respectively accounted for about 73% of the copper in concentrate and 89% of
the refined copper produced in Kazakhstan. The average copper grade of crude ore produced
by Kazakhmys decreased to 1.01% from 1.09% in 2010, resulting in a 6% decrease in the copper
content of ore production, despite a 1.5% increase in crude ore production. One of the new
projects under development is Bozshakol Mine. Production at Bozshakol is planned for 2015,
and the project is expected to produce 100,000 t/yr of copper in concentrate through 2030.
ENRC, a UK-listed Kazakhstan focused integrated mining group with interests and operations in
China, Russia, Brazil and Africa. The company has over 70,000 employees, of which 65,000 are
located in Kazakhstan, and annual revenue of US$ 7.7 billion in 2011. The company is the

CIS. The company was founded in 1960 and is based in Temirtau, Kazakhstan. JSC ArcelorMittal
Temirtau operates as a subsidiary of Luxembourg based Arcelor Mittal.
Kazatomprom. Within the past 8 years, Kazakhstan rapidly increased investment in its uranium
industry, and the country’s production of uranium oxide increased from 3,300 t in 2003 to
22,939 t in 2011. Foreign direct investment made up about 66% of uranium mining investment
in 2011 and was accomplished mainly through establishment of joint ventures with the state-
owned company Kazatomprom JSC. Kazatomprom is a state-owned company in Kazakhstan,
which operates in the field of uranium and nuclear fuel cycle services, production of beryllium,
tantalum and niobium, and power production. Kazatomprom was founded in 1997 and is

          Taraz Metallurgical Integrated Plant; and
          KSPSteel.


4.1.2 Kyrgyzstan
During the Soviet period, Kyrgyzstan’s mining industry was based on mining of antimony,
mercury, rare-earth elements and uranium. The country was a main producer of mined
mercury and of mercury and antimony metal in the Soviet Union. During 20 years of the
country’s independence, Kumtor mine was the only successful mining project developed.
Several gold/copper deposits are in an advanced stage of pre-development: Andahs,
Bozymchak, Ishtamberdy, Kumbel, Karakazyk and Jamgyr. Little exploration work has been
carried out and there have not been any new significant discoveries (Sariev 2012).
Gold mining industry. Registered gold reserves as of November 1, 2012 included 60 gold
deposits amounting to 448 tons, including 443 tons for 36 primary deposits, and 5 tons for 24
alluvial gold deposits. Despite the vast amount of proven and confirmed reserves of precious
metals and minerals, the country currently only has two gold mining companies operating in
the country, Kumtor and Makmal (respectively, 15-18 tons per year and 0.2-0.5 tons per year).
-




Page 35 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




There are also small gold mines that are operational: Jamgyr, Tereksai, Solton-Sary and
Ishtamberdy (Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources 2013).
Non-ferrous metals. The raw materials base of the industry includes mercury and
comprehensive mercury-antimony-fluorite ore deposits of Khaidarkan and Novoye, which are
developed by the Khaidarkan Mercury Plant. Explored reserves of antimony, in antimony and
complex ores of the Kadamjai, Terek, Khaidarkan, Novoye, Kassan, Severnyi Aktash, and Abshir
deposits, collectively total 265 thousand tons. Explored reserves of uranium have been
exhausted and in the past 30 years, the Kara Balta Mining Plant has been processing raw
materials imported from Kazakhstan. The plant does not have its own raw materials base and
its future depends on the ability to secure imports of uranium. Large reserves of tin and
tungsten are concentrated in the Trudovoye, Uchkoshkon and Kensu deposits and collectively
amount to 208 thousand tons of tin and 125 thousand tons of tungsten. A development plan is
under preparations for the Trudovoye deposit, with possible production to start no earlier than
2013 (Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources 2013).
Mining Sector Contribution in the National Economy
Mineral commodities are the backbone of the industrial production of the country, accounting
for 58% of industrial production in 2011. The mining industry contributed 14 % of GDP and 15 %
of tax and customs revenues in 2011. Production of mining and metallurgical industries
comprised more than 50 % of export revenues. The mining industry employs more than 15,000
people, with average monthly wage about four times higher than the average wage in the
country.

Social contributions

In addition to taxes and payments under the tax legislation, the subsoil legislation includes a
‘social package’ requirement. The social package is a set of measures implemented by the
subsoil user's investment aimed at developing the local community, and addressing the most
pressing issues of local importance. Criteria for investment include (Sariev, 2012):
          Education of the local population in various technical specialties;
          Employment of local population; and
          Development of rural infrastructure.
Mining sector challenges and priorities
The Government’s priority, as evident in the National Development strategy 2013-2017, is to
increase revenue and economic benefits from mining through:
          Production diversification and integration into the world economy;
          An improved investment climate;
          Introduction of new and green technologies; and
          Better balance of interests of mining companies, the government and communities.
One of the policy measures is the development of a medium-term strategy for development of
the mining industry for 2013-2015. The Ministry of Economy is responsible for the strategy, and
is supported by the USAID project REFORMA, Deloitte consultants and the Kyrgyz Mining
Association.

 56 companies were involved in the EITI in 2011; their industrial output accounted for 96.5 % of all the
country’s mining sector output.

The government has also included a number of mining projects as priority investments in the
National Development Strategy 2013-17. The sources of funding of such investments and the
mechanisms for their implementation are unclear. The government holds a stake in a number
of the projects listed below through the state–owned enterprise KyrgyzAltyn. Private
companies hold licenses for the majority of these deposits.

Major Players
Some large companies are partially owned by the state represented by a state owned
enterprise Kyrgyzaltyn (for example 33% in Centerra Gold - Kumtor; 40% in Altynken; and 40%
in Jerooialtyn). Kyrgyzaltyn operates another mining operator in Kyrgyzstan, the Makmal Mine.
The largest of the operating mines is the Kumtor gold mine, which is located about 350
kilometres southeast of Bishkek. The Kumtor Mine is operated by Centerra Gold Inc. of Canada.
In 2011, Centerra produced 6.02 Mt of gold ore and extracted 18.1 t of gold content. Kumtor
contributed 11.7% to the GDP of Kyrgyzstan and 26.1% to the total industrial production of the
country (Kumtor, 2012).

The companies that are conducting pre-development works include Kazakhmys (Bozymchak
deposit), Full Gold Mining (Ishtamberdy deposit), Robust Resources 5(Andash deposit), and Zi
Jin (Taldy-Bulak Levoberezhnyi deposit). Moreover, there are many Chinese companies working
at small gold deposits.
The largest companies involved in exploration are Manas Resources (Shambesai deposit),
Kentor Gold (Bashkol deposit), Highland Exploration (Kyzyl-Unkur deposit), Gold Fields (Taldy-
Bulak deposit), Stans Energy (Kutesai deposit), and Chaarat Gold.
In processing and refining, only the Kara-Balta mining plant is currently operating. It is owned
by Kyrgyzaltyn and refines Kumtor gold.


4.1.3 Tajikistan
Established during the Soviet era, the mining industry of Tajikistan served as a source of raw
materials for the processing industry in other regions of the Soviet Union. Tajikistan’s mineral
industry had been mining mineral ores and producing mineral products, which included
aluminium, antimony, arsenic, boron, celestite, cement, coal, construction materials, fluorspar,
gold, lead and zinc, mercury, molybdenum, natural gas, petroleum, salt, semiprecious and
decorative stones, silver, strontium, tin, tungsten, and uranium (USGS 2011). In many cases,
Tajik mining companies produced ore concentrates, which were sent for further processing to
other parts of the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the producing Tajik
mining industry lost their market. Some mines have ceased to exist and others considerably
reduced their production or shifted to other production.
The Tajikistan Aluminium Co. (TALCO) smelter (formerly the Tajikistan Aluminium Smelter
(TadAZ)) is the country’s only large-scale production enterprise in the mineral sector. Tajikistan
relies heavily on the smelter's earnings. The aluminium plant was launched in 1975. It is one of
the ten largest aluminium smelters in the world and provides up to 70% of the country’s foreign
currency earnings, consuming 40% of the country’s electrical power. Tajikistan does not mine
alumina but imports the raw material through tolling arrangements.6
Tajikistan has significant mineral resources, which include a large number of rare metals, rare-
earth elements and uranium, which have potential for future development. Currently, there are
more than 600 explored deposits and over 800 occurrences with demonstrated potential for
further development. The country has not engaged in the development of these resources as it
lacks access to international capital markets and relies almost exclusively on concessional
financial assistance from international financial institutions and bilateral donors.
Recently, the Government of Tajikistan has been actively seeking to reform its mining sector.
The most crucial step was undertaken when the Government decided to put the Konimansur
silver deposit out for tender with the IFC as its transaction advisor. Located in the north of
Tajikistan close to the border with Uzbekistan, the deposit is one of the largest in the world.
Various estimates put the size of the deposits at around 50,000 tons, and the total investment
required to develop them will likely be more than US $2 billion (World Bank 2012). The
Konimansur silver deposits are of high grade and include significant quantities of zinc and lead
ores.
Mining Sector Contribution in the National Economy
The country’s economy depends heavily on the production of aluminium and cotton, and
exports of these commodities. Exports of aluminium provide over 50% of the country’s export
revenue.


5
  Australian Kentor Gold sold Andash mining to Robust Resources in May 2013 as the company was
unable to start the development of the deposit due to a local community conflict.

Potential sector revenues remain lost to the central government, as they lack capacity to collect
taxes and enforce mining sector legislation that is currently in place. Tajikistan is not well
poised to take advantage of the global mining investment boom without a significant
transformation of the operation of its mining sector (World Bank 2012).
Sector Development Challenges
According to the State Committee for Investment and State Property Management,
GosKomInvest (Saidov 2011), the mining sector faces the following key challenges:
          Complex structure of sector administration, poor allocation of power among
           government bodies;
          Imperfect laws and lack of clear and transparent procedures for the acquisition of
           mineral resource rights;
          Ineffective laws associated with investment protection and volatility of mining
           legislation;
          Lack of a well-defined concept and comprehensive program for the industry’s
           development;
          Lack of qualified mining specialists and managers; and
          Inadequate infrastructure and power supply.

Major Players7
Tajik-Chinese Joint- venture Zerafshan, one of the largest companies in the industry, has an
almost complete production cycle: mining, processing and metallurgy. The main mineral base of
this enterprise is the Jilau and Taror primary gold ore deposits in Sughd region. The gold
production in 2012 was 1510 kg.8 Since 2007, the Chinese ZiJin Mining Group Co. Ltd, which has
a 75% stake in the joint venture, has invested US$ 144 million in the modernisation of the mine,
thus increasing the output capacity of this gold mining company. Part of these investments was
used to build a refinery, with first production in 2013. The design annual capacity of the refinery
is 5000 kg of gold9.
JV Aprelevka is a Tajik-British mining company, located in the north of the country, in the
village of Kansai, in the Sughd region. Until 1985, the mine produced lead and zinc ores and in
1985, Kairakkum gold mine was constructed on the basis of gold deposits, which served as the
base for creation of Aprelevka JV in 1996. Reconstruction of the gold processing plant started in
2001 and the first gold bar was produced in September 2002. The ore is mined by the open pit
method. To date, the company has obtained more licenses for exploration in several
prospective areas. Currently, it plans to carry out additional exploration work to increase the
gold reserves at existing Aprelevka deposit.
Pakrut LLC, a mine 100% held by the British company Kryso Resources Ltd, was established in
2003 and operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 107
km from the city of Dushanbe. The geological exploration at Pakrut deposit started in 2004. The
pre-gold reserves at the deposit, approved by the State Reserves Committee (CRC) of the
Republic of Tajikistan, were 28.1 tons. Currently, the reserves of Pakrut gold mine are
estimated to be 100 tons.
The gold mining company Tilloi Tojik (Tajik Gold), located in the Khatlon region, is a state-
owned gold company. The company is located in a mountainous area of Southern Tajikistan.
The gold extracted by Tilloi Tojik is mainly used to replenish country’s gold reserves.
Adrasman lead-zinc mining plant, 100% owned by Kazakh company KazInvestMineral,
specialises in the production and processing of silver-containing lead ores to produce a lead
concentrate, which is sent for processing to Shymkent Metallurgical Plant in Kazakhstan. The
plant is located in the village of Adrasman in Sughd region, 70 km away from the city of
Khujand. The resource base of the plant is the East Konimansur deposit. The facilities
constructed at the deposit are an underground mine, a concentrator plant, motorised transport
shop, electrical shop, etc.
Anzob Mine (now the Tajik-American Limited Liability Company) is located in Sughd province
on the northern slope of Gissar range in Central Tajikistan. The company specialises in
underground mining and milling producing a mercury-antimony concentrate. The antimony
grade in the concentrate is 40% to 60% and the mercury grade is up to 1%. The design
throughput capacity of the mine is 700 thousand tons of ore and more than 30 thousand tons
of mercury-antimony concentrate per year. The average actual volume of ore mining and
processing is 350 thousand tons per year. The main processor of the produced concentrate was
Kadamjai Antimony Plant located on the territory of Kyrgyzstan, but in recent years, the
products are being exported to China.

4.2 Mining Sector Investment Climate, Regulation and Institutions
This section describes the investment climate in each country with emphasis on the mining
sector. It also provides a brief analysis of laws and regulations that regulate mining investment,
such as subsoil law, concessions law, production-sharing contracts law, as well as key
government bodies and civil society organisations involved in the mining sector.
The level of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central Asia has grown rapidly in recent years. FDI
has been focused on relatively few sectors and countries due to the availability of natural
resources. Kazakhstan holds the largest stock of FDI in the Central Asian Region (including
Mongolia); in 2011, 56% of FDI inflows went into Kazakhstan, 3% to Kyrgyzstan and less than 1%
into Tajikistan (UNCTAD 2013).
Even though investment policy frameworks have partially improved, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and
Kyrgyzstan need to attract more and better FDI (OECD 2013). One of the key policy tools that
governments can use to increase the benefits of mineral commodity FDIs is to forge linkages
between foreign businesses and local companies, to maximise spill-over effects supporting
economic development. According to an OECD assessment (2013), investment promotion
agencies in Central Asia do not yet use such linkage programmes to actively attract foreign
investors while also supporting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.

4.2.1 Kazakhstan
Investment Climate
The global economic and financial crisis highlighted Kazakhstan’s dependence on primary
industries and commodity exports, and the need to diversify the economy towards value-added
industries. This is demonstrated by declining trends in FDI during 2008-2010, shown in Figure
11.

Regional economic integration has been enabled by the establishment of a customs union
between Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus in 2010. The next stage of economic integration was
initiated in 2012, to create a common economic space within the Eurasian Economic
Community. The Eurasian Economic Commission, the supranational body of the community, is
expected to gradually take over a number of responsibilities from the national authorities in
areas such as competition policy, technical regulations and environmental standards.
Bilateral World Trade Organization (WTO) accession talks are still continuing and expected to
be finalised by the end of 2013. One of the remaining discussions focuses on local content
requirements in the mining and hydrocarbon industry. WTO rules limit member countries’
policy discretion to impose performance requirements. The WTO Agreement on Trade-Related
Investment Measures (TRIMS) specifically prohibits the application the imposition of
quantitative local content restrictions.
Kazakhstan’s legal environment with respect to investments continues to remain complex and
challenging despite reforms to its legal system. Over the last few years there have been
significant improvements in crucial areas such as securities legislation, concessions, derivative
transactions, competition, insolvency and anti-money laundering legislation. Notwithstanding
such improvements, Kazakh commercial laws still fall short in certain respects of standards that
are generally acceptable internationally. In company law, the major shortcomings are found in
the legislation on ‘disclosure and transparency’ and on ‘ensuring the basis for an effective
corporate governance framework.
In terms of access to finance, 31% of firms identified this issue as a major constraint to growth
(Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) 2009). Nonperforming loans
(NPLs) remain high, at 37% of total loans as of the end of 2012 compared to 35% at the end of
2011 (EBRD 2010).
Subsoil Legislation
The main piece of legislation governing the mining sector is the 2010 law On Subsoil Assets and
Their Use. This law, which replaced a 1995 version, brought major changes to the legislative
environment for the mining sector, and increased the government’s control over the sector.
Notable changes compared with the previous legislation included the abolition of single
contracts for exploration and development of a mineral resource. The subsoil law also grants
the government the right to unilaterally abrogate contracts if it deems it to be in the national
interest, and gives local authorities powers to terminate contracts if a company is found to be
violating contractual provisions.
One of the most important aspects of the legislation governing subsoil use is that all companies
in the natural resource sector are being required to meet stringent conditions relating to their
use of local (Kazakh) content – goods, services and labour. These requirements were set out in
a 2009 document (Concept Paper on Further Development of Local Content) and were further
enhanced in the 2010 subsoil law. The latter grants the government greater powers to decide
how local content requirements for each contract be calculated, as part of efforts to promote
the use of Kazakhstani goods and services and help to diversify the economy. In addition,
companies are now required to follow strict procurement rules when purchasing goods,
services and labour.
Even though most extractives companies have clauses in their agreements specifying that their
contracts are protected in the event of legislative changes, the subsoil law contains an article
that requires all companies – including those with such stability clauses - to adhere by the local
content regulations. This has meant that most companies have had to incorporate new local
content requirements into their contracts.
The government has set ambitious targets for the next few years relating to use of local
content. In the Local Content Program for 2010-2014 (Government of Kazakhstan 2010), the
2014 subsoils (oil and gas and mining) target is to achieve 16% local content in goods and 85%
in works and services. According to the Ministry for Innovation and Trade’s (MINT) Local
-




Page 44 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




Content 2012 report, the actual total procurement of goods, works and services by subsoil
mining companies (215 companies) amounted to 766.2 billion tenge (US$ 5 billion). Of this,
purchasers from domestic producers amounted to 360.7 billion tenge (US$ 2.35 billion)
(47.1%). In particular, the purchase of goods amounted to 416.3 billion tenge (US$ 2.7
billion)(proportion of local content was 13.8%, or 57.6 billion tenge); and of works and services
amounted to 350 billion tenge (US$ 2.28 billion)(share of local content was 86.6%, or 303
billion tenge (US$ 1.98 billion)).
The Kazakh authorities regularly warn that extractives companies are falling short of their
obligations in this respect, and impose penalties ranging from fines to removal of licences.
Companies face a number of difficulties in ensuring that they meet their local content
requirements. These include the substandard quality – or, simply, lack of availability – of Kazakh
goods, owing to the underdeveloped manufacturing base, and the absence of the necessary
technical and managerial skills in the local workforce.
Regulations are also being tightened in the environmental sphere, amid growing concern over
the mining sector’s environmental record. The most recent legislation was approved in October
2011, and provides for mining companies to be fined if they fail to implement a waste-use
programme (which must itself be approved by the government) and, in the event of a second
violation, to have their facilities closed. Mining companies engaged in extraction work that
involves tailings are particularly affected. The government also has the right to revoke a
company’s permit for waste emissions, in effect preventing them from operating.
Concessions. Kazakhstan has adopted a policy of promoting public-private partnerships (PPP),
and as a result it has undertaken efforts to reform concession enabling legislation, in particular,
the amendments in 2008 to the 2006 Concessions Law No. 167-III. In addition, a National PPP
Unit was set up in 2008 under the Ministry of Economy to improve the PPP institutional
framework. The current Kazakhstan Concession Law enables the implementation of concessions
in infrastructure including those based on open tendering. The July 2008 amendments to the
Concession Law addressed a number of major flaws, relating to definitions, model contract
provisions, register of concessions, deadline period to conclude concession contract, and limits
to state guarantees. Overall, the amended Concession Law is now seen as adequate; however,
the law still falls short in certain aspects of internationally acceptable standards (EBRD 2010).
Corporate governance. The principal legislation governing corporate governance in Kazakhstan
is the Law on Joint Stock Companies (JSC Law), dated 13 May 2003 as amended. The EBRD’s
2007 Corporate Governance Sector Assessment assessed the quality of corporate governance
legislation in force in November 2007, and Kazakhstan was found to be in “medium
compliance” with the relevant international standards (OECD Principles of Corporate
Governance) (EBRD 2010).
Public Procurement. Public procurement law in Kazakhstan is regulated by the Law on Public
Procurement enacted on 29 December 2009. In the EBRD 2010 assessment, the law scored
“low to medium compliance”. However, Kazakhstan, based on the 1994 UNCITRAL Model Law,
scored very high in the competition indicators (90% compliance rate), with “average medium”
compliance with international public procurement standards (69% compliance rate). Local
public procurement policy focused on adopting transparency safeguards and providing
enforcement, although it is less comprehensive when it comes to accountability, efficiency, and
economy instruments (EBRD 2010)
Institutions
Kazakh government regulates the mining sector at three levels: by central government bodies,
at the local level (within a centrally established regulatory framework), and through ownership
of government stakes in mining projects (Kazakhstan Association of Mining and Metallurgical
Enterprises 2012). These are listed in Tables 7-9 below.

4.2.2 Kyrgyzstan
During the last few years, the government has made a number of efforts to improve
Kyrgyzstan’s investment climate. The Investment Council was established in early 2007 and has
been providing local and international business representatives (representing the mining,
industry, agro-processing and tourism sectors) with a forum to discuss the main barriers to
doing business with top officials in the government.
Fig 12. Kyrgyzstan’s FDI inflows, 2000-2012 (US$ million) (UNCTAD 2013)




According to the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2013-17, the major focus of public
authorities will be to create in Kyrgyzstan an environment that is attractive for domestic and
foreign investors. Special attention will be paid to development of mining, energy, tourism,
agriculture, transport, financial sector, as well as to ventures that are based on new and
environmentally-friendly technologies.
In many legal areas, written laws have reached medium compliance with international
standards of best practice (EBRD 2011). However, implementation of laws remains highly
problematic and investor confidence in the judiciary to enforce laws remains weak.
Under the umbrella of its extensive reform program to streamline the investment climate and
promote entrepreneurship in the country, several laws were either adopted or amended in
recent years. Some of the most relevant legislation includes the Law on Investments (2003) and
the Law on Foreign Investments (1997). The Law on Investments applies equally to both
domestic and foreign investors and provides for guarantees against undue government
interference in investor affairs, sets out detailed anti-discrimination measures, clarifies the
guarantees against unwarranted expropriation and naturalisation, and introduces explicit
measures on the right to repatriate funds. Despite the advances, one of the biggest drawbacks
of the system is poor implementation capacity (EBRD 2011).
The 2013-17 NDS recognises the mining industry as a strategic sector of the economy and that
the government should create a favourable environment for investments into the development
of natural resources of Kyrgyzstan. In recent years, community conflicts became a prominent
issue in the country’s relations with mining investors. The government strategy to address
these conflicts amounts to awareness building: “We must ensure that the population is aware
that investors bring in significant funds and create new jobs, contribute to regional
development and higher standards of living and therefore, the attitude towards investors has
to be positive and constructive”. No other formal mechanisms to address the issue have been
developed by the government.

Subsoil Legislation
The main laws governing the use of mineral resources are the Laws ‘On Subsoil’ as of 2012; ‘On
Concessions and Concession Enterprises’ as of 1992; and ‘On Production Sharing Agreements in
Subsoil Use’ as of 2002. Additionally, the use of coal and oil and gas resources is regulated by
the Law on Coal as of 1998 and the Law on Oil and Gas as of 1999.
The legislation provides the following means of acquiring mineral rights from the state: license,
state registration, concession contract, and production sharing agreement. Licenses are the
most common instruments issued by the State Geology Agency. The legislation provides for the
three types of licenses depending on the type of work: geological exploration work;
exploration; and development. Licenses can be obtained on the basis of competitive bidding,
auction or direct negotiations. The licensee has an exclusive right to transform the license for
geological exploration in the license for exploration work, and then for the development of the
deposit (International Business Council 2012).
Legislation provides for a wide range of rights and guarantees to foreign investors, including
guarantees of export repatriation outside the Kyrgyzstan, protection from expropriation and
compensation of losses to investors, the use of income guarantees, freedom of monetary
transactions, etc.
There are no local content provisions in the Subsoil Legislation. Local content requirements may
be included in the investment, concession agreements and production sharing agreements with
operators. There are no local content provisions in existing investment or concessions
agreements. The government can also include local content clauses in competitive tenders for
large mining projects. In the case of a tender for the Jerooy gold project (the tender failed in
April 2013, the second tender is planned for later this year), requirements for local workforce as
well as investment in local social infrastructure – the ‘social package’ - were included.
Concessions law. The 1992 Law on Concessions and Foreign Concessionaire Entities in the
Kyrgyz Republic, as amended, is the main act regulating the legal framework for concessions.
The Concessions Law is, however, vague as far as the majority of the concession regime’s core
areas are concerned. Its scope of application requires significant improvement in some
fundamental areas, e.g. the definition of a concession. Moreover, the selection procedure is not
detailed. The Concessions Law states that such a procedure, as well as the list of necessary
documents to be attached to a bid, is to be defined by the Government. No such document has
been identified, nor is it clear whether such documents have general application or are
particular to each concession (International Business Council 2012).
Public procurement law. The PPL is based on the 1994 UNCITRAL model law, hence the PPL’s
basic features are sound but the regulation is only medium compliant with modern
international (EBRD 2011). Procurement procedures include open tender, restricted tender,
two-stage tender, request for quotation and direct contracting. Open tender is the default
procedure. The PPL regulates eligibility and qualification criteria for public procurement
procedures. The law determines specific deadlines for some stages in the PP procedure.
Domestic preferences may be applied to any kind of procurement contract. The contracting
entity is entitled to apply a 20% discount to the offer of any tenderer offering products of
domestic origin, or 10% for local tenderers in the procurement of works.11

4.2.3 Tajikistan
The government of Tajikistan is generally favourable to foreign investment. Nevertheless,
despite some progress in various areas of economic reform the overall business environment is
underdeveloped (UNDP 2012). Two of the biggest impediments for investors are a weak
judiciary and widespread corruption (EBRD 2012). Mining investment procedures are
cumbersome and complicated, and in need of streamlining according to international best
practice.




Fig 13. Tajikistan’s FDI inflows, 2000-2012 (US$ million) (UNCTAD 2013)
In the World Bank Doing Business (2011) Report, Tajikistan gained 10 places from 149th in 2010
to 139th in 2011, placing it among the top 10 most improved countries. This improved score
was mainly due to changes in legislation, simplified procedures to start up a business, simplified
operation requirements and greater investor protection. Implementation remains weak. Areas
where Tajikistan continues to score poorly include paying taxes (reflecting overly complex tax
laws and a weak tax administration), trading across borders, construction permits and access to
finance. Overall, the business environment remains difficult with excessive state intervention in
the corporate and banking sectors, lack of competition and many formal and informal
administrative barriers.
The implementation of commercial laws by the courts in Tajikistan remains fraught with
uncertainties and inefficiencies. This reality deters investors from participating in this kind of
market. The EBRD Judicial Decisions Assessment (2012) found the quality and predictability of
commercial law decisions in Tajikistan to be well below the regional average, substantially
behind Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.
Subsoil Legislation
The principal pieces of legislation governing subsoil use relations in Tajikistan are the Law ‘On
Subsoil’ dated 20 July 1994 (the Subsoil Law) and the Law ‘On Production Sharing Agreements’
dated 5 March 2007 (the PSA Law). The Subsoil Law establishes a general legal framework for
the use of subsoil resources in Tajikistan, while the PSA Law provides the legal framework for
entering into a subsoil use contract with the state (UNDP 2012).
Under the Subsoil Law, the exercise of the right to use subsoil is governed by licensing agencies.
Subsoil use licenses are issued on behalf of the Government of Tajikistan by the Ministry of
Energy and Industry or the Main Geology Administration under the government. Subsoil use
licenses, amongst others, include geologic survey and exploration licenses and
production/mining licenses.
-




Page 50 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




The PSA Law provides an alternative way of structuring mining (including oil and gas) activities
in Tajikistan on the basis of agreed contractual terms. Subsoil users operating under PSAs are
taxed based on preferential tax regimes of Chapter 48 of Tax Code effective from January 1
2013. Two types of preferential tax regimes are applicable to investors depending on the
production sharing terms of PSA, but under both regimes investors are exempt from profit tax
(UNDP 2012).
The government also plans to adopt the law of Tajikistan ‘On Investment Agreements’ to allow
the investors the choice of the scheme of subsoil use in Tajikistan. After the adoption of this
law, investors will be entitled to choose the most appropriate form of cooperation with the
state, namely, on the basis of a license or a production sharing agreement or under a license
and investment agreement.
Concessions. On 26 December 2011 the President of Tajikistan signed a new Law on
Concessions. The Law provides transfer of state objects into concession without tender in
exceptional cases. The Law regulates relations between participants of the concession, defines
competence of the authorised state agency, terms and conditions of concession and transfer of
objects, rights and obligations of concessionaire and other issues related to transfer of state
object to concession. The Tajik concession law is of low compliance with international
standards. As the new Law is a relatively new piece of legislation its application in practice is yet
to be assessed (EBRD 2012).
Corporate governance. The basic legislation on corporate governance in Tajikistan is contained
in the Law on Joint Stock Companies, which entered into force on 5 March 2007. The 2007
EBRD assessment on corporate governance showed Tajikistan being in very low compliance
with the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, with a number of major shortcomings
especially with regard to ensuring the basis for an effective corporate governance framework,
disclosure and transparency, and the responsibilities of the boards (EBRD 2012).

5. Industrial and SME Development
Industrial competitiveness is the capacity of countries to increase their presence in
international and domestic markets whilst developing industrial sectors and activities with
higher value added and technology content (UNIDO 2013). As evident from UNIDO’s
Competitive Industrial Performance (CIP)12 index ranking (Japan 1st, Iraq 133rd), the industrial
performance of the three Central Asia Countries is poor, with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan at the
bottom of the list. In order to increase their industrial competitiveness, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan
and Tajikistan need selective policy interventions through which their comparative advantages
in the mineral commodes sector are exploited, while new competitive advantages through
industrial linkages are created.

With regard to the mining sector and its linkages with the industrial development, three policy
levels are relevant: macro level policies for capabilities development, infrastructure and
innovation, meso-level policies to promote industrial growth and diversification of key sectors
and of particular regions and industrial clusters, and micro-level policies to support enterprise
efficiency (Kaplinsky and Farooki, 2012).
Macro-policies support industrial development needed to address the prevalence of market
failure with regard to skills and capability building and the development of infrastructure
required by all industries. Together with the promotion of industrial growth and structural
change, this may involve direct equity holding by the state, including through joint ventures
with the private sector. Beyond direct equity holdings, the state may direct resource rents to
the industrial sector through loans, including micro-enterprise loans to SMEs which may be
viable third- and fourth-tier suppliers in commodity value chains. Mining sector rents may also
be utilized to develop state capacities to upgrade suppliers and processors of commodities, or
to provide support to linkage firms by the business services sector. Related to this is the
investment of mining rents in institutions that deal with innovation and technology, as well as
in training and education (Kaplinsky and Farooki, 2012).


12
   The CIP index now consists of eight sub-indicators grouped along three dimensions of industrial
competitiveness. The first dimension relates to countries’ capacity to produce and export manufactures
and is captured by their Manufacturing Value Added per capita (MVApc) and their Manufactured Exports
per capita (MXpc). The second dimension covers countries’ level of technological deepening and
upgrading. To proxy for this complex dimension, two composite sub-indicators – industrialisation
intensity and export quality – have been constructed. The degree of industrialisation intensity is
computed as a linear aggregation of the Medium- and High-tech manufacturing Value Added share in
total Manufacturing Value Added (MHVAsh) and the Manufacturing Value Added share in total GDP.
-




Page 53 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




Meso-level policies are aimed at structural change through industrial diversification. Of
Importance is the government capacity to identify lead sectors and to effectively direct
resource rents to promote these lead sectors.
Micro (firm level) policies target value chain and firm level efficiency and upgrading aimed at
the efficiency of all firms and value chains in the economy.
As per the World Bank study ‘Trade Expansion through Market Connection: The Central Asian
Markets of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan’ (2011), there are two types of
manufacturing      capacity constraints in the three countries: backbone services and
infrastructure i.e. expensive financial services, unreliable power supply, and limited and
expensive telecommunications services; and business environments i.e. excessive red tape,
poor public services, and excessive involvement by political elites in business thus biasing
competition.
As evident from the table below, Kazakhstan, thanks to the large size of the market, FDI and the
revenue from the oils and gas sector, has been more successful in developing its industrial
capacity through macro- , meso- and micro-level policies. Kazakhstan’s Manufacturing Value
Added 13 per capita is five times higher than Tajikistan’s and nine times higher than
Kyrgyzstan’s.

SME Development
Central Asian governments recognise the importance of SME development in their countries’
growth. However they have been constrained, as large enterprises have historically dominated
major industries like metal, oil, and gas, and SME linkages to these industries are not
developed. To assist SME growth, the countries have special programs funded by the
government or foreign donor institutions. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, for example, support
infrastructures (business incubators, techno-parks), consulting and training centres, special tax
regimes, outright financial support through loans and grants. Tajikistan is streamlining SME
policies to eliminate program duplication, and developing state policy and strategies to attract
FDI to SMEs.

   Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to ISIC divisions – all manufacturing, processing, repairs
and machinery installation activities. Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs
and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of
fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources.

Among key constraints to the growth of the SME sector are weak property rights, corruption
and weak judiciary.

Business regulations - registration, permits and licenses - also remain overly complex and time
consuming despite recent reforms to improve in all three countries. Access to infrastructure,
especially reliable electricity supply, is a major problem in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
Access to finance for SMEs in Central Asia is limited, with commercial banks and other lenders
generally viewing SMEs as high-risk borrowers. Consequently, small companies from the region
often face high interest rates and collateral requirements that they are unable to meet. Banks,
the traditional source of funding in Central Asia, are reluctant to provide loans to SMEs due to
the high perceived risk associated with SME lending. Only 20% of small firms and 27% of
medium firms in Central Asia use bank loans as a source of business financing. This reluctance
stems from the asymmetry of information, i.e. lack of relevant credit and financial information
on SMEs, and limited or lack of adequate collateral. At the same time, few financing tools exist
outside the banking sector to support SME financing (OECD 2013).
Regional integration and trade
Regional economic integration and trade can potentially play a significant role in the
development of the industrial and SME sector in the region. Regional trade might help
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan overcome such competitive disadvantages as small
domestic markets, landlocked location, low domestic economic density, and long distances to

international markets. Regional trade might also contribute to production diversification by
exposing suppliers to larger regional markets and regional competition thereby increasing
productivity. Further, the Eurasian Economic Community (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan
are members) may present an important avenue for the three countries to diversify their
economies.
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan established the Eurasian
Economic Community in 2000 with the goal of creating a common market. Within the Eurasian
Economic Community, a Customs Union agreement between Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia
went into effect on January 1, 2010. According to the agreement, the countries form a joint
customs territory where no customs duties or other economic restrictions on the movement of
goods apply. Each of the members of the Customs Union applies the same customs rates and
trade regulations for goods traded with countries outside of the Customs Union. The members
of the Customs Union were projected to save more than US$ 400 billion by 2015 owing to
reduced shipping time and costs. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan expressed their interest in joining
the Customs Union in the future. Kyrgyzstan is on the way to join the Customs Union within a
year. Starting on January 1, 2012, the Customs Union among the three countries became a
Common Economic Space (CES), which was the next step in the Eurasian integration process.
The CES agreement removed barriers to the movement of goods, capital, and labour between
the three countries. It also included coordinated principles of business regulation and
coordination of macroeconomic and monetary policies. 16
Skills and education
There is a shortage of professionals in the industrial sectors at all levels – managers, engineers,
technical specialists and skilled workers. Industrial professions have been in decline since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, due to the shrinkage of the industrial sector, underfinancing of
education, and broken relationships between educational institutions and employers. The
skilled workforce shortage is particularly acute in the Kyrgyz and Tajik industrial sector as these
two countries are major sources of labour migrants – both skilled and unskilled – for Russia and
Kazakhstan. For example, the share of Tajik labour migrant remittances is estimated at between
30 and 50% of the Tajik GDP. Skilled industrial professionals from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are
attracted by the visa free regime, better paying industrial job opportunities, as well as
prospects of career development. An older generation of highly skilled technical professional
with higher education and Soviet industrial experience is also attracted by the prospects of
retiring in Kazakhstan and Russia and receiving better retirement benefits.
Industrial and technical education is in need of reform at all levels - vocational, technical
training and higher education. The TVET system in all three countries is in particular contrast to
the rising demand for TVET services from industrial sectors, including mining. This stems from a
number of factors: excessive central control over educational curricula, low public spending per
student, and low completion rates of advanced study (OECD 2013). All these factors lead to a
misalignment between worker skills and job market requirements.

5.1 Kazakhstan
5.1.1 Industrial Development
Diversification
Oil and mining industries are the engine of Kazakhstan's growth, although the country is
actively pursuing diversification. The dependence on these extractive sectors meat that the
global financial crisis and subsequent fall of oil and commodity prices in 2008 led to a recession.
A recent recovery, with GDP increasing 7.5% year-on-year in 2011, and 5.0% in 2012 has been
assisted by rising commodity prices.
The government’s diversification program is aimed at developing targeted sectors such as
transport, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, petrochemicals and food processing.
Local content regulations are aimed in large part at supporting diversification of the economy
and thereby reducing dependence on the extractives sector. This is being currently
implemented through the 2010-14 National Programme of Accelerated Industrial and
Innovative Development, and the 2013-2020 Kazakhstan Innovative Development Concept.
Mining companies are encouraged to support the diversification drive through downstream
activities, specifically by building processing plants so as to increase the export value of
minerals and develop the country’s metallurgy sector.
Special Economic Zones
Kazakhstan has set up a number of special economic zones (SEZs) offering a range of incentives
to attract investment, encourage export-oriented manufacturing, implement new technologies,
and enhance management approaches. The SEZs are focused on sectors: Astana-New City
(construction); Sea Port Aktau (logistics and transport); Innovation Technology Park (IT
industry); Ontustik (textiles); National Industrial Petrochemical Technopark (oil and gas
engineering, petrochemicals); Burabay (tourism); Khorgos – Eastern Gates (trade and logistics).
One interviewee in this study from the mining industry expressed the view that the
expectations of the SEZs have not been met, partly due to the limitations on their activities and
the weakness of management models. The opinion was that rather than being focused on
singular sectors, the aim should be to develop the region in which the SEZ is located.
Innovation
Fostering innovation was at the centre of a speech by President Nursultan Nazarbayev at the
26th Plenary Session of the Foreign Investors' Council, 22 May 2013. The following priorities
were stated:
      •    Integrating ‘green economy’ concepts to industrial development, using EXPO 2017 in Astana
           as a key catalyst for technology transfer to the rest of Kazakhstan.
      •    Improving the education system to produce more engineering and technical specialists that
           meet the needs of business, by creating applied research divisions in the universities and at
           the same time encouraging development of non-applied sciences.
      •    Encouraging foreign investors to create corporate scientific centres in Kazakhstan, and
           developing innovation clusters in the areas of geology, medicine, 3D printing, metallurgy,
           energy saving and construction technologies, and composite materials.
      •    Expanding the triple helix model of Business, Science and the State being applied at the
           Nazarbayev University, which includes funding collaborative research, and establishing
           business incubators, commercialisation offices and experimental workshops.
      •    Establishment of an award for break-through scientific research and innovations that are
           commercialised by foreign investors and local companies within Kazakhstan.
      •    Calls to foreign investors to follow the example of oil company Shell, specifically their
           coordination of the Oil and Gas Industry R&D Roadmap to 2025. Responsibility for
           implementing the roadmap lies with the Government, Samruk-Kazyna Fund and KazEnergy
-

           Association.
      •    Simplification of regulations related to innovative activities, including strengthening the
           regulatory basis for an efficient system of intellectual property protection.
      •    Addressing non-compliance of Kazakh technical and construction standards against
           international standards, by preparing an inventory of all local standards and 2013-1015 plan
           for their alignment with international best practice.
      •    Establishment of financial instruments for risk financing.
      •    Establishment of a new institution called the Innovations Venture Fund, funded by subsoil
           users as part of the mandated 1% of profits for research and R&D, and encouragement of
           active participation of foreign partners in the Board of Trustees

WTO and Customs Union
In 2010 Kazakhstan joined the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia Customs Union in an effort to boost
foreign investment and improve trade relationships and is planning to accede to the World
Trade Organization in towards the end of 2013.
Kazakhstan's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will require a decrease of the
Common Customs Duty of the Customs Union. In line with Kazakhstan’s zero customs duty
obligations under WTO, the adjustment will be proportional to the position of Kazakhstan's
economy in the overall economy of the Customs Union.
Technical and Vocational Education
While the economy has been growing, the country’s TVET system has not been sufficiently
flexible to adapt to the growing demand for qualified expert staff. The obstacles that
Kazakhstan faces in establishing a well-functioning TVET system are similar to those of other
former Soviet countries. Many years of under-investment have resulted in outdated curricula,
materials and infrastructure. Centralised state control and weak links between general and
vocational education have exacerbated these problems. The core problem within TVET is that
most of the qualifications being offered are not relevant to the job market.
Recently, however, the government has made the modernisation of its educational system a
national priority. In 2010, it launched two programmes to promote education and economic
development: the State Program of Education Development in Kazakhstan for 2011 – 2020, and
the 2010-2014 State Program of Accelerated and Innovative Development of the Republic of
Kazakhstan.


5.1.2 SME Development
In 2010, SMEs contribute 93% of all enterprises; 26% of the workforce and 29% of GDP (DAMU
2013). More than 80% of SMEs operate in Retail & Wholesale, Services and Agriculture,
demonstrating the limited diversification. Mining and Fuels, which are usually produced by
large companies, make up more than 80% of Kazakh merchandise exports, and their share has
been growing in the recent years. For comparison, in other transition countries Mining and
Fuels make up around 20% of exports (EBRD 2009).
According the World Bank/IFC’s most recent Enterprise Survey, business practices of SMEs in
Kazakhstan follow the characteristics identified in Table 14.

The four main obstacles to business cited by entrepreneurs in the latest Business Environment
and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) (joint initiative of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank) (2009) were: high taxes, access
to finance, an inadequately educated work force, and corruption. The sources of finance are
concentrated in Almaty and Astana, and most banks and their branch networks remain focused
on catering to SMEs in the two main cities.
In Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (2012), Kazakhstan ranks 133 out
of 176 countries. Notwithstanding the low performance, the ranking has improved over time
and Kazakhstan became an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidate country
in 2010.
The World Economic Forum’s 2012-2013 Global Competitiveness Index indicates that
Kazakhstan’s position has improved remarkably, to a ranking of 51 out of 144 countries, from
72 out of 138 countries in the previous year. However, it ranked only 104th for indicators based
on innovation and sophistication factors and 115th for financial market development as an
efficiency enhancer. The improvements are largely attributed to progress in macroeconomic
stability (16th) and technological readiness (55th).
The main impediments faced by Kazakhstan MSMEs relate to (EBRD 2009):
      •    Low quality of products and manufacturing;
      •    Lack of transfer of technologies to reach international standards;
      •    Poor management skills (operational, marketing, export, mergers and acquisitions); and
      •    Deficiencies in long term business planning, and restructuring.
The DAMU17 Entrepreneurship Development Fund is a government initiative to boost the
development of small business. Its mission is to facilitate the development of Kazakh SMEs and
microfinance institutions, by integrating and providing financial and consulting services. DAMU
is a national development institute and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna National
Welfare Fund. Most major banks in Kazakhstan have credit lines with DAMU, and 12.5% is the
maximum banks can charge SMEs when they on-lend DAMU money.
DAMU also operates a Credit Guarantee Scheme that was established in 2010. The scheme
targets SMEs, including start-ups and established firms, operating in economic sectors defined
as a priority within the framework of the Business Roadmap 2020 programme, such as
manufacturing. The scheme also prioritises projects related to modernisation and expansion of
production, as well as purchase and modernisation of equipment.

The Government’s assistance has focused mainly on MSME financing rather than advisory
services and the local consultancy market is weakly developed (EBRD 2009). Several
international donors are providing assistance to MSME development, although this is reducing.
Besides the USAID Kazakhstan Small Business Development Programme, the World Bank and
the Ministry of Agriculture help improve access to finance by providing micro-credit
programmes.

5.2 Kyrgyzstan
5.2.1 Industrial development
The most important industrial sectors in Kyrgyzstan are metallurgy, food processing, textile and
garment manufacturing, and production of non-metallic mineral products and energy.
Together, these industries produce over 90 % of industrial output. According to the State
Statistics Committee there are over 2090 enterprises in the industrial sector employing more
than 200 thousand people. Despite the small proportion of GDP - 16.8% in 2012, industry
remains the most important sector of the economy in terms of contribution to the budget and
exports (Government of Kyrgyzstan 2012).
According to the Ministry of Economy, in recent years, the government has been working on
diversification, with a focus on industries with higher added value. These include the textile and
garment industry, agribusiness, energy, mining and construction industries. These industries
are increasingly using local resources, but not always focused on their downstream processing.

The Government of Kyrgyzstan’s National Development Strategy for 2013-17 recognises that
the extremely low competitiveness of the nation’s industrial sector is one of the main reasons
for a low volume of FDI and the underdeveloped SME sector. In addition to infrastructure and
business environment issues described in the previous section, instability of property rights in
the recent years has been one most important factors hampering industrial development. For
example, after a violent change of government in 2010 more than 40 companies were
nationalised, including industrial facilities, energy and mobile communication businesses,
hotels, etc. (Kalikova & Associates 2011)
A key policy document for the development of the industrial sector is ‘The P rogram of the
Development of Manufacturing sector in Kyrgyzstan for 2013-2015’. A number of activities
listed under this program represent opportunities for the government to develop production
linkages with the mining sector:
          Identification of priority sectors of the manufacturing industry,
          Development and implementation of programs in priority sectors of the manufacturing
           industry,
          Development of proposals for establishment of industrial zones,
          Identification of competitive advantages of regions and development of regional
           industrial development plans according to identified competitive advantage,
          Development of a draft program for a vocational and technical education system to
           meet the needs of industry,
          Introduction of product quality and safety assurance systems to meet international
           standards, and
          Creation of international accredited testing laboratories                                   for export-oriented
           production.
Although these activities seem to target primarily export oriented manufacturing, they could be
extended to cover domestic suppliers of the mining sector.
The NDS 2013-17 also includes a number of National Industrial Investment Projects. These are
presented as high return and high value added investments that will increase national product,
tax revenue and create new jobs. However, it is unclear whether these projects strategically
contribute to industrial development.
Free Economic Zones
The taxation of foreign investors and entities is governed by the law on free economic zones
(FEZ) of 15 March 1996. Customs fees, duties and payments, which apply to entities operating
in the zones, are also governed by this law. FEZs function as autonomous entities not subject to
customs laws and regulations of customs requirements. They are considered foreign territories
with total freedom from customs control. Customs involvement is limited to customs officials
escorting consignments destined to and from them. All goods except petroleum, alcohol and
tobacco and tobacco products can be brought into the zones.
The companies in FEZs are active in trade, food processing, light industry, the production of
construction materials and furniture and tourism. There are four FEZs in Kyrgyzstan:
      •    Bishkek FEZ is located in the capital, with part located at Manas international airport;
      •    Karakol is on the shores of Lake Issyk-Kul, the world’s second largest alpine lake and in the
           vicinity of the Kumtor gold mine, providing opportunities for tourism development;
     •     Maimak is situated near the Kyrgyz-Kazakh border; and
     •     Naryn, located on the Chinese border, offers potential for the development of tourism and
           the mining sector. This free economic zone covers 47,000 square km, equivalent to one
           quarter of the territory of Kyrgyzstan.
-




Page 62 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




The performance of the FEZs has been mixed. Recently, there have been reports about
corruption and power abuse, especially in the Bishkek FEZ. President Atamabaev has recently
requested Parliament to revisit the FEZ law amid corruption reports.
WTO and Customs Union
Kyrgyzstan is a WTO member since 1998 and is progressing to joining the Customs Union (CU)
in 2013. To become a full member of the CU, the Kyrgyz parliament must ratify the 70
international agreements in the framework of the Eurasian Economic Community, of which
about 40 are directly related to the CU.
There is an on-going debate about the costs and benefits of the CU. On one hand Russian and
Kazakh markets will be closed for re-export of Chinese goods from Kyrgyzstan – a major part of
the Kyrgyz informal economy. On the other hand, some argue that productive resources will
switch from the informal re-export sector to manufacturing. Kyrgyzstan’s cheap labour force,
high hydroelectricity potential and abundant natural resources, complemented by access to a
large combined market of CU members, may attract industrial investments to the country.
There appears to be a consensus that Kyrgyzstan has to put in place and implement a
comprehensive industrial development strategy in order to benefit from the CU accession.
Russia's WTO accession in 2012 may have positive impact on the terms of accession of
Kyrgyzstan in the CU. The most acute issue of the CU is import tariffs. The current average rate
of customs duties in Kyrgyzstan is 5.1%, the average rate for the obligations of the WTO is 7.5%,
and the average rate of the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) of the Customs Union is 10.6%. The
government is in negotiations with the CU to keep low tariffs for import of Kyrgyz
manufacturing inputs (Vecherni Bishkek 2012).
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
According to the OECD’s TVET review of 2012 (OECD 2013), the TVET system in Kyrgyzstan is
weak and growing weaker, in contrast to the rising demand for TVET services and the acute
need for population to obtain marketable qualifications. The overall Kyrgyz education system is
still in transition after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, two decades ago. The current
vocational education system is not sufficiently responsive to labour markets. Employers in
industrial sectors who purchase new technology and equipment face the difficulty of finding
workers who know how to operate this equipment.


5.2.2 SME Development
The contribution of SMEs is slightly more than 40% of the GDP. In the last three years, FDI in
SME development has been decreasing. In 2011, FDI fell by 15%. Kyrgyzstan’s SMEs mainly
operate in retail trade, services and agriculture and, to a much lesser extent, are engaged in
manufacturing. The Government NDS (2012) views trends in SME development “not as a driving
force of economic recovery, but rather a process which leads to inefficient use of natural,
labour, intellectual and other resources”. According to the NDS, the most challenging issue in
SME development is the sector’s competitiveness.
A distinctive feature of the Kyrgyz SME sector is that Kyrgyz firms are more likely to have full-
time female workers and to have female participation in firm ownership compared with the
ECA region. About 70% of manufacturing firms have female participation in ownership.
Kyrgyzstan stands out for the lowest level of capacity utilization (58%) in the region after
Georgia. Compared with the rest of the region, firms in Kyrgyzstan rely less on bank financing
for investments and more on equities and sales of stock. Only 14% of all investments in
Kyrgyzstan are financed by bank, compared with 23 % in the region (World Bank 2011).

Key Constraints to SME Development
Whereas there have been improvements in the business environment for SMEs, for example,
simplified tax payment procedures, Kyrgyz firms continue to face obstacles such as corruption,
inadequate provision of electricity, and limited access to finance (World Bank Enterprise Survey
2009). Small firms in particular are more credit-constrained compared to larger firms.
Kyrgyzstan lags far behind the region regarding technology innovation measures. 39% of the
Kyrgyz firms report having to bribe tax inspectors. In addition to pervasive corruption, less than
one-quarter of Kyrgyz firms believe the court system to be fair, impartial, and uncorrupted; only
four other ECA countries have lower percentages for this measure. Kyrgyzstan fares poorly in
infrastructure, specifically electricity, when compared to the ECA region: the number, duration,
and value lost due to power outages are consistently greater than for most ECA countries
(World Bank 2011).

5.3 Tajikistan
5.3.1 Industrial Development
Tajikistan’s industrial sector has be in decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union due to the
after-effects of the systemic crisis and the civil war, the country’s distance from international
markets and the limited scope of the domestic market. The Industrial sector is also suffering
from a shortage of industrial management skills, a breakdown of former production ties and a
shortage of public and private infrastructure services, in particular in power supply. The sector
also experiences high energy losses.
There is insufficient development of micro- and small businesses focused on manufacturing.
Delays in privatisation or restructuring, the inadequacy of methods being used for the
privatisation of large state-owned industrial and agricultural enterprises and the absence of
post-privatisation monitoring and support for enterprises have contributed to a decline in the
country’s production potential (Government of Tajikistan 2006).
The government lists the following measures to diversify the economy and enhance export
potential in its National Development Strategy (NDS) 2006 - 2015:
          Raise the profitability of the Tajik Aluminium Plant and the energy sector;
          Implement Infrastructure, export-oriented and tourism investment projects, as well as
           projects with an emphasis on import substitution;
          Settle debts in the cotton industry and promote sustainable development of this sector;
           and
          Encourage capital investment in the downstream processing of primary aluminium, in
           the textile industry and in the mining industry.

The expected outcomes of the NDS to 2015 for industrialisation include:
      •    Establishment of at least 8–10 private and public-private regional industrial-production and
           industrial-energy complexes (clusters) based on existing production facilities, and the
           creation of incentives for growth in the number of micro- and small industrial enterprises to
           meet the needs of the domestic market and to promote the incorporation of innovations
           into production; and
      •    Diversification of industrial production through the development of SMEs, improvement in
           the investment climate, reduction in the regulatory role of the state and implementation of
           urgent reforms in certain sectors of the economy, such as the mining industry and the
           processing of minerals.

The State Committee on Investments and State Property Management is responsible for
legislation affecting the foreign investment sector, investment promotion and measures to
encourage entrepreneurship. It has established four free economic zones in Pyanj, Soughd,
Dangara and Ishkoshim. Companies investing in these zones are given an exemption from profit
tax for a period of between two and five years, depending on the size of the investment.
Technical and Vocational Education
The Tajik TVET system has been deteriorating since the end of the Soviet era and is only able to
offer outdated skills. Tajikistan is currently modernising its educational system with the
assistance of donors. Mechanisms to involve the stakeholders in TVET are in place, but in
practice, the participation of stakeholders is limited. The education system in Tajikistan is
heavily affected by the difficult economic conditions in the country that lead to few
employment opportunities for graduates of TVET institutions. Creating jobs and opportunities
for recent graduates poses a challenge. The lack of opportunities demotivates prospective
students and affects the reputation of the VET system. Moreover, TVET schools suffer from a
lack of funding that inhibits their modernisation (OECD 2013).
5.3.2 SME Development
While the economy of Tajikistan has seen stable growth in the last three years, the SME sector
is developing unevenly. Thanks to easier administrative procedures, the number of individual
entrepreneurs and dekhan farms are growing rapidly, while SMEs are very few and expanding
at a slower pace. There are fewer than 200 businesses in Tajikistan which employ more than
200 workers. Thus, micro and small enterprises are the vast majority of the approximately
155,000 businesses in Tajikistan and their importance to the economy grows every year. The
SME sector employed about 1,076,000 people in 2007 or about 50% of total employment in
Tajikistan. Another 2% of the labour force is engaged in larger firms in the private sector, and
the remaining 48% do not work in the private sector. Individual entrepreneurship is an
increasingly popular form for SMEs, and relatively few transition to legal entities. SMEs also
face a significantly more difficult regulatory environment (World Bank 2009).
Women run 36% of individual entrepreneurs and 16% of small and medium companies. Women
are among the owners of just over half of these firms. Only 9% of dehkan farms are run by
women, although half of dehkan farm employees are women (World Bank 2011).

SME Development Constraints
The combination of strong regulation and weak enforcement creates significant opportunities
for rent-seeking by public officials. Corruption in interactions with public officials comprises one
of the main constraints for private businesses in Tajikistan. Tajikistan faces similar problems as
other economies from Central Asia in terms of access to finance for SMEs, having a relatively
small financial sector in relation to GDP. Microfinance lending has risen rapidly in recent years,
funded partly by international donors such as the EBRD, EU and IFC. But lending to small
businesses continues to be hampered by the lack of transferable land-use rights, which
precludes the use of agricultural land as collateral, despite recent moves to strengthen land
ownership rights.
Fig 20. Top 10 Business Environment Constraints for Firms
-




Page 67 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




The financial sector continues to be undermined by state-direct lending to priority sectors (e.g.
cotton production). Interest rates are high (around 17% on local currency loans), as are
collateral requirements, which make access to finance for SMEs difficult. As a result, bank
lending accounts for only around 15% of GDP (World Bank 2011). Import and export procedures
are too complicated for most SMEs. Only 24% of SMEs import goods, and fewer than 3% export.
Government SME Policy
The government of Tajikistan has taken a number of measures to improve the business
environment for SMEs. Implementation of the 2004 Licensing Law has led to some
improvements, most notably an increase in the average validity of an issued license. However,
licensing is still a lengthy and expensive process for the SMEs who must obtain licenses. The
2006 Inspections Law and its implementation resulted in annual savings to the Tajik SME sector
of US$ 9.3 million, reflecting savings to individual entrepreneurs and dehkan farms offset by an
increase in costs to SMEs. Government policies to strengthen access to finance for SMEs have
been limited, and have mainly revolved around measures to stimulate business activity
generally, rather than focusing on SMEs. Most public investment is directed towards large,
state-owned firms and infrastructure projects. The government is currently considering the
establishment of a credit guarantee scheme based on the experience of the scheme in
Afghanistan (OECD 2013).
The program of state support of entrepreneurship in Tajikistan for 2012-2020, implemented by
GosKomInvest, lists the following measures to support the SME sector:
      •    Establishment of a fund to support the financing of businesses;
      •    Logistical support entrepreneurship through preferential provision of equipment,
           production facilities and technologies;
      •    Creation of a body of state support of entrepreneurship and providing it with greater
           powers;
      •    Reduction of administrative barriers to the creation and maintenance of business;
      •    Government support for the priorities of businesses;
      •    Encouraging establishment of institutions of self-sustaining business in the form of
           manufacturing, sales, credit cooperatives;
      •    Support for innovative businesses;
      •    Providing information and consulting support entrepreneurship;
      •    Assistance in the training and upgrading of skills for entrepreneurship; and
      •    Creation of an enabling environment for businesses that contribute to the creation of
           additional jobs.

6. Domestic Procurement Policies and Regulation
6.1 Government regulation and government-led initiatives
Due to the shared Soviet past where business and state were a single entity, there is a
perception both in public and private sectors that large companies, in particular mining
companies, should play a significant role in providing public services and developing public
infrastructure in areas where they operate. Many participants in this study across all three
countries referred to large mining companies as ‘system-forming’ or ‘town-forming’, and
expressed expectations that such companies should perform many public sector functions,
including building and running schools, hospitals, roads, power, and water infrastructure as well
as developing businesses in their supply chain. In Kazakhstan, the term ‘system-forming
company’ is found in legislation, reflecting the expectations of the responsibility of large
business in performing public services.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the development of domestic procurement and local
content policies took different directions within the three countries. In Kazakhstan, local
content policies originated in the oil and gas boom as well as the drive to diversify the economy
from hydrocarbon exports. A strong focus on industrialisation and related policies – local
content, the policy of state equity participation in oil and gas and mining projects, SME finance
and innovation, e.g. the DAMU foundation, industrial parks, etc. – has stemmed from the Soviet
industrial heritage under the leadership of Nursultan Nazarbaev, president of Kazakhstan since
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Since its independence, Kyrgyzstan’s policy focus has been on market liberalisation and the
reduction of the state’s role in the economy. There was a lack of stability in property rights due
to the competition of Kyrgyz elites for power and violent changes of government. As a result of
predatory elites trying to capture mining sector rents there has been only one successful mining
investment, Kumtor. There has been little attention to developing mining sector linkages as the
policy makers have been focused on re-distributing mining rents and on attracting new
investments.
A civil war that erupted in Tajikistan after it acquired its independence prevented the
companies from developing any major mining projects. However, with the prospective
Konimiansur and other mining investments, the government has an opportunity to capture
greater benefits from the mining sector by developing appropriate industrial linkage policies
and learning lessons from the neighbouring countries and other emerging mining nations.
Public officials and business associations in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have no experience with
local content or domestic procurement policies. They are not aware of best practice and refer
to Kazakhstan as a model for developing local content. Moreover, the governments in both
countries are working on the amending their subsoil legislation to include local content
provisions. In the interviews they mentioned that they refer to the Kazakh experience in
developing local content provisions. All stakeholders in the both counties have expressed a
great interested in the subject and recognised that local procurement should play a greater role
in the mining sector.
6.1.1 Kazakhstan
Regulations related to local content in the procurement of goods, works and services in mining
activities fall under the 2010 legislation ‘On Subsoil and Subsoil Use’. The main institutions
involved in supporting local content in Kazakhstan include:
      •    National Agency for Technological Development (sets local content policy)
      •    National Agency for Development of Local Content (NADLoC) (implements policy)
      •    National Welfare Fund (Samruk-Kazyna) (implements industrial policy)
      •    Parasat (science and development)
      •    AGMP Association (equivalent to a Chamber of Mines)

Local content performance is monitored by NADLoC through two systems – subsoil reporting
and an online registry18. Data is analysed to understand what is purchased, volumes purchased,
and where potential exists for growth or entering other markets. The data informs
development of local content action plans. Kazakhstan’s 2010 - 2014 local content program has
set a target of 16% of goods and 85% of services. As shown in Table 17, actual spend is close to,
or exceeds targets, with 14% and 92% respectively in 2012.

The online registry is also a vehicle for providing measures of state support, including
reimbursement of expenses to domestic producers incurred in implementing quality
management systems according to international standards (e.g. ISO). To qualify for support,
domestic manufacturers need to past local content tests to determine the percentage of local
content in proposed industrial and innovation projects.
The database is also intended to provide mining companies with accurate information about
Kazakh producers, their activities and products.
Measurement of local content
The Kazakh Government’s Decree No. 367/2010 formalised the measurement of local content
in goods, works and services, using the Uniform Method of Kazakh Content Calculation (the
‘Uniform Method’). The relevant equations are outlined below. A differentiation is made
between ‘Kazakh content’ and ‘Kazakh provider’. The latter comprises citizens of Kazakhstan or
Kazakh legal entities where over 95% of staff are citizens of Kazakhstan. Subsoil users are
required to provide a 20% discount to Kazakh manufacturers.
The obligations are not only placed on subsoil users, but also state authorities; companies that
are majority owned by the National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC; concessionaires; and
other companies targeted by the government for local content monitoring.

Goods
The percentage of Kazakh Content in goods is stated in the CT-KZ certificate. The certificate is
issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Technical Regulation and Metrology Committee
to a Kazakh manufacturer. CT-KZ is issued for a period of one year. It is not mandatory for
manufacturers to obtain a CT-KZ certificate, however to claim local content, subsoil users need
to purchase from CT-KZ holders.




Where:
      •    KCT is the Kazakh content in goods
      •    n is the total number of goods purchased by a supplier and its subcontractors for the
           execution of a contract for the provision of goods to a subsoil user
      •    СТi is the cost of good i
      •    Ki is the share of KC in goods indicated in the СТ-KZ certificate
      •    S is the total cost of goods purchased

Works and services
Kazakh content in services is equal to the share of total salary expenses paid to Kazakh
employees, including subcontractors. The supplier determines this share, indicated as a
percentage on the official letterhead with the certified director's signature and the company’s
seal.
Kazakh content in works where goods are used is equal to the sum of Kazakh content in goods
and Kazakh content in services.




Where:
      •    KCp/y is the Kazakh content in works and services
      •    n is the total number of goods purchased by the suppliers and subcontractors for the
           execution of a contract for provision of works/services to a subsoil user
      •    CTi and Ki are as per the definitions above
      •    m is the total number of contracts for provision of works/services signed by a subsoil user
           and its contractors
      •    СAj is the value of the jth contract
      •    СТj is the total cost of goods purchased under the jth contract
      •    ССAj is the total value of subcontracting agreements signed under the jth contract
      •    Rj is the share of Kazakh staff payroll in total compensation
      •    S is the total value of the contract for provision of works (services)

Monitoring
Regulation 1139 requires that subsoil users submit their annual, medium term and long term
procurement program, and quarterly reports. Quarterly reporting is carried out using the
following formula for Kazakh content.




Where:
      •    n is the total number of contracts signed by a subsoil user with suppliers of goods, works and
           services
      •    СAi is the value of each contract for the purchase of goods, works and services
      •    КСi is the Kazakh content of a supplier of goods, works and services under each procurement
           contract
      •    S is the total cost of goods, works and services purchased by a subsoil user in the three
           month reporting period

Procurement rules
Since 2010, all subsoil users are obliged to: (1) procure all goods, works and services under the
government’s Procurement Rules; (2) download all procurement information onto an online
registry (i.e. advertisement, tender documentation, results of the tenders, contractor selected);
and (3) place advertisements and results in periodicals disseminated three times a week
throughout Kazakhstan, in Kazakh and Russian languages.
Kazakhstan’s procurement rules for subsoil users allow for the procurement of goods, works
and services for mining operations to be carried out by one of the following methods:
     •     Open competition;
     •     An e-procurement system;
     •     Commodity exchanges;
     •     Request for price quotations (restricted to instances when quality is of little importance
           and price is the decisive factor; and if the annual volume of purchases does not exceed
           an equivalent of US$ 150,000; or
     •     Sole sourcing (restricted to procurement of employee training; goods and services
           required for repairs in the event of breakage, failure mechanisms, units in transit,
           requiring immediate recovery; for containment and emergency response, in the event
           of emergency shutdown of the main equipment; and instances where there is only one
           Kazakh supplier of appropriate quality).
In the case of competitive tenders, tender documents prepared by mining companies are
obliged to include the following conditions:
     •     Naming of products using a standard classification
     •     Details of the procuring organisation
     •     The list of documents to be submitted by potential suppliers to confirm compliance
           with the terms of the tender documentation, in the form of certificates
     •     Payment terms
-




Page 72 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




     •     Format and method for calculating the price quotation, including cost of
           transportation, insurance, payment of customs duties, taxes, fees, and other expenses,
           excluding VAT
     •     Quantity of purchased goods, the volume of work performed and services rendered for
           each lot
     •     Location where the contract will be performed
     •     Terms of delivery of the goods, works or services to be purchased
     •     Manner, place and deadline for submission of bids, and bid validity period
     •     Place, date and time of opening of envelopes with bids
     •     Draft contract specifying terms of the contract
     •     Documents proving whether the supplier can be qualified as Kazakh supplier
     •     Maximum budget allocated
     •     Functional, technical and operational characteristics, quality characteristics, including,
           where appropriate, technical specifications, plans, drawings and sketches, as well as a
           list of documents confirming compliance with these requirements
     •     Local content requirements of purchased goods or works or services, expressed as a
           percentage for each lot (from 0 to 100)
The company can include a requirement that only manufacturers or their official
representatives can participate in a tender. However, tender documents are not allowed to
contain references to trademarks, service marks, trade names, patents, utility models,
industrial designs, appellations of origin and the name of the manufacturer, as well as other
characteristics that determine the identity of goods, works, services and the individual potential
supplier (or) the manufacturer of goods. There are two exceptions:
     •     Resupply, modernisation, repair and retrofitting main (fixed) equipment used in a single
           technological cycle; and
     •     To determine the service provider for leasing and in providing a detailed description of
           the leased asset.
The tender process involves the following stages:
      •    Stage 1: Tender applications are submitted and reviewed by the Tender Commission, who
           makes a decision on admission to participate in open competition within ten calendar days
           from the date of opening bid envelopes. The Commission considers whether a potential
           supplier meets criteria described under paragraph 2 of Article 78 ‘Support local producers’
           of the Act. The buyer is required to discount the price of competitive bids of local producers
           by twenty percent. A Kazakh producer of works, services is defined as ‘citizens of Kazakhstan
           and (or) legal entities established under the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, located in
           the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan, using no less than ninety-five percent of the
           citizens of Kazakhstan in the total number of employees’.
      •    Stage 2: Bidders submit their price offers using a prescribed form, detailing: description;
           manufacturer (this is omitted for goods and services); measuring unit; quantity (volume);
           and Price, delivery terms specified by bidder; and point of delivery, including transportation,
           insurance, customs duties, cost of necessary spare parts, cost of maintenance for one unit of
           good or service.
      •    Evaluation: The Competition Commission compares the competitive price offers and
           determining the winner of the open competition on the basis of the lowest bid price
           quotation and price reduction for Kazakh Producers. If prices are equal, the winner is the
           one offering the highest percentage of local content.

Issues impeding effectiveness
In March 2012, NADLoC, which is under the Kazakh Ministry of Industry and New Technologies,
claimed that most of the 229 companies mining companies do not meet the legal requirements
for local content in the Law on Subsoil Use 19. In 2011 mining companies purchased 568 billion
tenge worth of goods and services but only half were made through the register that is required
to be used for procurement purposes according to the Law on Subsoil Use. The violations were
estimated at 212.2 billion tenge (US$ 1.38 billion).
Interviews with NADLoC representatives affirmed that local content targets are not being met
in the mining sector. The main barriers were stated as a lack of locally produced equipment and
machinery and lack of local production facilities. Technology transfer is still at early stages and
human resources capability is still weak within certain technical specialities. NADLoC indicated
that just under 100 categories of goods that are currently imported by the mining sector have
potential to be developed locally (refer to Appendix 1). Some are being produced locally and
have potential for growth. Others are not being produced locally but have large demand.
NADLoC representatives expressed a desire for international investors to follow a transition
strategy with these items, investing firstly in assembly, followed by production of spare parts
later on.
NADLoC is currently studying the question of what are the allowable instruments to develop
local suppliers which are consistent with a WTO framework.
Industry and Civil Society-led initiatives, including assessment of their effectiveness
The AGMP (association of mining companies) is the representative body for the mining
industry. The AGMP has a Memorandum of Understanding with NADLoC and is the first port of
call for the government when making new, or amending, legislation affecting the industry.
The services to members are primarily in the form of consultancy advice on legal issues. AGMP
also fills an advocacy role when members have issues with local content, for example, in
instances when purchases are not counted as domestic purchases.
AGMP representatives interviewed for this study suggested that deeper analysis is required on
(1) the competitiveness of goods, and (2) current legal frameworks considering the
consequences of Kazakhstan entering the WTO, and what mechanisms will be permissible to
support local content. An analysis of the ability of local goods to compete on a global scale has
not yet been undertaken, and it was thought that not enough information is available to
determine if local producers can compete on price and quality.
Regional associations
To encourage local level initiatives, the Ministry of Regional Development has initiated a
partnership program for the development and support of SMEs in regions by bringing together
large companies, government and international organisations. The program aims to develop:
      •    Local supplier networks linked to large companies;
      •    Alternative business opportunities, unrelated to the core business of companies; and
      •    Entrepreneurial initiatives to introduce advanced technology and environmental protection.

Memoranda of understanding and cooperation were signed in April 2012 in Temirtau between
the Committee of Enterprise Development, Atameken Union, EDF, Damu, the Atyrau,
Mangistau, Karaganda and East Kazakhstan regions, KazMunaiGas, OzenMunayGaz, Kazzinc and
Kazakhmys. A Central Working Group is responsible for implementation of the Partner
Program, which includes representatives of the Committee, local government offices, DAMU
Fund, large companies and business associations.

In the Karaganda region, five meetings of the Working Group were held in 2012, which included
identifying priority sectors of SME Development. Kazakhmys shared a list of goods and services
planned for procurement in 2013 with potential suppliers, as well as a list of manufacturers and
service providers to consider.
Kazakhmys also initiated the Association of Businessmen and Industrialists in Balkhash and
Zhezkazgan regions, where Kazakhmys has operations. Currently they are 116 participants,
including 38 companies employing more than 4,978 employees.
In the East Kazakhstan region, the program is implemented in cooperation with Kazzinc. In
2012, there were four meetings of the Working Group on the implementation of the Partner
Program. The forum provided a space for addressing issues relating to the list of long-term
supply contracts for SMEs, as well as communicating requirements and criteria for suppliers.
6.1.2 Kyrgyzstan
There is no systematic approach to encouraging greater linkages between mining investment
and local suppliers. There have been some recent moves to attract investment to specific
sectors. For example, the Ministry of Economy has taken steps to create tourism clusters by
identifying locations with tourism potential and measures to simplify investment in the sector
and attract public-private partnerships. However, due to lack of resources further development
of the tourism cluster is currently on hold. No such programs exist in the mining sector.
The Ministry of Economy, the main government body responsible for the industrial and mining
sectors policy, recognises the importance of linkages and value-add that the mining sector
creates in the economy. However, there is no government strategy or policy aimed at
increasing domestic procurement. Moreover, the Ministry of Economy was not aware of
whether any research had been conducted on mining sector forward and backward linkages in
Kyrgyzstan. There is also no awareness of best practice in local content in the government
bodies responsible for the sector, namely, Ministry of Economy and Agency for Geology.
However, the recent community conflicts have put the issues of local content on the
government’s agenda.

There are no local content provisions in the Subsoil Legislation. Local content may be included
in the investment, concession agreements and PSAs with the operators, however, there are no
provisions in existing investment or concessions agreements.
The Subsoil law mentions a ‘social package’, a set of measures required to be implemented by
the subsoil user, aimed at developing the local community and addressing the most pressing
issues of local importance. Requirements include:
      •    Education of the local population in various technical specialties;
      •    Employment of local population; and
      •    Development of rural infrastructure.

There is no guidance, however, on calculating the size of the social package, its implementation
or monitoring.
The government includes some local content clauses in tenders for large mining projects. For
example, the social package for Jeruy gold project tender (the tender failed in April 2013 and
the second tender is planned for later in 2013) included requirements for a local workforce and
investment in local social infrastructure.
Public Procurement Law applies to companies where the government holds a stake of over
50%. The law applies in the case KyrgyzAltyn, the second largest miner in the country. The Law
has the following provisions regarding preferences to domestic suppliers:
      •    The procuring entity may provide a price discount of up to 20% in the evaluation of bids for
           goods manufactured in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic compared with tender
           applications for foreign-made goods, as well as up to 10% for domestic contractors;
      •    If procurement is carried out on the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic, the procuring entity
           provides benefits for domestic contractors subject to the use of local labour resources, as
           well as at least 30% of local raw materials; and
      •    In the case of a decision to give preference to domestic suppliers (contractors), all
           obligations under international treaties are taken into account.

Supplier Databases
There are no comprehensive databases of domestic suppliers in Kyrgyzstan. Both mining
companies and suppliers rely mainly on their own networks and databases. There are
numerous published sectoral catalogues and online databases of businesses that are used by
local procurement staff.20
The Kyrgyz Chamber of Commerce and Trade has a small register of ‘Reliable Suppliers’. The
Chamber also supported the development of an online database of domestic suppliers21. The
project is too new to assess its effectiveness. At the time of this report there were only a few
suppliers registered in the system, with a few tender opportunities advertised.
One online procurement database that has been fairly successful is the Portal of Kyrgyz
Companies22. The project is aimed at assisting in establishing business contacts between
companies in Kyrgyzstan and a wide range of customers on behalf of the U.S. Government. It
primarily services procurement needs of CENTCOM, the US army’s Afghanistan operations. The
supplier must self-register with the Joint Contracting and Contingency Services (JCCS). The
project is implemented by the American Chamber of Commerce, with the financial support of
the USAID Local Development. The portal provides Kyrgyz businessmen with advice on
accessing markets on behalf of the U.S. Government.

TenderPro is a Russia-based online supply/demand database and e-procurement platform that
is popular in the FSU and is used by Kyrgyz companies, including mining companies (e.g.
Kumtor) and their customers23. Presently, 182 Kyrgyz companies are registered in TenderPro.
Government Capacity
As noted during interviews with the Ministry of Economy, Agency for Geology and others24,
capacity in government bodies responsible for the mining sector is low due to the following
reasons:
       •   Lack of continuity and high turnover of staff due to political instability. In addition, the
           Agency for Geology has been a target of mismanagement and corruption accusations by
           some members of the parliament (Jogorku Kenesh) and the media due to the highly
           politicised nature of the agency’s work of granting and cancelling subsoil use rights..
       •   The flight of highly educated and skilled professionals from the government to the private
           sector due to a rigid public sector salary system. Officials in all ministries, regardless of the
           sector, receive the same salaries according to their civil servant category. Attracted by
           higher private sector salaries, mining, geology, economics and finance professionals tend to
           shift. (In other sectoral ministries, e.g. Education, this issue is not as prominent as there are
           few better paying opportunities outside of the public sector.)

Capacity of Business Associations
There are numerous NGOs and business associations monitoring activities of the mining sector
as well as protecting the interests of entrepreneurs in the country. Currently there are three
associations in Kyrgyzstan: Miners Guild, Association of Geologists and Miners; and the Kyrgyz
Mining Association. One of most effective business associations is the Committee on Mineral
Resources of the International Business Council (IBC). These organisations are operating in an
uncoordinated manner, pursuing the interests of a narrow group of stakeholders. Activities are
usually limited to discussions of policy, projects, laws, and some advisory services. Most
companies do not belong to either association.


6.1.3 Tajikistan
Subsoil legislation and other legislation applicable to private mining investment in Tajikistan do
not contain any provisions for local content or preferencing. There does not appear to be a
policy targeted at promoting domestic supplies in mining supply chains. In 2009, the
government created an Intra-agency Commission to Support Domestic Manufacturers.
However, it does not appear to be currently operational.
There are some local supplier referencing provisions in the Public Procurement legislation that
is applicable to companies with a government stake of over 50%:
       •   When foreign suppliers (contractors) participate in public procurement, internal suppliers,
           all else being equal, may be granted preference in the amount of 20% for goods and 10% for
           works;
       •   If the subject of procurement is works to be performed in Tajikistan, preference is granted
           on condition that the works are performed with the usage of domestic labour resources and
           not less than 30% of domestic raw and construction materials; and
       •   The procuring entity may grant 10% of preference to suppliers of consulting services on
           condition that the internal consulting companies employ not less than 70% of their
           permanent staff from domestic specialists.

In addition, local content requirements may be incorporated in investment contracts and
PSAs25.
There are no databases of local demand or supply in Tajikistan. However, the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry as well as the State Committee on Investments and State Property
Management play an important role in organising matchmaking and investment promotion
events in the form of business forums, fairs and roadshows. The Chamber of Commerce and
Industry organises fairs and roadshows to promote Tajik products and participates in major
international exhibitions. It is also charged with the mission of enhancing the quality of
products and engaging in the provision of training to Tajik entrepreneurs.
Government and Civil Society Capacity
An assessment of the capacity of public sector and civil society to support domestic
procurement was not undertaken as part of this study as none of the stakeholders interviewed
were involved in local content development or domestic supplier support.
At the government level, there appears to be some capacity and general interest to promote
domestic procurement at GosKomInvest. However, it is unclear which body within the complex
mining sector governance structure could potentially be responsible for supporting domestic
procurement.
There appear to be no business associations in Tajikistan representing the interests of the
mining sector. The Chamber of Commerce and Trade promotes interests of Tajik companies in
general and their main focus is promoting Tajik businesses abroad. The Chamber has over 600
members, none of which are mining companies. The Chamber has representations in four
regions, including two regions where mining businesses are concentrated – Sughd and Khatlon.
The regional Chambers seem to be more involved with mining businesses and, according to
suppliers interviewed, are involved in some matchmaking activities between mining companies
and local suppliers.
The National Association of Small and Medium Businesses of Tajikistan (NASMB) is involved in
promoting an enabling business environment, business support services, basic business skills
and private public partnership initiatives. NASMB does not have any linkages with the mining
sectors as most of its members are in Dushanbe, the capital. The organisation has capacity to
provide business skills training to local SMEs.

7. Domestic Procurement Practice
7.1 Kazakhstan Case Studies
Detailed case study research was conducted on two large mining companies, Kazakhmys and
Kazzinc, with a view to identifying opportunities to increase domestic procurement.
Kazakhmys is the largest copper producer in Kazakhstan and ranks 11th largest in the world.
The by-products include zinc, silver and gold. The company is an integrated copper producer,
encompassing mining and concentrating, smelting and refining, captive power, support services
and commercial power. Kazakhmys manages over 20% of the country's domestic supply,
making it the largest power provider in Kazakhstan. The company is listed in London,
Kazakhstan and Hong Kong. In 2012, group revenues were US$ 3,353 million. As at 31
December 2012, the market value of Kazakhmys was US$ 6.6 billion. The Group has two major
copper growth projects with planned output from 300 kt to over 500 kt in the next six years.
Kazzinc is a fully integrated zinc producer with considerable copper, precious metals and lead
credits. Most of the operations are in East-Kazakhstan Region. The company was established in
1997 through the merger of Eastern Kazakhstan's three main non-ferrous metal companies -
Ust-Kamenogorsk Lead and Zinc Combinate, Leninogorsk Polymetallic Combinate and
Zyryanovsk Lead Combinate. All three producers were majority-owned by the Government of
Kazakhstan. A multinational provate company, Glencore, is the largest shareholder of Kazzinc.
In 2011 the company spent approximately 2 billion tenge (US$ 13 million) on social support in
the towns where Kazzinc operates, such as Ust-Kamenogosk, Zyryanovsk, Ridder and other
regions. Focus areas include education, healthcare, sports and culture, infrastructure
development and providing support for disadvantaged groups.
In order to establish the maturity of both companies in embedding domestic procurement into
the strategy, policies and systems of their organisations, company representatives responsible
for local content were asked to conduct a self-assessment. The results of the two companies are
fairly consistent and presented in Tables 18. An advanced level of self-reported maturity is
evident, across all dimensions. This can be attributed to the established regulatory environment
for local content and proportionate company response.

7.1.1 Demand Analysis
As shown in Tables 19 and 20 below, companies operating in Kazakhstan tend to differentiate
between procurement made as subsoil users (and therefore subject to local content
regulations) from other procurement. Notable is that the subsoil regulations only influence a
minority of the total procurement by both companies - procurement as a subsoil user only
accounted for 38,5% of Kazakhmys and 14,8% of Kazzinc total procurement in 2012.
While a fairly high level of local content is achievable for works and services - 99% at Kazakhmys
and 96% at Kazzinc, goods are only at 30,5% and 6,4% respectively26.

  As mandated by the Kazakh local content regulation, local content numbers include only goods that
have CT-KZ certificates. As per case study companies, actual local content numbers are higher as many
suppliers whose goods otherwise meet Kazakh content requirement fail to acquire CT-KZ certificates due
to a cumbersome bureaucratic process.

7.1.2 Barriers to Increasing Domestic Procurement
Government Perspectives
According to NADLoC (2010), increasing the share of local content in procurement is enabled by
factors such as:
      •    The existence of institutions focused on the development of local content
      •    A legal framework designed to support the development of local content
      •    Specialist functions, policies and measures within mining companies for the development of
           local content
      •    Factors contributing to the competitiveness of Kazakh suppliers:
                o A rich mineral resource base
                o Strategic location between Europe and Asia
                o Potential for substantial increases in domestic production of goods, works, services
                     and human resources. (This is supported by the two mining company case studies
                     and the proportion of non-Kazakh content)
                o Expansion of trade integration, through the EEA and planned accession to the WTO

Barriers to increasing local content in domestic procurement in subsoil include:
      •    Lack of goods, works and services in the Kazakhstan market with the required quality
      •    Lack of awareness amongst local entrepreneurs of the goods, works and services demanded
           by the mining industry
      •    Lack of awareness amongst companies of potential suppliers of Kazakhstan goods, works
           and services
      •    Lack of government support for domestic producers of tools and equipment
      •    Potential deterioration in the business climate as a result of active intervention in the state
           in private market processes
      •    Factors detracting from the competitiveness of Kazakh suppliers, such as:
                o Low diversification of the economy, and low contribution of manufacturing
                o High dependence on imports
                o Low innovation, for example, the volume of innovative products in 2009 amounted
                    to only 2.6% of the total manufacturing output
                o Lack of highly skilled technical professionals
                o Accelerated industrial production in bordering countries such as Russia and China

Mining Operator Perspectives
Interviews conducted with mining company representatives (Kazakhmys, Kazzinc, Central Asia
Resources, and a uranium producer who preferred to remain unidentified), yielded the
following common themes:
Procurement system. The regulated e-procurement tendering system, which requires the
lowest bid to be accepted, can lead to the selection of suppliers offering lower quality. The
procurement system does not allow for evaluation of cost-benefit and a supplier’s track record
does not count as a criterion. It was expressed that this incentivises companies to work ‘around
the system’. The strict procurement regulations engender creative practices so as to tightly
specify the tender so that only one supplier is able to meet the requirements. This means that
the decision is sometimes made by the time the tendering process commences, a practice
associated with unethical practices such as kickbacks.
Lack of a local market in certain goods and services. Examples include second tier providers of
legal and advisory services (companies are forced to use the pricier large consultancies due to
lack of alternatives); leased mining equipment and heavy machinery (companies have to lease
-




Page 82 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




at high rates from individual entrepreneurs); and spare parts inventory in local suppliers (which
leads to long lead times for delivery, and companies having to keep safety stock). The idea was
put forward for the need for a large storage facility to be built in a centralised location, which
would service the needs of a number of mining companies. This would lower transportation
costs, and minimise delays in waiting for equipment. It was also expressed that there is little
incentive to develop local content in spare parts are these are fairly easy to procure, and the
more appropriate model of sourcing these is through joint ventures. Other needs identified
include materials for blasting, chemicals, and special steels.
Onerous regulatory reporting. Separate reporting regimes are required for tax, local content,
training, and tender reporting. Companies have all had to set up dedicated monitoring and
reporting functions. Smaller companies expressed that they are disproportionately burdened as
there is no differentiated treatment towards mining firms of different sizes.
Lack of access to affordable finance. Interest rates for borrowing were described as excessive
for SMEs. Mining companies in Kazakhstan do not tend to provide direct loans to suppliers, but
on occasion make advance payments, or interest-free loans. For example, in order for a
marshalling yard to be built to store chemicals, one mining company advanced payment to
enable building to commence. This was seen as more efficient as securing a loan from the bank.
This presents its risks, however, as companies interviewed described cases where suppliers
disappear after receiving advance payments without fulfilling the contract.
Joint ventures. Some companies prefer to work with (and in some cases have actively
facilitated) joint ventures between foreign companies and local suppliers. However, mining
company efforts to encourage joint ventures are not always welcomed by existing international
suppliers, who are not overly keen to develop local competitors.
Lack of information about local suppliers. The lack of a reliable, up to date, database of local
suppliers emerged as an issue.
Political risk of regional exports. The belief was that Kazakhstan may not be a large enough
market to build competitive local producers, and the politically instability of the remainder of
Central Asia does not necessarily lead to surrounding countries being an export market. The
Russian market was considered a more realistic trade partner.
Lack of company led supplier development programs. Companies generally saw training and
advisory interventions as the task of government rather than industry. Instead, they see the
industry role as providing information about items they are currently importing, running
supplier forums, and in some special cases, upfront payment, equipment, buildings and longer
contract terms.
Not all of the sentiment was pessimistic. Mining companies described Kazakhstan’s excellent
transport and logistics infrastructure base; and low cost labour, land and energy. Some high
quality goods are being provided with Kazakh content, such as drilling materials, pumps and
pipes.
One company, Kazakhmys, is pursuing local level initiatives to develop local suppliers by
working with SME associations in mining regions (for example, in Balkhash and Zhezkazgan).
Members are supported to develop the quality and skills needed to do business with
Kazakhmys.
Supplier/SME Perspectives
Interviews with suppliers to the mining industry identified five themes as barriers facing SME
suppliers.
Price competition from Russia and China. The local content regulations were introduced just
before the recession hit the mining industry. During the recession, a number of international
mining companies left Kazakhstan, leaving behind larger national companies to dominate the
industry. Lower cost supply was sourced from Russia and China, associated with lower levels of
-




Page 83 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




quality. With the introduction of the Customs Union, even more attention has shifted to supply
from Russia.
Regulated procurement system. The perception exists that the overly bureaucratic procurement
process is leads to mining companies working around the system and awarding contracts to
‘people they know’. Suppliers that do well in the system tend to offer a specialised service or
product. Thus, while the government-regulated procurement system is aimed at ensuring
equitable participation in the tender process, the reality is often the reverse, and decisions are
made by the time the tender is announced. The evidence for this practice is found in instances
where the tender is awarded the day after it is announced. The system has potential to be
manipulated by ‘unofficial’ bids and ‘official’ bids. The unofficial bid is the process of seeking
proposals from a number of suppliers, so that they preferred option guides the detailed
specifications for the government bidding process. Official bids are tightly specified so that the
buyer can get the quality and brand they seek. Not only is the decision made well in advance,
the situation presents the potential for decisions to be made on the basis of self-interest. It was
thought that free derestricted tendering, consistent with WTO policies, would not create the
same incentives for corrupt practices.
High costs of financing. Interest rates for short term business loans were also described as high.
The benchmark interest rate in Kazakhstan, as reported by the National Bank of Kazakhstan,
was last recorded at 5.5%. The National Bank of Kazakhstan official interest rate is the key
refinancing rate. However, short term credits (so called ‘fast money’) vary between 14% and
18%. Interest on capital investment tends to lean towards 18%.
Inefficient cross-border trading. Another barrier is found in cross-border trading in the CIS area
and visa requirements. Having access to the equivalent of an APEC card was thought to increase
the efficiency of trading. The Customs Union arrangement would have the potential to address
this barrier.
Access to qualified personnel. The education system in Kazakhstan was described as producing
too few engineers and scientists. Further, not enough staff have the ability to communicate in
the English language, thought to be essential for participation of local firms in global value
chains.


7.1.3 Opportunities for Increased Domestic Procurement
Both Kazakhmys and Kazzinc participated in a self-completion survey to identify which goods
and services have potential for market development in Kazakhstan. The results, which were
fairly consistent across both companies, were averaged and presented in Figure 22 and 23
below.
Services opportunities

health services, professional services: legal, load & haul, energy services, earthworks,
tunnelling, piles & caissons, building construction, civil works construction and maintenance,
hospitality services, facilities light maintenance, professional services: financial & business
advisory, insurance services, and telecom and data systems.

To give a sense of relative local economic development impact between purchases, the matrix
below segments these goods and services into four quadrants: high relative spend/high Kazakh
content; lower spend/high Kazakh content; high spend/low Kazakh content; and low spend/low
Kazakh content. The matrix excludes sales of pipeline gas fuel, as the total procurement spend
is approximately 2,5 times that of the next largest spend item.

7.1.4 Opportunities to Diversify Economy through Mining Supply Chains
Analysis conducted by NADLoC for the purposes of this study identified four main supply
sectors to the mining industry that have potential linkages to other sectors in the Kazakhstan
economy. As such, developing these supply sectors provides opportunities for diversification:
          Chemicals: the mining industry currently has a high demand for sulphuric acid, white
           spirits and technical alcohol. All are produced locally with fairly high levels of local
           content.
          Light industry: high demand items with a high local content supplier market include
           knitted gloves, mittens and mitts; and rubber apparel and clothing accessories.
          Metallurgy: for example, the industry consumes large volumes of threaded articles
           made of ferrous metals, however there is a low level of Kazakh content amongst local
           suppliers. Conversely, products made of ferrous alloy have very high local content
           levels.
      •    Production of machinery: this is an area of high demand but dominated by imports. Repairs
           and maintenance for mining, quarrying and construction machinery also show relatively low
           local content levels.

7.2 Kyrgyzstan Case Study
Detailed case study research was conducted on two mining companies, Kumtor Gold and
Kyrgyzaltyn, with a view to identifying opportunities to increase domestic procurement.
The research also involved a focus group with managers from the following mining companies
(mainly involved in exploration) and related organisations: Kyrgyz Mining Association, Andash
Mining Company, Manas Resources, Kazakhmys, Kentoo (a local engineering, procurement and
construction (EPC) contractor), International Business Council, Kyrgyzaltyn, USAID REFORMA
project and Deloitte consultants. The objective was to gather information about current supply
chain activities in the country, and identify barriers and opportunities for developing local
sourcing.
Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with several domestic suppliers who had
worked with the mining sector within the past five years. The interviews covered the following
subjects:
          Business enabling environment for domestic suppliers
          Access to finance
          Access to business service providers
          Access to infrastructure
          Engagement with mining companies, e.g. tender process, quality, HSE, volume, terms of
           supply, payment etc.
          Partnerships with mining companies
          Competition from foreign suppliers
          Role of government in supporting SMEs
          Role of business associations in promoting SMEs

Kumtor Gold is the largest enterprise in Kyrgyzstan. 100% of Kumtor is owned by Centerra Gold
Inc. whose shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Kyrgyz Republic, via Kyrgyzaltyn
JSC, is Centerra’s largest shareholder, with a 33% stake.
The Kumtor gold mine, located in the Kyrgyz Republic, about 350 kilometres southeast of the
capital, Bishkek, and about 60 kilometres north of the border with the People’s Republic of
China. The deposit is being developed by open-pit mining techniques utilising typical drill, blast,
loading and haulage operations. The ore is delivered to the crusher and further to the mill,
where the gold is extracted using carbon-in-leach technology. Kumtor is aiming to produce an
average of 650,000 ounces of gold a year for the next decade. In 2012, a new Life of Mine
(LOM) plan was been submitted to extend production till 2026.
Despite the fact that the Kumtor gold deposit was discovered in 1978, the development of the
mine was delayed as the project was seen as being too costly. It was not until after Kyrgyzstan
gained independence that it found itself in a position to attract western investment to start
developing its own mineral resources. In 1992, the Government of Kyrgyzstan signed an
agreement with Canadian Cameco Corporation, one of the world’s largest uranium producers,
to develop Kumtor deposit
In 2009, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, Centerra Gold Inc. and Cameco Corp. signed
an Agreement on New Terms over the Kumtor deposit. This Agreement, after being ratified by
the national parliament, resolved all of the legal disputes, expanded the Company’s concession
area, and adopted a simplified and stabilised tax regime for the Kumtor project. Under the new
tax regime, gross revenue is taxed at a rate of 14%, which includes a 1% monthly contribution
to the Issyk-Kul Region Development Fund. The Kyrgyz Republic, represented in the Company
by Kyrgyzaltyn JSC, in its turn, increased its shares in Centerra up to approximately 33%.
The Government of Kyrgyzstan and Centerra are currently negotiating a restructuring
transaction under which Kyrgyzaltyn would receive a 50% interest in the joint venture company
that would own the Kumtor Project in exchange for its 32.7% equity ownership in Centerra and

US$100 million which will be provided to Centerra by way of an adjustment to joint venture
distributions otherwise due to Kyrgyzaltyn.27
Kyrgyzaltyn is a state owned enterprise specialising in gold mining. Its key assets are Makmal
Gold, Tereksai Mine, Solton-Sary Mine and a gold refinery. The company also has stakes in
several joint ventures (representing interest of the Kyrgyz Government), such as Centerra Gold
Inc. (Kumtor deposit in Kyrgyzstan and a number of deposits in Mongolia, Russia, Turkey and
the USA), Altynken LLC (Taldy-Bulak Levoberezhny in Kyrgyzstan) and Jerooyaltyn CJSC (Jerooy
deposit in Kyrgyzstan).
       •   Makmal Gold is the main production unit of Kyrgyzaltyn. The Makmal gold deposit was
           discovered and explored in 1969-1977 and put into operation in 1986. The number of
           technical and production personnel exceeds 1200 people. Over the last 10 years, it has
           produced 21.7 t of gold and a project is being implemented to extend the combinate life
           until 2016.
       •   Tereksai, located in the south, is one of the oldest mining enterprises in the country. For a
           long time it was focused on mining of antimony, accompanied by the mining of gold. At the
           beginning of the 1990s, the main product became gold, and about 150 kg is produced
           annually. Reserves of gold in the Tereksai zone, including the Perevalnoye deposit, are
           estimated at 20-25 t of gold. There are 395 employees. The floatation concentrate is
           exported to China and Kazakhstan.
       •   The Solton-Sary deposit is located in 355 km from Bishkek city. Based on an evaluation by
           the Territorial Reserves Committee in 2005, reserves comprise 6,97 t of gold with average
           grade of 3.48 g/t, amounting to 2981.1 kg of gold.
       •   In operation since 1993 , the refinery produces standard (bank) gold bars weighing about 11-
           13 kg, small gold bars weighing 1000 g and 100 g of the highest standard (999,9), and
           standard silver bars weighing about 25 kg (999,9 standard). Joint ventures were created by
           Kyrgyzaltyn to develop the Jerooy and Taldy-Bulak Levoberezhny deposits and process the
           produced precious metal at the refinery28

Organisational maturity in domestic procurement
In order to establish the maturity of Kumtor and Kyrgyzaltyn in embedding domestic
procurement into the strategy, policies and systems of their organisations, company
representatives responsible for local content were asked to conduct a self-assessment. The
results of the two companies are presented in Table 22. A self-assessment by Kumtor identified
a fairly low level of maturity on integrating domestic content into large contracts; and supplier
capability development. Relatively higher levels of commitment were apparent in recognising
the business value to be gained from domestic procurement; meeting regulatory requirements;
reporting; supply side analysis; and internal coordination. A self-assessment by Kyrgyzaltyn
identified very low levels of maturity across all dimensions of embedding domestic
procurement into company practice. According to the Kyrgyzaltyn representative this is due to
the fact that Kyrgyzaltyn has to follow Public Procurement Law and regulations that do not
allow for much room to support or give preference to domestic suppliers.

7.2.1 Demand Analysis
Kumtor Gold and Kyrgyzaltyn operate under different procurement and tax regimes that
regulate their domestic procurement practices.
The Restated Investment Agreement of 2009 between Centerra and the Kyrgyz republic
establishes a legal basis for Kumtor operations as well as a specific tax and customs regime. The
agreement does not include any provisions for domestic procurement. Kumtor follows Centerra
Gold’s procurement process from pre-qualification to contract award and management.
Tax and customs duty exemptions that apply to Kumtor procurement include the following:
          Kumtor Gold Corporation and Kumtor Operating Company are exempt from all
           withholding obligations with regard to payments to third parties. However, these third
           parties are not exempt from the relevant taxes to which the withholding would
           otherwise have related, subject to benefits provided in any applicable international
           treaties;
          Centerra and its subsidiaries (including Kumtor Gold Corporation and Kumtor Operating
           Company) are exempt from paying taxes with respect to intra-group transactions,
           including for services, dividends, interest and other distributions or transactions; and
          The Kumtor Project is exempt from paying customs duties in relation to imported
           goods.

As a state-owned company, Kyrgyzaltyn follows the Law on Public Procurement (PPL).
Procurement procedures include open tender, restricted tender, two-stage tender, request for
quotation and direct contracting. Open tender is the default procedure. The PPL regulates
eligibility and qualification criteria for public procurement procedures. The law determines
specific deadlines for some stages in the PP procedure.
Domestic preferences may be applied to any kind of procurement contract. Kyrgyzaltyn can
apply a 20% discount to the offer of any tenderer, who offers products of domestic origin, or
10% for local tenderers in the procurement of works. According to the PPL, domestic suppliers
are individual entrepreneurs or legal entities, registered as such in the Kyrgyzstan. Sole sourcing
is allowed from a list of domestic suppliers approved by the government. The list includes 32
industrial companies mainly with government participation.
Supply chain
Share of local and international suppliers reported by Kumtor and Kyrgyzaltyn are quite
different. As illustrated in Figures 25 and 26 below, Kumtor and Kyrgyzaltyn reported that
Kyrgyz suppliers respectively comprised 53% and 75% of their total number of current
suppliers. Despite the fact that Kyrgyzaltyn scored significantly lower on procurement maturity
self-assessment, the company has a higher share of local suppliers. Some of the factors that
account for the difference in the share of local procurement between the two companies
include:
          Scale of operations: Kumtor ‘s production volumes are about 40 times higher than
           Kyrgyzaltyn’s. Accordingly, the two companies consume different volumes of
           production inputs, in particular, in the categories of bulk construction materials,
           chemical products and fuel. Whereas local companies can meet KyrgyzAltyn’s smaller
           volume requirements, existing local supplies in these categories are not sufficient for
           Kumtor.
          Quality standards: KyrgyzAltyn’s local suppliers follow the same system of quality
           standards, i.e. Soviet developed GOSTs. Many of Kumtor’s production activities require
           inputs in compliance with international quality standards. Most local suppliers are
           unable to meet such standards.

          Level of sophistication of operations: Kumtor’s operations use more advanced
           technologies and production processes, therefore their higher value added inputs -
           tools and equipment - are more sophisticated and are not available locally.

Some of the procurement challenges faced by Centerra, Kumtor’s parent company, are related
to the remote locations of their properties, requiring lengthy lead times for equipment and
supplies. Furthermore, Kyrgyz operations are limited with respect to alternative suppliers of
-

major reagents and consumables, and any disruption at supplier facilities could result in
suspension of operations. Major equipment and components and certain key consumables are
imported.
Total spend for the Kumtor project was US$ 406.3 million for the period June 2012 – May 2013.
Kumtor defines ‘local spend’ as all items sourced from a company registered in Kyrgyzstan.
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts, capital equipment, major consumables and
reagents are not available for purchase in Kyrgyz Republic. These items comprise 48% of total
spend (fuel exclusive). Total spend for the period on consumables (goods and services) was US$
112.4 million (including US$ 10.8 million for electricity), of which 50.91% was spent with Kyrgyz
suppliers based in proximity to operations

Kumtor has launched a series of initiatives in 2013 in order to identify other potential Kyrgyz
suppliers not currently in their supply chain. Kyrgyz suppliers are invited to attend business
forums organised by Kumtor. The forums aim to:
      •    To review purchases made by the Company;
      •    Express future needs for materials, products and services;
      •    Provide information on basic requirements for suppliers and purchased products; and
      •    Provide information on procurement procedures.

In 2013, Kumtor has commenced a review of all items purchased internationally with the intent
of identifying further items that could be bought in Kyrgyzstan. A database of items being
purchased locally is maintained, so as to record successes and failures.
Kyrgyzaltyn reported that main categories of goods and services purchased internationally
include complex and high tech equipment, as such equipment is not produced in Kyrgyzstan.
The main suppliers are in Russia and China. Categories of goods and services that are
exclusively procured locally include catering, earthworks, transport, civil construction, and
drilling.
-

In many cases, Kyrgyzaltyn’s terms of delivery and payment implicitly favour local suppliers.
Due to the scale of operations and cash flow issues, Kyrgyzaltyn places small regular orders (e.g.
once a quarter/month) within longer framework contracts. Such terms may not be attractive to
international suppliers as the transportation costs of such small volumes of freights would be
prohibitive.

In cases where a foreign supplier has an advantage over domestic suppliers due to concessions
on taxes such as VAT, these factors are taken into account in calculating the price of a bid. For
example, the value of the tax concession is added to the price of a foreign supplier
Kyrgyzaltyn carries a demand analysis on an annual basis as part of the procurement planning
process. Starting in September, the company develops workplans for the following year and this
informs the procurement plan. The demand analysis includes a historical spend analysis and
existing/known sources of supply.
Community Procurement
Kumtor’s main motivation to procure locally, In addition to cost efficiencies, is the mitigation of
social risk. In the past several years there has been growing pressure on Kumtor from local
communities around the mine and central and local government to contribute more to the local
economy. Access to the Kumtor project has been restricted on several occasions by roadblocks
(e.g. in May 2013), leading to delays and shut down in production.
A priority for Kumtor is to procure from suppliers in communities near the mine and in the
region of Issyk Kul. In evaluating bids, Kumtor assigns higher scores to companies from Issyk
Kul. Some categories of goods and services are sourced only from local businesses e.g. meat,
fruit and dairy products which are produced locally if possible i.e. some products are seasonal
and need to be imported. These products are also sourced from local suppliers. In some
instances, instead of placing a large order with one local supplier, the order is broken into
smaller orders to accommodate more local suppliers (the example was shared of supplies of
cheese).
Kumtor cited several success stories of switching purchases from international suppliers to
local, such as electrical goods, tools, vehicle parts, IT equipment and services, cleaning material
-




Page 97 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




etc.; a Toyota fleet full maintenance service agreement, including supply of spare parts with a
Kyrgyz company; and 25mm grinding media.
Kumtor occasionally engages with the government to target the development of specific
suppliers (as was the case with a local lime producer). Such initiatives are only ad-hoc and there
is no systematic approach to supplier capability development. There appears to be no
coordination or information sharing on local suppliers with other mining companies, nor formal
or informal discussions of local supplier issues though business associations or other forums.
The procurement department relies solely on their internal database of suppliers.
Kyrgyzaltyn representatives also reported that the company takes into account community
relations and positive social impact by preferencing local suppliers and workforce. The
company’s operations are in remote, mountainous areas where levels of poverty are high.
According to the procurement manager, 95% of the workforce is employed from local
communities near the site.
Community Enterprise Development
Kumtor partners with international and local organisations to develop and implement
community development projects, some of which are focused on SMEs and micro-enterprises.
The projects are mainly focused on the region where the mine operates. Interestingly, Kumtor
deliberately focuses its support on businesses sectors and enterprises that are not in their
supply chain. The main reason offered for this approach is conflict mitigation, in an attempt to
avoid accusations of unfair preference given to specific suppliers.
Examples of enterprise support projects include:
          Microcredit Line for Ton Farmers, a three-year credit program launched in 2012.
           Support is provided to give credit to animal husbandry, farms, small and medium-sized
           businesses at Ton. Ayil Bank’s office in Bokonbayevo assists Kumtor in implementation.
           Credit is provided at a lower interest rate of 12% for a period of one to three years.
          A project supporting women's business initiatives has been implemented by Kumtor
           jointly with UN-Women.
          Kumtor, in cooperation with EBRD, Association AgroLid and the GIZ ‘Deutsche
           Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit’ has planned a training program
           designed to help villagers manage their businesses, ranging from fish farms, soil
           productivity, fruit processing, business planning and ecotourism. Participation in the
           EBRD trainings as well as the Centre’s services will be free of charge.
As part of its operating agreement, Kumtor pays 1% of gross annual revenues into the Issyk-Kul
Development Fund (IDF). Oversight is provided by a steering committee, which includes local
government representatives and NGOs. Earlier this year, there were media reports of local
government misusing the Fund and funnelling money for personal benefit. This fund, which
received than US$ 25 million from Kumtor since 2009, was designed to develop the
socioeconomic infrastructure in Issyk-Kul Oblast, through e.g. business support, kindergartens,
schools, sports clubs and irrigation infrastructure.
Kyrgyzaltyn has not reported any engagement in community enterprise development
initiatives.

7.2.2 Barriers to Increasing Domestic Procurement
Government Perspectives
The following barriers to local supplier linkages were mentioned by government
representatives:
      •    Lack of domestic manufacturing and higher value service capabilities, due to weak property
           rights, lack of technical and vocational skills, as well as lack of sources of financing.
      •    Lack of local content requirements in legislation. The government is planning to propose
           some amendments on local content in the subsoil legislation. However, there appears to be
           little understanding of international best practice. Government officials frequently referred
           to the Kazakh experience.
      •    Rigid supply chain practices of mining companies. This was particularly attributed to Chinese
           mining companies, as these are perceived to procure only from Chinese suppliers and
           Chinese contractors. Such practices often lead to conflicts with local communities that have
           high rates of unemployment.
      •    Perceived corrupt practices within mining companies. The perception exists that company
           leadership and procurement managers have vested interest in foreign suppliers.
Mining Operator Perspectives
The main barriers, as perceived by the mining sector, facing suppliers in Kyrgyzstan are:
    • Low understanding of international procurement and Industry standards and procedures;
    • Lack of technical knowledge/qualified staff;
    • Lack of finance;
    • Lack of production capabilities in the country. One interviewee expressed the view that
       “there are plenty of middlemen who can supply anything but not enough producers”. It was
       thought that the customs union with Russia and Kazakhstan will exclude Kyrgyz middlemen,
       as Kazakh and Russian producers of equipment will be able to establish distribution centres
       directly in Kyrgyzstan
    • Too small a market internally to develop producers; and
    • Lack of technical knowledge and quality education.

Industry representatives suggested three key roles that the Government could play in
overcoming barriers:
      •    Supporting the development of local producers;
      •    Taking into account the demand of the mining industry in developing economic
           development strategies and plans; and
      •    Implementing a national system of quality and safety standards that is in line with
           international standards.
-




Page 99 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




Supplier/SME Perspective
Access to finance. Bank financing is viewed as unaffordable, with high interest rates (20% at
National Bank level, 30-35% through other banks) and high collateral requirements. Companies
often supply goods and services on pre-payment terms (customer pays part - usually 30-50% -
of the contract value upfront and this cash is used to procure some or all inputs for the
contract) and re-invest profits to develop their businesses.
Skills shortages. Technical and vocational skills, including marketing and business planning,
emerged as requirements.
Lack of information on business opportunities in the mining sector. SMEs obtain information
mainly through personal contacts or existing cooperation agreements. Few tender
advertisements are published and mining companies do not actively engage with SME in tender
preparation.
Competition from foreign suppliers, particularly with regard to low-cost goods from China.
According to interviewed local suppliers, customs clearance is inexpensive for Chinese goods,
no VAT is paid and goods do not require Kyrgyz government certification. Kyrgyzstan accession
to the Customs Union is viewed positively by local companies as it will help them compete with
Chinese suppliers. The suppliers participate in various catalogues and databases (such as
Bishkek Modern, Yellow pages, Construction and Maintenance, Construction and Repair,
Tender.pro).
Import duties concessions for mining suppliers. Domestic producers have to pay 12% import
VAT and 10% customs duties on their imported inputs. Mining companies’ inputs (and in
Kumtor’s case, all operations-related imports) are exempt from import taxes and customs
duties. Local suppliers who do not have such exemption cannot compete with exempt foreign
suppliers.
Political instability, insecurity of property right, corruption. The violent change of government in
2010 was followed by a wave of property rights redistribution in the mining sector. Licences
were revoked and many mining companies left the country. Domestic suppliers lost established
business relations in the mining sector. Some SMEs who invested in inputs for supplies under
existing contracts incurred serious losses.
Standards and certification. The quality and certification of local supplies are often not
acceptable to international mining companies.
SME representatives suggested the following as key roles that the Government could play in
overcoming barriers:
          Providing a stable political environment;
          Development of standards and certification of products;
          Influencing the transparency of mining sector procurement;
          Improving access to finance;
          Reducing import taxes and customs duties on inputs;
          Developing a database of mining sector supply and demand; and
          Introducing local content policies.

7.2.3 Opportunities for Increased Domestic Procurement
Services opportunities
Kyrgyzaltyn, Kumtor and other mining companies that participated in the focus group took part
in a self-completion survey to identify goods and services with potential for market
development in Kyrgyzstan. The results, which were fairly consistent across the companies,
were averaged and presented in Figure 29 below.
Competitive supplier market already exists within Kyrgyzstan: computer maintenance and
system servicing, load and haul (contracted services, spares, consumables, maintenance),
transport/logistics, security, facilities light maintenance (buildings, including air conditioning),
accounting services, banking and financial services, fleet management (car truck rental and
other vehicles), telecommunications and data systems, personnel training, supply chain services
(customs, warehousing, transports), legal services, light vehicle maintenance financial and
business advisory professional services, hospitality services (including camp catering, laundry,
etc.), and health services.
High potential to be developed in country but lack the required investment: earthworks,
tunnelling, piles & caissons, building (including camp) construction; paving and surfacing, site
improvements, including landscaping, personnel services: manpower; electrical equipment
(installation, repair and maintenance), blasting (explosive, transports and services, site
preparation), laboratory activities, energy services (fuel, electricity), insurance services, drilling
(contracted services, spares, consumables, maintenance, tyre tracks), civil works construction
and maintenance, environmental risk assessment services, heavy vehicle maintenance; waste
management (recycling and disposal), crushing and grinding (consumables, repair &
maintenance), and environmental services.
Medium potential given some technical/financial support: equipment maintenance
(generators, pumps, crushers etc.), demolition and site preparation, management and technical
maintenance services (engineering, planning, survey), and recovery activities

Goods opportunities
The responses of Kyrgyzaltyn and Kumtor differed in terms of identifying goods that have
potential for market development in Kyrgyzstan. These are presented as separate in Figure 30
below. The difference in responses can be explained by the differences in the scale of
operations, level of sophistication of operations and quality standards requirements of the two
companies.
Competitive supplier market already exists within Kyrgyzstan: cleaning and camp consumables
products; furniture and fixtures; and stationery/office supplies.
High potential with investment: bulk construction materials (cement, gravel, aggregate, etc.);
and hardware (tools, paints, nails, small parts, etc.).
Medium potential with technical/financial support of potential suppliers: basic tools.
Limited potential (form Kumtor’s perspective): equipment and equipment supplies, fuel, energy
and chemical products.

7.2.4 Opportunities to Diversify Economy through Mining Supply Chains
Mining sector upstream value chains and opportunities for local supplier development in
Kyrgyzstan have not been studied to date. The findings in this section are based on the
opportunities identified by mining companies, triangulated with customs statistics on main
categories of imported goods, reports of the government and international organisations on
the development of the industrial sector in Kyrgyzstan and interviews with suppliers,
government officials and business associations.
Production linkages with high potential for development
These linkages are the ‘low hanging fruit’ where domestic capabilities enable local firms to
produce competitively, in that they require low skills, or where the country enjoys competitive
advantages in the natural resource base or human capital endowment. The following measures
can be taken to improve linkages in this category:
      •    Technical assistance and access to finance to improve quality standards, upgrade business
           skills (marketing, management, logistics);
      •    Better matchmaking between mining companies and suppliers through supplier databases;
      •    Simplification of procurement procedures to accommodate less sophisticated local
           suppliers;
      •    Adjustment of procurement practices to accommodate lower supply volumes of SMEs; and
      •    Adjustment of payment terms by mining companies (upfront payments) to help local
           suppliers overcome lack of access to loan finance – operational and capital.

Agricultural and foods processing businesses. There are abundant local producers in most
categories of food consumed by the mining sector. Some issues include low quality and small
volumes of supplies, as these businesses tend to be SMEs.
Sewing businesses. These are the most developed small scale industries, where over 200,000
people are employed, out of which over 80% are women. The majority of the sewing
workshops are located in or nearby Bishkek. They have the potential to meet mining sector
needs for uniforms and other textile products.
Construction, installation, assembly, earthwork and paving businesses. This is a well-developed
sector with numerous suppliers in all regions of the country. Some local construction materials
are used. Whereas these businesses enjoy abundant unskilled labor, there are shortages of
skilled technical and vocational professionals. They also suffer from high costs of loan capital to
finance their purchases of equipment, and imported inputs.
Construction materials and some production inputs, e.g. lime. The country has hundreds of
deposits of construction materials, mining and chemical raw materials. There are three cement
plants with a capacity of 1 million tons per year (the Kant Plant), 300 thousand tons (Tehnolin
LLC) and 70 thousand tons (the Kurment plant), dozens of brick factories and quarries for the
extraction of sand and gravel, loam, clay, limestone, and gypsum. Some issues include low
quality of products and low volumes of supply.
Drilling. There are 10-15 active drilling companies which provide drilling services to exploration
and mining companies. Issues include insufficient or outdated drilling equipment, absence of
qualified specialists, and difficult and burdensome requirements established for import of
drilling equipment and fluids used for drilling.
Production linkages with medium potential for development
Some capacity and capabilities exist which are within the potential reach of local linkage firms.
The primary barrier in this category of domestic linkage development will be investment and
targeted government- private sector strategies to upgrade technology, facilities and skills to
meet the quality and scale requirements of the mining sector. Additionally, these linkages
require the same support measures as high level production linkages.

Design, engineering, procurement, construction management. There are a number of
providers, such as Ken-Too Project and Research Institute, Aziarudproekt CJSC, Eco-Service LLC,
Ala-Too Project and Research Institute, and Poisk LLC. These organisations, which used to be
part of Soviet ministries, suffer from out-dated technologies and lack of qualified specialists.
Laboratory services. Basic laboratory services are offered by a number of laboratories, of which
Central Laboratory subordinate to the Ministry of Geology as well as Alex Stuart, the
international certified laboratory should be specifically mentioned. Mining companies use them
for simpler lab test, and send samples for more complex test abroad.
Production linkages beyond feasible reach of local suppliers
A combination of technological barriers and small market size leads to local suppliers being
relatively disadvantaged. These categories mainly include goods that are heavily imported in
Kyrgyzstan (refer to Table 23):
      •    Fuel
      •    Steel Construction Materials
      •    Goods with a high technological component – machinery, equipment and tools.

7.3 Tajikistan Domestic Procurement Practices
Due to the relatively smaller scale of mining operations in Tajikistan, the project did not engage
in detailed case studies in this country. Instead, data on demand and supply and domestic
procurement barriers was collected through an abbreviated questionnaire sent by email and
followed up with phone interviews. The following companies were invited to take part in the
survey:
      •    Zerafshan, a Tajik-Chinese venture developing Jilau and Taror primary gold ore deposits in
           Sughd region. The Chinese ZiJin Mining Group Co Ltd has a 75% stake in the joint venture;
      •    Aprelevka, a Tajik-British mining company. Kairakkum gold mine and a gold processing plant
           are the main assets;
      •    Pakrut LLC, a gold mine that is 100% held by the British company Kryso Resources Ltd;
      •    Anzob Mine, a Tajik-American Limited Liability conducting underground mining, processing
           and production of mercury-antimony concentrate; and
      •    Rumri Gold, a Tajik- Canadian joint venture exploring the Rumri gold field in Tavildara district
           of eastern Tajikistan.

Despite numerous follow-up attempts, only one completed questionnaire was returned, from
the junior mining company involved in the exploration of the Rumri gold deposit. A brief
interview was also conducted with the operations manager of Anzob Mine.
Several domestic suppliers who have worked with the mining sector within the past five years
were also engaged through semi-structured interviews, covering the following subjects:
      •    Business enabling environment for domestic suppliers, including access to finance, access to
           business service providers, and access to infrastructure;
      •    Engagement with mining companies, including tender process, quality, HSE, volumes, terms
           of supply, payment etc.;
      •    Competition with foreign suppliers; and
      •    Role of government in supporting SMEs.

The government perspective on domestic procurement was explored and interviews were
conducted with the State Committee on Investments and the State Property Management
(GosKomInvest). The Committee promotes mining sector investment and champions mining
sector reforms, including a mining strategy, changes to the mining legislation to bring it in line
with international standards, and improvements to the country's mineral licensing regime.
To gain civil society perspectives on the subject, the National Association of Small and Medium
Businesses of Tajikistan (NASMB) and the Chamber of Commerce and Trade of Tajikistan were
also engaged.


7.3.1 Barriers to Increasing Domestic Procurement
Government Perspectives
As described previously, domestic procurement and local content are new issues for the Tajik
government. There is little understanding of mining sector supplier issues as there are no large
mining operations in Tajikistan. However, GosKomInvest welcomed the local content discussion
and expressed an interest in engaging with the World Bank in follow up work. With regard to
local content regulations, Kazakh subsoil legislation was mentioned as a model regulatory
framework.
From GosKomInvest’s perspective, the main issues hindering mining sector local production
linkages include:
-




Page 106 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




      •    Lack of government capacity and experience to prepare investment proposals and tender
           documentation and conduct negotiations for large mining projects, inclusive of local
           content. The Konimansur tender process has been going on for several years and has proved
           a steep learning curve for Tajik government;
      •    Lack of an overarching government strategy for industrial development;
      •    Lack of an ‘information space’ in the industrial sector, specifically, the lack of supply and
           demand databases; and
      •    Gas and power supply issues. Many producers of inputs for the mining sector, such as
           cement plants, had scaled down or shut down production as a result of losing their source of
           power, as Uzbekistan stopped supplying natural gas to Tajikistan due to disputes over
           irrigation water.

Mining Operator Perspectives
The two participating mining companies expressed the following issues facing domestic
procurement in Tajikistan:
      •    Lack of local industrial capacity;
      •    An acute shortage of highly qualified technical specialists, geologists and senior managers;
      •    Lack of facilities for training, retraining and improvement of professional skills of local staff;
           and
      •    Lack of access to finance and infrastructure, high tax rates, and customs duties on imported
           inputs.

Supplier/SME Perspectives
SMEs commented that in the past three years the enabling environment for SMEs has
improved, through the introduction of a ‘single shopfront’ process for receiving permits,
licences and registration. Their views on barriers focused on:
      •    Access to finance, specifically, high interest rates and unaffordable collateral requirements;
      •    Access to infrastructure, including electricity connections, availability of railroads and
           highways, particularly for suppliers of bulk freights such as industrial salt;
      •    Availability of information on business opportunities;
      •    Limited understanding of tender procedures, with limited assistance provided by mining
           companies with regard to tender preparation;
      •    Competition from Chinese suppliers of goods and services. It was perceived that Chinese
           contractors in particular were bringing their own low skilled workforce rather than using
           Tajik workers;
      •    Low levels of skills especially in vocational and technical professions; and
      •    Need for government support to overcome supplier development barriers; including
           developing and introducing international systems of quality standards and certification;
           subsidising loans; tax and customs duties concessions for SMEs; and training of personnel.

7.3.2 Opportunities for Increased Domestic Procurement
The junior miner that responded to the self-completion survey identified a number of goods
and services that have potential for market development in Tajikistan. The results are
presented in Figures 31 and 32 below.

7.3.3 Opportunities to Diversify Economy through Mining Supply Chains
To date, there have not been any studies of mining sector upstream value chains in relation to
opportunities for local supply development in Tajikistan. High-level findings in this section are
based on information collected during interviews with stakeholders in Tajikistan, questionnaire
responses of a junior mining company, as well as customs statistics information and reports of
the government and international organizations on the development of the industrial sector in
Tajikistan.
Any detailed analysis of mining production linkage opportunities would need to include the
perspective of TALCO, the aluminium smelter, as the company is the largest consumer of local
industrial supplies. TALCO was not covered by the scope of this study.
Production linkages with high potential for development
These include sectors with low skills, and where the country enjoys natural competitive
advantages in the natural or human capital, for example:
      •    Construction, earthworks and paving works. Tajikistan was a major source of construction,
           earthwork and paving workforce in the former Soviet Union. There are numerous local
           companies in various regions of the country.
      •    Agricultural and foods processing businesses. The country is a large producer and exporter of
           agricultural products. The sector is dominated by individual farmers and small producers.
     •     Textile and clothing businesses. There are many large companies and SMEs in the textiles
           and clothing industry that formed around cotton. Tajikistan’s largest export commodity.
-




Page 109 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




           These companies have capabilities to supply uniform and other textile needs of mining
           operations.
Similar to the case of Kyrgyzstan, improving linkages in this category would be facilitated by
measures such as:
       •   Technical assistance and access to finance to improve quality standard and upgrade business
           skills (marketing, management, logistics);
       •   Better matchmaking between mining companies and suppliers through supplier data bases;
       •   Simplification of procurement procedures to accommodate less sophisticated local
           suppliers;
       •   Adjustment of procurement practices to accommodate lower supply volumes of SMEs; and
       •   Adjustment of payment terms by mining companies (upfront payments) to help local
           suppliers overcome lack of access to loan finance (operational and capital).
Production linkages with medium potential for development
Some capacity and capabilities exist which are within the potential reach of local firms. The
primary barrier in this category of domestic linkage development will be investment and
targeted government-private sector strategies to upgrade technology, facilities and skills to
meet the quality and scale requirements of the mining sector. Additionally, these linkages
require the same support measures as described above for high level production linkages.
Some examples are:
       •   Construction materials production inputs. Tajikistan has a large resource base of
           construction material and produces many types of construction materials including cement,
           brick, sand and gravel, loam, clay, limestone. A major issue facing the sector is the lack of
           natural gas as the traditional source of power.
       •   Chemical products. There are several chemical plants that can potentially supply the sector –
           Tajikhimporm, Tajikazot, Isfara Chemical Plant - as well as small producers.
       •   Design, engineering, procurement, construction management. There is a number of state-
           owned organisations providing these services. However, they suffer from outdated
           technologies and lack of qualified specialists.
Production linkages beyond feasible reach of local suppliers
These categories, hindered by a combination of technological barriers and market size, mainly
include goods that are heavily imported in Tajikistan (see Table 24 below), i.e. fuel, steel
construction materials, vehicles, and goods with a high technological component such as
equipment and tools.

8. Recommendations
The pilot study has identified a range of constraints faced in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan in seeking to maximise local content outcomes by building respective industrial bases.
A number of these constraints present opportunities for the World Bank to further support
these countries in this pursuit. The opportunities, outlined below in a set of recommendations,
are specifically related to working with the governments to promote upstream linkages,
especially in mining-effected regions. These recommendations are not premised on quick fixes.
Change is incremental and involves alignment of policy direction within and across all layers of
government, industry cooperation and the management of significant public expectation
around the benefits flowing from mining sector investment.
Amongst the three countries, Kazakhstan is by far the most comparatively advanced in seeking
to capture economic value from domestic procurement by the mining industry. The key
questions the Kazakh government faces are: (1) how the mining sector can be used to increase
diversification and (2) how to adapt protectionist measures currently within local content
regulations and select instruments that develop local suppliers yet are consistent with WTO
rules. This study has identified certain goods and services consumed by the industry that have
strong linkages to other sectors. The recommendations below elaborate on ways in which these
supply sectors can be targeted for further development.
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, at earlier stages of domestic procurement maturity, would benefit
greatly from technical assistance on how to increase local content, and related to this, how to
enhance mining supply industrialisation through supplier linkages programs.
The recommendations also consider interventions to address other crucial elements, such as
Technical and Vocational Education, green technologies with potential to be commercialised by
local SMEs, local content advisory for specific mining investment transactions, credit guarantee
schemes, visibility of domestic procurement in the framework of EITI, and expansion of the
World Bank’s current enabling environment interventions in Kazakhstan to Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan.

8.1 Technical assistance on enhancing industrialisation through upstream
    mining linkages
There is an opportunity for the World Bank to support the governments of Tajikistan and
Kyrgyzstan to develop and implement local procurement strategies and policies. Such policies
and strategies would be mindful of existing levels of economic development, the countries’
international obligations e.g. to WTO, as well as of promoting transparency and investment in
the mining sector. The proposed technical assistance would be provided to Kyrgyzstan (to the
Ministry of Economic Development and to the State Agency of Geology) and Tajikistan (to
GosKomInvest, the Main Geology Department and Ministry of Energy and Industry).
Strategy Development
Without a vision, it is unlikely that detailed policies can be developed to effectively support the
development of linkages into and out of the mining sector. This vision is required at the highest
level of government, since it involves the mobilisation of adequate resources, the development
of coordinated policies which span a variety of ministries and the capacity to bring all key
stakeholders on board. Governments can encourage mining companies to jointly develop an
explicit and long-term strategy to promote the development of production linkages.
To achieve this, both governments and mining companies need an informed knowledge base
which enables them to map out a desired future. Beyond knowledge of the basic resource
itself, there is the need to understand the key linkages into and out of the mining sector, their
skills and training needs, and their enabling environment requirements. Similarly, mining
companies need to be aware of the government’s strategy and its thinking on policy
development, as well as to have an informed map of existing and potential local suppliers and
-




Page 111 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




customers. They also need to have an informed view of the strategic locational strategies and
supply chain development capabilities of its first-tier suppliers and customers.
Policy Capacity
Beyond the development of strategy lies the crafting of policies. This may involve World Bank
support in building institutional capacity in a range of different ministries, e.g. ministries
responsible for the mining sector, for the development of industry, for trade policy, for the
development and regulation of infrastructure, for skills development, capability building and
innovation and for the environment.
Underlying successful implementation of a strategy is the capacity of government employees
and the routines which back their behaviour. Governments may have ambitious local content
policies in relation to the capabilities to implement these policies. In some cases, they may
specify local content in detail without any clear knowledge of the technologies involved or the
whether there is an underlying industry capability to meet demand. Policy incentives and
sanctions need also to be fit-for-purpose but primarily designed to be enabling.
Attempts to accelerate the development of the mining related industries can lead to a policy
environment in which FDI is incentivised by conditions which are by their very nature
contradictory in intent against other prevailing policies. For example, investors may offer duty-
free imports of inputs while local suppliers are required to pay import duty on their inputs.
Thus, not only is the ensemble of policies failing to promote backward linkages (by providing for
duty-free importation of inputs in this case), but also they may in fact actively restrict local
linkages (since they penalise the costs of domestic suppliers).
Kyrgyzstan
As per the National Development strategy 2013-2017, the Government’s priority is to increased
revenue and economic benefits from mining through (1) production diversification and
integration into the world economy; (2) improved investment climate; (3) introduction of new
and green technologies; and (4) better balance of interests of mining companies, the
government and communities.
One of the policy measures is the development of the medium-term strategy for development
of the mining industry for 2013-2015. The Ministry of Economy is responsible of the mid-term
strategy. USAID project REFORMA and its contractor Deloitte and Kyrgyz Mining Association are
developing the strategy, however, it does not appear that local content / domestic
procurement is intended to be part of the strategy. There is an opportunity to strengthen the
gap during the development of the implementation plan later this year. The Ministry of
Economy will need specialised technical advice in this area as it appears to be outside the scope
and experience of the current USAID REFORMA implementers.
In Kyrgyzstan, there is also scope to engage with the Ministry of Economy to include mining
sector- manufacturing linkages in the implementation of the following activities belonging to
the government’s manufacturing sector development program for 2013-2015. The program
addresses the following priorities:
      •    Development of proposals to establish industrial zones;
      •    Identification of competitive advantages of regions and development of regional industrial
           development plans;
      •    Development of a draft program for a vocational and technical education system to meet
           the needs of industry;
      •    Introduction of product quality and safety assurance systems to meet international
           standards; and
      •    Creation of international accredited testing laboratories.
-

Tajikistan
In Tajikistan, there is a scope to engage with GosKomInvest and other ministries responsible for
mining sector reform, through the World Bank’s Private Sector Competitiveness project, to
ensure that local supplier linkages captured in government policy and regulations for the
sector.

8.2 Scope mining sector linkage initiatives for the development of
    domestic suppliers
A supplier linkage program can provide an effective way to leverage the broader benefits of FDI
more closely into the domestic economy, encouraging local sourcing of inputs, including labour,
and strengthening relationships with domestic firms in research and product development. Key
elements of such an initiative include:
      •    Framework for assessment and selection of participating companies;
      •    Database detailing products and capabilities of local SMEs and mining investors to provide
           easy access to interested participants;
     •     Technical assistance facility;
     •     Financing facility;
     •     Programmes for skills development (training, curriculum reform);
     •     Promotional and marketing services (including matchmaking events, roadshows); and
     •     Quality standards technical assistance.

Pilot linkages projects are recommended for Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. This would involve
identifying those economic sectors which would benefit most from the implementation of a
linkage program, to focus on sectors with a high economic development impact. A pilot project
could more easily be implemented in a low-technology sector such as works and services-
earthworks, construction materials etc., as technology intensive projects, e.g. in value added
manufacturing, would require significantly more resources and a longer timeframe for
implementation.
The linkage initiatives could be set up with other development partners, to complement their
existing programs:
      •    OECD Central Asia Business Linkage Program, part of the OECD Eurasia Competitiveness
           Programme
      •    GIZ Minerals for Development Project
      •    USAID and GIZ regional trade projects, in particular quality standards and certification
           components

One example of a successful linkage program in the region is the BP Azerbaijan Enterprise
Centre. The World Bank could support a study tour involving a group of stakeholders in
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, so that they can benefit directly from the lessons learnt of BP and its
partners. Other best practice examples are found in Chile and Brazil.
Kazakhstan
In Kazakhstan, the two mining companies interviewed for the study identified that, with some
investment, technical and financial support, a number of goods and services procured by the
mining sector have potential to be developed in Kazakhstan.
      •    Goods: cleaning and camp consumables; explosives; stationery/office supplies; dry foods;
           energy (fuel, gas); and bulk construction materials; hardware; equipment and supplies;
           chemical products; basic tools; rubber technical products; refractory products; and rolled
           metal.
-




Page 113 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




      •    Services: security services; insurance services; financial business and advisory services;
           hospitality services; civil works construction and maintenance; building (including camp
           construction); earthworks, tunnelling, piles and caissons; and energy services;
           telecommunications and data systems; personnel services training; supply chain services;
           banking and financial services; personnel services; accounting services; environmental
           services; site improvements; paving and surfacing; recovery activities; crushing and grinding;
           and blasting.

Within these, NADLoC identified four main supply sectors to the mining industry that have
potential linkages to other sectors in the Kazakhstan economy. As such, their development
provides opportunities for diversification: chemicals, light industry, metallurgy; and production
of machinery.
The study identified that Kazakhstan could benefit with more structured supplier linkages
programs that offer training, advisory services and access to finance. DAMU appears to be the
only option available to SMEs, and was described as focused more on financing than advisory
services, and an overly bureaucratic system. Even if SMEs are successful with accessing finance
through DAMU, they still have to go through the mainstream banking system that on-lends
DAMU money.
The next stage of analysis for the World Bank, to inform design of pilot linkages programs
targeted to these goods and services, might involve answering the following questions:
      •    Which of these goods and services, if developed, simultaneously support the Government of
           Kazakhstan’s drive for diversification? Specifically, which have linkages to targeted sectors
           such as transport, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, petrochemicals and food
           processing?
      •    Which of these goods and services have the potential to be sourced from mining regions,
           and contribute to the greatest multipliers at a local level?
      •    For which of these goods and services are SME upgrading interventions most likely to
           catalyse value added activities, rather than remain locked into low value added activities?
      •    Of these goods and service which have high economic development impact (i.e. contribute
           to diversification and local level multipliers and have high value add), which have the
           potential to be internationally competitive and have export potential?

A supplier linkages program should address institutional strengthening of existing associations
in mining regions and relevant SEZ’s; and the development and maintenance of a reliable and
up to date local supplier database.

8.3 Technical assistance in Technical and Vocational Education
All three countries would benefit from support such as the World Bank is currently providing in
partnership with Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Education and Science, a project to raise the
relevance, quality, and efficiency of Technical and Vocational Education (TVE) through an
improved policy framework and institutional capacity.
The program should be expanded to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and adapted in Kazakhstan. In
all three countries, the focus would be on the TVE needs of targeted supply sectors to the
mining industry, and include:
      •    Development of the National Qualifications System and occupational standards in selected
           priority sectors, and an upgrade in the assessment of the qualifications and institutional
           accreditation of TVE institutions;
      •    Modernisation of the governance, management, and financing policies and structures for
           TVE; and
      •    Strengthening of the skills delivery capacity of TVE institutions.
-

8.4 Support green technologies in the Kazakh mining sector with potential
    to be commercialised by local SMEs
The World Bank could encourage innovation and environmentally friendly goods for the mining
sector that have the potential to be commercialised by Kazakh suppliers. Opportunities should
be explored in consideration of the green economy focus of Kazakhstan’s upcoming Expo 2017.
The existing World Bank Technology Commercialisation Project could be leveraged, which is
conducted in partnership with Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Education and Science. The project
includes a competitive grant program selected and overseen by the International Science and
Commercialization Board to finance R&D projects conducted by groups of senior scientists and
junior researchers, and to develop a world class research infrastructure in the International
Materials Science Centre. Also included is a Technology Commercialisation Office to finance and
broker partnerships between Kazakhstani scientists and local and international technology
markets.
The program could be expanded to specifically target energy and water saving technologies
applied by the mining industry.

8.5 Technical assistance on allowable supplier development instruments
    in a WTO environment
Applied in the right context, trade related investment measures may help domestic suppliers
connect to GVCs and upgrade their capacities. The current mandatory requirements in
Kazakhstan may be a disincentive for mining firms and their large suppliers and contractors in
selecting Kazakhstan as a host country for the location of GVC activities. The challenge is to
identify which incentives are consistent with a WTO environment.
The World Bank is currently involved in a project ‘Improvement of Competitiveness through
Reduction of Trade Barriers’ in partnership with the Kazakhstan Ministry of Economy and
Budget Planning and Ministry of Industry and New Technology, through the Joint Economic
Research Program (JERP) 2012–2013. The Bank is:
      •    Supporting Government efforts to acquire knowledge and capacity in updating the analysis
           of the impacts of Kazakhstan’s continued integration into the Common Economic Space
           (CES) and the upcoming WTO accession on trade dynamics in different sectors and with key
           partners;
      •    Undertaking an institutional assessment of trade policy formulation and implementation;
      •    Analysing Kazakhstan’s exports survival performance; and
      •    Supporting continued policy dialogue, knowledge transfer, and capacity building in the
           analysis of nontariff measures.

All three countries would benefit from an expert assessment of which measures are
appropriate to support the development of target sectors supplying the mining industry.

8.6 Local Content advisory for specific mining investment transactions
A further recommendation is to provide World Bank’s local content expertise to the
governments of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to support them in tender preparations and
negotiations to ensure the inclusion of domestic supplier considerations when awarding
concessions and licenses to mining companies. Two potential transactions what could benefit
from the World Bank’s support are:
Jerooy project in Kyrgyzstan. The first tender for the development of this gold deposit failed this
year as only one bid was submitted. The tender documentation included a US$ 52 million ‘social
package’ – a list of potential investments in social infrastructure development. The government
plans to conduct another tender before the end of the year. With the World Bank’s assistance,
-




Page 115 – Final REPORT: Increasing Domestic Procurement by the Mining Industry in Central Asia, 2014




the social package could be revisited to include measures to increase domestic procurement
and support local businesses, and ensure that such measures are aligned with the industrial
base and the level of economic development of the Talas region, and are within the
government’s capacity to enforce and monitor.
Konimansur project in Tajikistan. The tender process for this large silver deposit has been
ongoing for the past four years. Presently, the government is conducting negotiations with a
consortium led by Glencore and Kazzinc. If negotiations fail, the government plans to retender
Konimansur30. One of the measures that Kazzinc is considering, in preparation for project
implementation, is training of the local workforce at its training facilities in Kazakhstan31. World
Bank/IFC technical assistance could help the government of Tajikistan and the prospective
operator coordinate their efforts in local content development and ensure that these efforts
are aligned with the Sughd region’s development priorities.

8.7 Establish Credit Guarantee Schemes for supply sectors
To address the dominant theme of lack of access to affordable finance, the World Bank could
assist all three governments in establish credit guarantee schemes (CGS) aimed at mining
suppliers. International experience suggests that a CGS can help improve lending to SMEs by
outsourcing part of the risk to a third party, i.e. a credit guarantee facility which provides an
insurance for banks against loan default in exchange of a fee. In case of default, the lender
recovers the value of the guarantee, provided by the credit guarantee facility. The advantage of
such a mechanism is that it allows SMEs with insufficient or lack of collateral but with high cash
flow potential to access formal bank credit. As a side-effect, by working with SMEs, the banks
can gradually develop expertise in assessing their risk and specialise in lending to the SME
sector.
One example is the OECD CGS for Manufacturing SMEs. Kazakhstan also has a CGS for
agribusiness. In setting up a CGS, Central Asian governments would benefit from looking at
international experience to take into account lessons learned from both successful and failed
schemes in other countries. For example, experience shows that it is important to clearly define
the mission of the guarantee scheme to reduce the conflict of interests between the guarantor
and lending institutions participating in the management of the guarantee scheme.
Furthermore, schemes were particularly successful when lending institutions were actively
involved in the evaluation of the SME risk, allowing the banks also to gain expertise and
specialise in SME lending (e.g. in Chile). To increase the positive impact on the SME sector, the
CGSs could also target a specific sector or group of firms (e.g. in Lithuania). Finally, conducting
impact analysis and monitoring the beneficiary firm’s business development is crucial to assess
the tool’s effectiveness.

8.8 Increase visibility of domestic procurement in the framework of EITI in
    all three countries
Even though Kazakhstan has a strong regulatory framework for increasing local content, and
systems for enforcement and transparent monitoring and reporting of non-compliance,
unethical procurement practices are still prevalent. The high level of state intervention appears
to be creating perverse incentives for market participants to work in a parallel, unregulated,
procurement system. Further, relying on regulated avenues to influence domestic procurement
may not be effective, as the proportion of procurement that is regulated is minor compared
with total procurement activities undertaken by a company.
Kazakhstan’s candidature of the EITI presents a platform for measures to increase the
transparency of domestic procurement and reduce the potential for corrupt practices in

procurement. The World Bank could play a role in providing technical assistance on selecting
effective measures which do not significantly add to the existing compliance burden on
industry.

8.9 Expand current business enabling environment interventions in
    Kazakhstan to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan
Two existing World Bank programs in Kazakhstan that could be expanded/tailored to increase
the ease of doing business in target supply sectors to the mining industry include:
      •    Improving Conditions for Doing Business to Increase Competitiveness and Facilitate Economic
           Diversification: In partnership with the Ministry of Regional Development, through JERP
           2009–2013, the Bank provides technical assistance to:
               o Modernise the licensing and permits legal framework, reducing unnecessary
                     barriers for firms to operate through the informed and orderly elimination of
                     unnecessary licenses and permits; and a reduction of the regulatory burden on
                     firms through a reduction of undue inspections; and
               o Elimination of business environment obstacles identified in the Doing Business
                     report.
      •    Customs Development Project: This project aims to support the Customs Control Committee
           (CCC) in order to achieve the following:
               o Reduce customs processing time at border posts and clearance time at inland posts;
               o Reduce physical inspections of import declarations by customs and number of
                     documents required for border and customs clearance for imports;
               o Increased effectiveness of total customs revenue collection;
               o Establishment of client service standards covering key customs outputs with
                     improved performance on an annual basis; and
               o Improved perception of traders and other stakeholders regarding the frequency of
                     unofficial payments to customs officials.
