THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        The certificate of alignment is issued by the Municipality of

        with respect to public roads.

        The official cost is €62.15 per 10 linear meters in the front of the
        building. In the Doing Business case study, the front of the
        building is assumed to be 30 meters, so the total cost would be
        €186.45.

        Agency: Municipality of Madrid



        Request and obtain a certificate of compliance (certificado
        de conformidad)

        Prior to applying for the construction permit, BuildCo must
        obtain a compliance certificate. This certificate is the provisional
        license which can be obtained from two agencies - Municipality
        or Entidades Colaboradoras Urbanisticas - ECU according to the
        new Local Ordinance of the City Council of Madrid ("Ordenanza
        para la apertura de actividades economicas en la ciudad de                 60 days               EUR 5,902

        The ECU has 2 months to examine the documentation and grant
        the compliance certificate. Once the compliance certificate has
        been granted, it must be attached to the building permit
        application.

        The final construction permit is issued by the Municipality. Once
        the building license is issued by the Municipality of Madrid,

      * Obtain approval of draft project proposal and
      implementation plan (Visado del proyecto básico y proyecto

      The College of Architects of Madrid must approve BuildCo’s draft
      project proposal and implementation plan. In particular, the
      College of Architects of Madrid verifies the professional
      qualifications of the individual in charge of the construction work
      and validates the correctness and completeness of the
      documentation provided for the project with respect to
      regulations.

      The following documentation must be provided:

      -report on the project
      -implementation plan
      -administrative and technical conditions’ statement

      approval = Módulo x C x S x Qv x F / 6000. For a warehouse such
      as the Doing Business case study: M = 497.43; C = 9.00; S =

      According to the building license, one on-site inspection must be
      carried out during construction and one at the end of the
      process.

      If, during the inspections, the committee detects any possible
      infringements of the building regulations or criminal law, a
      proposal on sanctions must be made, and a copy of the written
      record is given to the public prosecutor. At minimum,
      administrative proceedings are initiated.

      In each inspection report, a record is included that provides
      information on every person involved and their roles, as well as
      on the facts, circumstances, dates, and results of the inspection.
      The record is regarded as a public administrative deed. The
      record must be signed by the inspector(s) and by the person to
      whom the construction works have been attributed at the time
      of the inspection.

      Once construction works have been completed, the architect and
      surveyor must sign off a document certifying that the
      construction has followed the approved plans. Therefore, both
      individuals are responsible for the construction performed. This
      completion certificate must be approved by the College of

        Obtain administrative approval for connection project

        For any kind of electrical project an administrative authorization has to
        be obtained from the General Directorate for Industry, Energy and
        Mining (Dirección General de Industria, Energía y Minas; Consejería de

        inspected for the purpose of the approval (Iberdrola will later on do an
        inspection to ensure that the project has been realized according to the
        plans approved by the General Directorate).

      * Obtain license for external works from City Council

      Customers need to obtain a license for the external works from the
      municipality. The tax for this license is charged as 4% of the cost of the
      works, plus a fee for provision of urban services (‘Tasa por prestación de
      servicios urbanísticos’), and a fee for private use of public spaces (‘Tasa

      Await completion of connection works by Iberdrola or private firm

      Customers have two choices: The external connection works can be done
      by Iberdrola or the customer can hire a private licensed electrical
      constructor.

      In most cases, for a connection with a capacity of 140 kVA, customers
      hire a private company to carry out the works. For such a capacity, the
      connection is considered in most cases as medium voltage (connections
      are considered low voltage if they are below 100 kVA).                        30 calendar days     EUR 46,000

      A transformer station will have to be installed and the station remains in
      the possession of the customer given that he pays for it in its entirety.
      Iberdrola considers the transformer part of the internal wiring
      installations of the client.

        Obtain clearance of electrical installation

        The customer obtains a clearance of the electrical installation (‘acta de
        puesta en servicio’) from the General Directorate for Industry, Energy and
        Mining to certify that it is in compliance with its requirements. The
        documents to be presented are:

        Irrespective of who executes the actual works of the connection
        (installation of the transformer, excavation for cables etc.), Iberdrola is
        always in charge of installing the meter and the final energization of the
        project. The meter can be rented or bought by the customer. Most
        clients prefer to rent it at an approximate cost of EUR 12 per month.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       Notary requests property information from the Property Registry

       According to the law (Art. 175 of the Decree dated on June 2, 1944), the
       notary is obliged to duly inform the parties, be aware of the ownership
       and encumbrances on the property, and consult the Property Registry
       books before executing the deed. Since the early 2000, the consultations
       can be done on-line at www.registradores.org and the printout from the
       internet is valid.

       This document is an “Informative Land Registry Extract” containing the
       same information as an Ownership and encumbrances Certificate, and
       bearing the same responsibility of the Registrar in case of mistake as a
       formal certificate would provide. This is an information product
       specifically foreseen by the Mortgage Law to answer the Notary's
       requests of Information related to registrable acts and contracts. The             1 day

       Registrar must inform the Notary about any Document submitted to the
       Land Registry related to the same property, within the maximum term of
       24 hours since such document was submitted to the Land Registry
       Office. This procedure is aimed at preventing any surprises or
       unexpected situations while the contract is being formalised. This
       scheme is supplemented with the electronic submission to the Registry
       of a Notarial Attestation covering the essential features of the contract in
       relation to which the Information was requested, sent by the Notary by
       electronic means at the time of the document’s signature, in order to
       secure the priority of that document right after being signed.
       Since June 2011, the information from the Land Registry is also available
       in English. Translations come at an additional fee of EUR 20 and take up
       to 4 days.

      First transfers of property or transfers made between entrepreneurs are
      subject to VAT (down to 4% from the previous 8% rate, according to
      Royal Decree-Law 9/2011 of August 19, 2011) and Stamp Duty (0.5-1.0%
      of the property value, depending on the autonomous region -- it is 1.5%
      in Madrid). Second and subsequent property transfers are not subject to
      VAT, but to the Transfer Tax ("Impuesto sobre Transmisiones
      Patrimoniales y Actos Jurídicos Documentados", ITP). The rate of the
      transfer tax is 6% to 10% depending on the autonomous region of Spain
      (in Madrid, it is 6% of the property value). For the Doing Business case
      study, as it is assumed that the buyer is a company and the property is in
      Madrid and has been transferred at least once in the past, the applicable
      tax should be the Transfer Tax (ITP). The ITP is paid at the relevant tax
      office within 30 working days after the date of granting of the notarial
      deed of transfer (a copy of the transfer deed is to be attached to the                      6% of purchase

      Catalunya, and Andalucia, the tax may be paid online, although the buyer
      needs to obtain a stamp from the tax authority confirming the payment.
      However, it has to be noted that under certain circumstances (e.g., that
      the acquisition of the property is within the scope of the usual activities
      of the acquiring company), the acquiring company can choose to make
      the transaction subject to transfer tax or VAT. In the case the company
      chose to have VAT apply, it would be charged an 8% VAT rate on the
      sale price, plus a stamp duty of 1.5% . The VAT paid would become a
      credit that the company would deduct fromsubsequent transactions,
      such as those related to the normal business of the company. Note:
      VAT rates were increased by Law 26/2009 of 23rd December, on Estate
      General Budgets for 2010. By this law, as from the 1st of July 2010, the
      general rate increased from 16% to 18%.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business
taxpayer service centers or allowing for more deductions          recorded in Spain (table 8.1)?

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

DB year             Reform

                    Spain amended its regulations governing insolvency
DB2011              proceedings with the aim of reducing the cost and time. The
                    new regulations also introduced out-of-court workouts.
                    Spain strengthened its insolvency process by making workouts
                    easier, offering more protections for refinancing agreements,
                    allowing conversion from reorganization into liquidation at
DB2013              any time, allowing reliefs of the stay under certain
                    circumstances and permitting the judge to determine whether
                    an asset of the insolvent company is necessary for its
                    continued operation.
                    Spain made resolving insolvency easier by introducing new
                    rules for out-of-court restructuring, introducing provisions

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
