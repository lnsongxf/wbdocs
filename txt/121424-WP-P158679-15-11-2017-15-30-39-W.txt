viii                          Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships
Executive Summary

Armenia’s 16 years of experience with public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the water sector is a
rich illustration of how partnering with private operators in a well thought out manner can
improve water services in a developing country. The government took a phased and cautious
approach to the PPP reform, gradually increasing the geographical scope of the PPPs as well
as the level of transfer of risks to private operators. It began in 2000 with a 5-year manage-
ment contract in the capital city Yerevan, and in 2006 transitioned to a more complex,
10-year lease contract in Yerevan, while initiating additional management contracts to
­
manage water services in secondary cities and towns in the rest of the country.


Water Services Challenges before PPPs
The decade following independence from Soviet rule in 1991 saw the introduction of liberal,
market-oriented policies but the needs of the water sector remained largely unaddressed.
By 2000, 60 percent of the water mains and connections in Yerevan were 30 to 40 years old
and in very bad shape, a situation exacerbated in Yerevan and Shirak by the impact of the
devastating 1988 earthquake on the distribution network. The average daily water supply in
1998 was 6 hours in most parts of the country, including Yerevan, and breakdowns in sup-
ply were common. Tariffs covered only 30 percent of operations and maintenance (O&M)
costs and central budget allocations had to fill the gap. There were also administrative and
managerial gaps within the water utilities, namely Yerevan Water and Sewerage Enterprise
(YWSE),1 Armenia State Water Company (ASWC),2 and municipal utilities in the regions of
Nor Akunq, Shirak, and Lori. Recognizing the challenges and limitations of public service
provision, the government of Armenia decided to introduce private sector participation,
starting with Yerevan in 2000.


Creating an Enabling Environment for Water PPPs
Throughout the reform, the government exerted significant effort, with donors’ support, to
create an environment conducive to successful PPPs. The National Assembly passed some 20
­
new legal acts regarding water metering, billing, revenue collection, taxation, and other
financial matters to support the PPP program and the move toward financial sustainability
and operational efficiency. Another important step was the creation of the State Committee
for Water Economy (SCWE) to serve as the central body for water sector management.
In  addition, the government established project monitoring units (PMUs) to monitor the
implementation of projects and the performance of PPP contracts.


Careful PPP Contract Preparation and Tendering
The government, together with its development partners, spent considerable effort preparing
for the PPP contract and sought external support as needed. In both the Yerevan and AWSC



Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships                          ix
management contracts, preparation took 2 years. Tendering for all contracts was ­satisfactory.
The specific terms across all contracts showed significant similarities, suggesting a cross-­
fertilization of lessons learned with each successive contract. All contracts included clauses
for amendments and extensions, which were applied in all cases. In addition, all contracts
obliged the private partner to implement donor-funded capital expenditure (capex)
­
programs. All the management contracts included a fixed fee for the contractor and a vari-
able fee based on incentive payments (bonuses and penalties). While the number and type
of key performance indicators (KPIs) differed (93 for the Yerevan management contract,
10 for the regional utilities), all contracts included a few core indicators: duration of water
        collection of fees; and installation of water meters. Staff productivity, water losses,
supply; ­
    electricity consumption were also common indicators.
and ­


Implementation of the Capex Program under the PPPs
Under the successive management contracts and the Yerevan lease contracts, financing
for capital works was provided by the government of Armenia through loan programs
with its development partners. An important feature of the various PPP schemes is that
the private operators were left with significant flexibility and control in the execution of the
capital works, under the supervision of the SCWE, an arrangement which facilitated the
prompt implementation of the investment programs. Overall, the amount of capex
spent on a per capita basis differed significantly between the various water PPPs: ranging
from about $5–6 per year for the Yerevan management contract and lease, to $24 and
$30  per year for the management contracts for AWSC and the three regional utilities
respectively.


The Successive Water PPPs Achieved Strong Improvements in
Services Quality and Efficiency
The series of water PPP contracts across the country, implemented over a 16-year period, led to
major improvements in operational performance, service quality, and the financial situation of
the water sector. The quality of water services improved considerably, with continuous 24/7
water supply achieved in most of Yerevan by 2015, and a significant increase in the average
number of service hours in secondary cities and towns. These improvements were essential
to getting water systems across the country out of the vicious circle of intermittent supply,
accelerated deterioration of networks, dubious quality of drinking water, poor customer
satisfaction, and low willingness to pay for water bills. In addition, improved customer ser-
­
vice and modern commercial practices were introduced and billing based on actual, metered
consumption became widespread.
    Operational efficiency was also significantly enhanced, especially through remarkable
improvements in energy efficiency, bill collection, and labor productivity—although there was
little or no improvement in the reduction of water losses as measured by the non-revenue
water (NRW) indicator. However, this lack of improvement in NRW was not due to poor


x                               Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships
performance of the private operators, but to the following factors: (i) the direct impact of
reducing intermittent supply (which increases the average pressure in the network); (ii) the
shortage of funds to rehabilitate dilapidated networks; and (iii) the availability of plentiful
and cheap water resources, making the need to reduce leakage less compelling than in
other countries. Operational improvements were carried out in parallel with gradual tariff
increases, approved by the government in careful sequence so as to broadly match the
improvement of services and reduce the risk of public opposition. By 2015, Armenia enjoyed
a level of water tariffs well below that of neighboring countries—ranging from $0.35 to
$0.45 per m3—in exchange for a much higher level of services. Opinion polls have shown
that the population widely approved of the water PPPs, and that a large majority (70%)
would oppose a return to public management of water services.
  Progress was also made toward increasing the financial viability of the water sector, especially
in the capital city Yerevan. Water services in Yerevan, under a lease contract from 2006 to
2016, became financially self-sufficient by 2011, with tariffs covering all O&M costs and debt
services for investment (financed by the government). However, tariffs were still below full
cost recovery in the rest of the country—that is, the areas served by the two management
contracts for AWSC and the three regional utilities of Shirak, Lori, and Nor Akunq—when
these two contracts ended in 2016.


Looking Ahead: The New 15-Year National Lease that Started in 2017
Building on these achievements, the government decided to move to the next step in PPP
reform, and signed a 15-year national lease contract with one single private operator in November
2016. The new national lease contract, which began in January 2017, covers all geographical
areas previously served by the various PPPs (that is, Yerevan, secondary cities and towns
across the country, and some villages), home to about 2.2 million people or two-thirds of the
total ­population. The goal of this new water PPP is to consolidate the positive results achieved
under the first 16 years, expanding continuous 24/7 water supply to all cities and towns
across the country and allowing for more efficiency gains based on scale economies. In prac-
tice, the new national lease contract is introducing a cross-subsidy between Yerevan and the
rest of the country, with the establishment of a single national water and sanitation tariff of
about $0.43/m3. The private operator has to pay the government a total lease fee of about
$190 million over the 15 years of the national lease, an amount that is supposed to cover fully
the debt service of the water and sanitation sector (capex is financed by the government)
by  the 10th year of the contract when the water sector in Armenia should become fully
self-financed through tariff revenues.
­
  The year 2017 therefore represents a major turning point for water PPP reforms in Armenia,
marking the end of the lease contract in Yerevan and the two management contracts cover-
ing the rest of the country (AWSC and the three regional utilities), and the start of the new,
15-year national lease contract covering all areas previously served under the first generation
of PPPs. At this pivotal point, the World Bank’s Water Global Practice, with support from the

of documenting the many lessons learned from Armenia’s rich experience with water PPPs,
for the benefit of other developing countries considering PPP as an option to improve their
water services.

Ջրային ոլորտում պետական-մասնավոր գործընկերությունների (ՊՄԳ-ներ) ուղղությամբ
Հայաստանի տասնվեցամյա փորձը զարգացող երկրում ջրային ծառայությունների բարելավման
նպատակով մասնավոր օպերատորների հետ լավ մտածված եղանակով գործընկերության
հաստատման հիանալի օրինակ է: Կառավարությունը որդեգրեց ՊՄԳ բարեփոխումների
փուլային և զգուշավոր մոտեցում՝ աստիճանաբար մեծացնելով ՊՄԳ-ների աշխարհագրական
շրջանակը, ինչպես նաև մասնավոր օպերատորներին փոխանցվող ռիսկերի մակարդակը:
Սկզբում՝ 2000 թ.-ին, կառավարման հնգամյա պայմանագիր կնքվեց մայրաքաղաք Երևանում,
ապա 2006 թ.-ին Երևանում անցում կատարվեց ավելի բարդ՝ տասը տարվա վարձակալության

ազատական, շուկայամետ քաղաքականություններ, սակայն ջրային ոլորտի կարիքներին
հիմնականում անդրադարձ չկատարվեց: Մինչև 2000 թ. Երևանում ջրատարների և միացումների
60 տոկոսը 30-40 տարվա հնության էր և շատ վատ վիճակում, ընդ որում իրավիճակը Երևանում և
Շիրակում վատթարացել էր բաշխիչ ցանցի վրա 1988 թ. ավերիչ երկրաշարժի ազդեցության
պատճառով: 1998 թ. երկրի մեծ մասում, այդ թվում՝ Երևանում, ջրամատակարարումը օրական
միջինը վեց ժամ տևողություն ուներ, իսկ խափանումները սովորական բնույթ էին կրում:
Սակագինը հոգում էր շահագործման և պահպանման ծախսերի ընդամենը 30 տոկոսը, իսկ
ճեղքվածքը ստիպված լրացվում էր կենտրոնական բյուջեի հատկացումների միջոցով:
Ջրամատակարար կոմունալ ընկերությունների, մասնավորապես՝ Երևանի ջրմուղկոյուղի

Նոր Ակունք, Շիրակի և Լոռու մարզերի համայնքային ջրամատակարար ընկերությունների մոտ
առկա էին վարչական և կառավարչական բացեր: Հաշվի առնելով հանրային ծառայությունների
մատուցման մարտահրավերները և սահմանափակումները՝ Հայաստանի կառավարությունը
որոշեց ներդնել մասնավոր հատվածի մասնակցությունը, նախապես 2000 թ.-ին սկսելով Երևանից:

ուղղությամբ քայլերին օժանդակելու համար: Մյուս կարևոր քայլը Ջրային տնտեսության
պետական կոմիտեի (ՋՏՊԿ) ստեղծումն էր, որը ծառայելու էր որպես ջրային ոլորտի

ՊՄԳ պայմանագրի կազմման ուղղությամբ և ըստ անհրաժեշտության հայցել արտաքին
աջակցություն: Ինչպես Երևանի, այնպես էլ ՀՋԿԸ կառավարման պայմանագրերի կազմումը երկու
տարի տևեց: Բոլոր պայմանագրերի համար անցկացվեցին բավարար մրցույթներ: Բոլոր
պայմանագրերի պայմաններում զգալի նմանություններ կային, ինչից հետևում է, որ յուրաքանչյուր
հաջորդ պայմանագրից քաղված դասերը համադրվում էին: Պայմանագրերը ներառում էին նաև
փոփոխությունների և երկարաձգումների վերաբերյալ դրույթներ, որոնք բոլոր դեպքերում կիրառվել
են: Բացի այդ, բոլոր պայմանագրերը մասնավոր գործընկերոջը պարտադրում էին իրականացնել
դոնորների կողմից ֆինանսավորվող կապիտալ ծախսերի ծրագրեր: Կառավարման բոլոր
պայմանագրերը ներառում էին կապալառուի համար հաստատուն վճար և խթանիչ վճարումների

ցուցանիշներ՝ ջրամատարակարարման տևողությունը, վարձավճարների հավաքագրումը և
ջրաչափերի տեղադրումը: Աշխատակիցների արտադրողականությունը, ջրային կորուստները և

Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships   xvii
Overview

Armenia’s 16 years of experience with public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the water sector is a
rich illustration of how strategic partnering with private operators can improve water
services in a developing country. The government took a phased and cautious approach
­
to  the  PPP reform, gradually increasing the geographical scope of the PPPs as well as the
level  of transfer of risks to private operators while learning lessons as it moved forward.
The sequence of PPPs was as follows:

•	 Armenia’s experience with water PPPs began in 2000 with a 5-year management contract
  in the capital city Yerevan, which had a service area of about 1.2 million people;

•	 In 2004, a management contract was put in place for the Armenian Water and Sewerage
  Company (AWSC), a utility that covered almost 320 cities, 37 urban centers, and 283 rural
  communities with a total population of about 620,000 spread out across most of the
  secondary cities, towns, and villages in the rest of the country;
  ­

•	 In 2006, the management contract in Yerevan was replaced by a 10-year lease contract
  whereby a private operator assumed all commercial and operating risks and was remuner-
  ated through the tariff revenues collected;

•	 In 2009, another management contract was put in place for the three regional utilities that
  were still under public management. This contract centered on the cities of Lori, Shirak,
  and Nor Akunq (about 330,000 people).

  These four contracts represent what can be called the first generation of water PPPs, as the
Yerevan lease contract and the two management contracts for AWSC and the three regional
utilities all ended at the same time in 2016. Figure O.1 presents the chronology and key data
of this first generation of water PPPs undertaken in Armenia from 2000 to 2016. Figure O.2
shows the geographical scope of the PPPs.


Structure of the Report
The report is organized into eight closely related chapters. The first chapter provides an
­
overview of the context leading up to the start of water PPPs in Armenia, marked by the dire
situation of water services before the introduction of private operators, and followed by a
discussion of the decision process that led the government to embark on a PPP reform. It also
provides an outline of the steps taken to create a favorable environment for water PPPs
under the first management contract in Yerevan (which in turn an enabling environment for
subsequent contracts).

from the first 16 years of water PPP reform in Armenia. This chapter aims to capture the main
messages and experiences from the four water PPP contracts. It may well be the report’s most
important chapter, and the reader who is primarily interested in the main lessons from the
Armenia water PPP reform could focus on this chapter.
    Chapter 7 briefly presents the new, national lease contract that has been in place since
January 2017. This latest PPP contract in a way represents the culmination of the first
16 years of PPP reforms. Its design incorporates many lessons drawn from the previous
contracts. It is an “enhanced lease” arrangement whereby the private sector is expected to
                                                                      ­ evenues. Moreover,

entailing penalties for parties that fail to meet a contractually agreed schedule of targets.

  Chapter 8, the final chapter, discusses the key policy issues that will need to be addressed in
the future as Armenia continues pursuing its water PPP reform. These issues relate to the
need to make the planned infrastructure investments—to be largely financed by the gov-
ernment under the terms of the lease contract—efficiently and in full, how to expand
wastewater services in a viable manner, and most importantly, the importance of ensuring
that the benefits of the PPP reform gradually also reach the 650,000 people living in remote
villages and settlements that currently lack proper water services and that did not benefit
­
from the first generation of PPPs.

Chapter 1   Water Services at the Onset
            of PPP Reforms
            Context of Water and Wastewater Services in Armenia before PPPs
            In the late 1990s, the country’s water infrastructure was highly dilapidated. Most of it had been
            constructed during the Soviet era, and typically was built with excess capacity and little
            regard for economic or operational efficiency (especially energy efficiency). Due to inade-
            quate maintenance, these facilities seriously deteriorated over time. The state of water
            infrastructure worsened after Armenia attained its independence in 1991, as the country was
            facing multiple pressing challenges and competing sector priorities. By 2000, 60 percent of
            the water mains and connections in Yerevan were more than 30 years old and in need
            of ­rehabilitation. Even though 20 wastewater treatment stations had been built before 1990,
            they had gradually been abandoned and the collected wastewater was disposed of untreated
                 rivers and other receiving bodies. Photos 1.1 and 1.2 illustrate the poor state of the
            into ­
            infrastructure at the time.
            ­
              A devastating earthquake in 1988 in Yerevan had further undermined an already fragile
            water system. In addition to taking a dramatic toll on human life (about 45,000 people died),
            it damaged 4,574 kilometers of the water supply network and 2,094 kilometers of the sewer-
            age network. The volume of water supplied to customers fell by more than 42 percent (down
            to 40 million m3). Moreover, it was estimated that the level of leakage in the system increased
            by about 25 percentage points as a direct consequence of the earthquake.
              The average daily water supply stood at only 6 hours in 1998 in Yerevan, and even less in most
            of the rest of the country. Variations in pressure within apartment buildings meant that
            upper floors sometimes did not receive any water in the summer months and received only
            one or two hours a day in the wintertime, if at all—creating much hardship for the population
            and especially the poor, who had no access to coping mechanisms such as water tanks and
            private water trucks. The problem of intermittent supply became so pressing that a Financial
            Times advisory warned business travelers that while hot water was available in Yerevan’s
            main international hotel, the hours of supply were very limited.
              Water service companies throughout Armenia were on the verge of bankruptcy. Cost recovery
            was extremely weak during this period, as tariffs covered only about 30 percent of opera-
            tions and maintenance (O&M) costs, and central budget allocations had to fill the gap.
            A huge unpaid debt had been accrued with the power companies. In 2002, the government’s
            subsidies to the water sector amounted to 3.4 percent of total budget expenditure. This was
            due to a combination of inefficient operation, low tariffs, and poor collection discipline.
            Moreover, most customers were billed based on estimates,1 resulting in rampant nonpay-
            ment of bills, as customers found it unfair that they were charged an amount that did not
            take into account how much water they had actually consumed. By 1999, payment discipline

consumers—and almost no government institutions—paid
­
their water bills.2
    The macroeconomic situation of the country was also quite
dire, making continuous subsidization of the water sector unsus-
tainable. In the early 1990s, GDP fell by almost 50 percent,
budget expenditures shrank by a factor of three, and popula-
tion incomes halved, reflecting the country’s difficult transi-
tion to a market economy. In this context, there was not
enough revenue available from either the general budget or
consumers to cover water operational costs, let alone rehabil-
itation or expansion. In addition, an energy crisis had led to a
sharp increase in electricity prices, putting the water sector
under additional financial strain.
    Another challenge was the disastrous management and
                                                                    Source: Patrick Lorin.
operations of public water companies. The two main water
­
supply companies, Yerevan Water Company (under the
municipality of Yerevan, serving about 1.2 million people)          PHOTO 1.2.     Distribution Network in Village
and Armenia Water Company (AWSC, under the Ministry of
Urban Development, serving about 620,000 people across
the country), supplied water to most of the urban areas in
Armenia. However, they were chronically underfunded and
characterized by poor operating practices and dismal cus-
tomer service. Overstaffing was rampant, with poorly moti-
vated personnel and low salaries. The best trained employees
typically moved to the private sector or left to go abroad. The
three other regional water utilities, partly controlled by local
authorities and serving the areas around the cities of Shirak,
Lori, and Nor Akunq (about 330,000 people in total) were in
no better situation. Many small rural settlements (about
650,000 people) were not even served by these public utili-
ties and relied on standpipes or natural water sources.             Source: Patrick Lorin.



The Government’s Decision to Embark on Water PPP Reforms
By the late 1990s, there was a growing realization within government that public management
of water services alone could not address the daunting challenges of the sector. While donor
financing could help meet some of the infrastructure investment needs, it was not enough
to address the range of challenges in the sector—the huge infrastructure backlog, chronic
operational inefficiencies, weak utility management, poor financial performance, and bad
service quality. Partnering with the private sector seemed a viable option to address these

capacity and efficiency gaps. This was at a time when many other developing countries
across all continents were also experimenting with water PPPs as a way to turn around their
failing water services.
  In the context of the preparation of a new World Bank project (the Municipal Development
Program, MDP), the government considered bringing on board an international private oper-
ator under a management contract for Yerevan, as well as possibly ASWC. Wanting to better
understand what this would entail, the government requested the World Bank to organize a
study tour of private sector experience in water service provision in the region. Stakeholders
interviewed during this study emphasized that the study tour proved pivotal in catalyzing the
­government’s decision to embark on water PPP reforms. The tour was organized in March 1998
with a delegation from Armenia visiting Hungary (leases in Budapest), Poland (lease in
Gdansk) and France (management and affermage/lease contracts). The country visits pro-
vided concrete examples of water PPPs where the private sector concentrated on improving
service quality and operational efficiency, while the government retained responsibility for
investment in water infrastructure. Upon returning to Armenia, the head of the delegation—
who later became the Chairman of the State Committee for Water Economy (SCWE)—
reported the delegation’s positive assessment to the country’s president. Discussions within
the government were then initiated on the best water PPP approach to adopt for Armenia.
A management contract model was initially chosen, as it would allow for a cautious phased
approach, given the considerable risks for private operators entering the Armenian water
sector at that time.
  A sequenced approach to water PPPs was part of the design of sector reform from the onset.
From the beginning, the government intended to expand PPPs beyond the first manage-
ment contract in Yerevan, but it was also keen to move in a cautious and progressive man-
ner. While the inherent value of the lease contract approach was recognized—as it involved
more responsibilities being passed to the private sector and better incentives for
performance—the government felt that it would be too risky as a first PPP. Considering the
­
dire state of the water services in Yerevan in the late 1990s (notably the extremely low
tariff levels and collection rates), a management contract was seen as a first, necessary step
before possibly moving to a lease contract at a later stage. While discussions for a manage-
ment contract in secondary cities and towns (AWSC) also began in 2000, this second con-
tract started only 4 years later.


Putting in Place an Enabling PPP Environment
Major structural changes were made to the water companies operating in Armenia. Following
a national decentralization reform in 1996, responsibility for providing water services had
been transferred to newly established local authorities. However, when it became
apparent  that these authorities lacked the necessary organizational and financial
­
­
c apacities, the government reversed course. In 2000, water sector management was again
centralized under a single body: the SCWE.3 SCWE became the asset owner and 100

percent shareholder of AWSC and Yerevan Water and Sewerage Company (YWSC). The gov-
ernment restructured those entities’ debts by splitting them into two separate entities—
one part became a “shell company” and the other was reconstituted as a new water supply
company with a clean balance sheet. The decentralization of water services was partly
maintained for the areas around the cities of Shirak, Lori, and Nor Akunq, where regional
water utilities were established with 51 percent of the shares held by the central govern-
ment and the rest by local authorities.
    The National Assembly passed some twenty new legal acts as part of the water PPP reform.
The laws related to water metering, billing, revenue collection, taxation, and other finan-
cial matters. In 1999, it passed Decision No. 149, which required the installation of water
meters for consumers, and allowed YWSC to cut off water supply for public enterprises
that failed to pay their bills. The latter decision proved to be important later in enforc-
ing  payment discipline among consumers generally. In 2002, a Law on Forgiveness of
Customer Debts was passed, which allowed old debt to be canceled in exchange for
accepting the installation of meters. In 2002, a new Water Code that defined the frame-
work of private sector participation in water services was adopted, and in 2003 the
national regulator was established (box 1.1). In 2005, the Law on Fundamental Provisions



       BOX 1.1. Regulating Water PPPs: New Water Code (2002) and National
       Regulator (2003)


       The new Water Code, which was passed in 2002, that is, two years after the start of
       the first management contract in Yerevan, excluded the outright privatization of water
       systems (in other words, private ownership of infrastructure) but explicitly allowed
       for various forms of PPPs, namely service contracts, management contracts, leases,
       and concessions. The Natural Monopolies Regulatory Commission, subsequently
       renamed the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PRSC), was created in 2003,
       with responsibility for issuing permits and approving tariffs. It was also made
       responsible for developing market rules and regulations; setting service quality
       requirements; and reviewing investment programs presented by license holders.
       ­

       The Water Code defined the general principles for water sector governance in
       Armenia, including tariff policy, based on two approaches to tariff setting. Under the
       standard approach, utilities had to present requests for tariff adjustments through a
       tariff application to the regulator according to an established procedure. This approach
       was to be applied to the utilities that remained under public management (initially in
       Shirak, Lori, and Nor Akunq) and to those moving to management contracts (since the
       remuneration of the private operator was not linked to the tariff level). The second
       approach to tariff setting was to be applied in the case of lease contracts, whereby
       tariffs could be adopted based on the result of a tender. The second approach was first
       applied during the tender of the Yerevan lease contract in 2005.

water resources and systems. A year later, the 2006 National Water Program was
­developed, addressing water resources use and sustainability measures to meet the needs
of the population and the economy.


Notes
1.	 In Yerevan, fewer than 100 blocks out of some 4,230 covering 1.25 percent of the total population of 1.2 million were fitted
   with block meters, making it difficult to measure water consumption accurately. Bills were set based on normative per
   capita consumption of 200 liters per registered inhabitant for nonmetered customers.

2.	 The collection rates from other customers were much higher: 90 percent of billed volumes.

3.	 SCWE initially functioned as an adjunct body to the government. It was later transferred to the Ministry of Territorial
   Administration and currently operates under the Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources.

Chapter 2   Yerevan Management Contract: 2000–05
            Water Sector Context in Yerevan before the Management Contract
            As already mentioned, water services suffered greatly during the period of transition to a
            ­
            market economy in the 1990s. The water and sewerage infrastructure in Yerevan was ineffi-
            cient and seriously deteriorated, the public utility Yerevan Water and Sewerage Company
            (YWSC) was in a weak financial condition, and the quality of services was poor. Most of the
            city’s population received water only twice a day for a mere two hours, and some districts
            sometimes did not receive any water on a given day. A 2003 study found that approximately
            240,000 households were relying on communal taps and had to carry back to their homes
            about 15 liters per capita per day. The rate of average revenue collection, which had been
            about 47 percent in 1997, had dropped to 20 percent by 2000.


            Tendering and Contract Terms
            Tendering process: The preparation of the Yerevan management contract took 2 years,
            allowing the government to carry out in parallel the first reforms outlined above, to consult
            ­
            stakeholders—including soliciting donor support—and define its expectations. Following a
            competitive bidding process that involved three qualified bidders, the Italian utility ACEA
            (the private operator for water and electricity services in Rome) won the contract. A 4-year
            management contract was signed in February 2000, and ACEA took over the day-to-day
            operations and maintenance (O&M) of water services in Yerevan in June 2000.
              Terms of the contract: The contract was initially scheduled for completion on April 30,
            2004, but was extended by another year (until April 30, 2005). Most of the remuneration
            was based on a fixed fee, so as to reduce the operator’s financial risk, but a variable fee was
            also included to incentivize the operator to perform better. The contract was quite specific
            with regards to the scope of work, with a long and detailed list of activities to be carried out
            by the private operator. These activities included operational tasks, for example, imple-
            menting a leak detection program, supervising meter installation and repairs, preparing a
            digitized mapping system for water networks, enhancing the energy efficiency of pumps
            ­
            and other electrical equipment, and improving chlorination of water. Commercially, the
            contractor had to implement a program to collect accounts receivable, identify illegal con-
            nections, and implement computerized administrative systems for billing. Other delivera-
            bles included establishing a customer service system, carrying out a public information
            campaign, implementing a management training program for YWSC staff, developing
            standard operating procedures, and producing various manuals to improve the utility’s
            ­
            administrative systems.
              Performance monitoring: The contract included as many as 93 key performance indicators
            (KPIs), a very large number that was typical of the management contracts designed in the
            late  1990s. However, only a few were linked to bonuses, and none were associated with

      BOX 2.1.   Incentive Compensation in the Yerevan Management Contract


      The government paid the private operator a fixed fee of $5 million for a 4-year period,
      which formed the basis of the bidding process. It capped the maximum performance
      payment at $1.5 million over the term of the contract and set a ceiling of $375,000
      in any given year. The terms for this “maximum annual incentive compensation”
      were quite strict. An Incentive Compensation Chart provided performance ratings
            excellent” to “poor,” with weights for the different performance indicators.
      from “­
          example, continuity of water supply had a weight factor of 0.08, whereas electricity
      For ­
      use had a weight factor of 0.05. If the operator failed to achieve an excellent rating, it
      had to make up the shortfall in the following contract year. If it achieved a poor rating,
      it was not eligible for incentive compensation in the following year. The operator ended
      up receiving $1.41 million in incentive payments, 94 percent of the maximum possible.




penalties (box 2.1). The four KPIs linked to bonuses were: (i) continuity of water supply;
(ii) electricity usage; (iii) leak detection survey1 and (iv) installation of meters.2 While the con-
tract was largely input-based, the government deemed the use of bonuses (and no penalties)
essential because the partnership was new and therefore entailed higher risks for the private
partner, so providing some financial upside would generate more competition for the tender.
The operator had to submit regular reports to YWSC, including Base Year Data, a Human
Resources Plan, Procurement Guidelines and an Annual Operating Investment Fund Plan.
  The Yerevan management contract was mostly funded by the World Bank. The World Bank
provided $28 million under the new Municipal Development Project (MDP) (1998 to 2006),
a complete financing package for both the preparation and implementation of the manage-
ment contract. This loan provided funding for the investment program and paid for the
operator’s fees and bonuses as well as technical assistance and auditing of the operator’s
performance. The investment portion included both funding for capital investments for the
rehabilitation of water systems (as determined jointly by YWSC and the contractor), and an
Operating Investment Fund to support essential, short-term expenditures (with the private
operator in charge of managing the fund).
  There was no retrenchment of staff under the Yerevan management contract. As part of the
contract deal, YWSC transferred close to 1,800 staff to the management company. However,
YWSC continued to pay the salaries of the transferred staff. At the end of the ACEA contract,
the staff were transferred to Veolia, the operator for the new Yerevan lease contract, which
began in 2006.


Implementation of the Yerevan Management Contract
The private operator started rehabilitating the Yerevan water distribution network through
­sectorization. This approach involved dividing water distribution and pressure zones into

                                           sectors for which bulk water meters and, as required, pressure-regulating valves were
                                           installed to control incoming water flows, manage water pressure, and reduce leakage in the
                                           distribution system. Sectorization also enabled better long-term planning for rehabilitation/
                                           replacement of water mains. The contractor spent about 61 percent of the capital investment
                                           fund on sectorization. Under the project, about 50 percent of the YWSC service area was
                                           sectorized.3 Another priority of the contractor was to install block water meters in apartment
                                           buildings. In addition, it retrofitted internal plumbing systems in many buildings and under-
                                           took partial repairs. The Japanese Social Development Fund provided subsidies to defray
                                           the cost of installing retail water meters for poor families.
                                               As for commercial aspects, stagnant tariffs and weak revenue collection undermined YWSC’s
                                           financial position. In 1999, before the beginning of the management contract, tariffs were
                                           very low, at 56 Armenian drams (AMD) (or $0.10) per cubic meter. Tariffs stayed flat until
                                           2002 because the government preferred to see improvement in bill collections and service
                                           quality first before increasing tariffs. At the same time, revenue collection stayed well below
                                           the 35 percent target set in the contract, mainly because it took some time for the metering
                                           program to reach a critical mass. Moreover, even though the operator launched a communi-
                                           cation strategy to familiarize customers with the concept of payment for actual use, such an
                                           endeavor required behavioral change that took time to materialize. Operating expenses did
                                           not decrease as much as expected, leading to quite disappointing financial results on the
                                           whole. As a result, YWSC continued to face a cash shortfall, leading to some late payments to
                                           staff and delays in implementing maintenance and rehabilitation of the water system.
                                           The situation was only rectified toward the end of the management contract, when tariffs
                                           were steadily increased to reach $0.27 per m3 (an increase of 123 percent) by 2005, thus
                                           allowing a marginal improvement in YWSC’s financial situation (figure 2.1).
                                               Another implementation challenge was that initially counterpart funding from the govern-
                                           ment of Armenia did not materialize as planned. In 2001, the second year of the contract, the
                                           government budgeted $158,000 instead of $470,000 for capital investment, as counterpart
                                           funding for the World Bank financed MDP’s Operating Investment Fund. As this funding was
                                                                                   essential for covering the cost of procurement, investment,

and increased salaries. It also conducted multiple training sessions for utility managers on
topics such as personnel management, financial systems, budgeting, and planning. The con-
tractor provided hardware, software, and licenses at no cost. All these measures were meant
to build the administrative and technical capacity of the utility.
  Although improving customer service was not a priority under the Yerevan management
­contract, given the more urgent need for infrastructure improvements, the private operator
launched a customer service program, which entailed installing new software for billing
and collections and delegating some of its operation to YWSC branch offices. The contractor
also initiated a public information campaign to explain the nature of private management
of the utility.


Results and Key Factors
YWSC registered tangible improvements in its operational and financial performance under
the  management contract (table 2.1). The most concrete benefit for the population was a
major reduction in intermittent supply and a quadrupling of the average number of hours of
water services. Customers were able to save on coping costs such as private water trucks,
individual pumping and storage, and time spent fetching water. Moreover, most customers
­
started being billed based on actual metered consumption, as opposed to being billed on
estimates, as before.
  One of the strongest improvements was the major reduction in electricity consumption
and electricity costs. In the first year of the contract alone, there was a 14 percent decrease
in electricity consumption, equivalent to $60,000 in monthly savings. The hydraulic struc-
ture of the network was gradually rationalized to favor cheaper, gravity-based intakes, and
three pumping stations were shut down to enhance operational efficiency. As a result,
energy consumption decreased by almost half, from 240.3 million kWh in 2000 to 124.2
million kWh in 2005.

  Despite the technical improvements achieved under the contract, YWSC’s financial results
remained unsatisfactory. The company continued to operate at a significant loss, accumulat-
ing nearly AMD 20.9 billion ($37.6 million) in losses during the management contract period
(table 2.2). The main reason for this was that costs more than doubled while the revenue
increases were not high enough.
  The Yerevan management contract also failed to make a dent in the high levels of non-rev-
enue water (NRW). The contract included an activity on enhancing leak detection and
repair, with a target of 4,000 km by the fourth year. While NRW decreased in terms of
volume of water lost (by 17 percent), it did not decrease as a percentage of water produc-
tion. The main reason for this lack of progress was twofold: insufficient funding for the
rehabilitation of the dilapidated distribution system in Yerevan, and the fact that the
improvement in service continuity had a negative concomitant impact on water losses, as
the network was under pressure (and therefore leaking) for many more hours than before.
Moreover, from a monitoring point of view, the base year estimate for “unaccounted for
water” was calculated using unmetered consumption and therefore misleading. Given
these circumstances, the performance targets for NRW that were introduced in the con-
tract were clearly not realistic.
  Overall, the private operator earned $1.41 million in incentive payments (bonuses) over the
5-year management contract, in addition to the fixed management fee of $4.8 million. When
the contract ended in April 30, 2005, the operator continued in an advisory capacity for two

months, until June 2005. The aim was to ensure continuity until the new lease operator for
Yerevan took over. Key staff of the management contract, including the former Managing
Director, were hired as individual consultants to serve in operational positions.


Main Messages and Lessons Learned
As PPP was a new modality for the country, the government decided to focus on a few key
priority areas. The first was reducing intermittent supply while implementing demand-side
management, particularly metering, debt forgiveness, and bill enforcement. Managing
demand was a prerequisite for further capital investment because without a good basis for
monitoring and collecting revenues, there would not be enough financing for investment.
Secondly, the government decided to prioritize water supply and address sanitation later.
The lesson learned is that for a management contract of limited scale and size, it is better to
define a few essential activities that the private contractor can deliver quickly and efficiently.
The gains from this experience laid the ground for further technical and operational improve-
ments in subsequent PPP contracts.
  The introduction of a private operator proved an important driver of public sector reforms.
A major contribution of the private sector was not only the improvements it made on tech-
nical and financial performance, but also the impetus it gave to making difficult political
decisions that would have been easy to defer under public service provision. The decision to
turn to private sector operation brought major issues to the fore, such as customer debts,
that would otherwise have festered unattended. Private management also increased
­
expectations and scrutiny for water services, at a time when many citizens had resigned
themselves to suboptimal results under public management.
  The government made efforts to act as an equal partner (despite a sometimes shaky relation-
ship) and took concrete actions to create an enabling environment for the PPP—instead of
trying to push all responsibilities to the private operator. This attitude stands in sharp con-
­
trast to the one seen in many management contracts that were being implemented during
the same period in other developing countries around the world, where accumulated frus-
trations with the many implementation challenges led to a return to public management.
The continuous and welcomed support of donors as “honest brokers” was also important for
supporting the partnership between private and public partners.
  Another clear lesson is that the number of performance indicators should be limited and based
on good asset inventory. The initial poor state of the infrastructure system made it difficult to
set appropriate targets, such as for reducing NRW, which resulted in contractual targets not
being achieved. In hindsight, 93 KPIs were just too many and set unreasonable expectations
about what the private contractor could deliver in a limited amount of time and with limited
transfer of responsibilities. The spirit of the Yerevan management contract was very much
“input-based,” as most of the KPIs related to the development of standard operating proce-
dures, O&M plans, and other management plans. It might have been better to let the private
operator focus on key performance issues, rather than the preparation of reports.

Chapter 3   Yerevan Lease Contract: 2006–16
            Water Sector Context in Yerevan Leading up to the Lease Contract
            The relative success of the Yerevan management contract emboldened the government to
            expand private sector involvement in Yerevan and switch to a lease contract. This was, in
            many respects, a remarkable move. On face value, while the Yerevan management contract
            did achieve several notable improvements in performance, not all the KPI targets specified
            in the contract were achieved, and it failed to deliver the hoped-for improvement in
            the  financial situation of the Yerevan water utility. Furthermore, the State Committee
            of Water Economy (SWCE) acknowledged that the daily relationship with the private oper-
            ator was not always an easy one, and that ensuring a proper interaction and interface
            required considerable attention.
              Overall, the Yerevan experience in the early 2000s was not radically different from the
            outcome of other management contracts that were piloted during this period in developing
            countries around the world. All of these other contracts ended with a return to public
            ­management, as the respective governments abandoned the PPP route.1 However, in Armenia,
            the government took a radically different view. Rather than considering that with the Yerevan
            management contract the “glass was half empty” and the PPP had failed to meet expecta-
            tions, it took the view that the “glass was half full” and felt encouraged to keep on the PPP
            road. Recognizing the inherent limitations of a management contract—with only limited
            transfer of risks and responsibilities to the private operator in a relatively short time span—
                government did not choose to end the PPP experiment but instead decided to take it to a
            the ­
            new level, shifting in 2006 to a 10-year lease contract in Yerevan.
              The main goal of the Yerevan lease was to deepen the achievements under the YWSC manage-
            ment contract and make them sustainable, with the operator assuming more operational and
            commercial risks. The government remained responsible for financing the rehabilitation
            program—and undertaking overall contract supervision—with continued donor support to
            finance capital works. The service area of the new lease contract covered the city of Yerevan
            and 30 surrounding villages.


            Tendering and Contract Terms
            A competitive tendering process began in 2005 and resulted in the award of the contract to
            French operator Compagnie Générale des Eaux (CGE, now Veolia). Under the lease contract
            model, the private operator was remunerated entirely through the collection of tariff reve-
            nues from customers. Veolia offered the lowest average tariff, derived from a “base tariff” and
            “tariff adjustment factors” (billed water, inflation, exchange rate, and energy costs) for the
            whole 10-year period of the lease contract, as explained below. Following the contract award,
            Yerevan Djur, a closed joint stock company, was formed to execute the lease contract in
            Yerevan, with CGE as its sole owner and shareholder. The lease contract was signed on

December 14, 2005, for a 10-year period and officially began on June 1, 2006. The newly estab-
lished company became the water utility providing services and directly billing customers.
  The contract was designed as an “enhanced lease” with the private sector in charge of financ-
ing some minor investments and subject to penalties in the case of failure to meet some KPI
targets. The private operator had to repair properties, plants, and equipment with short
depreciation periods by setting aside a portion of its tariffs revenues—meaning that it had to
finance a portion of the capital expenditure (capex) by itself, instead of through government
transfers. Four KPIs were subject to penalties: continuity of supply (average number of hours
per day), quality of water (potability), time to respond to customers’ complaints, and timeli-
ness in execution of the investment plan (portion financed by the operator). Sales revenues
had to cover the lessee’s expenses and profits, at the operator’s own risk and based on the
tariff level that had been specified in the bid.
  The private operator had to pay a leasing fee to SCWE, the yearly amount being defined
under the contract, to service the debt attached to donor-financed programs as well as to
cover the rental of operating equipment.2 This meant that apart from retaining the obligation
to fund most of capex, the government no longer had to subsidize a portion of the opera-
tional costs or the debt service of water services in Yerevan—effectively setting the water
services in the capital city on a course to become self-financed.3
  Performance monitoring: The lease contract had clear annual objectives and the private
operator had to submit semiannual performance reports. The PMU retained an Independent
Technical Auditor and two financial auditors. SCWE and the private operator renegotiated
the KPIs in 2009 to make the evolution of some targets more realistic, based on the experi-
ence gained during the initial 5 years of operation. For example, the negotiations reduced
the target hours of water supply for the 3rd to 7th contract years, increased them for the 8th
and 9th years, and left them unchanged for the final year.
  Tariff setting: A 10-year program of tariff levels was established, with criteria for tariff
adjustments. The base tariffs for the lease period were set during the tender process and
were fixed in the license issued by the regulator in parallel with the signing of the lease
(table 3.1). The customer tariff for the first year of the contract was AMD 173/m3 ($0.39/m3),
compared to a prelease tariff of AMD 125/m3 ($0.28/m3). It must be noted that although this
represented an increase of 38 percent, the water tariff in Yerevan still remained well below
the average tariff level in other countries of the region. The license issued by the Public
Services Regulatory Commission (PRSC) in parallel with the signing of the contract outlined
the factors and formulas on which the base tariffs were to be reviewed, based on volume of
retail water sold to consumers, inflation, EUR/AMD exchange rate and energy costs (in accor-
dance with tender documents).


Implementation of the Contract
The staff of the former YWSC public utility was transferred to the private operator at the onset
of the lease contract. This was done on a voluntary basis. Although this meant a change in

                                             and professional advancement.
                                                The private operator was left with significant flexibility for implementation of investments. In
                                             the first year, the operator had to define an investment program jointly with SCWE and exe-

                                             the Yerevan Water and Wastewater Project (YWWP).4 In practice, the operator enjoyed signifi­
                                             cant flexibility in identifying investments, preparing tenders, and supervising civil works—an
                                             arrangement that was considered essential to ensuring that the capex program would be
                                             implemented efficiently. In addition, the government borrowed from other donors to carry
                                             out investments in Yerevan for a total amount of capex of about $68 million (table 3.2). The
                                             donors adopted the approach followed by the World Bank for the identification and execu-
                                             tion of civil works, leaving significant flexibility to the private operator under the control of
                                             SCWE. Overall, the total amount of capex invested over the 10-year duration of the lease was
                                             fairly modest, considering it represented a per capita cost of less than $6 per year.
                                                The actual evolution of tariffs broadly followed what had been agreed initially. For the first
                                             5 years, the actual tariff adjustment was lower than the one allowed under the contract, as
                                             a result of negotiations between the government and the private operator in exchange for
                                             some limited tariff subsidies.5 The volume of water sales as well as inflation were the fac-
                                             tors that contributed most to tariff increases compared to the base tariff, while the exchange
                                             rate had a small negative impact. The low base tariffs at the start of the contract caused
                                             challenges for Yerevan Djur and made it difficult to carry out the necessary volume of

accounting for inflation).
  Monitoring of intermittent supply was carefully designed. Pressure loggers were installed
in 60 zones of Yerevan to register the duration of water supply to customers as required by
contract. The performance standards on continuous water supply applied only to Yerevan
but villages supplied directly from the same transmission mains as Yerevan benefitted from
24-hour water supply as well. For the other villages, 10 in all, that did not have a connection
to the main intakes, the minimum supply requirement was four hours. By law, the operator
had to publish the hours of intended water supply service for each area of Yerevan twice a
year in the press, and to enhance accountability, water supply hours were included in the
customers’ bills as of February 2010.
  The Yerevan lease contract placed greater emphasis on customer service than the Yerevan
management contract (box 3.1). It included a provision setting the permissible average
response and repair times to major breakdowns during a given contract year at 24 hours.
For written enquiries, the response time could not exceed 15 business days. Moreover, the

       BOX 3.1.   Customer Service under the Yerevan Lease Contract


       The operator set up a Customer Service Department, which dealt with subscribers’
       calls, e-mails, and written complaints/inquiries. In the first year of the contract, it
       set up a “1-85” Call Center and a generic “1-85” number that all Yerevan Djur clients
       could access by landline and cell phone. After March 2014, it added three additional
       phone lines to the existing 10 lines. Subsequently, in 2015, the operator implemented
       new software at the 1-85 Call Center to localize calling subscribers on a map in
       order to better understand their issues. Following these improvements, the average
       number of calls received by the Call Center increased and the number of messages
       left decreased. The number of callbacks consequently went up by about 4,000 per
       month, which resulted in about 340,000 calls in 2014. About 30 percent of the calls
       were on commercial issues and the rest on operational and technical matters. Yerevan
       Municipality and independent audits verified that subscribers’ complaints were less
       serious than in the past and that the number of “persistent” cases had dropped.

(change in the intake structure to

cantly increased (up to 97.2 percent) and the labor productivity ratio was improved to 3.2
staff per thousand connections—figures that are comparable to well performing utilities in
more developed countries.
 One area where no improvement in performance was recorded is the level of water losses.
While the level of losses did go down by 8 percentage points, it still remained stubbornly
high at about 75 percent. This aspect deserves further discussion. The switch to continuous
24/7 supply in Yerevan was not achieved by increasing the volume of water injected into the
distribution network—as is typically the case when a water utility attempts to move from
intermittent to continuous supply. On the contrary, the actual volume of water production

dropped by about 25 percent over a decade (from 359 million m3 in 2005 to 270 million m3 in
2015). In practice, there is little question that the overall functioning of the distribution net-
work did improve, with the generalization of pressure-reducing valves and the introduction
of zoning to help identify leakages. But as the distribution network was also put under
­
pressure for a longer duration (from an average of 18.4 to 23.4 hours per day, a 27 percent
increase), the total volume of water lost through leakages was bound to increase given the
absence of a major network rehabilitation program to replace highly deteriorated pipes on a
large scale.
  Under the lease contract, financing for such a network rehabilitation investment would
have been the responsibility of the government, but the total amount of donor financing
that was ultimately available during the 10 years of the lease contract (about $60 million)
    insufficient for the private operator to deal with the scope of the water network rehabil-
was ­
itation needs. In fact, carrying out a massive rehabilitation of the water distribution net-
work in Yerevan was not a priority for the country, considering that overall donor funding
had to be allocated across multiple priorities and sectors. Given the availability of plenti-
ful and cheap water resources for the Yerevan distribution system, it is likely that the
actual “economical level of water losses” (i.e., the level of leakages at which the cost of
repairs exceeds the benefits from water saved) is quite high. The new lease contract,
which includes a specific financial incentive for the operator to reduce water losses (see
chapter 8) will hopefully result in significant NRW reductions—provided of course there is
enough capex funding.
  One of the reasons for the good performance of the lease contract was that the operator was
responsible for the implementation of the investment program, and did so efficiently. It was
made possible by the flexibility left by SCWE to the private operator for identifying,
designing, and supervising civil works. While this project was still subject to SCWE scrutiny,
­
assigning significant responsibility to the operator meant the limited capex funding avail-
able could be directed to those investments with the highest impact on service quality and
operational performance. It also reduced time spent execution, as the private operator had
clear incentives to complete each work as soon as possible.
  Importantly, Yerevan Djur gradually transformed from a foreign-operated company to one
managed nationally. During the contract, Veolia raised the salary levels of its staff several
times to boost performance, in parallel with a gradual reduction in the total number of
staff through retirement attrition. It also invested in personnel development by sending
many staff members for training to France. By 2012, an entirely Armenian team was man-
aging Yerevan Djur, which continued until the end of the lease, with no expatriates and
only limited support from headquarters in France. There is wide consensus among stake-
holders that significant knowledge was transferred from the operator to local staff under
the lease.
  In the early stage of the lease contract, Yerevan Djur did not generate enough operating cash
surplus for the private operator to be able to contribute to capex. This was a direct

  Water services in Yerevan became fully self-financed by 2011. By year 3 of the lease, opera-
tional costs had been contained and the company started to reach financial equilibrium, as
revenues gradually increased with the collection rate—indicating that it was on a course
toward becoming financially viable based on tariff revenues alone with full recovery of
O&M costs (figure 3.4). Yerevan Djur turned a first year of profit in 2010 (due partly to an
operational subsidy from the municipality of Yerevan), and was financially self-sustainable
by 2011. Over the period 2006–15, the private operator made a cumulative operational profit

  A beneficiary survey conducted in December 2011 found that the majority of respondents

vey also found that 16 percent of respondents deemed the tariff at the time very high and
46  percent deemed it adequate, although in reality the average water bill did not exceed
2 percent of households’ overall monthly per capita spending. Only 30 percent of respon-
dents wanted to revert to state-managed services rather than continue with a PPP.

Main Messages and Lessons Learned
The clear success of the Yerevan lease contract shows the overall benefits of a lease model over
a management contract. The lease contract generated a “cultural shift” toward improving the
quality and efficiency of water services, with a wider transfer of risks and responsibilities
and much sharper incentives. The private operator was henceforth assuming all operational
and commercial risks, but in exchange had much more flexibility to make operational deci-
sions, with all employees placed under private contract. The operator was also involved for
a much longer duration, enjoying enough time to make in-depth cultural changes in the way


26                               Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships
the utility functioned. The lease contract introduced a simpler and sharper “built-in” incen-
tive framework, pushing the private operator to reduce its operating costs and increase
billing and collection rates. The adoption of an “enhanced lease” structure with some capex
­
funded by the private operator and a few key KPIs subject to penalties made the incentive frame-
work even more effective.
  The positive experience of the Yerevan lease also shows the benefits of a sequenced approach
to PPPs. Despite its obvious benefits, the implementation of the lease/affermage model
(which was originally developed in France and Spain) in a developing country has had a
rather mixed record over the last two decades. While it was successfully replicated in the
Czech Republic (where about 70 percent of the urban population is now served by private
water operators under municipal leases), as well as a few cities in Slovakia and Poland, the
track record in developing countries has been more uneven. Affermage contracts have proved
very successful in Senegal and Niger at improving services, and gradually achieving finan-
cial sustainability of the water sector (just like in Yerevan), but attempts to implement lease
contracts in other African countries have been disappointing. For instance, the lease con-
tract that started in 1999 in Maputo (Mozambique) had rather mixed results, and the lease
contract in Dar El Salam, Tanzania (2003–04), was canceled in its second year amidst acrimo-
nious disagreement between the public and private partners. The mixed results across these
countries suggest that the complexity of the lease/affermage approach requires careful prepa-
ration and entails significant risks in developing countries with limited capacities and wide-
spread governance issues, and that their implementation may be enhanced by adopting a
gradual approach like in Armenia.
  In the case of Armenia, there are indications that the earlier implementation of the manage-
ment contract in Yerevan did facilitate the implementation of the lease contract later on, as
confirmed by interviews with SCWE staff in charge at the time. If the government had imme-
diately gone for tendering a lease in 2000, the uncertainties with baseline data and overall
country risks—not to mention the lack of previous experience with water PPPs—would have
made it unlikely that the winning bidder would have accepted to take on the kind of finan-
cial risks that Veolia did. The foundation set by the Yerevan management contract made the
future lessee more willing to plan on a major turnaround in revenues and collections and
more accepting of financial losses in the early years. Had the government immediately opted
for tendering a lease contract—without first going through the management contract—the
tender would probably have resulted in a higher tariff hike for customers and an even higher
end tariff—which would probably have endangered the entire PPP reform. It would also have
been difficult to implement an “enhanced lease” structure with targets for key KPIs without
a reliable baseline.
  Finally, one key element of the success of the Yerevan lease is the flexibility that was left to
the private operator for designing and implementing the capital investment program. This was
based on an arrangement that gradually evolved as SCWE and donors became comfortable
that the private operator could be trusted to implement capex in an efficient manner.

This assessment was confirmed in all interviews conducted with donors who supported the
Yerevan lease contract, as part of the preparation of this study. Given the fairly limited fund-
ing available from donors during the 10 years of the lease, this arrangement was key to
ensuring that investments would target those actions that had the largest positive impact on
service quality and operational efficiency.


Notes
1.	 This key matter is discussed in more detail in chapter 8, which captures the main lessons from the four PPPs.

2.	 It is important to underline that the yearly lease fee was preset in a specific schedule of the contract. This represents the
     fundamental difference between a lease contract and an affermage contract, whereby the lease fee is replaced by a tariff
     structure in which a portion goes to the private operator (operator’s fee) and another portion goes to the government to
     cover the debt servicing of capex.

3.	 The total amount of the lease fee was almost AMD 4 billion ($8.7 million). The lease fee paid by Yerevan Djur to the govern-
     ment over the 10 years of the lease contract had been set in the contract so as to cover the repayment (principal and interest)
     of the two World Bank loans provided for Yerevan PPPs (the first one under the management contract, and the new one for
     the lease).

4.	 The first component of YWWP was the $18.75 million YWWP Fund, which covered investments in system rehabilitation and
     upgrading. In addition, a Project Preparation Facility financed consultants to draft the lease.

5.	 The larger difference was in year 5, when the actual tariff adjustment was 28 percent lower than the amount allowed per the
     contract, with the municipality of Yerevan providing in exchange a one-off subsidy of $1 million.

6.	 The 23.4 hours per day figure reported in the table for 2016 is an average across all service areas of Yerevan Djur, including
     a few small towns outside of Yerevan not connected to the main water supply system that still had an intermittent supply,
     and some areas in Yerevan that still suffer from moderate shortages in the summer.

Chapter 4   Armenian Water and Sewerage Company
            Management Contract: 2004–16
            Water Sector Context in Secondary Towns and Cities before the
            Management Contract
            The Armenian Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC)’s service area included almost 320 cities,
            37 urban centers, and 283 rural communities covering a total population of about
            620,000  people outside Yerevan. AWSC had been operating as a national public water
            company since the recentralization of water services in the late 1990s, and was fully
            owned by the State Committee for Water Economy (SCWE). At the start of the manage-
            ment contract, about 15 percent of the population received water from public standpipes.
            AWSC had about 250,000 connected customers spread throughout the country, with
            infrastructure consisting of 441 abstraction points, over 8,000 km of water supply
            ­networks, 12 water treatment plants, and a multitude of reservoirs, pumping stations, and
            chlorination points. The sewerage system consisted of 2,000 km of pipes and served
            about 53 percent of water customers. Many of the water systems were gravity-fed due to
            the local topography.
              Prior to the start of the management contract, AWSC faced many serious challenges in
            ­delivering services. The structures and pipelines of the water and wastewater system were
            dilapidated and assets had been insufficiently maintained and rehabilitated for many
            years. Because of widespread water leakages, deteriorated electrical and mechanical
            installations, and poor operational management, the average daily supply of water was
            only about six hours. Operating costs were high, due in part to the heavy power consump-
            tion needed to keep the few operable but inefficient pumps in service. There were frequent
            leaks and overflows in the sewerage system. Photo 4.1 illustrates the poor state of the
            infrastructure at the time.
              AWSC was in poor financial shape before the start of the management contract. Even though
            the customer tariff had almost doubled since 2002, it still stood at only AMD 100 per m3
            (about $0.21/m3). Collected revenues were not enough to cover operations and mainte-
            nance (O&M) costs. The residents of the small towns and rural areas that were part of
            AWSC’s service area had relatively low incomes (about half that of Yerevan), so their
            ­
            c apacity to pay was small. At the same time, the unreliable service provided and poor
            billing system (60 percent of customers were billed based on estimates) resulted in low
            ­
            willingness to pay. Illegal connections were widespread, involving many businesses such
            as hotels, workshops, and industrial bakeries close to pumping stations. As a result, the bill
            collection rate was a mere 47.9 percent, with four out of five customers having more than
            4 months’ debt with AWSC.
              There were considerable water leakages, but the actual volume could not be properly
            ­calculated because of a total lack of customer and bulk metering. Operating costs, which had

erbated the already precarious
financial   situation   caused   by
weak revenues. A bloated work-
force, at 9.45 employees per
1,000  connections, further com-
pounded the problem. To cover
its growing cash deficit, AWSC
had to rely on subsidies from the
government, including exemp-
tion from paying VAT. The gov-
ernment also had to pay the
company’s bills to the electric                          Distribution chamber                                Pumping station

Tendering and Contract
Terms
While the idea of undertaking a
management contract with AWSC          Source: Patrick Lorin.

had germinated at the same time
as that for the Yerevan management contract, the government decided to wait until initial
improvements were made, and early lessons could be drawn, from the Yerevan experi-
ence. In 2002, the government decided to go ahead, but only after restructuring AWSC’s
balance sheet in order to prepare it properly for private management. The Law on Debt
Forgiveness in 2002 led to the write-off of AWSC’s debts and reduced its deferred liabilities
and other arrears significantly. The goal of the restructuring was to shield AWSC from debt
accumulated prior to the start of the management contract.
 The contract was prepared as meticulously as the Yerevan management contract and the
preparation process also began two years before tendering. In addition to hiring a consul-
tant firm to review available options, prepare bidding documents, and draft the manage-
ment contract, the government prepared an outline of the priority works program that
AWSC would implement under the private contractor. Although this capital expenditure
(capex) program was merely indicative and the contractor was given the flexibility to
refine it, defining the program early minimized the risk of implementation delays.
 In 2003, the government issued a call for tenders for a 4-year, performance-based manage-
ment contract. A total of 10 firms submitted Expressions of Interest and four international


30                               Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships
operators from France, Germany, and Italy ultimately submitted bids. The government
evaluated the bids from January to April 2004, reviewing both the technical and financial
proposals, and finally selected the French water operator SAUR as the winner. The man-
agement contract was signed on August 19, 2004, and transferred the powers of the
Executive Body of AWSC to the new private operator, who in turn established a dedicated
local subsidiary company (Saur Sevan Services) to implement the contract. Appendix B
has more details on the tendering process, which was carried out with the technical
assistance of the World Bank.
­
  The contract duration was originally set at 4 years, with the possibility of a 2-year extension,
but finally lasted 11 years. The contractor had two sets of responsibilities under the manage-
ment contract. The first was to administer AWSC’s daily operations, including technical,
commercial, financial, and personnel issues. The second was to define, prepare, implement,
and manage the capex program. The private operator would formally apply for tariff ­revisions
on behalf of AWSC, with the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PRSC) responsible for
reviewing the request and making a decision on the proposed tariff—but this could not affect
the remuneration of the private operator, which came (partly) from its performance-based
management fee and not from tariff revenues. At the beginning of the management con-
tract, the average share of the water bill in household expenditure was about 1 percent in the
area served by AWSC.
  As with the other PPP contracts in Armenia, donors financed the investment program and
­supported the overall partnership. The World Bank’s Municipal Water and Wastewater Project
(MWWP) provided a $43 million loan package to finance the implementation of the invest-
ment program. In addition to supporting the preparation and tender of the AWSC manage-
ment contract, the project components financed (i) the fixed fee and performance bonus of
the private contractor for the first 4 years of the management contract; (ii) various costs
associated with improving operations, including a redundancy program to reduce AWSC’s
staff, the purchase of communication equipment, and the setting up of training facilities,
staff training activities, and laboratories to test water quality; (iii) a revolving fund for the
installation of block meters in condominiums, and for financing some of AWSC’s operating
expenses, such as the purchase of spare parts and chemicals; and (iv) the rehabilitation of
water supply and sewerage networks and other branch investments, such as offices and
operating equipment. Other donors—EBRD, EIB, NIF, and ADB—also provided financing for
capex, bringing the total amount to $180 million (table 4.1).
  The contractor’s fees comprised a fixed fee and a Performance Incentive Compensation.
This  performance-based remuneration consisted of a schedule of bonuses and penalties.
The fixed fee was a monthly lump sum paid to cover the expenses of implementing the man-
agement contract. When the contract was amended in 2011, the Performance Incentive
Compensation was set so as not to exceed the equivalent of 25 percent of the annual base
management fixed fee. The penalties could not exceed the equivalent of 20 percent of the
annual base fixed fee for the same period. In addition, the management contractor had to

provide a performance guarantee of 10 percent of the total amount of the management fixed
fee for the duration of the contract.
  The AWSC management contract included 25 performance indicators—much less than the
93 indicators in the Yerevan management contract. The rationalization of indicators reflects a
significant lesson learned, as having 93 KPIs had been cumbersome to manage and proved
unnecessary. Similarly, NRW was not included as a contractual indicator in the AWSC man-
agement contract, in recognition that the contract was not designed to make an impact on
the NRW level. Of the 25 contractual indicators, only four were linked to incentive compen-
sation and were the actual focus of the management contract: (i) continuity of water supply,
(ii) effectiveness of meter installation program, (iii) water safety compliance, and (iv) com-
pany operating efficiency (collection ratio)—with different weights for calculating the
bonuses and penalties. In the case of service duration, the bonuses/penalties could not be
higher than 10 percent of the base management fixed fee for a given year. The contract
defined three groups of cities and set differentiated targets for each group, as well as ­separate
targets for rural communities.


Implementation of the Contract
One of the main challenges of improving AWSC performance was the geographical fragmenta-
tion of the services, spread over the country’s entire territory. Initially, the team consisted of
21 experts, including seven SAUR Group staff (the expatriate staff had been reduced to three
by the fourth year). During the first year, the contractor rationalized 36 former AWSC
branches into four well-organized and operationally autonomous regional branches,

                                       with procurement and revenue centralized at head office. While this rationalization process
                                       generated resistance from local authorities, the contractor was able to go ahead thanks to
                                       the backing of SCWE and the powers granted to it in the contract.
                                          The contractor also worked on optimizing staffing arrangements. In 2004, AWSC employed
                                       2,837 people, of which 2,250 were based in more than 37 territorial branches and the rest
                                       at headquarters in Yerevan. The staffing ratio—at 9.45 staff per 1,000 water connections—
                                       was clearly excessive, even when allowing for the wide dispersion of infrastructure sys-
                                       tems across the AWSC service area. Moreover, staff members were poorly motivated and
                                       had limited opportunities for professional development. Through natural attrition as well
                                       as a voluntary redundancy program financed by the MWWP, the private operator managed
                                       to rationalize the workforce and gradually reduce its size until it reached the more reason-
                                       able staffing ratio of 6 employees per 1,000 subscribers (figure 4.1). Staff members report-
                                       edly welcomed the retrenchment and many volunteered to leave because of the attractive
                                       terms offered.1 At the same time, the average salary for the remaining staff was raised
                                       ­
                                       significantly, from AMD 32,000 ($70) to AMD 56,000 ($120) per month for the duration of
                                       the management contract.
                                          Some early challenges to implementing the management contract are worth noting. The
                                       Electrical Network Company unilaterally decided to cut off electricity supply to all AWSC
                                       facilities within hours of the management contract’s signature, because of large unpaid
                                       bills—an issue that had to be dealt with, as a matter of priority, with the help of SCWE.
                                       While MWWP subsidized the cost of installing residential meters for low-income house-
                                       holds, benefiting about 2,000 households, residents of rural areas offered some resistance
                                       when the contractor wanted to regulate the flow of water to villages, as many considered
                                       water an ancestral possession and refused to come under the remit of the contractor.2
                                          In the context of the MWWP, the AWSC investment program prioritized water production,
                                       water distribution, and wastewater collection in small and medium towns so as to reach the
                                       maximum number of people given  the limited funding available for investment. In vil-

urgent repairs and replacing equipment, as  well as simply rationalizing the network to
reduce losses.
  There was a notable effort to improve commercial practices—much more than under the
first management contract in Yerevan. A dedicated customer call center was opened. To
deal with illegal connections, the operator installed water chamber meters at the borders
of each property to prevent illegal connections upstream of the water meter. Some creative
measures were taken to promote payment discipline among customers, such as the cre-
ation of a national lottery for customers who regularly paid their monthly bills and had a
water meter installed.3
  The contract was extended several times until 2016—finally lasting for 11 years in total,
a reflection that the government was both satisfied with the gradual improvements and
cognizant that the private operator needed time to make an impact on AWSC given,
among  other things, the fragmentation of services across the service area. In October
2008, the contract was first extended by 2 years and then for an additional year until
October 2011. In 2011, an amendment introduced penalties to the contract (bonuses had
been included from the beginning). Another extension was granted until 2014, as part of
a negotiation whereby SAUR joined the consortium of the management contract for Lori,
Shirak, and Nor Akunq. Finally, when the government made the policy decision in 2014 to
adopt one single operator for the whole country under a lease contract, the end date of
the AWSC contract was extended further—until May 31, 2016, to align with the end date of
the Yerevan lease contract. There was a final contract extension, from June 2016 to
December 21, 2016, to accommodate the late tender process for the national lease contract
(see chapter 7).
  When the parties extended the contract in October 2011, they reformulated it as an
“enhanced management contract.” The change was to allow the operator to maintain a
certain level of performance once it had achieved the targets set in the respective KPIs.
The operator had to both manage AWSC and prepare a “total management plan” (TMP) as
part of the enhanced management contract approach. According to the contract amend-
ment, the TMP included a business plan and an open format financial forecasting to
advise the government on developing a long-term funding strategy. The TMP’s aim was
to help SCWE make better decisions on when it was most appropriate to repair, replace,
or rehabilitate particular assets. The contractor had to develop an asset inventory, under-
take sectorization of the water distribution system, and set a timeline for rehabilitating
critical assets.
  The first tariff increase under the management contract was introduced at the end of 2005.
Tariffs went up from AMD 100/m3 ($0.21/m3) in 2004 to AMD 140/m3 ($0.30/m3), a 40 percent
increase. The tariff was increased a second time in 2008, this time by 25 percent. By 2016, the
combined water supply and sewerage tariff had reached AMD 180/m3 ($0.38/m3) (table 4.2
and figure 4.2). The cumulative increase led to a significant income boost for AWSC, which
allowed it, among other things, to pay for increases in staff salaries. However, it proved

                                          the water meter by photo camera, which transmitted the photo directly to the billing

                                          tor focused on reducing energy consumption—by rehabilitating the biggest pumping

                                          stations, improving pumping time by using the night tariff, switching to gravity supply as
                                          much as possible, and decreasing water losses.
                                             During the third phase of the contract, the emphasis shifted to strengthening customer rela-
                                          tions. The contractor established a customer service center with a call center and central-
                                          ized billing. Initially, customers were worried about lodging complaints to the customer
                                          center or using the customer hotline, as they had been discouraged by some AWSC employ-
                                          ees from doing so. In response, the contractor invested in training its staff to be more wel-
                                          coming to customers. The contractor also initiated a public relations and education

Results and Key Factors
The AWSC management contract proved efficient in significantly improving the continuity and
quality of water supply throughout the country. At the beginning of the contract, water sup-
ply was only 6 hours a day and continuity was the most important challenge. As customers
were not willing to pay for such poor water supply, improving the reliability of services
was crucial for catalyzing a virtuous circle and increasing willingness to pay. Throughout
the contract, improvement in water supply averaged a steady 1 additional hour per year and
increased threefold over the life of the contract—with on average about 18 hours of service
per day by the end of the contract (table 4.4). At the same time, the quality of the water
delivered improved markedly, with up to 98.7 percent water potability compliance by the
end of the contract.
  These results were achieved by focusing on some key operational actions: repairing the
most visible leaks, modernizing the reservoirs, rationalizing the distribution network,
through generalization of pressure reduction valves, the installation of more efficient
pumps, and fighting illegal connections.4 The improvements proved generally stronger
in  towns than in villages, reflecting the lack of sufficient funding for investment for
smaller  settlements, where unit costs were higher. A beneficiary survey conducted in

wastewater management had improved since 2004, while only 21 percent thought it had

contract, only 33 percent of respondents wanted to revert to state-­
  The operational efficiency of AWSC also significantly improved under the management
contract. The bill collection rate went up from 47.9 percent in 2004 to 90.1 percent in 2015.
Labor productivity doubled. The proportion of metered customers more than doubled, up
from 40.2 percent to 86.1 percent. Energy efficiency improved twofold, with unit power con-
sumption down from 0.43 kWh/m3 to 0.22 kWh/m3.
  However, little progress was made in improving the financial situation of AWSC, despite a
more than threefold increase in the collected revenues from water sales. While unit operating
costs continued to be very high—due in part to the wide dispersion of services across the
country, which stymied the achievement of economies of scale—the tariff level was still
below the one in Yerevan by the end of the management contract. As a direct consequence,
AWSC continued to depend on government subsidies for its financial survival. Over time,
AWSC’s equity decreased from the equivalent of $56 million in 2004 to $2.6 million in 2010.
Part of the difficulty was that the funds available for capex were too low, given the overall
deteriorated state of the system, compared to what would have been needed to carry out
modernization works and significantly reduce operating costs.
  While NRW was not part of the performance indicators at the beginning of the contract, tar-
gets were set for water losses (defined as NRW in the contract) in the fourth contract amend-
ment in 2011. The target was to reduce water losses from 83 percent in 2010 (which had gone
up from 76 percent since 2005) to 70 percent in 2014. There was only marginal improvement
and the target was not met, as the level of NRW stood at 78.4 percent in 2013. AWSC did
make  significant efforts to rationalize the distribution systems—among other things, by
installing pressure-reducing valves, replacing 180 km of pipes, and replacing leaking pipes
and valves in the basements of apartment buildings—but these actions more or less merely
compensated for the negative impact on leakages from improved continuity of supply (as
increasing duration and pressure also increases leakages). The government could simply not
afford the massive investment required to rehabilitate the water distribution system across
the 320 towns and smaller villages covered by AWSC. Again, as in Yerevan, the economic
level of leakages for AWSC is probably quite high anyway, given the abundance of low-cost
water resources across most of Armenia and the fact that most distribution systems are
gravity-based.
  Between 2004 and end 2011, the contractor earned a total $17 million in management fees. Of
this amount, $14.5 million represented the fixed fee and $2.5 million the performance bonus.
Up to year 9 (2013), the management fee was paid by the World Bank but, as of 2014, the
German government-owned development bank KfW started doing so. The fee was net of
VAT and Enterprise Profit Tax, as per the specific terms of the management contract.

Main Messages and Lessons Learned
The AWSC contract shows an evolution in the design of management contracts in Armenia.
First it focused on both managing and supervising the construction of infrastructure. This
approach was in contrast to that of the Yerevan contract, which focused on a smaller set of
activities, particularly metering and some limited rehabilitation. Second, the number of
KPIs was significantly reduced.
  As in the case of Yerevan and despite a more challenging environment, the AWSC manage-
ment contract achieved significant improvements in service quality and operational efficiency.
However, the dispersion of systems across the country made this process lengthier, more
difficult, and more costly. The 12-year duration of the management contract is unusual for
what should be a short-term arrangement, reflecting the many adjustments that had to be
made in the course of implementation and the lengthy decision-making process the govern-
ment went through, with the support of its development partners, on the timeline and struc-
ture of the second generation of water PPPs that started in 2017.
  Achieving financial sustainability for AWSC proved elusive. Although the private operator
delivered efficiency gains, reduced operating costs (especially electricity), and improved bill
collection, these actions were insufficient to fill the gap between revenues and operating costs,
largely because of insufficiently high tariff levels. The AWSC experience suggests that the
approach of seeking first to improve quality and raising tariffs only after service has improved
considerably may undermine the objective of reaching financial autonomy. In this case, while
service quality undoubtedly improved in terms of reliability, new connections, customer ser-
vice, and water quality, customers’ willingness to pay did not increase c
                                                                        ­ oncomitantly. Tariffs
would have had to increase by 50 percent more to cover O&M alone, and the government
showed no desire to take this action.
  As in the case of the Yerevan management contract, the overall outcome of the AWSC man-
agement contract is positive yet somewhat mixed. While the AWSC contract achieved signifi-
cant improvements in service quality and operational efficiency, it failed to make a significant
impact on the financial situation of the utility. Like in Yerevan, the government’s answer to
this problem was not to move away from the PPP, but instead to upgrade to a new level
under the second generation of PPP reform initiated in 2016—bypassing the 320 towns and
many other settlements served by AWSC under a lease contract, following the successful
approach implemented in Yerevan since 2005. Contrary to the earlier Yerevan case, there
was recognition that such a lease would not be financially viable on its own because of the
higher unit costs associated with the smaller size of many systems, and the additional costs
of managing services spread through the whole territory of the country. The government
therefore decided to tender a single national lease contract in 2016, thus allowing cross-­
subsidies between Yerevan and the rest of the country.
  As with the experiences of the Yerevan management contract and the lease contract,
AWSC’s management contract confirms the benefits of giving the operator autonomy to

manage the water company and execute the investment program. The government’s role was
restricted to supervising and monitoring the performance of the contractor, with minimal
interference in how the operator did its job. The operator designed and executed the invest-
ment program, managed the financial resources, and contributed working capital. This pro-
vided for an efficient alignment of incentives, as the private operator had a strong interest to
ensure that civil works were carried out diligently and would be directed at actions having
the greatest impact on the performance indicators monitored under its contract. At the same
time, the government, as well as the donors financing capex, still had a strong role through
supervision.

Chapter 5   Regional Utilities Management Contract:
            Nor Akunq, Lori, and Shirak: 2009–16
            Water Sector Context: Regional Utilities before the Management Contract
            A history of municipal water management: The three regional water utilities, Shirak Water and
            Sewerage Company (WSC), Lori WSC, and Nor Akunq WSC provided water and sewerage
            services to a combined population of 330,000 people in five towns and 60 rural settlements.
            These services were separate from AWSC, as the municipalities of Shirak, Lori, and Nor
            Akunq had been directly managing these companies since the 1996 decision by the govern-
            ment to decentralize water and sanitation services. Lori WSC supplies one town and 16 rural
            communities, Shirak WSC supplies two towns and 35 rural communities, and Nor Akunq
            WSC supplies two towns and nine rural communities. The three regional utilities were orga-
            nized as joint stock companies—the central government (through SCWE) holding majority
            control with 51 percent of the shares and local authorities owning the rest of the shares.
              The decentralization of water services in the 1990s had proved to be unworkable, as
            ­
            municipalities lacked the capacity to provide quality services and maintain the infrastructure.
            However, when the decentralization reform was reversed, the three utilities were not
            integrated into AWSC, as the German government-owned development bank KfW singled
            ­
            them out with a program to support municipal management of water services. Under its
            Communal Infrastructure Programs, KfW provided a total of €95 million to these three
            regional utilities over three successive phases: 2001–05, 2012–15, and post-2015—combining
            investment with extensive technical assistance. However, despite all these efforts, the
            attempt at turning around these municipal utilities proved quite disappointing. The poor
            service quality and performance largely continued, despite the investments and technical
            assistance provided under the KfW project—with the notable exception of the bill collection
            ratio, which improved significantly under public municipal management. This situation
            contrasted sharply with the wide, positive improvements achieved under the government’s
                program, especially the management contract for AWSC, which served most of the
            PPP ­
            remaining towns and villages in the country, under technical conditions comparable to
            those in these three cities. KfW subsequently revised its approach and agreed to the govern-
            ment’s request to provide support for another management contract targeted at the three
            regional utilities.


            Tendering and Contract Terms
            Because these three companies were too small to tender separately, the government decided
            to bundle them under one management contract with a single private operator. KfW provided
            assistance for the design and tendering process. A competitive tender was issued in 2008,
            and the bidding documents were prepared with technical assistance from KfW. A consor-
            tium of MVV Decon, MVV Energy, and AEG Services (an Armenian firm) was selected as

the private operator for Nor Akunq WSC, Shirak WSC, and Lori WSC. The 3-year manage-
ment contract was signed in 2009, with the explicit possibility of further extension. Following
an amendment to the contract in 2013, penalties were introduced and were applied from
2014 onward.
  The contract value was $7.4 million for the overall management fee, financed by KfW, which
also provided financing for capex under its Communal Infrastructure Programs (II and III),
to the tune of €68 million ($70 million) during the span of the management contract—a
capex amount equivalent to $212 per capita or $30 per capita per year. The government, as
the majority shareholder, remained responsible for developing and funding the capital
investment program. Tariffs were slightly lower in Shirak and Lori than in Nor Akunq at the
beginning of the contract, but all three cities saw tariff increases during the contract period
(figure 5.1). The average tariff for all three cities increased from $0.31/m3 in 2009 to $0.44/m3
in  2013, representing a 42 percent increase. Because major tariff increases had already
been introduced under public management, this tariff increase was smaller than that faced
by AWSC. The final tariff for the three utilities stood well above the one applied by AWSC in
other towns and villages across the country, which was about $0.30 per m3.


Implementation of the Contract
While SCWE monitored the performance of the private operator, the management contract of
the three regional utilities was different from the other management contracts in that the
municipalities were strongly involved at Board and managerial level. In theory, this arrange-
ment could have promoted transparency and accountability, and enhanced the supervision
of the private operator. In reality, it ended up allowing undue interference by local officials
in the utilities’ daily management. For instance, even though the three utilities were grossly
overstaffed, it was difficult for the private operator to initiate a serious rationalization effort
because of multiple pressures from local governments. Moreover, the regional utilities did
not benefit from the same kind of

Results and Key Factors
As with the other management and lease contracts, progress was made on three key perfor-
mance indicators: average duration of daily water supply, bill collection rate, and share of
customers having water meters (table 5.1). Arguably though, these improvements were of
somewhat lesser magnitude than the ones achieved by AWSC in other cities and towns across
the country.
  The performance in terms of labor productivity was disappointing. The labor productivity
ratio did improve in Nor Akunq, but much less than in the case of the AWSC management
contract. It remained broadly the same in Lori, and even deteriorated further in Shirak.
In line with the poor performance in terms of labor productivity, salary costs represented a

significant share of operating costs for the three companies, accounting for 48 percent of
costs in Lori, 44 percent in Shirak, and 24 percent in Nor Akunq (appendix B)—underlining
that little progress had been made in controlling operating costs.
  The improvements recorded for all three companies in customer metering and collection rate
helped to boost revenues. Fee collection indicators reached 100 percent for all utilities within
4 years of the management contract (i.e., before SAUR took over).1 However, these efforts
were not enough to cover O&M and debt service costs. The utilities continued to depend on
subsidies to cover their operational and debt service costs, in the case of Nor Akunq for the
entire management contract duration,2 and only to cover debt service, in the case of Shirak
and Lori during the last 2 years of the contract (table 5.2)—even though the tariff level was
higher than for towns in the rest of the country under AWSC.


Main Messages and Lessons Learned
The experience of the three regional utilities under municipal management underlines the
­challenge of turning around a publicly managed utility, when the political economy does not
provide for sufficient barriers against political meddling and interference, to name just one
factor. It did bring some tangible improvements, but the parallel—and more successful—­
implementation of the AWSC management contract provides an interesting point of compari-
son, especially since the latter was not allocated as much funding for capex and technical
assistance as the three regional utilities in their early years. Unfortunately, the governance
issues that had existed under the municipal public management model were not entirely
resolved under the management contract, as local authorities continued to play a role.

Nevertheless, the private consortium that took over was able to focus on improving the
administrative, commercial, and technical operations, with a level of attention not possible
for municipal authorities.
  The bundled management contract proved to be a good way to make the utilities attractive for
private management, even though it initially attracted only the local private sector. It also
allowed for economies of scale through a common investment program and operational
approach. The later incorporation of SAUR, which already operated the AWSC management
contract, provided further opportunities for scale economies. It also underlines again the
flexible approach taken by the government throughout the implementation of its water PPP
reform, confirming its ability to adjust to evolving needs.
  While continuity of water supply increased under this contract, the performance on water
losses was weak, even more so than under the Yerevan lease contract and the AWSC manage-
ment contract. Only in the case of Nor Akunq was there some reduction in NRW (by 10 per-
centage points, down to the still high level of 64.7 percent) while in the case of Shirak and
Lori, the level of NRW actually went up. As in the other cases, this was the direct result of the
steady improvement in the continuity of water supply and the associated increase in average
pressure in the distribution systems, combined with insufficient funds to rehabilitate the old
water distribution networks.
  As in the case of the Yerevan and AWSC management contracts, there was no turnaround of
the financial situation of the three utilities, despite the improvement in bill collection.
The regional utilities continued to receive state subsidies despite significant tariff increases
and a tariff level well above the one applied for AWSC in the other towns across the country
(and by the lessee in Yerevan). Again, this shows that while management contracts can be
efficient in improving some key aspects of service quality and operational efficiency, they
are not necessarily effective at improving the overall financial situation of a water utility—
unless a government is able and ready to sharply raise tariffs and control costs in parallel.


Notes
1.	 A significant improvement had been achieved under public management with the bill collection rate even before the start
   of the management contract, especially in Nor Akunq, where it already stood at 100 percent in 2009.

2.	 Nor Akunq had rather high operating costs because the water supply system was dependent on pumping and electrical
   costs, which made up 16 percent of its operating costs, compared to 6 percent in Shirak, and 9 percent in Lori.

            The water PPP reform in Armenia has clearly been a success. Private operators brought signifi-
            cant technical and operational gains, as the four PPP contracts succeeded (albeit to varying
                                                                                          services.

            Table  6.1 povides an overview of the main operational results of the four PPP ­
                                                                                        ­ tility under
            Appendix C provides more detailed data on the key indicators for each water u
            PPP, on a year-by-year basis.
              There is no doubt that the Armenian population benefited from the implementation of the
            PPPs, in terms of improved reliability of water supply and elimination of intermittent service
            and water shortages. The continuity of water supply—measured as the average number of
            hours per day when water is available at the tap—went up significantly under the three man-
            agement contracts, from between 6 and 12 hours per day to about 18 hours a day. Under the
            lease contract, continuous 24/7 water supply was established in most of Yerevan and is well
            on its way in secondary towns and cities. The large improvements in the energy efficiency of
            water systems also stand out as a remarkable success.
              The overall success of the water PPP reform in Armenia has been confirmed by positive
            ­opinion polls—that is, it is not only based on an expert’s assessment. Several opinion polls
            have confirmed that a majority of customers are satisfied with services and show no opposi-
            tion to the presence of foreign operators under the existing PPPs—in contrast to the rather
            negative perceptions held in Armenia about the privatizations carried out in other sectors.
            For instance, in a 2011 survey of customers in Yerevan, only 30 percent of respondents
            wanted to revert to publicly managed services rather than continue with a private water
            operator. On the same question, the result was 33 percent of Armenian Water Sewerage
            Company (AWSC) customers. The Armenia story confirms earlier studies that demonstrated
            that a PPP is a viable option for improving poorly performing water utilities in developing
            countries—provided it is properly implemented.
              This improvement in water service quality was achieved in a cost-effective manner, with
            Armenia enjoying a level of water tariffs among the lowest in the region (between $0.35 and
            $0.45 per m3 in 2015) (figure 6.1). In Yerevan, the lease contract succeeded in making water
            services fully self-financed by 2011, with tariff revenues covering all operating costs and debt
            services. Full cost recovery in Yerevan was achieved through major efficiency improvements,
            both in operations and capital investments:

            •	 In operations, energy efficiency was dramatically improved, and it is very likely that the country’s
              carbon footprint and its imports of fossil fuels were reduced significantly over the 16-year

  annual per capita basis, the amount spent on capex stood at about $5–6 in Yerevan (both
  under management and lease contracts). The capex allocated for the PPPs outside of
  Yerevan was significantly higher, at $24 per capita per year under the AWSC management
  contract and $301 for the 3-utilities management contract—reflecting the higher unit costs
  of serving smaller and less dense towns and settlements spread throughout the country’s
  entire territory (figure 4.3) The largest capex program was for AWSC, with investments
  through donors’ lending reaching a total of $180 million over 12 years (figure 6.1).



Key Lessons: What Are the Main Factors that Explain this Success?
It is important to reiterate that the success of water PPPs in Armenia was never a foregone con-
clusion—especially when considering that many developing countries that had initiated
management contracts around the same period in the late 1990s or early 2000s (such as
Venezuela, Lebanon, Jordan, Guyana, Trinidad, Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, and Albania)2
decided after a few years not to continue with PPP reform and went back to public manage-
ment only. Clearly though, Armenia’s success is not the result of chance: Armenia did sev-
eral things well, compared to how water PPPs were implemented in other developing countries
in the early 2000s.
  Perhaps the most crucial moment in the water PPP reform in Armenia was toward the end of
the first PPP—that is, the Yerevan management contract—when the government had to decide
whether to continue with the PPP experiment, or revert to public management. While this first
PPP had undoubtedly brought tangible improvements, it had also failed to meet the govern-
ment’s initial expectations, and the first 2 years of implementation had been quite difficult.
While the overall results were slightly more positive than in many other management
contracts tried elsewhere, the outcome was not radically different either.
  The crossing point of the Armenia water PPP experience was probably around the end of the
management contract in Yerevan, when the government did not feel discouraged by the somewhat
mixed results and challenges of implementation. As previously mentioned, instead of consid-
ering that with the Yerevan management contract the “glass was half empty” and PPP had
failed to meet expectations, the government took the view that the “glass was half full” and
                                                                                 ­ ontract—
decided to stay the course. Recognizing the inherent limitations of a management c
with limited transfer of risks and responsibilities to the private operator under a relatively short
duration—it did not end the PPP experiment but instead decided to take it to a new level, shift-
                                                                       management contracts to
ing in 2006 to a 10-year lease contract in Yerevan, and also expanding ­
the rest of the country, in preparation for another switch to a lease model later on.
  One possible reason for this more positive attitude toward water PPPs was that popular
­sentiment against foreign private companies was less pronounced than in some other develop-
ing countries. Armenia, a landlocked country with a dramatic history, was open to interna-
tional engagement and eager to develop closer links with the West. Its openness to outside
advice and willingness to study concrete experiences from other countries before making a



Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships                            49
decision about PPPs proved wise, as this approach shaped realistic expectations about what
an initial PPP could achieve. The decision to defer the start of the management contract for
AWSC until early lessons had been drawn from the Yerevan contract underscores this sober
and realistic attitude.
  Throughout the 16 years of water PPP reforms, the government of Armenia’s commitment
to acting as a true partner to the private operator was essential. This commitment was not
merely stated but also demonstrated through multiple concrete actions that helped the
PPPs to succeed. The extensive measures taken ahead of the first management contract
made the conditions for partnership with the private sector favorable for success (e.g., for
customer debt relief and restructuring the debt-ridden companies). The role of SCWE as an
efficient public counterpart was also essential, due to a combination of factors. SCWE had
strong and constant leadership, with the same Chairman at the helm for most of the first
generation of PPPs, thus providing stability and fostering trust with the private operators.
As the PPPs evolved, the government proved to be flexible, amending contracts when
needed and performing its monitoring functions with the support of an Independent
Technical Auditor.
  Another major benefit of the water PPP reform in Armenia was the adoption of a sequenced
approach—both for expanding the geographical scope of PPPs and for transferring risks and
responsibilities to the private sector. Armenia is quite unique among developing countries for
having adopted such a gradual strategy, but it ended up paying off handsomely. The phased
approach allowed the government to build capacity for the design and implementation of
PPPs gradually, learning on the way and adjusting to lessons learned. It also allowed tariffs
to increase gradually, in parallel with improvements in service quality, so as to reduce poten-
tial opposition from the population and keep momentum for the reform. In the case of
Yerevan, starting with a management contract before transitioning to a lease contract also
turned out to be a good move: it allowed a reliable database to be built first and reinforced
the government’s capacity to interact as a strong public counterpart. Consequently, there
were lower risks for the private sector to bid on the lease when the tender was carried out in
2005, resulting in more favorable financial offers from bidders than if the lease had been
initiated immediately in 2000. The phased approach also proved key to ultimately achieving
full cost recovery in Yerevan while keeping the water tariff at a low level compared to regional
benchmarks.
  The gradual approach adopted for water PPPs in Armenia also shows that the common
belief that establishing an appropriate institutional framework is a prerequisite for successful
water PPPs is largely misplaced. While the government did implement major reforms during
the first years of PPPs, the first management contract in Yerevan was launched in 2000, well
before the new national Water Law (2002) was enacted, the national regulator put in place
(2003), and almost all the new legal acts required (e.g., on metering and debt collection)
were passed. Instead of a dogmatic view of water PPP reform, Armenia chose to be practical:
had the country first tried to put in place, before embarking on its first PPP, all the new laws and

reforms deemed necessary for a PPP to succeed, it might have lost the whole momentum for
reform. The experience of Armenia indicates that reform should be viewed as a gradual pro-
cess, and that putting in place (and fine-tuning) the appropriate institutional framework can
be done in parallel with the implementation of PPPs rather than completed beforehand as a
prerequisite.
  Leaving the private operator in charge of implementing capex, and giving it flexibility on
investment decisions and supervision, while the government remained responsible for financing
investment, is a rather specific feature of the Armenia water PPP experience, one that proved
crucial for success. The private operators had direct incentives to use the limited funds avail-
able for investment in an efficient manner, focusing on those actions that would have the
maximum impact on service quality and operational efficiency, and ensuring that procure-
ment and civil work were carried out in a diligent manner. This flexibility allowed the vari-
ous PPPs to achieve remarkable results regarding service quality and efficiency, despite the
fact that the overall amount of funds allocated by the government to support investments
under the PPP reform was modest by international standards.
  The mixed results on achieving financial sustainability of the water companies largely
reflect political decisions linked to water tariff levels, rather than an inherent weakness of the
PPP approach. The successive PPPs have eased the financial burden of the water sector on
the government’s budget and improved creditworthiness in a general manner. However,
only in Yerevan have water services managed to achieve operational cost recovery (in
2011), and this took more than a decade. This was achieved under a lease contract whereby
the tariff level had been set as a result of the tender process, with the private operator tak-
ing a calculated risk that such a tariff would ensure full cost recovery after efficiency
improvements had been carried out. AWSC and the regional utilities remained dependent
on subsidies to cover their operating costs: even though the government had allowed tariff
increases in all cases, these were insufficient to ensure full cost recovery. The two key
­
lessons here are that:

•	 A management contract alone is not by itself sufficient to achieve full cost recovery, unless
  the government is willing to take the necessary measures to raise tariffs so as to accom-
  pany the expected improvements in bills collections and operational costs reduction;

•	 A lease can be more efficient than a management contract in promoting a move to self-­
  financing sustainability of the water sector. Under a lease contract, the private sector has
  sharper incentives, and more flexibility and responsibilities for operating the system if the
  tariff is set through the tender process. This has also been illustrated by water PPP reforms
  in other developing countries, such as Senegal and Niger, where a private operator was
  able to bring service quality to international levels and achieve full cost recovery through
  tariff revenues after about a decade.3

  All four PPP contracts have highlighted the difficulty of addressing non-revenue water
(NRW), which remains stubbornly high even after 16 years of presence of a private operator

in Yerevan. The NRW level still lies between 70 and 90 percent, depending on the service
area. While this could at first seem a setback, the review of individual PPPs showed that this
was largely due to the fact that the private operators were concentrating on reducing inter-
mittent supply—that is, increasing the average number of hours that water was available at
the tap—which also had the direct negative effect of increasing the average pressure in the
network and thereby the level of leakages. While the private operators did take actions to
reduce leakages—such as introducing district zoning and installing pressure valves—the fact
that only a limited amount of funds was available under the capex program to rehabilitate
the distribution network made it impossible to achieve more than keeping the NRW at the
same level (but with increased average pressure). Another important element is that as
water resources in Armenia are cheap and plentiful, and the private operators also took
major actions to switch distribution networks toward being gravity-fed, there were consid-
erably fewer incentives for investing in leakage reduction and much fewer financial/­
         benefits to be derived from doing so.
economic ­
 The Armenia PPP experience also highlights the importance of designing “smart”
­
incentives for achieving results under PPPs. The private sector is driven by clear financial
incentives, and it is essential that these incentives are properly designed in the contract to
guide the private operators’ behavior toward what a government wants in terms of
improvement. In this context, the incentives framework applied in Armenia gradually
evolved as lessons were learned. The large number of contractual KPIs under the first man-
agement contract in Yerevan was reduced in the AWSC and 3-cities management contracts.
While remuneration under the first management contract in Yerevan was largely based on
a fixed management fee (reflecting the high risks associated with the first water PPP con-
tract in the country), the AWSC management contract not only introduced more variable
payments but also established a cap for bonuses and penalties (at respectively +25 percent
and −20 percent of the fixed fee), an acknowledgment of the risks associated with having
to turn around water services scattered across the entire territory of the country. Another
insight from Armenia’s management contracts is that it is advisable to start with bonuses
when there is a significant risk of failing to attract operators, but then move on to add pen-
alties once better services have been established. The adoption of an “enhanced lease”
structure for the second PPP in Yerevan sharpened the incentives structure and was key to
the good results achieved over a decade.
 Finally, continuous donor support proved crucial for the success of the water PPP reform in
Armenia. The PPP results were the fruit of a sustained partnership not just between the
government and private operators, but also between the government and donors. Donors
financed most of the investment carried out under the PPP contracts as well as funding for
preparation of PPPs, staff retrenchment, and remuneration of the operators under the
management contracts. Yet this was not just about providing funds. The technical
­
assistance provided through the supervision of donor-financed investment projects
during regular donor missions and visits was also important. Technical support was

especially important as SCWE was open and eager to seek advice based on international
experiences in order to deal with the inevitable challenges encountered throughout the
implementation of the PPPs. In the early years, the World Bank played a leading role in
this process, gradually withdrawing after more than a decade as the reform became more
mature and other donors were willing to step in and take over for the second generation
of water PPPs.


Notes
1.	 Total amount spent by donors on investments in the three regional utilities of Shirak, Lori, and Nor Akunq is actually
   underestimated, as it does not include all the relevant expenditures covered by KfW funding between 2000 and 2008,
   ­
   when the utilities were under public management.

2.	 These management contracts include Amman (Jordan), Georgetown (Guyana), Trinidad, Ghana, Johannesburg (South
   Africa), Uganda, Zambia mining towns, Tripoli (Lebanon), Lara and Monagas (Venezuela), and Durres (Albania). All these
   management contracts were developed at about the same time with support from donors (especially the World Bank),
   followed a broadly similar design and contractual structure, and brought equally mixed results—bringing improvements in
   ­
   some areas of performance but not in all areas.

3.	 Full cost recovery was achieved, though, with a higher tariff level than in Armenia. Moreover, in a few other cases of lease
   contracts, for instance, the Maputo lease in Mozambique and the Dar el Salam lease in Tanzania (2003–04), the PPP reform
   actually failed.

Chapter 7   Second Generation of Water PPPs:
            National Lease Contract since 2017
            Addressing Remaining Water and Wastewater Challenges
            As early as 2013—as the three PPP contracts in Yerevan, the Armenian Water and Sewerage
            Company (AWSC) service area, and the 3 regions were drawing to a close—the government
            started to review its options for the next phase. As the validity of working with private
            operators had by then been solidly demonstrated, it was keen to pursue the PPP reform
            ­
            through a “second generation” of contracts that would expand the role of the private sector,
            but it was not clear what form this would take. While the first generation of PPPs had resulted
            in considerable gains, there was still a need to improve continuity of water supply, quality of
            services, efficiency of water resource management and financial viability, especially outside
            of Yerevan. Considering what had already been achieved under the various PPPs, the
            government faced three different challenges:
            ­

            •	 In Yerevan: How to sustain the remarkable gains achieved over 16 years of efforts under the
              successive management contract (2000–05) and lease contract (2006–16)—especially in
              terms of achieving self-financing of the sector—while also continuing with further
              improvements in areas not previously or not fully addressed (e.g., NRW reduction,
              ­wastewater treatment);

            •	 In towns and cities across the rest of the country (covered by AWSC and the 3 utilities in
              Shirak, Lori, and Nor Akunq): How to consolidate and further enhance the gains achieved
              under the two management contracts—especially for reaching continuous, 24/7 supply
              nationwide—and how to phase out government subsidies and move to financial sustain-
              ability, as happened in Yerevan;

            •	 In the 579 smaller settlements that had been left outside of the PPP reform and lacked proper
              water systems: What to do in order to improve access to piped water for this population in
              a sustainable manner—either by gradually incorporating them under the new lease or
              through other schemes.

              This last point was particularly critical, as the population of these 579 villages is estimated at
            about 650,000 (about one quarter of the country’s total population), who were not covered
            by the PPP reform and therefore did not benefit from it. These residents mostly live in remote
            and poor areas, where they were not receiving water and sanitation services from any formal
            providers. Some villages relied on local schemes with distribution through rudimentary
            pipes or community standpipes. Others relied on water trucks. Because disinfection is not a
            common practice in these areas, they face a high risk of water contamination (although in
            the absence of monitoring, incidences of bacteriological pollution are not well documented).
            Local village organizations typically carry out some basic form of operations and mainte-
            nance (O&M) with little outside support—and tariffs are either nonexistent or very low.



            Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships                            55
 The decision-making process leading to the choice of a single national lease involved ­extensive
consultations with stakeholders, including drawing on donors’ experiences elsewhere. Many
options were reviewed,1 and the government finally leaned toward a single national
lease contract that would combine the service areas of all utilities served by the previous
PPPs: Yerevan, towns and villages served by AWSC, and the three utilities in Shirak, Lori,
and Nor Akunq.
 The main advantages of this approach were twofold. First, having only one private operator
would allow for economies of scale to be reaped through lower operating costs for the oper-
ator and lower supervision costs for the government. Second, it would result in a single
national water and sanitation tariff for the whole country, allowing for cross-subsidization
between Yerevan (where the unit operating cost was lower and residents had already bene-
fited from improved services) and the rest of the country (which had higher operating costs
on average, more needs for service provision investments and improvements, and a higher
incidence of poverty). Given the relatively small size of Armenia, the national lease contract
would serve a total population of just about 2.2 million, which was not excessive by interna-
tional standards. The main downside of this single, national PPP approach was that the gov-
ernment would lose the “competitive edge” that it had enjoyed until then by having ­different
private water operators in the country. However, provided that the contract was awarded to
a truly competent operator and proper regulation could be ensured, this disadvantage was
considered manageable.
 By mid-2014, the final decision to go with a single national contract had been made and the
government issued two decrees2 stipulating that after the expiration of the first set of
PPP contracts, a single lease operator would be selected on a competitive basis. The plan
was to transfer the right to operate water systems and other property then operated by
Yerevan Djur, AWSC, Lori WSC, Shirak WSC, and Nor Akunq WSC to one private water
operator for 15 years. A single tariff would be established for water supply and sanitation
­
services throughout the country, effectively expanding the geographical cross-subsidies
already in place between the secondary cities, towns, and villages served by AWSC, to
              subsidies between Yerevan (as well as the three regional utilities) and the
include cross-­
rest of the country.


Tendering and Contract Terms
As with the previous PPP contracts, donors provided the funding and technical support nec-
essary to prepare and carry out the tendering process. The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD) provided a grant to finance the recruitment of three interna-
tional consulting companies that would help organize the tender. The PPP transaction
advisor was Fichtner (Germany), in association with AVAG Solutions (Armenia). Two other
international consulting firms were recruited: one engineering firm, to carry out the
technical audit of the water companies, and one accounting firm, to provide support for
­

property registration, evaluation, and cadastral registration. Appendix D provides more
details on the tendering process.
  The package of tender documents specified that the future lessee would not receive any
operating subsidies during the lease contract, which meant that the future national tariff for
water and wastewater services was expected to cover all O&M costs in full. The successful
bidder had to meet the technical evaluation requirements and submit the lowest tariff for
water supply and sanitation services. The lessee had an obligation to pay a lease fee of AMD
89.75 billion (about $190 million) over the duration of the 15-year contract, based on a contrac-
tual schedule of payments (two installments in each year of the contract). The lease payment
schedule was set up so as to gradually cover the loan servicing costs of the five water supply
companies—up to 25 percent of the water companies’ loan servicing costs in 2017, and reach-
ing 100 percent after 8 years (i.e., by 2025).
  The national lease contract was structured as an “enhanced lease,” continuing the success-
ful approach followed with the Yerevan lease. It defined minimum levels of mandatory
capital works program for each contract year, with the lessee having an obligation to finance
from its own funds a certain amount of mandatory capital spending with an annual average of
AMD 2.5 billion (about $5 million per year), which is equivalent to about 12.5 percent of
total  capex for the whole contract duration. The contract also included four priority key
performance indicators (KPIs)—continuity of supply and water quality, which were already
                                                                           satisfaction4—
tracked under previous PPPs, plus two new indicators for NRW3 and consumer ­
with penalties to be paid if targets were not met. A large number of internal benchmarking
indicators was also included, which are not subject to penalties.5 Performance monitoring
continues to rely on independent technical auditors. With the inclusion of NRW as a KPI
with penalties and the rather aggressive schedule of KPI improvement targets, the incentive
structure of the new national lease has been significantly sharpened compared to the previous
Yerevan lease.
  Relative responsibilities for implementation of capex by the private operator and the State
Committee for Water Economy (SCWE) have been modified under the new national lease. In a
significant departure from the previous PPPs, the government—through SCWE as lessor—
will be taking back control of the execution of most of the investment program financed
with public funds.6 While this is the typical approach under a standard lease contract, it
represents a major change compared to the approach that had been followed under the
Yerevan lease and AWSC management contracts, where the private operators had been
given significant flexibility for the identification, design, tender, and supervision of civil
works and other investments. It is important to note that by taking over the capex execu-
tion responsibility, the government is modifying the risk balance of the PPP, and by gaining
more control is also effectively taking more risks. Untimely execution of the scheduled
capex by SCWE would become the government’s responsibility and, since it would proba-
bly also affect the financial equilibrium of the lease (as  some of the cost reductions

expected through upgrading investments would be delayed), this could lead to a call for
renegotiation by the private operator. The position of SCWE is that it preferred to regain
control over investments because it felt that it had acquired sufficient capacity to be able
to carry out capex functions efficiently on its own.
     During the tendering process, four consortia were initially prequalified but in the end only
two companies submitted a full bid—Veolia (which had been successfully operating the lease
contract in Yerevan for the previous 10 years) and an Armenian-Russian consortium. As its
technical bid was the only one considered satisfactory, Veolia was awarded the lease contract
with a financial offer that was also deemed acceptable. The contract was signed on November
21, 2016, and set for 15 years. The new national water operator was formally established as
Veolia Water CJSC.
     After the award of the lease contract, Veolia Water applied for a formal tariff approval to
the PRSC. The PSRC approved the tariff in December 2016, and it has been in force since
January 1, 2017. The overall tariff for retail water supply and wastewater treatment services
was  set at 180 AMD/m3—equivalent to about $0.37/m3—inclusive of VAT for the entire
­country. Of this amount, 85 percent is for water supply and 15 percent for sewerage services.
This tariff level represents a reduction for customers outside of Yerevan, and remains among
the lowest in the region (table 7.1).
     A noteworthy element of the lease tender is that it introduced the concept of “affordable
tariff.” The government’s latest development program (2014–25) requires that drinking
water charges not exceed 2.5 percent of consumer spending in the poorest quintile of the
population, given an estimated daily consumption volume of 70 liters per capita. The PPP
transaction advisor carried out an assessment of tariffs based on a financial model specifi-
cally developed for this purpose, to ensure that the financial offers would meet that crite-
rion (box 7.1). The tariff level with which Veolia won the tender of the national lease does
meet the national water affordability threshold, which is also much stricter than the
affordability threshold typically applied in other countries—meaning that affordability for
the poor should be ensured.

        BOX 7.1. Introducing a Tariff Threshold in the Tender Evaluation of the
        National Lease


        According to 2014 household survey data, consumer spending in the poorest quintile
        of the population was AMD 15.7 ($37.8) per capita, and the maximum affordable
        drinking water tariff was AMD 187 ($0.45)/m3.a An affordable tariff forecast for the
        coming years was carried out based on the assumption that consumer spending in the
        poorest quintile of the population would increase annually by 4 percent per capita.

        It should be noted that international standards normally use lower requirements
        for the affordable tariff than the one adopted in Armenia. For example, the United
        Nations Development Programme (UNDP) recommends that for a tariff to be
        considered affordable, the charges for drinking water should not exceed the median
        of 3 percent of household income. Based on the 2014 household survey data, the
        affordable tariff by UNDP standards was AMD 542 ($1.11) per cubic meterb—well above
        the current tariff level under the three PPPs and the national tariff that would result
        from the tender of the national lease.

            The long and generally successful story of Armenia’s water PPPs offers a wealth of knowledge
            and lessons for those interested in using PPPs as a delivery model for improved water services.
            Armenia’s experience is remarkable for a number of reasons. First is the diversity of contracts,
            including a classic management contract, a lease, and a bundled management contract for
            three service areas. The second is the success (to varying degrees) of each contract. While
            operations and maintenance (O&M) cost recovery did not materialize except in Yerevan, and
            water losses remained very high, these results reflect policy choices (tariffs and investment
            funding) rather than fundamental flaws in the PPPs themselves. Third, the evolution in PPPs
            illustrates the benefits of learning from experience. Lastly, Armenia is one of the few
            countries in the world that has a significant proportion of its population (about 75 percent)
            ­
            receiving water services under private provision over many years. Armenia is also distinct
            because the foreign private water operators have been well accepted by the population, a
            feat that is difficult to accomplish in many other countries.
              While Armenia’s 16 years of PPP experience has largely been positive, the implementation
            of the new national lease contract begins a new phase, involving a greater transfer of risks to the
            private sector and also to the government, which is now responsible for the capital program. For
            the government, having to deal with one single private operator rather than several, as in the
            previous reform, will also represent an important change. Three issues deserve emphasis at
            this stage because they will need to be prioritized for the second phase of the water PPP reform
            in Armenia to continue bringing sustained benefits to the country: (i) timely implementation of
            scheduled capital expenditures (capex); (ii) improvement of water services for currently
            unserved communities; and (iii) expansion of wastewater collection and treatment in a
            responsible way.


            The Timely Implementation of the Scheduled Capex Will Be Critical
            According to the “Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy and Finance Program” approved by
            the Republic of Armenia (RA) government in August, 2015, the total investment costs for
            water and wastewater systems for 2017–32 are estimated at AMD 300 billion (about
            $628 ­million, or about $42 million per year). Of this amount, AMD 262.5 billion (87.5 percent)
            should be from state investment and AMD 37.5 billion (12.5 percent) from investments made
            directly by the lessee for the entire contract duration.
              In order to finance the investment program under the national lease contract, donors have
            so far committed to providing $200 million for the first 5-year period. The timely execution of
            this investment program is essential for the private operator to be able to expand the suc-
            cessful results already achieved in Yerevan to the rest of the country, and meet the perfor-
            mance improvement targets set by the contract’s key performance indicators (KPIs):
            non-revenue water (NRW) and service continuity. It is also essential for maintaining the
            financing equilibrium of the lease, since a portion of it will be directed at investments to

improve operational efficiency, and the private operator made its financial offer in the ten-
der (i.e., level of national tariff) based on the expectation that operating costs could be
reduced in part thanks to these new, upgrading investments.
  At the early stage of the national lease contract, ensuring that all funding committed by
donors will materialize, and the capex program will be implemented by the State Committee for
Water Economy (SCWE) in a timely manner, remains a critical issue. Enhanced donor support
for capacity building may be necessary to ensure that SCWE has the capacity to carry out this
new responsibility in a diligent manner. Uncertainties regarding the evolution of the govern-
ment’s fiscal situation may create some challenges to finalizing all required borrowing.


How to Provide Improved Water Services for the 650,000 Residents of
Unserved Communities?
The design of the second generation of water PPPs took into account the challenge of the
remaining 650,000 people living in remote settlements (579 villages) who so far have not
benefited from the reform. The lease contract stipulates that the private operator has an
obligation to incorporate, upon SCWE’s request, new settlements into its service area each year,
­
up to a total of 20,000 additional people, without the need for renegotiation of the financial
terms. However, as of January 2017, there was no clear policy or strategy yet for incorporat-
ing these unserved communities into the service area.
  One key limitation is that while these remote settlements currently have a poor water
supply, the population for a large part also pays very little or nothing for that water (except
­
for the residents who are served by trucks). As these remote areas tend to have a high ­poverty
rate, it is unclear whether these rural populations would easily accept being incorporated into
the service area of the private operator and have to start paying the new national water tariff in
exchange for better service. Furthermore, for these communities to agree, significant invest-
ments in systems rehabilitation and expansion would be required considering the typically
high unit costs of small remote settlements. As funding is the government’s ­
                                                                            responsibility,
the uncertainty about funding may end up jeopardizing the policy objective of achieving
financial self-sufficiency for the water sector by 2025.
  A new €10 million KfW grant from the EU-NIF has been earmarked to incorporate about
30 villages in the short term. The villages were identified based on technical feasibility and
the residents’ willingness to join the national service area—but the question of what to do
with the remaining majority of villages remains open. For the poorest settlements, provision
of improved services through community standpipes may remain a more viable solution in
the  first stage, or an operational subsidy may be needed in case individual household
connections are chosen. An alternative option to explore would be to promote some form of
­
contractual technical assistance for critical operational processes (for instance, chlorine dis-
infection) between the private operator and some of the village communities. This arrange-
ment could allow a domestic private sector to gain competence in water operations, which is
important for the country in the long term.

                                    How to Expand Wastewater Collection and Treatment in a Sound and
                                    Sustainable Manner?
                                    Investment in wastewater treatment was largely left out during the first 16 years of water PPP
                                    reforms in Armenia, in recognition that more urgent priorities had to be tackled first. It is to
                                    be hoped that, under the new national lease contract, the country will be able to start invest-
                                    ing in wastewater collection and treatment, at least regaining the level of wastewater treat-
                                    ment achieved during the time of the Soviet Union, when secondary treatment was available
                                    in Yerevan and a number of other secondary cities. There are nascent signs that progress has
                                    already started, as the new wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Yerevan (photo 8.1) is
                                    expected to start operation in 2017—restricted at first to primary treatment only—and some
                                    donors have expressed interest in financing new WWTPs in secondary cities.
                                      While more emphasis on wastewater treatment in the future is a welcome development
                                    for the protection of water resources in the country, expectations on how far wastewater
                                    treatment can go should be tempered. The environmental and health benefits should not
                                    distract from the fact that wastewater treatment is costly, not just in terms of investment but
                                    even more in terms of O&M. In addition, realistic goals should be set, bearing in mind that
                                    secondary treatment of effluent may need to be deferred until a later stage when the eco-
                                    nomic case for it is stronger. The experience of the implementation of the Urban Wastewater

                                    major difficulties in trying to comply, underlines the many challenges involved. Armenia is
                                                                       still far from the level of economic development that makes

                                                                       Armenia, recognizing in particular that any new WWTP will

                                                                       under the national lease contract. Future funding for WWTP

                                                                       Investments in new WWTPs will always need to ensure that
                                                                       the utility will have sufficient financial means—through tar-

74                                        Review of Armenia’s Experience with Water Public-Private Partnerships
Appendix D   Tendering Process for the New National
             Lease Contract: 2015–16

             RA Government Decree N 1233-N of October 15, 2015, stated that the selection of the lessee
             would be organized through competitive dialogue. The same decree also defined the
             prequalification requirements for companies participating in the procurement procedure.
             ­
             With the support of the PPP transaction advisor, SCWE prepared the prequalification organi-
             zation package of the tender, which the government then approved.1 Under Article 21 of the
             RA  “Law on Procurement,” SCWE published the prequalification announcement both in
             the  Official Journal of Procurement (www.gnumner.am), as well as on the international
             UN Development Business website (www.devbusiness.com) on December 15, 2015. Initially,
             January 21, 2016, was the deadline for submission of applications (the opening day of the
             prequalification applications). However, another government decree extended the closing
             date and February 22, 2016 was set as the new deadline for submission of prequalification
             applications in order to attract the maximum number of potential participants in the tender
             process while maintaining the competitive factors.
               The following mandatory requirements were set for the tender participants by the
             ­prequalification procedure:


             1.	 Compliance of professional activity with the contractual activity:

             a. For a period of not less than 5 years during the 15-year period, the operator should have
             implemented either: (i) one water systems management, operations and maintenance
             (O&M) project of no less than 5 years duration to provide water supply services to at least
             600,000 people annually, or (ii) two or more water supply projects serving a combined total
             population of at least 800,000 (with at least one named project serving a population of more
             than 300,000).

             b. The bidder should have water system management, O&M, and project implementation
             experience providing services in at least three different countries during the last 15-year
             period.


             2.	 Professional experience:

             a. Should have performed reconstruction and rehabilitation of water systems for at least
             three projects, each costing not less than the equivalent of $5 million during the last 15-year
             period.

             b. For a period of not less than 5 years during the preceding 15-year period, the bidder should
             have experience with implementing one project of water systems management, O&M
             providing services to at least 100,000 people in the territory of the RA.

3.	 Financial resources:

a. Should have an average annual turnover of $50 million equivalent in respect of its water
systems management, O&M over the last 5 years.


Following prequalification, SCWE announced the firms eligible to participate in the tender.
In March 2016, invitations for participation in the tender package were sent out. As already
mentioned above, the three PPP contracts were to expire on May 31, 2016. However, due to
the extensive and time-consuming bidding process, under RA Government Decree N 1233-N
of October 15, 2015, the closing date for the existing PPP contracts was extended until
January 1, 2017, when the new lessee would assume its contractual obligations.


The following organizations/departments were directly involved in the tender process:

•	 The RA government, under whose decisions the bidding documents, the results of all
     bidding phases, and the final contract were approved.
     ­

•	 The State Committee of Water Economy of the RA Ministry of Agriculture as a customer,
     a  procurement manager, a property leaser, and a lease contract party (RA Government
     Decrees N 883-N dated August 14, 2014, and N 1233-N, dated October 15, 2015).

•	 The InterGovernmental Committee formed under RA Government Decree N 140-A, dated
     February 19, 2015 (the Chairman is Minister-Chief of the RA Government Staff David
     Harutyunyan), with which the documents regarding the tender were agreed before being
     circulated and before relevant decisions were adopted by the government or the Prime
     Minister.

•	 The RA Public Services Regulatory Commission, which must provide water systems use
     permits to the tender winning company, and approve the drinking water tariff and its
     subsequent modification mechanism fixed in the lessee’s contract.
     ­

•	 The Ministry of Environmental Protection, which issues water use permits.
