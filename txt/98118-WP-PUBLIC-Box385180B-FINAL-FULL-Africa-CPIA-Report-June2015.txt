2014 CPIA RESULTS FOR AFRICA


Summary
u	The overall quality of policies and institutions in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa was unchanged in 2014,
   but there was much variation in performance across countries.
u	More than half the countries in the region saw a change in their policy environment: 10 countries
   experienced an improvement in their overall Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score,
   and an equal number saw a deterioration.
u	There were divergent trends across policy clusters. Economic management weakened on the back of
   continuing fiscal policy slippage, as the sharp drop in commodity prices underscored weaknesses in the
   fiscal framework of several of the region’s countries.
u	By contrast, there was some strengthening in the governance cluster, with nine countries showing
   improvements in scores, more than twice the number of countries with declines. The greatest progress in
   this cluster was in the quality of budgetary and financial management.
u	The average CPIA score for Sub-Saharan Africa’s non-fragile countries remained comparable to that of
   non-fragile countries elsewhere, while the region’s fragile countries saw a narrowing of the gap with
   fragile countries in other regions.




Recent Trend and Analysis

The CPIA Africa report describes the progress African countries are making on strengthening the quality
of their policies and institutions. It presents CPIA scores for the 38 African countries that are eligible for
support from the International Development Association (IDA), the concessional financing arm of the
World Bank Group. CPIA scores reflect the quality of a country’s policy and institutional framework across
16 dimensions, grouped into four clusters: economic management (Cluster A), structural policies (Cluster
B), policies for social inclusion and equity (Cluster C), and public sector management and institutions
(Cluster D). The scores, which are on a scale of 1–6, with 6 being the highest, are computed by World
Bank staff and are based on quantitative and qualitative information. The assessment also relies on the
judgments of World Bank staff. CPIA scores are used in determining IDA’s allocation of resources to the
poorest countries.

Beginning in 2014, the CPIA Africa report includes coverage of two countries in the Middle East and North
Africa region: Djibouti and the Republic of Yemen.

CPIA Scores and the Twin Goals of Eliminating Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity

The World Bank Group is committed to the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared
prosperity within a framework of sustainable development. The first goal is essentially to reduce the share
of global population living on less than $1.25 a day to less than 3 percent by 2030. Having achieved the
MDG goal of halving poverty for the world, the new goal is to be more ambitious and eliminate poverty
altogether. The focus of the second goal is to improve the pace of income growth of the bottom 40 percent

                  4.0 (figure 3). Other relatively high scorers were Cabo Verde (3.9), closely followed by Kenya, Senegal, and
                  Tanzania, all with scores of 3.8. The low end of the score range was unchanged at 2, with South Sudan
                  slipping to the bottom.

cluster declined to 3.3 from last year’s 3.4,
while the governance cluster saw a rebound,
with the cluster score climbing to 3.0 from 2.9 in 2013 (figure 5). The sharp, broad-based plunge in
commodity prices in 2014 complicated economic management in several of the region’s countries
and underscored weaknesses in the fiscal framework of these countries. Resource-rich countries—
especially oil exporters such as Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria, but also mineral exporters such
as Burkina Faso, Niger, and Zambia—were hard hit by the adverse terms-of-trade shock, as lower
commodity prices depressed export earnings and reduced commodity-based fiscal revenues. Policy
adjustment was particularly challenging in countries with depleted policy buffers. More than one-
third of the countries, mostly commodity exporters, experienced a slippage in fiscal or monetary
policy. Consequently, the overall quality of economic management posted a deterioration in 2014.
By contrast, there was some strengthening in the governance cluster, with nearly one-fourth of
countries posting gains in scores, more than twice the number of countries with declines. Within this
cluster, the largest progress was in the quality
of budgetary and financial management

                     A comparison of IDA borrowers in Sub-Saharan Africa with those elsewhere shows a narrowing of the
                    gap on the average overall CPIA score. This reflects a weakening in the overall CPIA score in the latter
                    group. Although the regional average CPIA score for Sub-Saharan Africa remains below that of other IDA
                    countries, this gap is largely explained by the performance of the region’s fragile countries. Sub-Saharan
                    Africa has 17 of the 34 countries that are classified as being fragile (Appendix B). A comparison by country
                    groups shows that the region’s fragile countries continue to lag fragile countries elsewhere (figure 6).
                    The score gap between these two country groups narrowed in 2014, because of the deterioration in the
                    score for fragile countries in other regions. At the same time, Sub-Saharan Africa’s non-fragile countries
                    continued to post scores that were similar to those of non-fragile countries outside the region, although
                    both sets of countries saw some pullback in overall scores.

Analysis of CPIA Components
CLUSTER A: ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
The quality of monetary and exchange rate, fiscal, and debt policies are covered under
this cluster.
Similar to last year, stresses in fiscal policy were evident across several countries. More than a fourth of
the region’s countries (11) experienced a slippage in this policy area, including Burkina Faso, Central
African Republic, Kenya, Niger, and Nigeria (table 2). Within the economic management cluster, one area
where countries are showing progress is in debt policy and management. Among countries with gains
in this component are Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Zambia.
Overall, however, the regional score of cluster A declined to 3.3 from 3.4 in 2013, because of weaker fiscal
policy performance.

The quality of economic management varies sharply across country groups, with oil-rich countries (CPIA
score 3.1) trailing both non-oil resource-rich countries (3.5) and non-resource-rich countries (3.3) (figure 7).
This pattern has persisted since 2008, when oil-rich countries saw a sharp deterioration in their economic
management performance.

                  account balance and exchange rate. Sharp currency depreciations and substantial foreign reserve
                  losses prompted adjustments in monetary and exchange rate policies in some of Sub-Saharan Africa’s
                  oil exporters. For example, in Nigeria, the Central Bank raised the policy rate from 12 to 13 percent and
                  devalued the naira by 8 percent in November 2014.1 The pass-through from the naira devaluation and the
                  election-related stimulus added to price pressures in Nigeria. Many of the region’s oil exporters, including
                  Cameroon, Chad, and the Republic of Congo, are part of the Central Africa Economic and Monetary
                  Community and have a common currency (the CFA franc) that is pegged to the euro. The depreciation of
                  the euro against the dollar translated into a depreciation of the CFA franc against the dollar.

                  Elsewhere, Ghana continued to battle double-digit inflation, as the country struggled to contain its high
                  twin deficits (on the current account and the fiscal balance). Although lower oil prices helped to reduce
                  pressure on the current account of oil importers, the broad-based U.S. dollar appreciation, since mid-2014,
                  put depreciation pressures on currencies in some oil-importing countries, such as the Zambian kwacha
                  and Ugandan shilling, pushing up inflation in those countries. Overall, the region’s current account deficit
                  widened to an estimated 3.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014

                  Fiscal Policy
                   This component assesses the stabilization and resource allocation aspects of fiscal policy. The evolution
                  of fiscal outcomes over the past several years shows that fiscal deficits have widened recently, and have
                  not recovered to pre-global financial crisis levels (2007–08), as fiscal policy has supported aggregate
                  demand in the face of a generally weak global economic recovery (figure 8). Government spending has
                  climbed from 22 percent of GDP in 2007 to 27 percent of GDP in 2014 on the back of ambitious public
                  investment programs, large and often rising public sector wage bills, and higher spending on social
                  sectors. In some cases, costly and inefficient fuel subsidies fueled spending pressures.

                  At the same time, government revenue growth has been low, with the shares of revenue in GDP rising
                  only 2 percentage points to 22 percent over this period. The tax base remains low in many countries.
                                                                                      The expansionary fiscal stance has

revenue shortfalls from the extractive sector          Source: CPIA database.

in countries such as Burkina Faso (gold),
Cameroon (oil), Mali (gold), and Nigeria (oil);
in Nigeria, oil revenues fell short of what was programmed into budgets by 20 percent. In some countries,
political and social instability weighed down economic growth and revenue performance. Revenue
shocks prompted some countries, such as Cameroon, to lower fuel subsidies. In other countries, public
capital spending took a hit. Windfall gains from commodities have supported infrastructure spending
in energy, transportation, and irrigation systems. For example, capital spending increased by over 3
percentage points of GDP between 2009 and 2014 in the following resource-rich countries: Cameroon,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, and the Republic of Congo.

Large and, in some cases, rising wage bills added to budgetary woes in several countries. For example,
in Comoros, the higher wage bill stemming from the increase in teachers’ salaries in March 2014 and
previously unbudgeted expenditures, including those related to the administration of elections and the
electricity utility fuel purchase subsidy, added to budgetary difficulties. In the Central African Republic,
tax revenues were 4.4 percent of GDP in 2014, which was not enough to cover salaries for civil servants,
which are equivalent to 6.3 percent of GDP. In Kenya, fiscal pressure built up, emanating from the costs of
rollout of devolution, increased security spending, infrastructure spending, and the rising wage bill (the
wage bill rose from 6.5 percent in 2012/13 to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2013/14) at both levels of government.
The increase in government spending outpaced the growth in revenue, widening the fiscal deficit to 6.2
percent in 2013/14. In Lesotho, the deterioration in the fiscal balance largely reflects an increase in the
wage bill, which is one of the largest in the world, from 18.8 percent of GDP (in FY2012/13) to 20.7 percent
of GDP (in FY2013/14). Public expenditures stand at over 60 percent of GDP, with recurrent expenditures
representing almost three-quarters of the budget. The share of recurrent expenditures in GDP increased,
mainly reflecting an increase in the compensation of employees. In Ethiopia, investment activities of
public enterprises helped push the consolidated public sector primary deficit to 10 percent of GDP in
2013/14, compared with 4.6 percent of GDP in 2012/13. The government continued to finance part of the
deficit by issuing direct advances from the central bank.

A few countries, such as Mauritania, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe, registered improvements on the fiscal
policy front. In Rwanda, fiscal policy was back on track in FY2013/14 after the aid shortfall in the previous
year. The consolidated fiscal deficit narrowed in FY2013/14. Fiscal policy measures were aligned with the
medium-term fiscal policy framework, which is focused on fiscal consolidation through increased revenue

                   by ongoing revenue administration measures.

                   then. Disaggregating performance by country groups shows the largest gains for non-oil resource-rich
                   countries (figure 10). Again, oil exporters post lower scores than other groups.

                   In 2014, six countries observed gains in this component: Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of
                   Congo, Madagascar, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

                   u	 Côte d’Ivoire has implemented a debt management strategy that has helped to contain the buildup
                         of debt after the 2012 debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and the Multilateral
                         Debt Relief Initiatives. The medium-term debt strategy is implemented with a monitoring and
                         evaluation mechanism to ensure the country objectives are on track. The Treasury prepares a yearly
                         borrowing plan that is attached to the budget law and voted on by the National Assembly. The
                         Debt Directorate provides debt service forecasts for the yearly budget preparation, and ensures that
                         adequate debt recording systems are available to provide accurate and up-to-date data. Quarterly
                         data on domestic and external debt are published within 45 days after the end of each quarter.
                         In June 2014, the government adopted a new organic budget law, and an organic law adopting
                         a transparency code for public financial management, thereby transposing to the national legal
                         framework the West African Economic and Monetary Union directives on the new harmonized public
                         financial management framework.

                   u	 The improvement in Rwanda’s score was underpinned by a decline in the risk of debt distress to
                         “low” in 2013. In late 2013 and 2014, Rwanda made further progress on the legal and governance
                         structure of debt management. First, the legal framework was strengthened through the revision of
                         the Organic Law on State Finances and Property in 2013. Second, a dedicated Debt Management Unit
                         was created to coordinate the process of formulating and implementing a strategy aiming to raise the
                         appropriate and required amount of funding at the lowest possible cost and risk over the medium to
                         long run. The government started announcing the domestic borrowing plan for T-bonds, aiming at


                                                                                12
   reviving domestic bond issuances to facilitate the development of the capital market, as well as to fund
   infrastructure projects.

u	 In the Democratic Republic of Congo, debt management, including the management of arrears,
   has improved, resulting in a substantial upgrade in the 2012 Public Expenditure and Financial
   Accountability rating of the country. In Tanzania, the government published the third medium-term
   debt strategy in December 2013. The authorities conduct a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) every two
   years and the DSA guides new borrowing, as evidenced in the budget, and is used for policy analysis.

u	 In Zimbabwe, although the country has yet to resolve outstanding arears to external creditors, debt
   management was strengthened: the Back Office Procedure Manual and training of staff in the use of
   the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) was undertaken; domestic debt service
   recording and reporting commenced in DMFAS; a comprehensive debt bulletin with debt statistics
   was produced in 2014 and expected to be published in 2015; and in June 2014, the Cabinet approved
   the Public Debt Management Bill, which is expected to provide the Ministry of Finance with a stronger
   and more effective mandate to plan, negotiate, and monitor external borrowing operations and bolster
   the institutional role of the Debt Management Office, while strengthening the quality of public debt
   management in Zimbabwe.

In a few countries, debt burden indicators were sharply higher, indicating sustainability concerns. For
instance, in Ghana, the public debt reached an estimated 70 percent of GDP by end 2014. A major
feature of the public debt is its relatively short-term nature and high-interest cost to the government.
The most recent DSA of external public debt indicators for Ghana shows a high risk of public external
debt distress. In Gambia, public sector domestic debt has grown substantially in recent years, nearly
doubling to 97 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2014. This upward trend was more marked in 2014,
undermining macroeconomic stabilization. The government’s increased reliance on domestic borrowing
has contributed to the rise in interest rates over the past two years. And, with about 85 percent of public
domestic debt held in short-term maturities, rollover and interest rate risks are sharply elevated. Debt
servicing costs have risen, putting further pressure on fiscal coffers.

                   CLUSTER B: STRUCTURAL POLICIES
                   Cluster B covers policies affecting trade, the financial sector, and the business environment.

                   The regional average score for Cluster B was stable at 3.2.

                   Trade
                   The trade component assesses a country’s trade policy regime and trade facilitation. CPIA scores for trade
                   in Sub-Saharan Africa showed remarkably little change in 2014 compared with 2013, and remained at
                   a score of 3.7. This flat trend means that Africa has not closed the gap on trade policy scores with other
                   regions, such as East Asia. As a result of less restrictive trade policies and more effective trade facilitation,
                   countries in East Asia remain better positioned than those in Sub-Saharan Africa, on average, to leverage
                   trade to support growth and poverty reduction. Indeed, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest costs to
                   export and import of any developing region (figure 11).

                   The average CPIA score on trade for Africa reflects the large number of fragile states on the continent.
                   As was noted in last year’s report, excluding fragile countries moves the average regional score for
                   trade much closer to the average for other developing regions. The average score for fragile states is
                   substantially lower, 3.4 compared with 3.9 for the region’s non-fragile countries. An area of particular
                   weakness for fragile states in Africa is trade facilitation. Hence, the challenge on trade in Africa relates
                   primarily to the fragile states, which is of particular importance, since the majority of the extreme poor
                   (those living on less than $1.25 per day) in the world live in fragile states.

                   There is an opportunity for the fragile states in Africa to improve performance on trade, especially trade
                   facilitation, and catch up to other countries in Africa. There is scope for peer-to-peer learning on issues such
                   as improving performance standards in agencies at the border, reducing clearance times, increasing the
                   transparency of trade procedures, addressing corruption, applying risk management more widely to reduce
                   physical inspection rates, and allowing electronic submission of customs declarations and other documentary
                   requirements. Countries wishing to make progress on these issues can organize efforts in the context of the
                   World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement, which provides a coherent framework for identifying
                   trade facilitation improvements and leveraging Aid for Trade resources to support implementation.

Several countries in the region have made good progress on trade policy and trade facilitation over the
years.

u	 Democratic Republic of Congo (score 3.5) has simplified customs and other taxes, reduced non-tariff
   barriers at major land borders, and adhered to regional agreements, which are all good moves. In
   addition, the country has implemented several measures to facilitate trade, including the one-stop-
   shop, Sydonia Software (Automated SYstem for CUstoms DAta ASYCUDA ), and improvements at
   border crossings.
u	 Côte d’Ivoire (score 4.0) has implemented several improvements in customs administration procedures,
   which improved the country’s Trade Logistics Index ranking from 109th in 2010 to 79th in 2014. The
   government made efforts to harmonize and facilitate customs and trade procedures. The scanners at
   the port have helped to ensure smoothness in the customs administration procedures. In addition,
   the government introduced a simplified procedure for anticipated clearance, and a computer-based
   system to enable freight forwarders to process their clearance electronically.
u	 Rwanda (score 4.5) has made considerable progress in reducing trade restrictiveness by reducing
   non-tariff barriers, increasing the number of bilateral agreements signed, being active in regional and
   multilateral forums, and reforming the competition regulations in the logistics services sectors. In recent
   years, various trade facilitation efforts have been captured through a mix of good performance in trade
   facilitation indexes and indicators and progress on important short-, mid-, and long-term reforms. Time
   to import was reduced from 31 days (Doing Business 2014) to 27 days (Doing Business 2015). Time to
   export was reduced from 47 to 26 days in the same period. The launch of the trilateral initiative between
   Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda will facilitate the movement of goods from Mombasa Port. Major reforms
   were made in the simplification of procedures and processes; reduction of documents; implementation
   of risk management; automation, including the introduction of the ASYCUDA World Electronic Single
   Window (ESW); improvements in coordinated border management; and reduction in corruption. Rwanda
   is considered an example of regional best practice in the area of trade facilitation. Rwanda’s ranking in
   the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) improved from 139th in 2012 to 80th in 2014. In 2014, Rwanda also
   made trading across borders easier by introducing an electronic single-window system at the border.

Financial Sector
The financial sector component measures policies and regulations that affect financial stability, efficiency,
and access. The average score for the region remained stable, well below that of other regions. The score
for the financial sector remained at 2.9 in 2014 (same as in 2013). Country ratings were broadly stable,
with some positive exceptions related to improved access to finance; a couple of countries faced minor
pullback within categories, including on stability.

Financial markets in Sub-Saharan Africa’s IDA borrowers remained broadly stable. A couple of countries faced
increased risks caused by weaknesses in international markets, but most countries remained fairly isolated
from global trends, as the countries are not fully interconnected. Some exceptions included countries that
have issued sovereign bonds in international markets in recent years while facing internal macro pressures.

Overall, the region’s financial systems have high headline capital adequacy ratios and liquidity buffers;
nonperforming loan ratios remain high in many countries. Efforts to improve financial regulatory and
supervisory regimes continue, particularly through improved compliance with international standards.
Further efforts are needed to ensure increased resilience as risks evolve, including an increased presence

                   of cross-border institutions within Africa. Incipient efforts in a few countries to strengthen bank resolution
                   and crisis management frameworks should be accelerated to ensure readiness to handle weaknesses that
                   may emerge in financial systems.

                   at a financial institution in 2014 compared with 24 percent in 2011 (figure 12); 12 percent of adults had a
                   mobile money account in 2014)2. There are also enormous disparities among developing regions, where
                   account penetration ranges from 14 percent in the Middle East to 69 percent in East Asia and the Pacific.

                   Sub-Saharan Africa is an exception in the global picture for mobile banking. Almost a third of account
                   holders in the region—or 12 percent of all adults—reported having a mobile money account (figure 13).
                   Within this group, about half reported having a mobile money account and an account at a financial
                   institution, and half reported having a mobile money account only. Mobile money accounts are especially
                   widespread in East Africa, where 20 percent of adults reported having a mobile money account and 10
                   percent a mobile money account only. But these figures mask wide variation within the subregion. Kenya
                   has the highest share of adults with a mobile money account, at 58 percent, followed by Somalia, Tanzania,
                   and Uganda, with about 35 percent. In southern Africa, penetration of mobile money accounts is also
                   relatively high, at 14 percent, but just 2 percent of adults reported having a mobile money account only.

                   Notwithstanding these improvements, eight countries account for about 85 percent of total loans in
                   Sub-Saharan Africa, while only a handful of countries have noticeable financial markets beyond lending
                   (insurance, pensions, and capital markets), following the bank-centric model prevailing in the region.
                   However, several reforms are in progress or getting started that are expected to deepen markets in Africa,
                   including beyond lending. Importantly, efforts are increasing across countries to improve financial literacy
                   and consumer protection, which are also expected to improve the functioning of financial markets.

partly as a result of competitive power, but
largely driven by the need to compensate for huge operating costs. Spreads remain the focus of attention
for several governments that want to ensure broader access at more affordable rates. Some governments
have introduced interest rate ceilings to this end in recent years, while others have managed to avoid
pressures from various segments of the population to set these ceilings by putting in place reform
packages to address the root cause of high rates, namely, operating costs, high information costs,
nonperforming loans, and competition issues.

Overall, financial systems in Africa need to continue to reform and improve going forward. Strong
attention is needed to ensure that fiscal distortions do not delay these efforts, on stability and access
grounds, and that emerging risks are effectively identified and managed.

Business Regulatory Environment
The business regulatory environment component of the CPIA assesses the extent to which the legal,
regulatory, and policy environment helps or hinders private business in investing, creating jobs, and
becoming more productive. The three subcomponents measured are (a) regulations affecting entry, exit,
and competition; (b) regulations of ongoing business operations; and (c) regulations of factor markets
(labor and land).

The regional average score for the business regulatory environment in 2014 was unchanged at 3.1,
reflecting little movement in the rating for most countries in Sub-Saharan African. Three countries
recorded a decrease in score for business regulatory environment: Ghana (4.5 to 4.0), Lesotho (3.5 to
3.0), and South Sudan (2.5 to 2.0), and two countries registered an improvement: Guinea (2.5 to 3.0),
and Malawi (2.5 to 3.0). The scores for the business regulatory environment for Central African Republic,
Eritrea, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe remained low at 2.0 and below. Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal, and
Uganda were at the top of the region’s score range, with scores at or above 4.0.

In 2014, several countries in the region again made strides in reforming regulations. In overall doing
business reforms, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounted for the largest number of regulatory reforms
in 2013/14, with 39 countries reducing the complexity and cost of regulatory processes and 36


                                                                 17
strengthening legal institutions. Six countries in SSA were among the 21 economies with at least three
reforms making it easier to do business in 2013/14. Among those 21 economies, five countries in SSA
stand out as having improved the most in performance on the Doing Business indicators: Benin, Côte
d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, and Togo.

For the vast majority of countries in SSA, the stagnant scores in 2014 reflect that (a) many top 2014
Doing Business reformers started from a very low base; (b) the lack of reforms on companies’ exit
(insolvency) as well as lack of land reforms resulted in low rankings in these indicators; (c) the distance to
the frontier in many Doing Business indicators is still high; and (d) in some cases, the reforms were not
implemented yet, as in Malawi and Mozambique. Many impactful Doing Business reforms were achieved
in trade facilitation reforms, which are measured in the average CPIA trade score.

All five Sub-Saharan African countries within the 10 top Doing Business improvers (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, and Togo) carried out reforms making it easier to start a
business, while three countries implemented reforms making it easier to obtain credit. Some of these
changes were inspired by transnational initiatives. Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, and Togo, as OHADA
(Organisation pour l’Harmonisation en Afrique du Droit des Affaires) member economies, reduced the
paid-in minimal capital requirement, which is the amount of capital an entrepreneur needs to deposit in
a bank account or with a notary before or within 3 months of incorporation. Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal
also took measures within the framework of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. Both
adopted the Uniform Law on the Regulation of Credit Information Bureaus ahead of other member
states, providing a legal framework to establish credit information bureaus. Furthermore, Côte d’Ivoire,
Senegal, and Togo reformed property registration.

For the fragile countries, the average business regulatory environment score is 2.7. As noted above,
Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Togo undertook at least four Doing Business
reforms. Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone score above 3.3, reflecting reforms in
recent and previous Doing Business cycles. As an example, in 2014 Mali undertook reforms in dealing
with construction permits and protecting minority shareholders by introducing greater requirements
for disclosure of related-party transactions to the board of directors. Shareholders can now inspect
the documents pertaining to related-partly transactions and appoint auditors to conduct an
inspection of such transactions. Mali moved up seven places in rank for the latter indicator. However,
countries such as the Central African Republic and Chad have not reformed well and still occupy the
last places in the global Doing Business rankings. The Central African Republic just reemerged from
a civil conflict and needs to tackle many reforms to empower its enterprises to take on the risks of
investment and employment.

As reforms are often cross-cutting, they require the involvement of several ministries, parliament, and
representatives from the private sector and, often, professional associations, academia, and civil society.
Undertaking successful business regulatory environment reforms therefore requires not only strong
champions, but also focused coordination, sequencing, and selectivity. Navigating reforms through
interactive processes, engaging with stakeholders, building consensus, and maintaining the reform
momentum are the key factors. As an example, Mozambique is engaged in a fruitful dialogue with the
private sector; in 2014, the country completed several important reforms.

CLUSTER C: SOCIAL INCLUSION AND EQUITY
This cluster covers policy areas such as gender equality, equity of public resource use,
human development, social protection, and environmental sustainability. The regional
score for Cluster C held steady at 3.2 in 2014.

Gender Equality
The gender equality component assesses the extent to which a country has enacted and put in place
institutions and programs to enforce laws and policies that promote equal access for men and women to
human capital development and productive and economic resources, and which give men and women
equal status and protection under the law. The average score for this category has remained at 3.2 since
2005, reflecting not only the large gender inequalities in Sub-Saharan Africa, but also the “sticky” nature
of many gender issues. Most countries lag in the area of gender equality in human capital development.
National indicators suggest that there are also significant geographical differences in the magnitude of
gender inequalities in urban and rural areas.

Cabo Verde has consistently held the highest score (4.5) in Africa for some time. This high score reflects
the country’s relatively low gender disparities, especially among human capital indicators, the gender
equality promoted by its laws and policies, and the mechanisms to enforce these laws. There are six
countries with an average score of 4.0: Burundi, Ghana, Lesotho, Mauritania, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe,
which increased its score from 3.0 last year. One of the main factors behind Zimbabwe’s improved score
is the adoption of the new Constitution, which provides for the overall equality of men and women
and gender balance at all levels of government, and states that “all laws, customs, traditions and cultural
practices” must comply with the rights that the Constitution provides for women.

Several countries—Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea-
Bissau, Niger, South Sudan, and Sudan—continue to show poor performance in extremely high rates
of maternal mortality, a low percentage of births attended by skilled health staff, low contraceptive
prevalence, high adolescent fertility, and large gender disparities in secondary school enrollment. These
factors have kept these countries’ CPIA scores on gender equality low.

Overall, resource-rich countries appear to lag behind non-resource-rich countries in their performance,
with an average score of 3.1 for the former compared with 3.4 for the latter. This relatively poor
performance appears to be largely driven by greater gender inequalities in human capital development.
This situation persists despite the fact that the median per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of the
resource-rich countries is noticeably larger than that of the non-resource-rich countries.

Human capital development
The region is lagging on targets to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for maternal mortality.
Modeled data for 2013 suggest that developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have an average maternal
mortality ratio of 510 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is much higher than the average for developing
countries in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) (75), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) (87), and the Middle
East and North Africa (MNA) (78). The attendance of a skilled health professional at birth is thought to be one
of the most important interventions for reducing maternal mortality. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the link between
income and attendance by a skilled health professional is weak (figure 14), underscoring the importance
of public policy in this area. Between 2000 and 2010, Rwanda was able to increase the percentage of births
attended by a skilled health professional from 31 to 69 percent. Over the same period, its maternal mortality

                   farmers is hampered by their lower access to productive inputs. A recent study by the World Bank and
                   the ONE Foundation3 found that this situation has led to large gender productivity gaps, ranging from 24
                   percent in Ethiopia to a staggering 66 percent in Niger. However, there is evidence on interventions that
                   have helped. For example, in Rwanda a pilot land tenure regularization program improved secure access
                   to land for married women, thus improving women farmers’ incentives to invest in their land. An impact
                   evaluation of the program4 found that its impact on investments in soil conservation were twice as large
                   for female- compared with male-headed households.

                   Women tend to be concentrated in the informal sector, are more likely to work as unpaid family workers,
                   and are less likely to work in technical and senior management positions. For example, in Tanzania,
                   while the ratio of female to male labor force participation is close to parity, only 6 percent of women are
                   engaged in formal employment, versus 15 percent of men. The contributing issues include women’s lower
                   skills and education and restrictive social attitudes regarding women’s economic roles. Time poverty is
                   also a factor: women tend to bear a disproportionate burden of household chores, which significantly
                   reduces their ability to engage in income-generating activities, especially those outside the family
                   home. Nonetheless, some countries have made significant progress: between 2000 and 2011, Mauritania
                   increased the ratio of female to male labor force participation from 29.6 to 36.2 percent.

                   Equality of status and protection under the law
                   Agency is important because it is the process through which women and men can convert their
                   endowments into economic and other opportunities and, ultimately, the outcomes that they desire.
                   Critically, there does not appear to be a strong association between women’s agency and a country’s
                   income level, suggesting that economic development alone will not be enough to bring progress.

Over recent years, Sub-Saharan Africa has improved its performance with regard to the proportion of
parliamentary seats that are held by women, with the average across the region increasing from 11.6
percent in 2000 to 22.1 percent in 2014. This proportion is largely in line with the world average and is
significantly higher than developing countries in MNA (16.8 percent) and ECA (18.1 percent). Rwanda has
the highest proportion of seats held by women of any country in the world—almost 64 percent in 2014.
This has partly been achieved with the inclusion of a 30 percent female Member of Parliament quota in
the national Constitution. Some statutory legal discrimination, especially against women as wives, still
exists in constitutions in some countries and in statutes governing marital property, inheritance, land, and
labor. However, over recent years, many countries in the region have made notable progress.5 Despite
progress, women’s ability to take advantage of their statutory legal rights is often complicated by several
factors, including: (a) the influence of customary law, which is often discriminatory against women; (b) a
lack of capacity or willingness of implementing agencies to enforce certain gender equality provisions,
especially in the areas of gender-based violence; and (c) women’s relative lack of human and financial
capital, which prevents them from knowing their rights and effectively defending them.

Legal protection for women tends to be insufficient in the area of gender-based violence (GBV). This issue
is especially serious in conflict and post-conflict areas, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where
violators are often able to act with relative impunity. Despite some progress in addressing this issue,
high rates of GBV continue to persist across many countries in the region. Various GBV acts are often not
covered by specific laws and, where laws do exist, these are often not effectively enforced. In Sierra Leone,
for example, data suggest that despite recent legislative efforts, only 20 of every 1,000 cases of GBV result
in prosecution.

Equity in the Use of Public Resources
The equity in the use of public resources component of the CPIA assesses the extent to which the pattern
of public expenditures and revenue collection affects the poor and is consistent with national poverty
reduction priorities. Organized into three dimensions, the component provides snapshots of available
poverty measurement tools and monitoring systems, government priorities and strategies, and revenue
collection. The average score for the overall category was unchanged at 3.3 in 2014, with few countries
recording changes.

For the overall score, four countries—Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and South Sudan—
recorded negative changes by half a point, while the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe
recorded positive changes. The continued slippage in the score for the Central African Republic reflects
the findings of a recent public expenditure review, which showed that priority sector spending receives
a disproportionately small share of the budget. In addition, a lack of resources adversely impacted the
country’s budget implementation in 2014. The Central African Republic and South Sudan experienced
conflict that might have contributed to the reduction in the 2014 scores, similar to Liberia, which
experienced the Ebola outbreak in 2014. The positive change in the Democratic Republic of Congo
reflects continuous improvements in measurement, data availability, and informed actions aligned with
poverty reduction objectives, while the gain in Zimbabwe reflects the increase in progressive personal
and corporate tax revenues and the decline in absolute amounts and as a share of GDP of value-added tax
(VAT) revenues, which tend to be regressive.

5	    The 2014 International Finance Corporation, “Women, Business and the Law,” found that over the past two years, two of the countries that have made the most reforms
     related to women’s economic inclusion were from Sub-Saharan Africa: Côte d’Ivoire and Mali.

poverty reduction priorities. In Burkina Faso, the share of the budget devoted to poverty-reducing social
expenditures increased between 2012 and 2014. In Ethiopia, government spending is guided by the
Growth and Transformation Plan: In 2014, 68 percent of government spending was on pro-poor sectors,
which is among the highest in Africa. In Kenya, there is an increasing policy emphasis on social protection
programs. Sub-Saharan Africa’s energy exporters have a low average score of 2.8 for this category of the
CPIA, which is well below the regional average and the scores of other country groups (table 3).


Building Human Resources
The human development component assesses the quality of national policies and public and private
sector delivery in health and education. The human development CPIA score for Sub-Saharan Africa
remained unchanged in 2014 at 3.5. The gap between resource-rich countries (score 3.3) and non-
resource-rich (score 3.7) countries remained substantial, as did that between fragile countries (score 3.2)
and non-fragile countries (score 3.5).

Overall, there was little improvement in the health component of the CPIA. Several countries (Comoros,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sudan, and
Zimbabwe) saw strengthening in health areas. But the Ebola-affected countries, such as Liberia and
Sierra Leone, saw an erosion of recent efforts (box 1). Understandably, many fragile and conflict-affected
countries (for example, Central African Republic, Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and South Sudan) have low
performance in the health component mainly because of limited coverage of essential services, weak
governance, inadequate health financing, and limited quality data to track progress. However, those
countries that have embarked on health sector reforms focusing on accountability and results are seeing a
strengthening of scores (for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe).

The status of health in Sub-Saharan Africa has significantly improved over the past two decades, but the
region is still short of reaching the health-related MDGs. The under-five morality rate dropped 48 percent,
from 179 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 92 in 20136 and the maternal mortality ratio also halved
from 990 deaths per 100,000 live births to 510 during the same period (World Health Organization, World
Health Statistics, 2014)7. However, SSA still accounts for about 50 percent of under-five deaths and 62
percent of maternal deaths globally. According to a recent report,8 Sub-Saharan Africa houses “13 of the
20 countries with the highest prevalence of stunted children, 17 of the 20 countries with the highest

   of EVD, have magnified the impact of the epidemic and eroded earlier gains. After years of conflicts in Sierra     already weak
   Leone and Liberia, the health sector lacked critical structures and resources for health systems development:      health systems
   these countries had insufficient qualified health workers, most prominently in rural areas. Many facilities,
   including referral hospitals, were inadequately equipped and had no electricity or running water, and there
   were few laboratories, mainly concentrated in cities. Health information, disease surveillance, logistics, and
   supply systems were also weak. In addition, they relied heavily on external sources of funding and out-of-
   pocket payments were high and regressive.
   As a result, health care personnel paid a heavy toll: a total of 822 confirmed health worker infections and
   488 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, caused by weak infection prevention and
   control systems and emergency preparedness capacity (WHO, February 2015). In addition, resources from
   other programs and routine care were redeployed to the Ebola response, contributing to the decline in the
   provision of essential services at the height of the outbreak. For example, health facility data in Sierra Leone
   demonstrated a reduction in the number of people accessing services in the second half of 2014. In response,
   the Government of Sierra Leone initiated a consultative process to plan for the recovery and resilience of the
   health system to be better prepared to respond to future outbreaks and other emergencies.

fertility rates, and 19 of the 20 countries with the lowest life expectancy at birth,” (figures 15 and 16),
although the economies in Sub-Saharan Africa have grown faster than those in other regions, largely
thanks to extractive industries and beneficial commodity prices. Health outcomes are especially poor in
fragile and conflict-affected countries.

There is a huge variation in health outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa and within countries in the region.
More than one in ten children born in Angola (167/1,000 live births), Sierra Leone (161), Chad (148),
Somalia (146), Central African Republic (139), Guinea-Bissau (124), Mali (123), the Democratic Republic of
Congo (119), Nigeria (117), Niger (104), and Guinea (101) would die before their fifth birthday. Children
born in Seychelles (14), Mauritius (14), and Cabo Verde (26), by contrast, have a much higher chance of
survival, comparable to developed regions. Maternal mortality also varies considerably, from less than
100 deaths per 100,000 live births (Cabo Verde [5], Seychelles [57], and Mauritius [73]), to more than 800
deaths per 100,000 live births in Sierra Leone (1,100), Chad (980), Central African Republic (880), and
Somalia (850). Within countries, the poor fare worse on health outcomes compared with the wealthy: a
child born to a family in the poorest quintile in Sub-Saharan Africa is almost twice more likely to die before
age one and three times more likely to suffer from severe stunting than a child born in a wealthy family.

The challenges in HNP outcomes are partly caused by limited coverage of evidence-based, high-
impact health, nutrition, and population services. On average, the contraceptive prevalence rate is only
24 percent, with high unmet need of contraception in many countries (for example, Benin, Burundi,
Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, São Tomé and Príncipe, Togo, and Uganda). And
only about half of deliveries are attended by skilled health care providers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although
immunization programs made marked progress, one-quarter of children are still not benefiting from
immunization against, for example, measles and DPT. The immunization coverage is particularly low

                   matched with an adequate level of resources and action. Thus, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are
                   short of the necessary inputs to deliver quality service. The majority of IDA borrowers in the region have
                   less than 1.0 skilled provider per 1,000 population. Evidence shows that the absenteeism rate is also high,
                   and when providing services, many health care providers do not follow clinical guidelines or manage
                   maternal and neonatal complications correctly (table 4). In addition, the availability of other inputs, such
                   as infrastructure, equipment, and medicines and supplies, is grossly inadequate, further limiting the
                   delivery of essential services.

The inefficient health financing system is of particular concern. Limited public sector commitment
has been replaced by large out-of-pocket (OOP) spending, low efficiency in resource utilization, and
mismatch of resources with population needs. The shares of public expenditure and OOP spending in
total expenditure on health are 44 percent and 35 percent, respectively, with large variation by country,
Almost half of IDA-eligible countries rely heavily on external resources (for more than 30 percent of total
health expenditure), which can lead to fragmentation, despite considerable efforts toward harmonization.
In addition, a review of public expenditure reviews (and some country status reports) found substitution
of public resources from health to other priorities as a response to external donor assistance, resulting in
increased vulnerability of the budget to reductions in external assistance.

The education sub-component focuses on development of a sector strategy, education management and
information systems, learning assessments, teachers, education finance, and school based management.
While these are not directly outcome indicators, they are inputs/policies to generate good performance
on outcome indicators. Countries have made efforts to improve their outcomes and policies in terms of
their learning outcomes, teacher trainings, collecting data and improving assessments. Although Sub-
Saharan African countries have been making progress in primary education, large gaps are observed
in primary completion rates between fragile and non-fragile countries: 65 percent and 74 percent,
respectively, in 2013. On the other, hand, primary completion rates are very similar for resource-rich (70
percent) and non-resource-rich (71 percent) countries. The Ebola crisis disrupted schooling systems in the
three most severely affected countries, jeopardizing progress (box 2).

Leone              income. Children who may be affected by these factors may not return to school and learning without
                   targeted support. In a context of 25 percent of school-age children being out of school prior to Ebola, the risk
                   of children not returning to school could significantly reverse the efforts to achieve universal education in
                   Sierra Leone. In addition, the disruption of the school calendar could also worsen the situation of over-aged
                   children in schools, which is already a huge challenge. In addition, children with disabilities, who were in a
                   vulnerable situation before Ebola, would be even more disadvantaged.

                   Furthermore, learning outcomes, which have been poor, could be further jeopardized. At the end of grade
                   3, many children lack the most basic reading, writing, and comprehension skills. Assessments conducted in
                   2014 showed that less than 1 percent of children in grade 4 could read with sufficient fluency; 27 percent
                   achieved level 2 addition for understanding and application of numeracy. The loss of learning time because
                   of Ebola would make the situation more challenging.

                   School closures not only impacted the learning rights of children, but have significantly disrupted the
                   implementation of the Education Sector Plan, as well as the Global Partnership for Education–supported
                   project, Revitalising Education Development in Sierra Leone, which seeks to reform and revitalize education,
                   a project that was already in difficulties prior to the crisis.

                   education of their children. In Sub-Saharan Africa, given the low level of formal employment, the coverage
                   of formal pension systems and labor market insurance tend to be fairly modest, with relatively low CPIA
                   scores in these areas.

                   There were no notable changes in country performance between 2013 and 2014. Conflict-ridden
                   countries, as could be expected, report lower scores, while countries with stronger institutional
                   capacity continue to achieve stronger ratings, including Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania. Overall
                   scores improved in Madagascar, Mauritania, and Zimbabwe, reflecting efforts to improve social
                   protection and safety net programs in these countries. For example, in Mauritania, as part of their
                   National Social Protection Strategy, the Government implemented emergency response with a long-
                   term safety net focused on the chronically poor. The national social transfer program will support a
                   first wave of 15,000 beneficiaries during 2015 in the Poverty Triangle (southern region with the highest
                   number of extreme poor), with a final objective of reaching 100,000 households nationwide (all
                   extreme-poor households in the country). The social transfer program will use the Social Registry to
                   identify its beneficiaries.

Policies and Institutions for Environmental Sustainability
The environment component of the CPIA measures (a) the appropriateness and implementation of
policies across a range of environmental topics, including air pollution, water pollution, solid and
hazardous waste, freshwater resources, marine and coastal resources, biodiversity, commercial renewable
resources (mainly forests and fish), commercial nonrenewable resources (mainly minerals), and
climate change; and (b) the strength of cross-cutting institutional systems, including the quality of the
environmental impact assessment system, and a range of environmental governance factors, including
access to information, participation, coordination, and accountability.

implementation evident in almost
every country in Africa.

Five countries saw an increase in their Environment score in 2014, and no countries experienced a
decrease:

u	 Guinea, Mali, and Sierra Leone all introduced a range of improvements in institutional measures,
   such as participation and access to information systems, and all made improvements in solid waste
   management.

u	 Rwanda has made steady improvements in environmental performance in recent years. In 2014,
   improvements in licensing water users pushed the overall score over the threshold to 4.0.

u	 Togo has taken a number of steps to improve monitoring and enforcement of pollution standards, and
   has conducted planning studies for coastal resources.

Access to information showed the strongest improvement (with six countries making progress and only
two countries seeing a decline). Public participation, environmental assessment, air pollution, and water
pollution showed no net change. No metrics declined overall.

A comparison of results for the 14 performance metrics in 2014 shows that:

u	 All the institutional measures but one (public access to information, participation, environmental
   assessment, and coordination) were within the top six performers by average score.


                                                                                     27
                u	 The exception was accountability, which ranked 13 of 14 (same as in 2013). The assessment for this
                                        metric relies more heavily on actual implementation, compared with the other institutional metrics.

                u	 Ecosystem and biodiversity management ranked highest among the theme-specific metrics (same as
                                        in 2013). Climate change and most natural resources management metrics occupy the middle order.

                u	 As in previous years, however, pollution-related measures (especially water pollution and air pollution)
                                        performed poorly.

                Despite some variation in spatial patterns for the individual performance measures, the countries that
                perform well in some measures tend to perform well in others. Although there are a couple of lower
                performing countries in West Africa, the central African countries are performing noticeably worse than
                the rest of the region.

                The performance gap on Environment between Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world is narrow.

                u	 The average overall CPIA score for Environment in the region is only 0.1 points lower than the score
                                        for all IDA countries.

                u	 The relative performance between the 14 metrics in the Africa region appears to follow a similar
                                        pattern as for the rest of the world.

                u	 The largest differences are in Climate Change, Freshwater Resources, and pollution-related metrics,
                                        which all score significantly higher in the rest of the world.

                u	 There is very little difference in institutional metric scores between Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of
                                        the world. The much poorer performance on Accountability than other institutional metrics also occurs
                                        in other regions.

                u	 Sub-Saharan Africa is also close to the rest of the world in its performance on a range of natural
                                        resource management measures, such as biodiversity, renewable, marine, and mineral resources.

CLUSTER D: PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONS
Cluster D covers governance and public sector capacity issues: property rights and rule-based
governance; quality of budgetary and financial management; efficiency of revenue mobilization; quality of
public administration; and transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector.

Governance quality and performance in developing countries has received increased attention since
the global financial and economic crisis of 2008–09 (which increased public resource pressures and put
poverty alleviation efforts at risk) and, more recently, during consultations for the review of progress
made under the MDGs and the setting of the post-2015 agenda toward the Sustainable Development
Goals, which aim to speed up development. Governance quality and performance is viewed as a
transformational element for future social and economic development and resource mobilization because
of its potential to shape the relationship between the state and society, and encourage more foreign and
local investments in Sub-Saharan Africa by reducing risks and enhancing security. The institutional failures
that hindered progress in the achievement of the MDG service delivery standards and in the promotion of
peace and reduction of conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa11 also serve as a key lesson.

Calls for good governance are coming from multiple stakeholders in Sub-Saharan Africa. Citizens and
businesses now expect increased information and transparency in the public use of resources, and
frequently voice concerns over the accountability of public services. They demand better security, rights
protection, and justice. Tax payers, media, development practitioners, and opinion leaders are demanding
higher predictability in public investments and their outcomes, simplified revenue collection, and pro-
poor budgetary and financial management policies. State institutions are exercising their constitutional
functions, developing improvement plans, and demanding increased resources from the treasury to
fulfil their obligations. Civil society organizations, community leaders, and others are fighting against
corruption by demanding accountability and the disclosure of the assets of political leaders and those
in government, for strengthened democratic legitimacy. Regional entities such as the African Union
are facilitating collective action to deal with poverty alleviation and state failure, which fuels conflict,
extremism, unhealthy migration, and fragility within the continent.

In the CPIA 2014 cycle, despite policy and institutional efforts (such as the development of master plans,
promulgation of new laws and regulations, engagement of civil society, and development of websites
with procurement information), the governance ranking of Sub-Saharan Africa still remains low, generally
lagging other developing regions (figure 19). For example, with a score of 2.7, Property rights and rule-
based governance (which includes the performance of rule of law and justice entities as a subset) ranks
the lowest (compared with 3.2 in Latin America and Caribbean [LAC], 3.1 in East Asia and Pacific [EAP],
2.9 in Europe and Central Asia [ECA], and 2.8 in South Asia [SAR]). The Quality of budget and financial
management systems has a score of 3.1, which compares unfavorably with ECA (3.8), SAR (3.4), LAC (3.2),
and EAP (3.2). The Quality of public administration has a score of 2.9, which is less than that of ECA, SAR,
and LAC, all with a score of 3.1. The public sector performance in Sub-Saharan Africa in the dimension of
Transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector (score 2.7), is better than Middle East and
North Africa (MNA) (2.3), equal to ECA, and much lower than that in LAC (3.5) and EAP (3.1). The Quality of
efficiency in revenue mobilization, which is the strongest governance category in Sub-Saharan Africa, is
comparable to that of SAR and EAP, but below that of ECA and LAC.

11	 The significance of governance and public sector capacity as the basis for sustainable growth and effective service delivery is amply clear: low levels of security, justice,
    and normative structures weaken protection of property and contract rights in fragile and conflict-affected areas such as the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Weak public
    administration at the central, regional, and local levels affects policy development, implementation, and service provision in parts of the Great Lakes region, the northern
    states of Nigeria, and elsewhere. Deficiencies in revenue collection and budgetary and financial management reduce the predictability of public investments and their
    expected outcomes. Lack of transparency and corruption reduce the integrity of public resource use and its effectiveness, affecting citizens’ trust in their public institutions.

                    The effort to improve the efficiency of revenue mobilization in Sub-Saharan Africa has yielded some
                    positive results. With a score of 3.4, Sub-Saharan Africa now compares equally with EAC and SAR, ranks
                    higher than MNA (3.3), and has reduced the gap with LAC (which has the highest score in this category).
                    In recent years, these efforts have included tax policy changes and establishment of revenue authorities,
                    coupled with non-tax reforms aimed at removing economic, demographic, and institutional constraints
                    that hinder revenue performance. As a result, and also aided by higher growth rates, “tax revenue
                    collections has been increasing almost continuously, faster than the predicted values, and the tax effort
                    index has improved significantly”—that is, Sub-Saharan Africa recorded about 15 percent higher actual
                    tax revenues relative to predicted values.12

                    In addition, good performers in tax administration and policy reform are focusing on the redistribution
                    of income; reduction of inequalities through progressive taxes; introduction of new taxes, such as the
                    VAT, to promote the business environment; and adoption of re-pricing by using taxes and subsidies to
                    ensure market prices that better reflect social costs and benefits. Good performers are also undertaking
                    measures that enhance citizen participation and representation, as well as technological initiatives that
                    help improve compliance and the ease of fulfilling obligations, while reducing the cost of operations for
                    tax administration entities.

                    Disaggregating performance by country groups shows similar patterns across the various governance
                    dimensions, but substantial gaps by country type (figure 20). For example, non-resource-rich and non-
                    oil-endowed countries consistently outperform others, as their treasuries are under constant pressure
                    to improve the efficiency of their resource use in delivering public services to citizens, especially the
                    poor and vulnerable. For example, the public administrations of non-resource-rich countries perform
                    better compared with oil-rich countries (a score of 2.9 versus 2.4). Governments are more effective
                    in pursuing transparency and accountability in non-resource-rich countries compared with oil-rich
                    countries; the former have better incentives to show results to the electorate and gain popular support by

controlling the leakage of scarce resources and taking tough administrative measures against corruption.
Governments of non-resource-rich countries also have to rely on popular support for their actions and
engage civil society and other constituencies (a score of 2.8 versus 2.3 for oil-rich countries).

Moreover, property rights, regulations, and judicial contract enforcement appear to be more effective
in non-resource-rich countries compared with oil-rich and other natural resource–rich countries, and
more reliant on improvements in the enabling environment for local and international investment
for the growth of SMEs, including agribusiness in urban and rural areas (a score of 2.9 versus 2.3 and
2.8, respectively). The quality of budget management tends to be better in non-oil resource-rich
countries, followed by non-resource-rich and oil-rich countries (a score of 3.3 compared with 3.1 and 2.7,
respectively), mainly because of tighter fiscal controls, transparency, accountability, and anti-corruption
measures. In the case of oil-rich countries, governance indicators are suboptimal on average because of
weaknesses in transparency, higher instances of corruption, and weaknesses in the checks and balances
of public administration and rule of law enforcement. Overall, performance across the various groups is
negatively affected by the weaknesses in property rights and judicial contract enforcement, as well as the
corruption and transparency deficiencies of public institutions.

In the 2014 CPIA cycle, strengthening occurred within the governance cluster, with nine countries
showing improvements in scores—more than twice the number of countries with declines. The area
with the largest progress was the quality of public financial management (six countries), followed by
transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector (four countries). Zimbabwe experienced
an increase of 0.5 point in its overall average score; Chad experienced an increase of 0.2; and Burundi,
Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia Madagascar, Mauritania, and Uganda saw an
improvement of 0.1 (figure 21).

Gains in the quality of public financial management have led the improvement in the governance cluster

                   Chad, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have all improved their public financial
                   management scores, which is attributed to multiple efforts related to planning, reporting, audit
                   compliance, and budgetary practices. These improvements result from reforms and institutional
                   efforts initiated based on public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessments, which
                   periodically assess capacity, and offer reform guidance. In 2014, for example, follow-up on budget
                   reports and audits showed improvement in Chad, thanks to a modern information technology
                   center that went into operation during 2014 and permitted the interconnection between the IFMIS
                   and SIGASPE (payroll management software). This information system is very useful for tracking and
                   monitoring budget execution and can now regularly produce budget execution reports (tableau
                   des quatre phases), including staff salary information, which is uploaded to the Ministry’s website
                   (http://www.finances.gouv.td).

                   13	 PEFA assessments review these and many other financial management aspects to determine progress and help outline the agenda for reform. “Accountability in Public
                       Expenditures in Latin America” Report 2012 provides lessons from experience and shared reform implementation experiences.




                                                                                             32
Ethiopia enhanced its audit reporting. Presently, at the federal level, audit coverage is 100 percent and
reports are submitted within six months after the end of the fiscal year. According to the PEFA assessment
indicator, Ethiopia also recorded a reduction in the deviation of actuals from its budget: from 9.6 percent
in 2010/11 to 7.0 percent in 2012/13. Mauritania started publishing its fiscal data using BOOST14 and
making information available online. Malawi upgraded its internal controls and reporting to manage risks
better. Zimbabwe has witnessed improved efficiency in tax administration, as reflected by the declining
cost of collection ratios. The costs of collection were about 3.7 percent of revenue in 2011, but have
decreased to 3 percent recently.

Moreover, the budget link to policy priorities has been improved in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, this
was possible through the aggressive implementation of the new public financial management (PFM)
strategy, among other measures, to operationalize the contingency fund to address the problem of
supplementaries; strengthen the monitoring and evaluation functions across MDAs; operationalize
the Treasury Single Account system; strengthen the controls within IFMIS (Integrated Financial
Management Information System) by penalizing the violation of controls; and pass the PFM Bill into
an Act of Parliament. In Chad, policy links were improved through the introduction of budget circulars,
compliance with the calendars for the preparation and approval of the budget, efforts to limit the use
of emergency spending procedures (extra budgetary expenditures, Dépenses Avant Ordonnancement),
gradual implementation of medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) in key sectors, and
conformity of budget classification with international standards. In Côte d’Ivoire, the public investment
execution rate for the first six months of 2014 stood at 92.2 percent, compared with 86.9 percent a year
earlier. There was a large increase in spending to improve access to electricity, housing, water, rural
feeder roads, and health, which are priority areas. Pro-poor spending had an execution rate of 104.5
percent by end of June 2014.

Among the governance indicators, an increase in the score for accountability has been significant in
Sub-Saharan Africa (table 5), mainly because of the availability of information for nongovernmental
organizations and their involvement in government initiatives such as the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI), Open Budget, Open Data, and the budget adoption process. Civil society’s
access to timely and reliable information on public affairs and public policies, including fiscal information
on public expenditures, revenues, and large contract awards, is helping improve outcomes. In Mauritania,
for example, the Ministry of Finance enhanced public access to information on its new webpage and
involved civil society in the EITI process, which enhanced the participation of civil society in the National
Development Plan. In Madagascar, citizens are aware that budget execution reports are available on
the Ministry of Finance website. The government legislation portal has been upgraded, allowing better
accessibility for users. The National Institute of Statistics has increased the sets of data and analysis
available to the public, to comply with open data principles.

In spite of recurring issues on corruption, Madagascar has taken steps to improve transparency and
integrity in the management of public resources, including the establishment of major accountability
institutions, such as the Conseil de Discipline Budgétaire et Financiaire and Integrity Institution. Efforts have
also been strengthened at the local level through the continuation of participatory budgeting and other
social accountability mechanisms. The government has opted-in to the Global Partnership for Social

14	 The BOOST program seeks to enhance accessibility and use of fiscal data for enhanced expenditure analysis as an input to improved budget processes and outcomes.
    A critical component of the initiative is a meticulous process of collecting, cleaning and vetting expenditure data to ensure that data is timely, comprehensive and
    reliable.




                                                                                             33
Accountability, allowing Malagasy civil society to participate in the process. The political crisis has seen the
revival of civil society organizations, but their capacity still remains low.

Integrity in the management of public resources, including aid and natural resource revenues, has shown
improvement. Budget reports complete with aid flows are now regularly disseminated in many countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa (for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda,
and Uganda). Currently, 17 countries are EITI compliant15 and regularly inform and engage citizen groups
in carrying out integrity audits and ethical reviews, and encourage others to join in this effort. Madagascar
reintegrated into the EITI in 2014 and seeks to apply the EITI process to its natural resources sector (for
example, in forestry and fisheries).

Transparency in decision making is gradually improving in Burundi, as the government attempts to
distribute relevant information to the public and build capacity. The government has published detailed
budget execution information on an official website in an interactive format that is downloadable in Excel
and other user platforms. Reports from the Audit Court and Procurement Authorities are accessible to
the public and online (www.courdescomptes.bi and www.armp.bi). The National Assembly and Senate
have also developed websites. Access to Parliament for public and private media contributes to spreading
national debates to citizens.

In 2014, the quality of the legal and judicial system continued to stagnate (at a low level) and did not
help enhance property rights and rule-based governance in cluster D. This status quo is potentially
because of: the lack of attention paid to justice reform in the region on account of political will challenges;
and the limited budgetary resources allocated to the judiciaries by the executive branches, who view
the judiciaries as unequal and a threat to their power in the public sphere. Many judiciaries in Sub-
Saharan Africa are dependent on budget allocations from the executive, lack capacity, and operate in a
normative framework that affects their independence to perform their role effectively and contribute to
good governance and development. Considering that secure property rights and prevention of crime
and violence require effective judicial and rule of law performance, there is a need for accelerated and
renewed efforts to upgrade and focus on this area of governance improvements by instituting reforms
that improve access to justice for citizens and businesses.

  DJIBOUTI AND YEMEN
2014 CPIA Results for Djibouti and Yemen
This section discusses the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores16 for Djibouti and
Yemen, the two countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region that are eligible for support
from the International Development Association (IDA). The focus of this section is on the 2014 scores,
supplemented with a discussion on trends over the last seven years.



Summary

u	The latest Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores for the MENA region countries
     were virtually unchanged relative to 2013. All cluster scores were unchanged except for slight
     weakening in one policy cluster each in Yemen and Djibouti.
u	Since 2008, neither country has improved its overall rating; indeed, Yemen’s policy environment score
     actually declined.
u	The quality of policies and institutions in MENA IDA countries overall lags slightly behind the average
     for middle income countries (MICs) in all CPIA categories except for social inclusion and equity for
     which MENA was slightly ahead.
u	Yemen’s CPIA ratings exceeded the average for fragile IDA countries overall. Yemen’s ratings, overall and
     on all four policy clusters, dominated the rating of the average fragile country (both in and outside of
     Africa).




Recent Trends and Analysis
The average CPIA score for the IDA-eligible countries in MENA (Djibouti and Yemen) was 3.1 in 2014, up
slightly relative to 2013 (3.0). Both Djibouti and Yemen had unchanged overall scores, indicating that in
the midst of unsettled conditions in the region and lingering challenges in global economic conditions,
these countries were largely able to maintain their existing policy frameworks. Djibouti’s CPIA score was
on par with the regional average (3.1) while Yemen’s was below the average (Figure 22).

Compared with other country groups, both MENA IDA countries had lower scores than the average IDA-
eligible country score (3.3), lower also relative to the Sub-Saharan African IDA country average score (3.2).
The MENA countries, both lower middle-income countries, had lower overall ratings than the average
for IDA-eligible middle-income countries17 (3.3). Given that the IDA country CPIA scores ranged from
2.0 to 4.0 in 2014 and the median score was 3.3 (half the country ratings falling below 3.3, and the other
half rated above), the MENA IDA country scores were positioned toward the top of the lower half of the
distribution.

16	 The scores are an indicator of the quality of these countries’ policy and institutional framework across 16 dimensions, grouped into four clusters: economic
    management (Cluster A), structural policies (Cluster B), policies for social inclusion and equity (Cluster C), and public sector management and institutions (Cluster D).
    The 16 policy and institutional areas are defined in Appendix A. The scores, which are on a scale of 1–6, with 6 being the highest, are calculated by World Bank staff and
    are based on quantitative and qualitative information. The assessment also relies on judgments of Bank staff. CPIA scores are used in determining IDA’s allocation of
    resources to the poorest countries.
17	 Most of which are lower middle-income. Appendix B highlights (with asterisks) the 47 middle income countries (MICs) that are IDA eligible. Nine of these are upper
    MICs that, except for one, are small island countries in the Caribbean and Pacific oceans of which 2 are fragile.

cluster scores were also higher than

Djibouti is not a fragile country despite CPIA scores similar to that of Yemen. Compared with other non-
fragile countries (both SSA and non-SSA country groups), Djibouti’s scores were on par both overall and
on all four policy clusters. The two exceptions were Djibouti’s score for structural policies (Cluster B) and

non-fragile countries in SSA but slightly below the score for non-fragile countries outside SSA.

Despite having similar overall scores, Djibouti and Yemen exhibited some differences in cluster scores
depending on the policy or institutional area. The two countries had the same scores on policies for
social inclusion and equity (3.0) and on public sector management and institutions (2.7) (Figure 23)
(see Appendix A for definitions of the CPIA categories). However, Djibouti’s score on structural policies
was higher than Yemen’s (3.5 versus 3.0 respectively) while Yemen had a slight edge over Djibouti on
economic management (3.2 versus 3.0,
respectively). These differences contrast
somewhat from last year, when the two                  CPIA Cluster Scores for Djibouti and Yemen, 2014                        FIGURE 23

policymakers place on macroeconomic stability for facilitating economic and social development, as well
as the fact that modifying macroeconomic policies (such as tightening monetary policy or reducing the
fiscal deficit) is not as lengthy, complex or politically contentious a process as changing institutions (such

                as the framework for better public sector governance). For Yemen and Djibouti, however, the cluster
                scores were at similar levels, highlighting the challenges the authorities are facing in sustaining and
                strengthening the quality of economic management policies.

                The stability in the MENA IDA scores overall and at cluster level relative to 2013 comprises several possible
                situations. In some instances it reflects absence of reforms, or ongoing reforms whose fruits are yet to
                materialize. In other policy and/or institutional areas it might reflect the absence of new information.
                Nonetheless, the stable scores in 2014 relative to 2013 belie changes in the quality of some policies and
                institutions in the region over a longer time horizon. While the average overall score for the region held
                steady at about 3.1 between 2008 and 2014, the scores for structural policies (Cluster B) declined from 3.4
                to 3.2 during 2008-14, the score for public sector management institutions (Cluster D) declined from 2.9 to
                2.7 over the same period, and the quality of economic management (Cluster A) also weakened, from 3.2
                to 3.1 (Figure 24). The downward trend, which preceded the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, deepened in the
                wake of the political and social tensions experienced that year in Yemen and several other countries in the
                region and has largely not yet rebounded.

                Djibouti’s policies and institutions were largely unaffected in the immediate aftermath of the 2011 Arab
                Spring uprisings that occurred in several other MENA countries. Indeed, slight policy gains achieved prior
                to 2010 were largely sustained in 2011. Subsequently however, several cluster scores eased downward in
                2012 with minimal recovery since, thus leaving Djibouti’s policy and institutional environment unchanged
                overall relative to 2008 (Figure 25). At the cluster level, structural policies and public sector management
                institutions were slightly weaker relative to the 2008 scores.

                Yemen’s policy and institutional environment also remained largely unchanged in 2014 relative to 2013: the
                overall score and the first three cluster scores held steady. The fourth cluster (public sector management
                and institutions) posted a slight decline in score relative to 2013, as increased crime and violence stemming

comparable with that of lower middle-
income countries (LMICs) in Africa and
MENA, but lagged behind the LMIC average in almost all CPIA categories. The notable exception was
structural policies, which were an area of strength for MENA. The 2014 comparison with MICs indicates
that the MENA countries are just slightly behind the quality of the average IDA MIC policies and
institutions, as the latter weakened slightly over the past year. Nonetheless, without improvements in
stability and security and in reforms to upgrade the quality of policies and institutions, MENA countries
risk losing competitiveness relative to other MICs and failing to make progress toward shared prosperity.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on

actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

   1. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: The quality of monetary/exchange rate policies in a coherent macroeconomic
      policy framework.
   2. Fiscal Policy: The quality of fiscal policy as regards stabilization (achieving macroeconomic policy objectives in conjunction
      with coherent monetary and exchange rate policies, smoothing business cycle fluctuations, accommodating shocks) and
      resource allocation (appropriate provisioning of public goods).
   3. Debt Policy: Degree of appropriateness of the country’s debt management strategy for ensuring medium-term debt
      sustainability and minimizing budgetary risks.


B. Structural Policies:

   4. Trade: Extent to which the policy framework fosters regional and global integration in goods and services, focusing on the
      trade policy regime (tariffs, nontariff barriers and barriers to trade in services) and trade facilitation.
   5. Financial Sector: Quality of policies and regulations that affect financial sector development on three dimensions: (a)
      financial stability; (b) the sector’s efficiency, depth, and resource mobilization strength; and (c) access to financial services.
   6. Business Regulatory Environment: The extent to which the legal, regulatory, and policy environment helps or hinders
      private business in investing, creating jobs and becoming more productive.


C. Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity:

   7. Gender Equality: The extent to which policies, laws and institutions (a) promote equal access for men and women to human
      capital development; (b) promote equal access for men and women to productive and economic resources; and (c) give men and
      women equal status and protection under the law.
   8. Equity of Public Resource Use: The extent to which the pattern of public expenditures and revenue collection affects
      the poor and is consistent with national poverty reduction priorities.
   9. Building Human Resources: The quality of national policies and public and private sector delivery in health and
      education.
  10. Social Protection and Labor: Policies promoting risk prevention by supporting savings and risk pooling through
      social insurance, protection against destitution through redistributive safety net programs and promotion of human capital
      development and income generation, including labor market programs.

      legal system and rule-based governance structure in which property and contract rights are reliably respected and enforced.
  13. Quality of Budgetary and Financial Management: The extent to which there is: (a) a comprehensive and credible
      budget, linked to policy priorities; (b) effective financial management systems to ensure that the budget is implemented as
      intended in a controlled and predictable way; and (c) timely and accurate accounting and fiscal reporting, including timely audit
      of public accounts and effective arrangements for follow up.
  14. Efficiency of Revenue Mobilization: Assesses the overall pattern of revenue mobilization, not only the tax structure as
      it exists on paper, but revenue from all sources as they are actually collected.
  15. Quality of Public Administration: The core administration defined as the civilian central government (and sub-national
      governments, to the extent that their size or policy responsibilities are significant) excluding health and education personnel,
      and police.

Note: “Fragile Situations” have: either a) a harmonized average CPIA country rating of 3.2 or less, or b) the presence of a UN and/or regional
peace-keeping or peace-building mission during the past three years. This list includes only IDA-eligible countries and non-member or
inactive territories/countries without CPIA data. It excludes IBRD-only countries for which the CPIA scores are not currently disclosed.
The analysis does not include the following fragile countries since either they do not have CPIA data or are IBRD countries: Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and West Bank Gaza.

Middle income countries (MIC) are identified by asterisk (“*”) and upper MICSs by “*(U)”, based on the income classification in effect as of July 2015.

Appendix C: Guide to CPIA
The CPIA is a diagnostic tool that is intended to capture the quality of a country’s policies and institutional
arrangements—i.e., its focus is on the key elements that are within a country’s control, rather than on
outcomes (such as growth rates) that are influenced by elements outside the country’s control. More
specifically, the CPIA measures the extent to which a country’s policy and institutional framework supports
sustainable growth and poverty reduction, and consequently the effective use of development assistance.
The outcome of the exercise yields both an overall score and scores for all of the sixteen criteria that
compose the CPIA. The CPIA tool was developed and first employed in the mid-1970s and over the years the
World Bank has periodically updated and improved it to reflect the lessons of experience and the evolution
of thinking about development.

In June 2006, the World Bank publicly disclosed for the first time the numerical scores of its 2005 Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). The CPIA exercise covers country performance during a given
calendar year with the results for the IDA eligible countries disclosed in June of the following year.

The CPIA has undergone periodic reviews to update and refine the content of the criteria. The most recent
revision of the criteria took place last year and was applied to the 2011 CPIA exercise. The revisions were
guided by the conclusions of an IEG evaluation and by the relevant literature findings and the lessons
learned in carrying out the annual CPIA exercise in the past few years. In undertaking the revisions, special
attention was given to ensuring that the content of the revisions was commensurate with the availability of
information and the ability to assess country performance; and that some degree of continuity was preserved
in the criteria. The revisions have not resulted in significant changes in country scores. Among the revisions
are the following:

  •	 In Q4 (Trade), trade policy and trade facilitation are now equally weighted; more emphasis is placed
    on the trade regime, not just imports; services are explicitly introduced; and the trade facilitation sub-
    component elaborated.
  •	 The coverage of social assistance programs, including coordination, reach and targeting issues in Q10
    (Social Protection and Labor), was strengthened.
  •	 Q15 (Quality of Public Administration) was revised to include a stronger focus on the core public
    administration and, when relevant, a more explicit treatment of sub-national governments.
  •	 In Q16, (Transparency, Accountability and Corruption in the Public Sector) was revised to include a new
    dimension to cover aspects of financial corruption that had not been treated consistently. Coverage
    of fiscal information is now more explicit, and capture and conflicts of interest as distinct forms of
    corruption are treated more consistently.
CPIA scores help to determine IDA allocations—concessional lending and grants—to low-income countries.
