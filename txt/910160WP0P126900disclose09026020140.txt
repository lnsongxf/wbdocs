    Methodology
    This report uses the Scopus abstract and citation database
    to evaluate trends in research growth in SSA. While the re-
    port recognizes that indicators on peer-reviewed research
    outputs do not fully capture all research activity in SSA,
    this is the most systematic and objective foundation for
    analysis currently available. Although previous studies have
    also analyzed research output trends in SSA, this is the
    first report that provides comprehensive policy analysis and
    recommendations at a regional level and builds an analyti-
    cal foundation for stakeholder dialogue in driving the STEM                            Figure E.0 — Map of sub-Saharan

     The Uganda MSI project (2007 – 2013) is an example of an initiative that makes use
     of innovative funding mechanisms such as competitive grants to enhance research
     capacity through teams and collaboration.


     The project aimed to produce more and better qualified science and engineering
     graduates and higher quality and more relevant research. Component One ($
     16.7 million) of the project focused on developing research capacity through
     competitively awarded grants. Component Two ($16.7 million) aimed to improve public
     understanding and appreciation of science and strengthen the institutional capacity.

While the report calls for increased national and interna-
tional funding to research and research-based education at
the master and doctoral level in Africa with a strong focus
on STEM, we must keep in mind the substantial opportunity
costs of research funding. The estimated cost of one doc-
toral degree (USD 50,000) can fund 5 classrooms benefit-
ting around 400 pupils in primary education or 25,000
textbooks in math. Therefore, it makes sense to closely tie

Nevertheless, with a larger share of SSA having attained
or within reach of becoming middle-income countries, the
regions’ development will increasingly require greater scien-
tific and technological capacity.                                                © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

       Research Output

    2.2.1. Total Research Output and Growth
    From 2003 to 2012, sub-Saharan Africa significantly in-
    creased the amount of peer-reviewed research it produced.
    As Figure 2.1 demonstrates, all three Africa regions more
    than doubled their total yearly article 8 output. For exam-
    ple, Southern Africa researchers produced 928 articles in
    2003 and 1940 in 2012. West & Central Africa research-
    ers produced 3,069 articles in 2003 and 8,978 in 2012.
    The compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) 9 for research
    output exceeded 10% for both East and West & Central
    Africa (Southern Africa still grew at a respectable 8.5%
    annually).


    Despite the strong research output growth by the Africa
    regions, the comparator countries grew even faster over
    the same period. Malaysia, whose article output in 2003
    was similar to that of East Africa, grew its output by 31%
    per year. Similarly, Vietnam, whose article output in 2003
    was about two-thirds the level of Southern Africa, grew its
    output by 18.8% per year.

    2.2.2.	 World Article Share
    Over the past decade, the total research output of the world
    has also risen, and world article share 10 provides a normal-
    ized measure of the regions’ growth. As Figure 2.2 shows,
    since every region’s world publication share increased from
    2003 to 2012, their output growth rates outpaced the
    world’s overall growth. Collectively, the SSA’s share of glob-
    al research increased from 0.44% to 0.72%. The overall
    findings about sub-Saharan Africa’s world publication share
    suggest a reversal in the trends reported in Tijssen’s (2007)
    analysis of Africa’s research output from 1980-2004,11
    which had found that “Africa's share in worldwide science
    has steadily declined.” However, certain regions grew more
    quickly than others. West & Central Africa increased its
    world article share from 0.23% in 2003 to 0.40% in 2012,
    achieving a CAGR of 6.3%. In contrast, Southern Africa
    barely increased its share from 0.07% to 0.09%.


    However, with a population of 0.9 billion, SSA accounts
    for 12.5% of the global population, a far cry from its less
    than 1% share of the world’s research output. This shows
    a large gap in Africa’s capacity to produce new knowledge
    in relation to its share of the world population and presents
    potential for rapid growth.

2.2.3.	 Output and Growth by
	       Subject Grouping
Although overall article outputs rose for all regions from
2003 - 2012, certain subject groupings grew faster than
others. As Figure 2.3 shows, in every SSA region, research
in the Health Sciences comprised the highest percentage of
those regions’ total article output. At one extreme, research
in the Health Sciences accounted for 47.8% of EA’s total
output in 2012. On average, research in the Health Sciences
comprised 45.2% of the SSA’s total research output. In
contrast, the Physical Sciences & STEM has been the main
area of focus for South Africa, constituting 44.7% of the
country’s total output in 2012. However, for the other Africa
regions, the Physical Sciences & STEM comprises between
only 25% and 30% of their total research output in 2012.


The Africa regions’ comparator countries provide a stark
contrast. As Table 2.1 reveals, over 67% of Malaysia
and Vietnam’s article output in 2012 was in the Physical
Sciences & STEM.

Moreover, as the individual radar charts reveal and Table
2.2 details more closely, while absolute output across all
subject groupings increased over time, the share of STEM
research in SSA has actually marginally declined by 0.2%
annually since 2003. In contrast, despite Malaysia and
Vietnam’s high relative output in the Physical Sciences &
STEM, these comparator countries further increased their
relative output in this area from 2003 to 2012, grow-
ing 2% annually. On the other hand, relative output in the
Health Sciences and the Social Sciences & Humanities
increased in all SSA regions.


Past research has also identified and expressed concern
about the overall skew of African research toward the
Health Sciences and Agriculture and away from the Physi-
cal Sciences & STEM, a trend dating back to the 1990s.12
Pouris and Ho (2013) comment, “The continent’s research
emphasizes medical and natural resources disciplines to
the detriment of disciplines supporting knowledge based
economies and societies.” 13

Across all three SSA regions, although the percentage of
highly cited article output in Agriculture remained well below
the regions’ overall percentages, it increased significantly
from 2003 to 2012. For example, in 2003, only 3.3% of
Southern Africa’s outputs in Agriculture were in the world's
top 10% in terms of citation counts, but in 2012, 7.9%
were.


The regions’ relative output of highly cited articles in the
Health Sciences has consistently increased over the past
decade, with Southern Africa achieving the highest absolute
percentage growth. From 2003 to 2012, Southern Africa
grew its percentage of output in the world's top 10% in the
Health Sciences from 10.0% to 17.3%.

One particularly interesting audience of sub-Saharan
research is international corporations. They provide both
an early indicator of what types of research could attract
further corporate R&D funding and a test for whether such
research is more broadly applicable. Corporations, however,
often have differing tastes in and uses for research than
academics. As Table 2.5 exemplifies, downloads from cor-
porate users comprises only a fraction of the total amount
of usage data. For example, while East African articles from
2008-2012 were downloaded on average over 900 times,
each paper was downloaded only 15.5 times on average
from corporate users. More importantly, as Table 2.6 shows,
the distribution of corporate interest in the different regions’
subject outputs is very different from that of the academic
sector. In particular, while the output in the Health Sciences
received fewer downloads on average relative to that from all
sectors, such output received between 27% and 87% more
downloads from the corporate sector. In contrast, research
in the Physical Sciences & STEM received between 9% and
30% less downloads on average.

             Box 1.	 R&D Funding and Funding Mechanisms Matter: The Case of South Africa

             The following figures provide data on the growth of R&D in South Africa as a result of increased funding
             and better managed funding mechanisms. As shown in Figure A, starting from 2000, R&D funding in
             South Africa rose with GERD reaching $4.3 billion (in 2005 dollars) by 2008. This increase in funding
             volume has led to a sharp rise in research output in the past decade. The line in Figure A represents the
             introduction of a new funding formula for the provision of incentives by the Department of Education
             to universities. It is clear that this led to a sharp rise in the number of publications. Pouris (2011) 25
             concludes that R&D funding and funding mechanisms matter for research output.

           Over the years both Uganda and Mozambique have increased their funding in S&T but it remains lower than that
           of health. In Malaysia, the GERD in STEM is 28% while that in Health is 4%. In contrast, in 2010 the spending
           on STEM in Mozambique and Uganda was 15% and 12%, respectively of the total countries’ expenditures on
           research. In Africa, Health has seen great improvements given the national priorities and presents an example
           that can be followed in STEM.

      RESEARCH
    COLLABORATION

    This chapter focuses on how various types of
collaboration affect citation impact. It examines the
 levels of extra-regional (i.e. international) and intra-
 regional collaboration, the corresponding impact of
research resulting from such collaborations, and the
   top institutional collaborators with each region.

    International Collaboration
3.2 
3.2.1. Methodology
As technological advances facilitate long-distance commu-
nication and low-cost travel, researchers are increasingly
collaborating with international partners.27 Moreover, past
research suggests that such collaborations are quite produc-
tive. Internationally co-authored articles are associated
with higher field-weighted citation impact.28 For this report,
publications are classified as single-author (self-explanatory)
or into one of three, mutually-exclusive types of geographic
collaboration based on the nature of co-authorship: 29 extra-
regional (i.e., international), intra-regional, and institutional.

Type of Collaboration                                 Definition


Extra-regional (i.e., international)                  Multi-authored research outputs with authors affiliated
Collaboration                                         with institutions in at least two different regions (e.g.,
                                                      East Africa and non-Africa, or West & Central Africa and
                                                      Southern Africa)


Intra-regional Collaboration                          Multi-authored research outputs with authors affiliated
                                                      with more than one institution but both institutions within
                                                      the same Africa region (e.g., University of Nairobi and
                                                      National University of Rwanda, both in East Africa region)
                                                      NB: for country comparators, regional collaboration is
                                                      synonymous with national collaboration


Institutional Collaboration                           Multi-authored research outputs with all authors affiliated
                                                      with the same institution


Single Author                                         Single-authored research outputs

the heterogeneity between these three regions and so weak
are the inter-regional linkages, that it raises the broader
question of optimal organization of African research.
Considering that African research effort and capacity are
increasing rapidly, Africa as a whole stands the risk to miss
synergies inherent in well integrated innovation systems
and which are foundational for knowledge economy.” 33


To calculate the number of collaborations between East
Africa and West & Central Africa, for example, this report
counted all publications in which at least one author holds
an affiliation to an East African institution and another
author holds an affiliation to a West & Central African insti-
tution. Thus, the counts of inter-regional collaborations are
subsets of the counts of international (i.e., extra-regional)
collaborations from the previous section. Figure 3.8 dis-
plays the trends of inter-regional collaboration for East Af-
rica vis-à-vis the other regions. The first and top three trend
lines correspond to all collaborations between East Africa
and West & Central Africa, Southern Africa, and South
Africa respectively. The bottom three trend lines corre-
spond specifically to collaborations in which no co-authors
were affiliated with institutions in OECD countries.34 This

      3.5.1. Top Collaborators in Southern Africa
      Figure 3.17 provides a more granular view of Southern
      Africa’s top ten collaborators. Given the skew of the region’s
      output and impact in the Health Sciences, nearly all of its
      top collaborators are institutions that specialize in medicine
      and health-related research. This skew towards high levels
      of (and impacts associated with) collaboration in the Health
      Sciences is also found in the lists of top institutions for the
      other Africa regions, including South Africa.


      Further reinforcing the dominance of Health Sciences in
      the regions’ collaborations, past research has found that
      in terms of absolute publication output, public-private
      research collaborations are most common in the fields of
      medicine.48 Unsurprisingly, the two companies that ap-
      peared in all three SSA regions’ lists of top 10 corporate
      collaborations were GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. Moreo-
      ver, other pharmaceutical companies comprise the majority
      of each region’s top corporate collaborator lists.

2.	International collaboration is highly instrumental in           International collaboration comprises a smaller share

   South Africa, Malaysia, and Vietnam were 2.7, 1.3, and
   1.9, respectively.


Although international collaboration is the major driver of
African research, raising the citation impact of research
in Africa, Africa today still lacks sufficient capacity and
critical mass to produce international quality research on its
own, in particular within STEM.


While the success of SSA’s diaspora demonstrates that
talent abounds on the continent, that scientific talent may
be insufficiently nurtured due to shortcomings in the quality
of science and math basic education, the availability of high
quality post-graduate training, research infrastructure,
faculty time, research funding, and incentives to pursue
an academic career. In most public research institutes, the
governments only cover operational costs and salaries, and
the research itself is financed through collaborations. In ad-
dition, research funding often comes through international
collaboration (often salaries are covered, but not opera-
tional, travel, and equipment costs). As a result, research
would, independent of student training capacity, tend to be
associated with international collaboration.


3.	There appears to be little knowledge transfer and col-
   laboration between African academics and the corpo-
   rate sector, as measured by corporate downloads of and
   patent citations to African academic research, espe-
   cially for STEM disciplines. To the extent such knowl-
   edge transfer occurs, it occurs within Health Sciences
   and through collaborations with global pharmaceutical
   companies. Such trends suggest that corporations do

    Returning diaspora contribute significantly to raising the citation impact of
    SSA research, specifically in East and Southern Africa. While they make up a
    relatively small share of the region’s total researcher base (3.6% and 2.1%,
    respectively), the relative citation impact of those returnees’ publication is
    quite high compared to that of other SSA researchers.

potential declines in the stock of local human capital.52


The availability of comprehensive publication databases
containing articles with complete author affiliation data,
such as Scopus, has enabled the development of a system-
atic approach to researcher mobility analysis through the
use of authors’ addresses listed in their published articles
as a proxy for their location. The following section describes
the individual components of that brain circulation model,

Mobility Classes
The model generates several main categories of researchers.


Category                       Description


Sedentary                      Researchers who have only published with affiliations to institutions within a particular region.
                               This includes researchers who move between institutions within the same region.


Inflow                         Researchers who come to the region.


Outflow                        Researchers who leave the region.


Returnees (Inflow)             Researchers who first publish while at an institution in the region, leave and publish with an
                               affiliation to an institution outside of the region for two or more years, and ultimately return to
                               back to the region. The institutional affiliation of their return destination need not be the same
                               as their “original institution”.


Returnees (Outflow)            Researchers who first publish elsewhere, come and stay in the region for two or more two years,
                               and then leave to publish elsewhere. The institutional affiliation of their post-region destination
                               need not be the same as their “original institution”.


Transitory                     Researchers that spend less than two years at an institution in the region or an institution out-
                               side the region at any given time; within this group, this report separately analyzes those that
                               publish the majority of their work with region-affiliations versus non-region affiliations, denoting
                               the former as Local Transitory researchers and the latter as Non-local Transitory researchers.




Indicators
For each of the mobility classes, the analysis provides several indicators
to characterize the publication profile of the sets of researchers:


Indicator                      Description


Relative Productivity          The number of papers published per year (PPY) since the first appearance of each researcher as
                               an author in the database during the period 1996-present, relative to all researchers in that re-
                               gion for the same period. The analysis calculates the relative productivity for an author’s entire
                               output of articles, not just those articles with a particular regional affiliation.


                               Relative productivity somewhat normalizes for career length, enabling comparisons of produc-
                               tivity across different groups (e.g. those comprising mostly early career researchers versus
                               those comprising mostly more senior academics). For instance, a group that has a relative
                               productivity of 1.28 produces 28% more PPY than that institution’s overall average PPY.


Relative Age                   The number of years since the first appearance of each researcher as an author in the database
                               relative to all researchers in the region in the same period. The analysis calculates relative age
                               for the author’s entire output in articles (e.g., not just those with a particular regional affiliation).


                               Since the dataset goes as far back as 1996, reporting on relative age is right-censored (e.g., the
                               time since a researcher’s first appearance as an author has an upper limit of 17 years).


FWCI                           The FWCI (see Appendix B for full definition) of all articles associated with a researcher, regard-
                               less of whether that researcher lists the given region as an affiliation on said articles.
4.3 international mobility                                                                                                            53




4.3	 International Mobility
4.3.1. East Africa
For conciseness, this section presents the brain circulation
model of East Africa. The brain circulation models for the
other regions can be found in Appendix F. The brain circula-
tion model in Figure 4.1 is based on the movement of 8750
active East African researcher profiles. These profiles
account for 87% of all articles published with an affiliation
to an institution in the East African between 1996-2013.
As a comparison, the FWCI of articles associated with all
East African researchers over this period is 1.65, while that
of articles associated with active East African researchers
is 1.74.


The Outflow groups of East African researchers tend to be
more senior, productive, and impactful. Returnees Outflow,
or those researchers that spend more than 2 years in East
African institutions before leaving to publish elsewhere, are
amongst the most productive and impactful of all mobil-
ity classes - they produce 35% more papers per year on
average than the typical East African researcher, and the
average FWCI of their papers at 2.14 is well above the 1.74
average associated with all active East African researchers.


Transitory researchers comprise the great bulk of East
African researchers at 57.2%. Within this group, there is
a big difference between non-local transitory researchers
(visiting scholars) and local transitory researchers. The for-
mer are much more productive (relative productivity of 1.38
versus 0.57), senior (relative age of 1.16 versus 0.84), and
impactful (FWCI of 1.81 versus 1.42).


Relative to past studies of other regions, East Africa has a
low number of sedentary researchers (24%); in contrast,
31.7% and 56.8% of US and European active research-
ers remain in their respective regions throughout their
careers.57 Such researchers tend to be less productive
(relative productivity of 0.47) but also younger (relative age
of 0.70).

►	
       articles in each mobility class. All three indicators are
       calculated for each author’s entire output in the period
       (i.e., not just those articles listing a corresponding ad-
       dress for that author).


Measuring Article Downloads
Citation impact is by definition a lagging indicator: newly-
published articles need to be read, after which they might
influence studies that will be carried out, which are then
written up in manuscript form, peer-reviewed, published
and finally included in a citation index such as Scopus. Only
after these steps are completed can citations to the earlier
article be systematically counted. For this reason, inves-
tigating downloads has become an appealing alternative,
since it is possible to start counting downloads of full text
articles immediately upon online publication and to derive
robust indicators over windows of months rather than
years.


While there is a considerable body of literature on the
meaning of citations and indicators derived from them,70
the relatively recent advent of download derived indicators
means that there is no clear consensus on the nature of
the phenomenon that is measured by download counts.71 A
small body of research has concluded however that down-
load counts may be a weak predictor of subsequent citation
counts at the article level.72


In this report, a download is defined as the event where a
user views the full-text HTML of an article or downloads the
full-text PDF of an article from ScienceDirect, Elsevier’s
full-text journal article platform; views of an article abstract
alone, and multiple full-text HTML views or PDF downloads
of the same article during the same user session, are not
included in accordance with the COUNTER Code of Prac-
tice 73. ScienceDirect provides download data for approxi-
mately 20% of the articles indexed in Scopus; it is assumed
that user downloading behavior across countries does not
systematically differ between online platforms. Field-
weighted download impact is calculated from these data
according to the same principles applied to the calculation
of field-weighted citation impact.

SUBJECT
CLASSIFICATION
Background on Scopus All Science
Classification System (ASJC)
Titles in Scopus are classified under four broad subject
clusters (life sciences, physical sciences, health sciences
and social sciences & humanities) which are further divided
into 27 major subject areas and 300+ minor subject areas.
Titles may belong to more than one subject area. For a
complete list of titles associated with these subject areas,
please see http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus/
content-overview


For this report, these 27 subject areas are then aggregated
into five major subject groupings: Agriculture; Physical
Sciences & STEM, Health Sciences, Social Sciences &
Humanities, and the Life Sciences. The main foci of the
report are Agriculture, the Physical Sciences & STEM, and
the Health Sciences.
