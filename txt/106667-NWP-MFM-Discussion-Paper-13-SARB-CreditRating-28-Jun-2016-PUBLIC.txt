Abstract:

Since the global financial crisis and the end of the commodity super-cycle, weak growth and
countercyclical fiscal policy have contributed to deteriorating public finances in many countries across the
globe. As public debt burdens rose, credit ratings deteriorated and a number of countries have been
downgraded from investment to sub-investment (‘junk’) grade. Rating downgrades continue to haunt
countries in a world of low growth. This paper examines the effect of such downgrades on short-term
government borrowing costs, using a sample of 20 countries between 1998 and 2015. The analysis
suggests that a downgrade to sub-investment grade by one major rating agency increased Treasury bill
yields by 138 basis points on average. Should a second rater follow suit, Treasury bill rates increase by
another 56 basis points (although this effect is not statistically significant). The analysis does not detect
any equivalent impacts for local currency ratings, even though T-bills tend to be issued in domestic
currency—although this may be due to sample limitations and is therefore not conclusive.

1     Introduction
Global growth slowed following the global …nancial crisis of 2008, from an
average 4.5% between 2000 and 2007 to 3.2% between 2008 and 2015.1 Com-
modity exporters were hit by a second major shock when commodity prices
dropped, led by a plummeting of the oil price in late 2014. Governments
responded to low growth with countercyclical …scal policy and in response,
public …nances deteriorated markedly. Public debt (in gross terms) rose
from 78% of GDP in 2008 to 105% in 2015 in advanced economies, and,
from 37% to 47% in emerging and developing countries. As solvency con-
ditions softened, credit rating agencies re‡ ected this in a wave of rating
downgrades— not only of sovereigns but also private …rms and state-owned
enterprises. According to Fortune, by April 2016 only two U.S. companies
were left with the top-notch AAA rating.2 Many countries experienced sim-
ilar fates— even U.S. sovereign debt was downgraded, to AA+, by Standard
and Poors (S&P) in August 2011. Low growth means that countries continue
to be haunted by potential rating downgrades.
    This paper focuses on one speci…c rating decision, to sub-investment
(‘junk’or ‘speculative’grade), and the e¤ects on short-term government bor-
rowing costs. Although borrowing costs are expected to increase in the event
of a downgrade, empirical studies are largely lacking for the speci…c event

of a sovereign downgrade to sub-investment grade (sub-IG). It is uncertain
whether markets expect and thus price-in the expectations of a downgrade
to sub-IG, in which case there would be no signi…cant impact on borrow-
ing costs when the country is eventually downgraded, or whether the actual
downgrade to sub-IG causes a signi…cant change in the yield in that period.
The behavior of yields during the period around the downgrade to sub-IG
is thus not fully understood.
    This study aims to …ll that gap by analyzing a sample of 20 countries that
have been rated by the three major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’      s
and S&P) between 1998 and 2015 and determining what e¤ect a downgrade
to sub-IG grade had on the short-term T-bill rate 3 in other countries that
have already experienced such downgrades. The countries were selected
based on data availability.
    The analysis focuses on the e¤ect rating downgrades have on T-bill rates
only. While a sovereign downgrade is likely to feed through across the yield
curve to longer maturity government bonds, and also a¤ect the real economy,
e.g. through e¤ect on state-owned enterprises and private …rms (especially
banks), this is beyond the remit of this study. Although the paper makes
an attempt to study di¤erential e¤ects of foreign-currency rating vs local
currency rating changes, results for the local currency rating are inconclusive
as they are limited by the sample size. A …nal shortcoming of the study is
that it employs annual data, which is a high level of aggregation as …nancial
markets change rapidly. Some nuance will undoubtedly be lost.
    This paper is structured as follows. The next section will present an
overview of the research design: section 2 provides a brief overview of the
literature to help inform the analysis and choice of methodology. A more
detailed description of the empirical methodology is provided in section 3
while data used in this study are described in section 4. Section 5 provides
a short case study of the downgrade to sub-IG that occurred in Latvia in
2009. Section 6 will discuss the results of the analysis while the last section
concludes.


2        Literature Review
The literature on rating downgrades in the private sector is well developed.
Early studies focused on the e¤ect rating decisions had on bond and equity
returns. Drawing on this literature, Goh and Ederington (1993) zoomed
in on the role of rating agencies in delivering new information to markets.
    3
        91 day T-bills were used unless unavailable.


                                                2
They demonstrate that to the extent that credit ratings simply re‡  ect …rms’
leverage (which relates to their solvency situation and is publicly known
for listed companies) markets do not respond to rating decisions— if rat-
ing agencies, however, deliver unanticipated negative news about a …rm’     s
…nancial prospects risk premia increase accordingly. This is an important
insight: to an extent, credit ratings re‡ ect economic fundamentals, which
markets can observe. However, ratings can also reveal new information that
rating agencies gathered during the assessment period, and this is priced
in accordingly. This paper thus aims to account for the extent to which
credit ratings are anticipated by markets and to which extent they convey
new information. Credit rating agencies often highlight that their ratings
are mere ‘         . To an extent ratings are thus subjective. Yet as Goh
            opinion’
and Ederington— as well as this paper— suggest that these opinions a¤ect
market perceptions and risk premia in turn.
    The link between rating decisions and …nancial or economic outcomes
is not straightforward, however. For example, a sovereign downgrade will
immediately a¤ect …rms’ credit ratings with residency in the country in
question— …rms generally cannot have a rating that is higher than the gov-
ernment’  s (Almeida et al., forthcoming). This can result in feedback e¤ects
where …rm performance spills into the real economy and back into the …scal
accounts. Secondly, the e¤ect of ratings on …nancial and economic variables
is not necessarily linear. Hung et al. (2016) …nd that the e¤ect of credit
downgrades on …rm leverage in the US is particularly pronounced for …rms
with investment-grade credit ratings.
    Moreover, discontinuities arise from the investment decisions of partic-
ipants in …nancial markets, such as mutual fund managers. Raddatz et
al. (2014) look at criteria that make certain instruments more likely to
be included in international equity and bond market indexes (such as, for
example the MSCI Emerging Market Index) which are increasingly being
used as benchmarks by mutual funds— to enhance accountability of fund
managers as well as management costs, increasing the extent to which in-
vestments track such indexes. The study shows that asset allocations shift
considerably in response to …nancial instruments being included or excluded
from such indexes. A downgrade to sub-IG is one such event where indexes
may drop the associated …nancial instruments. In the case of bonds, this
shifts demand away and therefore increases borrowing costs.
    The incentives to maintain an investment-grade credit rating are there-
fore strong. At the economic level, avoiding a downgrade is important for
growth. Chang et al. (2015) demonstrate that rating downgrades increase
risk premia (and thus borrowing costs) for a¤ected companies— with con-

                                     3
tagion across the supply chain, a¤ecting both suppliers and rivals. This
a¤ects leverage, i.e. …rms’ability to borrow. Such contagion is not limited
to …rms. Almeida et al. (forthcoming) show that a sovereign downgrade
spills into ratings in the private sector and thus into the real economy since
sovereign and …rm ratings are intertwined. This is another channel through
which downgrades can thus result in lower …rm leverage. Overall, rating
downgrades are thus closely linked with real variables, such as investment
and growth.
    It is therefore not surprising that both …rms and governments try to
avoid rating downgrades. Graham and Harvey (2001) report that 57.1% of
a sample of U.S. and Canadian Chief Financial O¢ cers (CFO’        s) identi…ed
the credit rating as the second highest concern when issuing debt. Accord-
ingly, Kisgen (2006) demonstrates that rating decisions a¤ect …rm leverage.
Hanusch and Vaaler (2013, 2015) show something similar for governments.
As voters are aware of the negative e¤ects of rating downgrades on the econ-
omy, they punish governments at the polls in response to rating downgrades.
This in turn provides incentives to governments to pursue less expansionary
…scal policy during election years.
    This study builds on the insights from the literature. While a num-
ber of studies has explored the e¤ect of a rating downgrade on companies,
this study focuses on sovereign downgrades. Taking into account the dis-
continuities that exist in the e¤ects of rating decisions, the paper focuses
speci…cally on rating changes to sub-IG. To the knowledge of the authors
it is the …rst study of its kind, presumably owing to the fact that there
have been relatively few cases of sovereign downgrades to sub-IG, barring
a limited number of cases during the Asian …nancial crisis of the 1990s.
So samples have been limited (and the sample is still relatively small). As
emerging market economies developed and …nancial markets deepened, sov-
ereign credit ratings have been on a generally improving trend. This trend
was reversed with the onset of the global …nancial crisis triggering another
round of downgrades to sub-IG. The study also explicitly aims at taking into
account the extent to which ratings are expected by markets and/or they
convey new information.


3    Methodology
The research design is grounded in the fact that rating agencies do not fully
reveal the criteria they apply in their rating decisions. So, to an extent at
least, markets are left guessing how raters will assess a government’   s sol-


                                      4
vency. Largely, of course, solvency is determined by economic fundamentals
(economic growth, in‡     ation, …scal accounts, etc.) so credit ratings should
generally re‡   ect these. They are also variables observable by market partic-
ipants. Thus, to a considerable extent, a credit rating should be expected
by markets, based on economic fundamentals (Goh and Ederington, 1993).
Yet it is well known that raters also apply a degree of discretion to their
ratings which may not be expected by markets. The research design aims
to tease out the expected and unexpected components of ratings to examine
the e¤ect on short-term borrowing costs.
    The event of a down-grade to sub-IG is a special case along the rating
scale as it fundamentally changes a country’   s risk pro…le and is likely to cause
considerable shifts in investor exposure as the rating category changes to
‘speculative’  . This study teases out the di¤erential e¤ects of the downgrade
to sub-IG of the …rst rating agency and a second rating agency respectively.
A country’   s debt is only technically considered rated sub-IG when two raters
downgrade it accordingly. However, the …rst such downgrade may have a
signaling e¤ect and the analysis below suggests that the …rst downgrade
has the largest e¤ect on T-bill rates— this is consistent with Raddatz et
al. (2015) who focus on the …rst downgrade as markets anticipate a second
downgrade to follow suit. The analysis is conducted both for local and
foreign currency credit ratings. Although T-bills are issued in domestic
currency, the analysis below does not …nd any e¤ects of local currency rating
downgrades to sub-IG on T-bill rates. The sample of countries experiencing
such downgrades is low, however, so this result may merely be due to a lack
of statistical power.

3.1    Estimating credit ratings
We model each country’    s average credit rating as a function of economic
fundamentals, namely GDP growth (annual percentage change), the bud-
get balance (in percent of GDP— where a negative balance corresponds to a
budget de…cit), net government debt (in percent of GDP) and in‡   ation (an-
nual percentage change in consumer prices). The …rst lag of the dependent
variable is included to account for dynamics in the series. The equation is
given by
                   0
           yit =       xit +   i   + #t +   it ;       (i = 1; :::; N ; t = 1; :::; T )   (1)

                      s average credit rating at time t;
where yit is country i’                                    is a (K + 1) 1
vector, and xit = (1 x1;it     xK;it )0 , with K = 5— average rating lagged
by one period, GDP growth, budget balance, net government debt, and

                                                   5
in‡ation. i ; #t ; and it capture country and time speci…c shocks and the
overall error term respectively.
    Given the number of time periods in this study, Generalized Methods
of Moments (GMM) is the best estimator for this analysis (Judson and
Owen, 1999). GMM is also common for a dynamic panel model with a rel-
atively persistent dependent variable— speci…cally System-GMM (Arellano
and Bond (1991), Arellano and Bover (1995), Blundell and Bond (1998) and
Judson and Owen (1999)). Yet to compare estimates, as is also common in
the literature, pooled and …xed e¤ects Ordinary Least Squares results will
also be reported.
    From this analysis, predicted values are obtained to represent the ex-
pected rating while the corresponding residuals (i.e. the di¤erence between
the expected rating and the actual average rating) represent the unexpected
rating. Values greater (lower) than zero on the unexpected rating mean
that the average credit rating is above (below) market expectations. The
analysis is conducted separately for both foreign currency and local currency
long-term credit ratings. When estimating equation 1 for foreign currency
ratings, the current account balance (in percent of GDP) is included, as one
potential determinant that creates currency risk and may thus distinguish
the foreign currency from the local currency-rating. As this variable is not
signi…cant, however, it is not included in the base speci…cation.

3.2   Estimating the e¤ect of credit rating downgrades to sub-
      IG on short term interest rates
To determine the e¤ect of actual credit ratings on short-term government
borrowing rates, the predicted values and residuals from equation 1 are used
to estimate T-bill rates. In addition, two dummy variables are included to
capture the event of a downgrade to sub-IG of a …rst rating agency (1st
rater) and a second rating agency (2nd rater) respectively. Equation 2 is
thus essentially a representation of T-bill rates as a function of expected
ratings (underlying which are economic fundamentals) and unexpected rat-
ings, as well as two downgrade dummies to capture non-linear e¤ects of
downgrades to sub-IG grade (as opposed to linear e¤ects across the rating
scale). A key control variable when analyzing T-bills is a country’    s policy
rate (with a pairwise correlation coe¢ cient of 0.7) which is thus included in
all speci…cations. The equation is,
                  0
          rit =       zit +   i   + ! t + vit ;       (i = 1; :::; N ; t = 1; :::; T )   (2)



                                                  6
where rit is country i’s T-bill rate at time t; is a (M + 1) 1 vector, and
zit = (1 z1;it    zM;it )0 , with M = 6— lagged T-bill rate, expected rating,
unexpected rating, indicator for downgrade by …rst agency, indicator for
downgrade by second agency, and Central Bank policy rate. To distinguish
the error terms from equation 1, i ; ! t ; and vit represent country speci…c,
time speci…c, and overall error terms, respectively, in equation 2.
    A number of controls have been included for robustness. In the analysis
below, several controls will be used to test the robustness of the relation-
ship, including replacing the rating variables with the underlying economic
fundamentals. Moreover, the central bank’      s main policy rate will also be
included given that government bond yields— especially in the short end of
the yield curve— closely follow policy rates. As for equation 1, the main
employed estimator is System-GMM.


4    Data
The dependent variable in equation 1, the credit ratings on (i) long-term for-
eign currency-denominated and (ii) long-term local currency denominated
government debt by the largest three rating agencies (S&P, Moody’       s, and
Fitch), are retrieved from Bloomberg, and converted into numeric values be-
tween 19 and 0. Higher values represent better credit ratings: values from 10
to 19 represent investment grade ratings while 0 to 9 are sub-IG. The rating
values for the three agencies are then averaged to create one variable for av-
erage foreign and local currency credit ratings each.4 Figure 1 shows that in
recent history there have been two episodes of sub-IG downgrades. The …rst
was the Asian …nancial crisis of 1997, which mostly a¤ected East Asian coun-
tries (Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand), but also Colombia
and the Slovak Republic. The second episode of major downgrade followed
the global …nancial crisis and mostly a¤ected European countries (Croa-
tia, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Portugal, Russia
and Slovenia), Latin American and Caribbean countries (Barbados, Brazil,
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Uruguay) as well as Tunisia. Major rating shocks
occurred in 2009, 2011, 2012, and most recently 2015, when the end of the
commodity super-cycle hit commodity-exporters: Brazil, Azerbaijan, and
Russia (where the commodity shock was aggravated by sanctions).
    Given the data coverage (and especially given the availability of T-bill
   4
     In some case, countries were only rated by one or two of the three rating agencies
under study. Thus, the average rating may include underlying ratings of one to three
rating agencies.

data), only the second episode of major downgrade will be included. Al-
though some countries in the sample have coverage from 1998 to 2015, the
downgrade episodes under study fall exclusively into the post-global …nan-
cial crisis period. The data set include 20 countries which are listed in the
appendix. Uneven data coverage means that the sample under study is un-
balanced. Eleven countries under study experienced a downgrade to sub-IG
by at least one rating agency, while seven experienced a downgrade by a
second agency.
    Independent variables for equation 1 include annualized key economic
fundamentals that impact credit ratings and short-term rates. These vari-
ables are all taken from the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO, April
2016) and include GDP growth, the budget balance (in percent of GDP),
net government debt (in percent of GDP), and the in‡    ation rate.
    The dependent variable in equation 2 is the short-term T-bill rate. These
rates are retrieved from various sources which include Bloomberg, IMF In-
ternational Financial Statistics (IFS), Haver Analytics, and Central Bank
databases. In addition to independent variables obtained from equation 1
(expected rating, and unexpected rating), the other key variables are the
downgrade dummies. Accordingly, two dummy variables were constructed
from the foreign currency and local currency credit rating data, where a
value of 1 represents the period in which a country had been downgraded to
sub-IG by one rating agency and another dummy is used when it was down-
graded by a second rater. The main control variable in Equation 2 is the
policy rate which was obtained mostly from Haver. Gaps were …lled using
data from Bloomberg. Where policy rates were not available but interbank
rates were, those were used as proxies for the policy rate.


5    A case study: Latvia after the global …nancial
     crisis
Before delving into the statistical analysis, it is worthwhile to map out a
case where a country recently experienced a downgrade to sub-IG. Latvia is
a good example, as it is an emerging economy which experienced consecutive
downgrades, including to sub-IG, following the global …nancial crisis. The
Latvian story is also instructive not only because it was downgraded but
also as it was upgraded again to investment grade, illustrating a full cycle
of credit downgrades and upgrades.
    Figure 2 depicts Latvia’ s experience (using quarterly data). In response
to the global …nancial crisis of 2007/8 Latvian GDP growth (q/q saar) con-


                                     9
tracted sharply (the dotted line in Figure 2) and the …scal accounts de-
teriorated markedly. In response, credit rating agencies cut their ratings
successively (light grey line in Figure 2), by about four notches from pre-
crisis levels. In response, T-bill yields started increasing markedly (dark
blue line). The largest spike in yields occurred in the period when Latvia
moved toward the threshold to speculative grade (speculative or sub-IG is
equivalent to an S&P or Fitch letter grade of BB+ and below), when two
raters moved to BBB- equivalent and …nally two raters downgraded Latvian
debt to sub-IG. Latvia experienced its …rst downgrade to sub-IG by S&P
in 2009 Q1 (the …rst red-shaded area) which saw the yield spread spike 35
bps from the previous quarter and 390 bps from two quarters prior. Fitch
closely followed in the next quarter (beginning of maroon-shaded area), be-
ing the second rater to downgrade Latvia to sub-IG.5 This saw the T-bills
yield spread spike by a further 640 bps over the next two quarters, resulting
in the yield spread more than doubling due to the second downgrade to
sub-IG.
     Interestingly, the spike in T-bill rates was short-lived. As the pace of the
economic contraction slowed and growth eventually turned positive, T-bill
rates recovered, even before the average credit rating improved and long
before the country moved back to investment grade in 2012. While this
is an important observation it is important to note that it is di¢ cult to
determine the extent to which this is a consequence of ultra-loose monetary
policy in developed countries which saw large in‡    ows of portfolio investment
to emerging economies (including Latvia). The downgrades followed closely
after the …nancial crisis which saw Latvia’    s budget de…cit worsen from 3.2%
in 2008 to 7% in 2009. Net government debt (% of GDP) also doubled in
2008-2009 from 16.2% to 32.5% largely due to signi…cant GDP contractions
during the same period. The improvement in GDP allowed the budget
balance to improve to a 0.1% surplus by 2012, although net government
debt slightly increased further, to 36.9% by 2012.
     The Latvian experience is borne out in other countries. Figure 3 plotseT-
bill rates for a number of countries, also highlighting periods in which these
countries were downgraded— by one rating agency and two agencies respec-
tively. As can be seen, in most cases T-bill rates increase well in advance
of the downgrades and generally continue to do so in the year of the down-
grades. This illustrates the extent to which the raters capture market senti-
ment. As the analysis below demonstrates, however, the opinions of rating
  5
    The nominal T-bill brie‡ y fell in this period. Yet looking at the spread with average
European T-bill rates, the expected increase in borrowing costs can be observed.

6      Statistical estimation
6.1      Estimating credit ratings from economic fundamentals

at addressing the bias associated with dynamic panel estimation with …xed
e¤ects (Nickell, 1981). In addition, the instruments used in the GMM esti-
mation are broadly valid: as required, the di¤erenced residuals experience
…rst order but not second order autocorrelation. The Hansen test of overi-
dentifying restrictions is insigni…cant suggesting that the instruments are
valid (although this test is weakened by the large number of instruments).
The goodness of …t is unusually high with an R2 above 0.91— this is largely
owed to the fact that ratings are highly persistent
    Examining the coe¢ cients of the independent variables, the observed
e¤ects are as expected. Economic growth is associated with higher credit
ratings (although this e¤ect is not robust in the GMM speci…cation for local
currency ratings). A higher budget balance is associated with a stronger
…scal position and thus has a positive e¤ect on credit ratings— public debt
levels have the expected opposite e¤ects. Higher in‡   ation results in a lower
credit rating. This e¤ect may be due to multiple reasons, including an
economy that is slipping out of internal balance. It may also point toward
an expected depreciation of the currency, increasing the burden of external
debt (although the evidence for this is weak as the coe¢ cient would be
expected to be larger for the foreign currency rating than the local currency
rating, which is not the case). Since foreign and local currency ratings
mainly di¤er in that the former adds another source of risk (the exchange
rate), column 4 in Table 1 also controls for the current account balance.
This is not statistically signi…cant, however, and will thus not be considered
for subsequent analysis.
    The results from Table 1 are used to predict the foreign and local cur-
rency ratings, expected rating, and the associated residual unexpected rat-
ing. For the foreign currency rating, the results from column 3 are used; for
the local currency ratings, column 7 is selected.

6.2   Estimating the e¤ect of sub-IG downgrades on T-bills
Table 2 presents the results from the analysis of T-bills as a function of
expected and unexpected credit ratings, downgrades to sub-IG, by one and
two raters respectively, and the Central Bank’ s policy rate. Turning again
to the adequacy of the empirical model, the lagged dependent variable coef-
…cients, both for foreign currency and local currency ratings lie in between
the pooled and …xed e¤ects estimates. First order autocorrelation in the
di¤erenced residuals— and the lack of second order autocorrelation— as well
as the Hansen test all point toward acceptable model speci…cation.
    As expected, when rating agencies rate a country (on average) higher

than markets would expect from fundamentals, T-bill rates fall— it is cheaper
for the government to borrow. The coe¢ cient of the unexpected rating vari-
able is negatively signed and statistically signi…cant for the foreign currency
credit rating across speci…cations in Table 2 (it does matter for local cur-
rency ratings). Interestingly, the expected rating element is not statistically
signi…cant, although it is signed in line with expectations. The policy rate is
positive and signi…cant, underlining the general co-movement of policy rates
and T-bill rates.
     Turning now to the e¤ect of downgrades on T-bill rates it is striking that
it is the …rst downgrade to sub-IG that matters; and it only matters in the
case of foreign currency ratings, local currency rating downgrades to sub-IG
have no discernable e¤ect on T-bill rates— even though T-bills tend to be
local currency denominated. On average, the …rst downgrade to sub-IG on
the foreign currency long-term rating resulted in an increase in T-bill yields
of 138 basis points. While the coe¢ cients of the …rst downgrade to sub-
IG dummy bears the expected sign, suggesting downgrades are associated
with higher T-bill rates, the coe¢ cients are not statistically signi…cant in
the case of the local currency rating. The second downgrade dummy to
sub-IG has the expected positive coe¢ cient for both the foreign and local
currency downgrades, associated with an additional increase of 56 and 68
basis points respectively, yet it is not statistically signi…cant. The results
are robust to the inclusion of the ‘   alternative’ currency rating (the local
currency rating in column 4 and the foreign currency rating in column 8).
Thus, according to this analysis, T-bills are determined by their history (the
lagged dependent variable), the Central Bank policy rate, the unexpected
part of a credit rating, and when a …rst rating agency declares a country’    s
national debt as ‘ speculative’.


7    Conclusion
This study draws on the experience of countries after the global …nancial
crisis to study the e¤ect of a downgrade of the sovereign credit rating to sub-
IG. It feeds into a broader literature demonstrating the e¤ect of downgrades
for borrowing costs, not just for …rms but also governments. A downgrade
to sub-investment grade on the foreign currency rating is associated with
an average increase of 138 basis point in T-bill rates. A second downgrade
appears anticipated by markets and even though it makes the rating category
‘o¢ cial’ (for a sub-IG rating to become o¢ cial coincident ratings by at
least two rating agencies are required) the e¤ect is small (56 basis points,


                                      16
although this is not statistically signi…cant). This e¤ect is large and can
pose considerable additional …nancing costs to governments, and yet it does
not take into account the e¤ect on the yield curve. T-bills tend to be largely
in‡uenced by policy rates while risk premia play more of a role for longer-
maturity debt. The e¤ect for longer-term government debt is thus likely to
be even larger.
    It is important to note a number of caveats. Downgrades of sovereign
ratings to sub-IG are still relatively rare— they have only occurred a few
times during the Asian …nancial crisis and more recently in the aftermath
of the global …nancial crisis. This means that there are relatively few oc-
currences available for analysis, making it more di¢ cult to generalize to all
countries. This study is a …rst attempt at this, but further research will
be required to re…ne it. In particular, to better capture the di¤erent na-
ture of countries— e.g. countries with …xed currencies (i.e. many European
countries) may have very di¤erent experiences from countries with ‡     oating
currencies (such as Brazil, India, South Africa, etc.). Moreover, most of the
analysis falls in an unusual time of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative
easing in developed countries, making it more di¢ cult to generalize from the
results to periods with a di¤erent monetary policy environment. This study
also paints with a broad brush, not taking into account several economic
feedback e¤ects, be it e.g. through banks or state-owned enterprises that
could di¤erentiate the results across countries.
    Finally, the study does not detect any e¤ect of local currency rating
downgrades on T-bill yields— even though they are denominated in local,
not foreign currency. This may be due to the fact that there are even fewer
local currency rating downgrades than foreign currency ones, limiting the
statistical power of an empirical panel approach. While the study does not
…nd e¤ects for local currency rating downgrades it does not preclude them.
