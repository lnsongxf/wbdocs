1     Introduction
After the discovery of oil in Nigeria in 1956, the country started oil production in 1958, and soon
after became the main oil exporting nation on the African continent. In spite of the oil boom in the
1970s, the expected prosperity was failing to appear. GDP per capita (constant) was stagnating.
It did not improve signiﬁcantly and sustainably until the mid 2000s, and only caught up with
the Sub-Saharan African average in 2010. Other indicators of economic development have been
following a similar pattern—the share of people living below $1 per day increased from 36% in
1970 to a staggering 70% in 2000, and at the same time the share of extremely wealthy individuals
grew, such that the income distribution widened considerably1 .
    An additional characteristic of Nigeria’s development is the volatility of its growth rates. While
its average GDP per capita growth rate was just over 1% between 1980 and 2014, the standard
deviation was close to 7.5, which is higher than in other Sub-Saharan African countries, and in
other oil-producing nations (see Table A.1 in the Appendix).
    Ever since the important contribution by Sachs and Warner (1995), in which a negative inﬂu-
ence of natural resource wealth on economic development was shown empirically, Nigeria’s lack
of development was attributed to its oil-abundance, and accompanying Dutch disease eﬀects. van
der Ploeg (2011), however, remarks that ”[i]t is hard to maintain that the standard Dutch disease
story of worsening competitiveness of the non-oil-export sector fully explains [Nigeria’s] miserable
economic performance”. Empirical research by Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003, 2013) backs
up that presumption: natural resources have a deteriorating impact on the quality of institutions,
and through that channel natural resources harm economic development, even in the absence of
Dutch-disease eﬀects.
    This data-based analysis aims at re-investigating the causes for Nigeria’s growth performance.
Using panel data of close to 150 countries during 1970 and 2014, we assess the determinants of
GDP per capita growth, highlighting in particular the role of natural resources and institutional
quality. Long-term, cross-sectional analyses are performed in addition, in order to carefully take
into account that institutional quality measures are prone to endogeneity and measurement errors
by using Two-Stage-Least-Squares estimators. The ultimate aim of the analysis is to learn about
the drivers of growth in Nigeria, and to assess the country’s future growth potential. Therefore,
various interaction terms in the panel setting allow a deviating impact of several factors in Nigeria
as compared to the rest of the sample. These estimations are used to project GDP per capita
growth rates for Nigeria under diﬀerent scenarios.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes existing literature
on the resource-growth nexus, and the relevance of the institutional environment of countries in
this context. Before the estimation results are presented in Section 5, Sections 3 and 4 outline the

the growth regressions, Nigeria’s growth rates are predicted assuming diﬀerent scenarios in Section
6. Section 7 concludes.


2       Natural Resources, Institutional Quality, and Growth
Starting with the observation that resource-abundant countries are often performing worse than
resource-poor countries, Sachs and Warner (1995) study empirically the impact of natural resources
on economic growth using worldwide cross country data. In their seminal contribution, they ﬁnd
evidence for a detrimental eﬀect of natural resources on growth, and in subsequent studies they
further conﬁrm the robustness of this result2 —a controversial ﬁnding that triggered an ongoing
scholarly discussion about the curse and the blessing of natural resources.
     In response, various analyses were dedicated to deepen the understanding of this result, and
in particular, to identify the mechanisms through which natural resources result in low economic
growth rates. One of the most common arguments is that high shares of natural resources can lead
to overvaluations of the real exchange rates. A consequential contraction of the tradable sector can
weaken economies’ development prospects, especially if this sector exerts economies of scale, by
learning-by-doing, for example (Torvik, 2001; Atkinson and Hamilton, 2003). Sachs and Warner
(1995, 1997, 2001) mainly attribute their empirical ﬁndings to these so-called Dutch-disease eﬀects.
     Another strand of the literature argues that natural resources may lead to a ”crowding-out”
of investment in human capital. Strong primary sectors lower the incentives to dedicate suﬃcient
resources to other, more education-intensive sectors. Gylfason, Herbertsson, and Zoega (1999)
highlight that school enrollment rates are lower in countries with a high share of the labor force
engaged in the primary sector. Low human capital accumulation can translate into poor growth
rates—directly via the channel of productivity, or through indirect eﬀects on political stability,
health, or democracy. Empirical evidence suggests, that a considerable part of the negative impact
of natural resources on growth can be attributed to lower educational attainment in resource-
abundant countries (Gylfason, 2001).
     Rampant rent-seeking behavior is a further often-investigated transmission mechanism. The
rents generated by natural resources cause an increased number of agents engaged in rent-seeking,
as opposed to pursuing productive activities, and this voracity eﬀect destroys the rents generated
by natural resources. Lane and Tornell (1996), for example, develop a model that shows that in
countries with powerful groups and low institutional quality, growth rates reduce due to natural
resource windfalls, as higher productivity increases the demand for transfers, and these redistribu-
tional eﬀects may outweigh the growth-enhancing eﬀects of resource endowments. Hodler (2006)
provides theoretical as well as empirical evidence that increased rent-seeking behavior weakens

property rights, and that in turn further reduces the attractiveness of productive activities. The
more rivaling groups, i.e. the higher the fractionalization in the countries, the more likely it is,
that natural resources are a curse, as opposed to a blessing.3
   While the rent-seeking and the Dutch disease hypotheses claim an unconditional negative inﬂu-
ence of natural resources on growth (Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik, 2006), there is a large literature
that tied the negative relationship to certain conditions, most importantly the institutional environ-
ment and corruption in the countries. The contribution by Bulte, Damania, and Deacon (2005) is
among the ﬁrst studies investigating the inter-relationship between natural resources, institutions,
and economic and human development. While they ﬁnd only limited evidence for a direct eﬀect
of natural resources on human development, evidence for an indirect link via institutional quality
is presented. Similarly, Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik (2006) conﬁrm a negative direct eﬀect of
natural resources on growth, but conclude that the combination of ”grabber friendly” institutions
and natural resources harms growth, whereas ”producer friendly” institutions help materializing
the full beneﬁts of resources.4
          A ﬁnal important literature, related to the discussed inﬂuence of institutional quality, and the
rent-seeking hypothesis, is the role played by corruption. Leite and Weidmann (1999), and more
recently Badinger and Nindl (2014), show, that natural resources facilitate corruption. Again,
the strength of this link has been tied to the countries’ institutional environments. Resource
rents appear to mainly increase corruption levels, if countries have a comparably low polity -score,
a measure of the degree of democracy in a country (Bhattacharyya and Hodler, 2010). Stable
democracies—Norway, Australia, and Canada are named as examples—do not suﬀer from these
adverse eﬀects, as their institutions prohibit rent-seeking behavior to a large degree.

       Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of long-term GDP per capita growth rates and
natural resource rents as well as oil rents (both measured as shares in GDP). It is apparent, that no
correlation between long-term growth and natural resources can be detected. There are high-growth
countries—such as the Asian tigers—that are poorly endowed with natural resources, whereas
                                                                           ublica Bolivariana
countries rich in resources—Nigeria, Liberia, the Republic of Congo, or Rep´
de Venezuela are examples—lack long-term economic progress. Recent research stresses the role
of institutions in the growth-resource-nexus. The graphs in Figure 2 attempt to ﬁnd descriptive
evidence for a correlation between resource endowments and institutional quality. The correlation
is remarkable: Resource-rich countries, among them Nigeria, are associated with lower average
institutional quality and higher levels of corruption (based on long-term averages of the variables),
supporting the presumption that resources can deteriorate institutional quality and promote rent-
seeking and corruption.
       Based on the current state of the literature, and on the important work by Sala-i-Martin
and Subramanian (2003, 2013), this study addresses the determinants of GDP per capita growth,
focusing in particular on the role played by natural resources, institutions, and corruption, and
highlights the growth prospects for Nigeria in a global setting.


3                   Empirical Setting
Panel ﬁxed eﬀects estimations                                                      The main results of this analysis and the ingredients for
the out-of-sample predictions of Nigeria’s growth rates are based on cross country panel growth
regressions. The real per capita growth rate in country i and period t, git , is regressed on a variable
expressing natural resource abundance, institutional quality (Iit ), and a set of covariates X, and
the basic speciﬁcation can be characterized as


                                                                                                     5
                                    GDPi,t−1               N ATit
                git = α + β log                    + γf               + δIit + Xη + µi + νt +          it         (1)
                                    P OPi,t−1              GDPit
   where α is a constant, µi and νt are country and period ﬁxed eﬀects, and                     it   is the remaining
error term. In particular the country ﬁxed eﬀects that control for time-invariant characteristics
inherent to the countries are important components in this setting, because they limit potential
unobserved heterogeneity biases.5 In order to limit the chance of business cycles and short term
GDP ﬂuctuations distorting the results, t corresponds to ﬁve-year periods and the variables enter
as ﬁve-year averages or initial values of the respective period.6 Important control variables that are
included in the matrix X are human capital, investment, government consumption, the openness
of the countries, as well as a measure for the undervaluation of the currency. In all speciﬁcations,
a measure of natural resources is included. In a simple setting, we control for the share of total
natural resource rents in GDP. In order to allow for heterogeneous eﬀects, we decompose that
variable into rents from oil and non-oil natural resources. As the eﬀects of oil rents on GDP per
capita growth may be non-linear, the oil rents variable is split into four quartiles in a third setting.
The underlying hypothesis is that the degree of oil-dependence might aﬀect the contribution of oil
rents to GDP growth rates.
   As the major aim of this study is to carve out the main determinants of growth in Nigeria,
several variables are interacted with a Nigeria dummy in order to learn about possible deviating
eﬀects.

Endogeneity The coeﬃcient estimates of the institutional measures (incl. the corruption index)
might be biased in an estimation framework that does not account for endogeneity. Endogeneity
problems could come from various sources. First, both the institutional characteristics and the
growth rates of countries could respond simultaneously to omitted factors. Such factors could
                                                                                       endez and
be cultural dispositions, legal frameworks or historical conventions (see for example M´
   ulveda, 2006). As a panel setting allows to control for country-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects, country-
Sep´
inherent factors that are constant over time are controlled for, and persistent country characteristics
will not cause biased estimates. Second, the estimates could suﬀer from reversed causality—a
problem that arises when not only corruption inﬂuences GDP growth, but also the reverse is true.
Third, the rule of law as well as the corruption indicator are indices, and not precise measurements.
Measurement errors cause biased estimates, when they are correlated with the observed (and
potentially) mis-measured values.
   Biased estimates that should not be interpreted causally are the consequences of all described
sources of endogeneity. Several attempts to instrument the institutional variable in a panel setting
were not fruitful due to a lack of credible instruments that vary over time. Instrumental variables

that have proved helpful are constant within countries (see below for a discussion of those instru-
ments), and therefore they cannot be used in a panel framework that controls for country ﬁxed
eﬀects. As these country ﬁxed eﬀects help overcoming another important (heterogeneity) bias, the
cost of omitting them is too high. Inspired by recent literature (Werker, Ahmed, and Cohen, 2009;
Nunn and Qian, 2014; Dreher and Langlotz, 2015) on the causal link between aid and growth,
attempts were made to interact presumably excludable, but constant instruments with a variable
that varies over time. The special feature of this strategy is that the second variable that the
excludable instrument is interacted with must not necessarily be exogenous. Although promising
at ﬁrst, further considerations revealed that the instruments for natural resources proposed in the
literature are not appropriate for such an instrumentation strategy. For this reason, a bias reduc-
tion with two-stage least squares methods seems not feasible in the panel setting and we rely on a
cross-sectional analysis for an attempt to establish causality.

Instrumentation of institutional quality in a non-panel, cross country setting Very
much in the line with the literature on institutional quality and economic growth, the possible
endogeneity of the institutional variable is instrumented in a cross-country, long term growth
setting. The time dimension exploited in the main results, that are based on the panel setting
outlined above, needs to be neglected, and long term averages and initial values of the variables are
used. In this setting, one can draw on the literature for successful instrumentation strategies. Hall
and Jones (1999), for instance, use the fraction of the population speaking English or another major
European language as an instrument for institutional quality, arguing that the language shares
are approximating the exposure to Europe. Using similar arguments, the seminal contribution by
Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) exploits the variation in mortality rates of early European
settlers in the colonial countries to approximate the foundations of current institutional quality
that have been established in the past by European settlers. Together with the presumption of high
persistence of institutional quality, their instrumentation rests on the assumption that bad living
conditions increased the likelihood of ”‘extractive”’ institutions, whereas a favorable environment
caused settlers to build ”Neo-Europes”. Easterly and Levine (2003) instrument the institutional
variable with ”endowments”, and use settler mortality, latitude, crops/minerals dummies, and a
landlocked dummy.
   Using settler mortality as an instrument drastically reduces the number of observations, and
for that reason we are following Hall and Jones (1999) and Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003,
2013) and use English and other European language shares as instrumental variables for the two
indicators for the quality of institutions—the rule of law and a corruption index.
   Formally, the growth equations that are estimated have the following form

                                      GDPi            N ATi
                     gi = α + β log            + γf               + δIi + Xη +   i               (2)

                                                  7
Institutional quality and the level of corruption is instrumented with the fraction of people speaking
English and another European language using Two-Stage-Least-Squares (2SLS) estimation. The
corresponding ﬁrst stage is

                                                        GDPi                N ATi
                Ii = θ0 + θ1 Engi + θ2 Euri + θ3                   + θ4 f            + Xκ + ui                 (3)

4       Data
Panel analysis The sample used for the panel regressions contains 1,000 observations that rep-
                                                              7
resent 150 countries during 1970 (or later) and 2014              The time dimension is reduced to ﬁve-year
averages (for log GDP per capita, the initial value is used), in order to net out business cycles and
high short term volatility. One observation indexed (i, t) thus corresponds to a country i and the
average during years t, t + 4 or the initial value in t. Table A.4 in the Appendix lists the countries
and periods included in detail.
     The sources and precise deﬁnitions of the variables used are summarized in Table A.2 in the
Appendix. A measure of the real undervaluation of currencies is constructed by the price level
of an economy adjusted by the Balassa-Samuelson eﬀect8 following Rodrik (2008). More specif-
ically, the real eﬀective exchange rate, calculated as the exchange rate over the PPP conversion
factor, is regressed on (the logarithm of) per capita GDP and a set of time dummies. The diﬀer-
ence of the real exchange rate and the predictions from this regression is used as a proxy for real
undervaluation. The resulting index is centered around zero. A positive value indicates under-
valuation, and a negative value indicates overvaluation. Figure 3 shows the natural logarithm of
the undervaluation index for Nigeria, as compared to other Sub-Saharan African oil-exporting and
non-oil-exporting countries. This comparison shows descriptively, that Nigeria’s exchange rates
have been overvalued—considerably so compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries—during
the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Only in the mid-2000s, the degree of undervaluation returns to
the Sub-Saharan African average.
     In order to measure institutional quality and the level of corruption in the countries, we rely
on the recently established Varieties of Democracy Data Base (Coppedge, Gerring, Lindberg,
Skaaning, Teorell, Tzelgov, Wang, Altman, Bernhard, Fish, Glynn, Hicken, Knutsen, McMann,
Staton, and Zimmermann, 2015), that provides a wide array of indicators related to various aspects

non-tradeable goods due to productivity improvements.

of democracy. The indicators chosen for this analysis are a rule of law index (v2xcl rol) and a
corruption index (v2x corr). The former measures the equality before the law and individual
liberty, the transparency and the enforceability of laws, and to what extend citizen have access to
justice, secure property rights, freedom from forced labor, freedom of movement, physical integrity
rights as well as freedom of religion. The corruption index includes measures of distinct types of
corruption, thereby distinguishing between bribery and embezzlement, as well as between the levels
at which corruption takes place—the highest levels as opposed to the public sector at large. It is
calculated as a weighted average of public sector, executive, legislative, judicial corruption indices.9
Both indices in their original forms are normalized between 0 and 1, but had been rescaled for
the analysis to run from 0 to 100 for interpretation purposes. In the panel data application, the
indices enter the regressions as deviations from country-speciﬁc means (as country ﬁxed eﬀects are
included, the standardization does not alter the coeﬃcient estimates in any way).

Cross-sectional analysis                                      In order to account for a possible endogeneity of the institutional
variable and the corruption indicator that is not controlled for by country ﬁxed eﬀects in the panel
setting, we estimate long-run growth regressions using only long-term averages and/or initial values
of the variables. The estimation sample consists of 113 countries. The country coverage is lower in
this setting as compared to the panel regressions, because for some countries the time dimension
of the data is not long enough to calculate long-term growth rates. While in the panel setting it is
possible to control for period eﬀects, this cannot be done in this framework, and the data need to
be comparable in order to obtain reliable results. Table A.3 in the Appendix provides an overview

5     Growth Regressions
5.1     Panel Data Analysis
Table 1 presents the elementary speciﬁcation of the growth regressions using panel data and various
extensions, all including country as well as period ﬁxed eﬀects. The ﬁrst column allows human and
physical capital, government expenditures, inﬂation, as well as openness to trade and institutional
quality, measured by the rule of law, to inﬂuence GDP per capita growth rates. The inclusion of
initial GDP per capita controls for convergence within countries, i.e. for convergence to a country-
speciﬁc long-term equilibrium growth rate. The negative coeﬃcient of initial GDP per capita
conﬁrms that classical convergence hypothesis, as increases in income per capita are followed by
lower growth rates of GDP. Higher human capital, investment shares and trade openness, as well
as good macroeconomic management (low inﬂation) and low levels of government expenditures are
increasing medium-term growth rates of GDP per capita. Although the coeﬃcient of institutional
quality cannot be interpreted causally due to a potential endogeneity bias, the estimates suggest a
positive relationship between an improved institutional environment and economic development.
The estimated coeﬃcients are not only statistically signiﬁcant, but also their magnitude shows
non-negligible impacts on economic growth. An increase in the share of upper secondary and
tertiary educated in the labor force by 10%-points is estimated to increase GDP per capita growth
by roughly 0.7%-points. Similarly, based on the results, an increase in the share of investment in
GDP by 10%-points has the potential to raise growth by 1.6%-points.
    In columns (2) and (3), natural resource rents are added to the equation. Neither in the
aggregate form, nor when disaggregated into oil and non-oil resource rents a signiﬁcant impact
can be detected.10 It is likely, that the impact of natural resources is too heterogeneous and/or
depends on additional factors, and only a further reﬁnement can shed light on the role played by
natural resources. As an extension of column (2), Figure 4 presents the estimates of the impact of
natural resources on economic growth when interacted with period dummies. The variation over
time is considerable and might oﬀer an explanation for the insigniﬁcance of the natural resource
variable in the previous columns. There is evidence for a heterogeneous eﬀect over time, and it
appears that during the last decade, natural resource rents had a signiﬁcant (at the 10% level) and
positive impact on economic growth.11
  10 When splitting the natural resource variable further into oil, natural gas, mineral and forest rents (not displayed

in the table), no further insights are gained. While all coeﬃcients but the one for forest rents are positive, none of
them can be distinguished from zero at a statistically signiﬁcant level of conﬁdence.
  11 The exceptionally large eﬀect in the ﬁrst half of the 1970s could be due to the vast increase in oil prices, but

also to a smaller country-coverage in this early period of the sample.

    Another reason for the lack of a clear relationship for natural resources and growth could be
a missing link to institutional quality. For natural resources to improve growth rates, a stable
institutional environment might be a prerequisite that guarantees a fair distribution of revenues
associated with the rents. When allowing for such an interaction in column (4), it appears that on

average, oil rents improve growth rates when institutional quality is held constant, whereas rents
from other natural resources require solid institutions for them to be beneﬁcial. It is important
to note again, that as the endogeneity of the institutional variable is not accounted for, causal
interpretations cannot be made.12
    In the ﬁnal column of Table 1, heterogeneities with respect to the countries’ dependence on oil
are allowed for (see also Raggl, 2014, for a similar setting). Therefore, oil rents are interacted with
dummies indicating the quartile of oil rents in GDP that are calculated using the full sample for
each period. The results in column (5) show, that on all levels of oil dependence, oil rents increase
GDP per capita growth rates on average. However, the magnitude of a 1%-point increase in oil
diﬀers considerably across the four levels of oil dependence, and is highest for countries with low
oil dependence. Nigeria is highly dependent on oil, and is allocated to the fourth quartile in all but
  12 Several attempts to instrument the institution indicators in the panel setting were not fruitful. As common

in the literature, 2SLS estimations are carried out on the cross-sectional, long-term level, that abstracts from the
variation over time in the data (Hall and Jones, 1999; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2001; Sala-i-Martin and
Subramanian, 2003). However, possible endogeneity in the panel framework will not negatively aﬀect the quality of
the out-of-sample predictions in Section 6, if it is safe to assume that the patterns of endogeneity prevail during the
course of the prediction period.

one period, and belongs to the group of countries that exhibit the lowest beneﬁts on average. A
10%-point increase in the share of oil rents in GDP—for Nigeria this would imply an incline from
approximately 16% in GDP in 2010-14 to 26%—is estimated to increase GDP per capita growth
by roughly 0.8-1.5%-points in the third and fourth quartile, respectively. The following paragraph
reviews and discusses results particular for Nigeria in more detail.

A Focus on Nigeria Table 2 displays panel ﬁxed eﬀects estimations that highlight the role of
natural resources and institutional quality in Nigeria. The ﬁrst column suggests that the impact
of natural resources on growth are signiﬁcantly lower in Nigeria than in the rest of the sample.
In fact, increases in natural resource rents appear detrimental to growth in the country. In the
second column, an index for the rule of law as a measure of institutional quality is added, and as
a result, the negative impact of natural resources declines in magnitude for Nigeria (from -0.042
to -0.029). These ﬁndings are in line with Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003), and provide
evidence for a negative relationship between natural resources and institutional quality. When
omitting institutional quality, and natural resources weaken institutions, then the impact of lower
institutional quality is wrongly attributed to natural resources. Controlling for institutions in
column (2) thus increases the coeﬃcient of resources for Nigeria.
    This interdependence between resources and institutions is further conﬁrmed in column (3),
where the addition of another measure of institutional quality, political corruption, leads to a
further (small) increase in the impact of natural resources. The positive impact of corruption in
the full sample has previously been found in the literature, it is summarized as the ”‘greasing
the wheels”’-eﬀect of corruption (Egger and Winner, 2005; Vial and Hanoteau, 2010; Campos,
Dimova, and Saleh, 2010). As in this setting no measures have been undertaken to limit a possible
endogeneity bias, causal interpretations are not justiﬁed, however. In columns (4) and (5) the
corruption variable is interacted with a Sub-Saharan Africa dummy and with a Nigeria dummy,
respectively. Apart from the ﬁnding that corruption is associated with lower growth in Sub-Saharan
Africa, and even more so in Nigeria13 , the eﬀect of natural resources on growth in Nigeria further
increases (column 4) and becomes positive in column (5). This latter ﬁnding suggests, that in
particular in Nigeria, there is a strong connection between natural resources and corruption, and
when controlling for this link, resource rents do no longer harm, but foster economic growth. The
negative impact of natural resources in Nigeria found in the previous speciﬁcations appears to be
driven by the high levels of corruption associated with the country’s resource wealth, and in order
to enable natural resources to be beneﬁcial for growth a stable institutional environment is crucial.
    Distinguishing between the oil and non-oil rents in GDP in column (6) reveals, that both oil
and non-oil resource rents are stimulating economic growth in Nigeria. Although Nigeria is an
  13 The coeﬃcient for Nigeria appears particularly large. However, when interpreting the eﬀect in terms of standard

deviations, the eﬀect is still considerable, but less pronounced. A one standard deviation increase in the corruption
indicator reduces growth by 0.8 standard deviations.

economy highly dependent on oil, after controlling for both institutional quality indicators, oil
rents are contributing to growth in the country.
   The impact of the rule of law indicator does not change when interactions between resources
and Nigeria dummies are included, nor when the corruption variable is added. Although no causal
interpretation can be made in this setting, improvements of institutional quality within countries
are associated with higher GDP per capita growth rates. Columns (5) to (7) of Table 2 allow
for a deviating coeﬃcient of the rule of law measures in Nigeria as compared to the rest of the
sample. The results suggest, that the connection between the rule of law and GDP growth is
particularly relevant in the country, even when an additional measure of institutional quality,
political corruption, is controlled for. Therefore, both dimensions of institutional quality should
thus be addressed in order to smooth the way for sustainable growth, and a growth-enhancing
eﬀect of Nigeria’s natural resources.

Further results     Table A.5 in the Appendix provides additional results related to the growth
determinants in Nigeria. First, the impact of human capital on economic development is stronger
when the level of GDP per capita is comparably small. In other words, the growth-enhancing
eﬀect of educational expansions is higher in developing countries. This result is underlined by
the ﬁndings in column (2), where the eﬀect of education is allowed to diﬀer between Nigeria and
the rest of the sample. It appears, that human capital accumulation is of particular importance
for growth in the country. The variable is measured as the share of people with upper secondary
education or more in the age group 20 to 64. An expansion of secondary and tertiary education is
estimated to be a fruitful strategy to enhance economic progress in the long run.
   Second, a measure of the undervaluation of a currency, as suggested by Rodrik (2008) and
discussed in more detail in the Data section, is included in the speciﬁcations (3) to (5) of Table A.5.
Rodrik (2008) ﬁnds a signiﬁcant and positive relationship between the degree of undervaluation of
a currency and economic growth, and he argues and shows empirically that the impact is especially
high in countries with low incomes per capita.
   When interacting the measure of undervaluation with a Nigeria dummy variable, the eﬀect for
the country is positive and signiﬁcant. If, to a certain extent, the impact of natural resources on
growth is channeled through overvaluations of the real exchange rates (Dutch disease eﬀects), then
an inclusion of a measure of undervaluation should improve the growth impact of natural resources.
In other worlds, if the degree of undervaluation of a currency is held constant, the impact of natural
resources should be more positive (less negative), as the negative eﬀect via the exchange rate is
controlled for. This can be observed for Nigeria. The impact of natural resources on growth turns
positive, once controlled for undervaluation. For oil rents, the impact is still negative (columns
4 and 5), but considerably closer to zero compared to estimations without the undervaluation
measure. This implies that there is evidence for Dutch disease eﬀects in Nigeria, and policies that

are directed towards the prevention of strong currency overvaluation could improve the growth
eﬀects of natural resources. The magnitude of the eﬀect of undervaluation on growth is non-
negligible in Nigeria: an increase in the undervaluation index by 1% is estimated to raise growth
rates by 0.06%-points (all relevant columns 3–5 in Table A.5), that could correspond to an increase
from a 4% to a 4.06% growth rate. Similarly, an increase in the undervaluation index by 10%—not
an unrealistic change given the large ﬂuctuations—could improve GDP per capita growth rates by
0.6%-points. This ﬁnding is robust across diﬀerent speciﬁcations, that include various alternating
measures of natural resources.
    In order to highlight the potential of a less overvalued currency, Figure A.1 in the Appendix
presents the estimated growth impact of a steady improvement of the undervaluation index towards
the values estimated for the mid-1960s between 2010-14 and 2040-44. Nigeria had long periods of
a severely overvalued currency from the 1970s until the early 2000s. Currently, the undervaluation
is no longer negative, the index suggests even a slight undervaluation of the currency. Assuming
that the undervaluation index continuously improves in the future, until by the period 2040-44
it reaches the level of 1965-69 (0.38), GDP per capita growth rates could improve by more than
1%-point on average in the long run.


5.2     Cross-sectional Analysis
The results of the long-term growth analysis that instrument the institutional variable and the
corruption indicator are presented in Table 3. The top panel displays the second stage of the
2SLS estimations, in which the rule of law indicator is instrumented, whereas the bottom panel
displays the results for the corruption variable14 . The ﬁrst two columns refer to OLS results,
and columns (3) to (7) to 2SLS results. In the ﬁrst speciﬁcation (column 1), the institutional
variables are omitted, and natural resource rents are not signiﬁcant in the growth regressions.
Controlling for the rule of law and the corruption index, respectively, results in a positive and
signiﬁcant coeﬃcient of the resource variable. This ﬁnding is in line with the results of the panel
analysis, and suggests a link between natural resources and institutional quality. Natural resources
are associated with lower institutional quality, and that negatively aﬀects growth rates. As soon
as institutions are held constant, the impact of natural resources turns positive and signiﬁcant.
Instrumenting the rule of law and corruption does not change the signiﬁcance nor the sign of
the variables. If anything, their impact becomes more pronounced. This result holds for various
model speciﬁcations, the inclusion of variables related to macroeconomic management, a currency
undervaluation index, life expectancy and geographical characteristics. Further conﬁrming the
panel data results, the coeﬃcient of the oil rents for highly oil-dependent countries (oil rents >
median) is lower as compared to the coeﬃcient for low oil-dependence.
  14 Due to the high collinearity and the increased standard errors resulting from the 2SLS estimation, both indicators

are treated in two separate regressions.

6     Predictions
In-sample ﬁt The in-sample predictions of the growth rates of Nigeria based on the diﬀerent
speciﬁcations in Tables 2 and A.5 are graphically represented in Figures A.2 and A.3 in the Ap-
pendix. Relying on this graphical analysis, speciﬁcations (5) to (7) in Table 2 provide the best
in-sample ﬁt of Nigeria’s growth rates. This seems to be mainly driven by the prediction of the
spike in growth in the period 2000-200415 . Speciﬁcation (7) is chosen to serve as the base for
the out-of-sample growth predictions, because it contains the ﬁnest decomposition of the natural
resource variable.

General assumptions           GDP per capita growth rates are predicted for six ﬁve-year periods
starting in 2015-19, such that the last prediction period is 2040-44. The high degree of uncertainty
about the future development of covariates such as investment, trade or government expenditures,
is accommodated by the deﬁnition of diﬀerent scenarios. Common to all scenarios is the assumption
that the ﬁxed eﬀect of Nigeria is moderately improving over time.16 Figure A.4 in the Appendix
shows the magnitude of the ﬁxed eﬀects of all countries in the sample. Fixed eﬀects can be
understood as country-speciﬁc deviations from the overall constant of the regression. Nigeria’s
ﬁxed eﬀect is strikingly low, and among all the countries in the sample, only three countries have
lower ﬁxed eﬀects, among them Liberia as another Sub-Saharan African country. Assumptions
concerning changes of ﬁxed eﬀects over time reﬂect beliefs about the development of countries
relative to each other. In other words, if income convergence is assumed, ﬁxed eﬀects are modeled
to converge to each other. We assume, that Nigeria’s ﬁxed eﬀect will increase to -3 until 2050,
which is a level that is close to Burkina Faso (-3.7), the Senegal (-3.2), Indonesia (-2.9) or Cote
d’Ivoire (-2.4) in the current estimation.
    In addition, in each scenario GDP per capita is updated, i.e. the GDP per capita growth rate
in (t − 1) is used in combination with the level of GDP per capita in (t − 1) to calculate GDP per
capita in period t. The future development of the remaining covariates diﬀers across scenarios,
and the underlying assumptions are explained in detail below.

Scenario 0:      This baseline scenario is rather pessimistic, and assumes that oil rents in GDP
remain at the low level that is predicted for 2015-19 until the end of the prediction period, 2040-
44. Expected oil rents for 2015-19 are based on the World Bank’s Commodity Price Forecasts for
  15 The high average growth rate in this period comes from a growth rate of close to 30% in 2004, as reported in

the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, but also by the United Nations (oﬃcial data) and by the National
Bureau of Statistics in Nigeria.

    The resulting forecasts of GDP per capita growth rates are graphically displayed in Figure 5.17
The dotted line corresponds to Scenario 0. Under this scenario, growth rates are projected to rise
only moderately as compared to the current levels. Low oil prices, which are assumed to remain
at the low level over the next decades, and stagnating human capital stocks, investment, and
institutional quality keep growth prospects below 3% until 2040-44. The top left graph in Figure
A.7 in the Appendix shows the contributions of the main explanatory variables to the growth
predictions in Scenario 0, and to what extent they compensate for the signiﬁcantly negative ﬁxed
eﬀect of Nigeria. Inherent to the underlying assumptions is that the contributions remain constant
over time, and the variation in the expected growth rate results from income convergence alone.
The factors that contribute most to Nigeria’s growth rates are human and physical capital, oil and
non-oil natural resource rents, institutional quality, and corruption.18

Scenario 1:       That scenario diﬀers from the baseline scenario with respect to the underlying
expected oil rents in GDP. The future development of oil rents is tied to the oil price forecasts
of the World Bank’s Commodity Price Forecasts (see Figure A.5 in the Appendix). All other
covariates remain at their 2010-14 level as displayed in Table 4, including the non-oil natural
resource rents.
  17 Growth rates used in the regressions as well as for the predictions are growth rates of per capita GDP, that

correspond to yearly averages over ﬁve-year periods. With an annual population growth of roughly 2.7%, GDP
growth rates are considerably higher.
  18 It might seem puzzling that the institutional environment in Nigeria positively contributes to growth. This

ﬁnding is explained by the construction of the underlying indices: they are measured as deviations from country-
speciﬁc means. As Nigeria’s institutional quality as well as corruption levels improved since the 1980s and 1990s,
the current deviation from the mean is positive (negative) for the rule of law (corruption) index. If this improvement
did not happen, growth rates were predicted to be considerably lower.

       Projected growth rates of GDP per capita based on this scenario are moderately higher than in
Scenario 0, and by 2040-44, they are expected to be close to 4%. The better part of the diﬀerence
between Scenarios 0 and 1 is materialized not before the end of the prediction period, however.
The top left graph in Figure 6 shows that inclining oil rents in GDP drive the diﬀerence to the
baseline projections. The expected recovery of the oil prices gradually raises the growth prospects
of the country, assuming that other factors remain constant. Most importantly, this improvement
can only be materialized, if institutional quality and corruption are not worsening simultaneously.
This scenario certainly suggests that recovering oil prices alone are not suﬃcient for noteworthy
and sustainable improvements of GDP per capita growth rates.

Scenario 2: Growth predictions based on Scenario 2 are more optimistic, and the underlying
assumptions can be found in Table 5. The share of upper secondary and tertiary educated indi-
viduals in the working age population follows the medium scenario of the IIASA/VID Education

projections (Lutz and Butz, 2014). Government consumption is assumed to fall by 5.6% per period,
as during 2000-14, investment is assumed to increase by 10% per period such that it reaches a share
of 26.7% by 2040-44. The openness index is expected to gradually improve back to the level of
1990-2000, and inﬂation is assumed to remain at a comparable high level of 26.6. The projections
of oil rents in GDP follow the oil price forecasts of the World Bank’s Commodity Price Forecasts
as in Scenario 1, but in this scenario also non-oil resource rents develop in line with the respective
price forecasts. This implies a further decline in 2015-19, and a gradual increase to present values
until 2040-44, and altogether this is less favorable for the country than a continuation of the current
trend, but at the same time a more realistic assumption. The rule of law and corruption indicators
remain at the 2010-14 level.

   Growth forecasts under these assumptions are signiﬁcantly revised upwards as compared to
Scenarios 0 and 1, and are projected to cross the 5% threshold in 2030. Particular to this scenario
is that as opposed to the ﬁrst two scenarios, the contributing factors can—at least to a certain
degree—be inﬂuenced by policies. The top right graph in Figure 6 displays how the contribution
of various factors to GDP per capita growth diﬀers between Scenarios 1 and 2. In particular the
inﬂuence of human and physical capital accumulation is striking. Also the assumed slight reduction
in government consumption and the gradual improvement of the openness measure contribute
positively to growth. Merely the tying of non-oil natural resource rents to commodity price forecasts
causes a lower contribution of that factor to growth. This latter assumption, however, is important,
and more realistic than the presumption of constant non-oil natural resource rents in the upcoming
decades.

Scenario 3: This scenario diﬀers from Scenario 2 with respect to the adopted institutional char-
acteristics. While in Scenario 2, the rule of law and corruption were assumed to remain constant
at the current levels, Scenario 3 shows predicted growth rates that could be materialized given

   Corresponding growth projections further improve, and highlight the potential inherent to
enhancements of the quality of institutions and a reduction in corruption.

Summary      For the projections of Nigeria’s GDP per capita growth rates, we rely on the panel
growth regression results presented in column (7) Table 2, as this speciﬁcation exhibits the best
in-sample ﬁt and at the same time contains decomposed natural resource variables. Predicted
growth rates are yearly growth rates of per capita GDP, and correspond to a time window of ﬁve
years. In order to accommodate the high degree of uncertainty concerning the future developments
of the explanatory variables, four diﬀerent scenarios are deﬁned. Table 6 summarizes the predicted
growth rates between the 2015-19 and 2040-44 for the four scenarios, and below the key implications
are highlighted.

   1. Scenario 0 eﬀectively simulates an extrapolation of the status-quo in combination with
      continuously low oil prices. Predicted GDP per capita growth rates increase moderately over
      time due to income convergence, but reach merely 3% by 2040-44.


   2. In Scenario 1, expected oil rents in GDP follow the path of oil price projections, which
      suggest a moderate recovery after the sharp drop between 2015 and 2019. Growth rates are
      predicted to improve as compared to the baseline scenario, but a rise above 4% appears not
      to be feasible until 2040-44. Based on the forecasts, a recovery of oil prices alone is not
      suﬃcient for obtaining sustainable growth rates of per capita GDP above 4%, even if they
      are not accompanied by a reduction in the quality of institutions.


   3. Growth predictions based on Scenario 2 exceed 5% from the period 2030-34 onwards. The
      underlying assumptions are moderate improvements of human and physical capital accumu-
      lation, an increasing openness of the economy, a reduction of government consumption, as
      well as non-oil natural resource rents that follow commodity price forecasts. The largest


                                                    23
      contribution to the predicted growth rates come from education and investment, both areas
      that can be tackled by economic policy.


    4. An additional improvement of the institutional quality, measured by indices of the rule of law
      and corruption, leads to a further rise in growth prospects by up to 1%-point in Scenario
      3. Addressing present shortcomings in the transparency and enforceability of law and the
      access of civilians to justice and secure property rights, as well as delimiting corruption on
      all levels, appear to be fruitful strategies for enhancing Nigeria’s growth prospects.


7     Conclusions
In this empirical assessment, the determinants of GDP per capita growth are studied using data of
approximately 150 developing and developed countries during 1970 and 2014, focusing in particular
on the role of natural resources, their interactions with institutional quality, and speciﬁc impacts
in the country of Nigeria. Blessed by an enormous wealth of natural resources but at the same
time aﬄicted by stagnating GDP growth rates, Nigeria is a prominent example of an economy that
lacks economic development in spite of its resource-abundance. Based on the econometric results,
Nigeria’s growth prospects are assessed under the assumption of diﬀerent scenarios.
    Relying on the global sample, the empirical ﬁndings suggest that a sound institutional environ-
ment, measured by an index of the rule of law, is associated with higher GDP per capita growth
rates. In addition, the impact of natural resources on GDP per capita growth turns positive,
once natural resources are interacted with the rule of law. The eﬀect of natural resources thus
depends on the quality of institutions, and resources can be a blessing in countries with transpar-
ent and enforceable law, secure property rights, as well equality before the law of all citizens, and
their freedom of movement and religion. The estimates further suggest that the growth impact of
natural resources diﬀers by the level of resource-dependence of the countries. Countries that are
highly dependent on resources obtain lower growth-returns than countries that have comparably
low shares of resource rents in GDP.
    Shifting the focus to Nigeria reveals that improvements of institutional quality—measured by
the rule of law as well as by a corruption index—have a particular beneﬁcial eﬀect on growth rates
of the country. In particular a reduction of corruption not only has a direct inﬂuence on economic
growth, but also an indirect one through the improvement of the growth-enhancing potential of
natural resources. If the level of corruption is held constant, higher natural resource rents are
estimated to increase Nigeria’s growth rates. When omitting the corruption variable, the impact
of natural resources appears to be detrimental to the growth of the economy. This suggests a
strong link between resource endowments and the quality of institutions in the country, and a
stabilization of the institutional environment at an improved level should be of high priority.


                                                 24
   An additional important result is found with respect to the over-/undervaluation of Nigeria’s
currency. Undervaluation is positively linked to GDP growth, and the long periods of overvaluation
signiﬁcantly reduced the country’s growth rates. Similar to institutional quality, there is an addi-
tional indirect eﬀect of that factor: when holding the degree of overvaluation constant, the impact
of natural resources on growth increases. Such ﬁndings are in line with Dutch-disease eﬀects, and
managing the country’s real exchange rate can not only positively contribute to growth directly,
but also indirectly by improving the growth-eﬀect of resources.
   As especially the institutional variables are prone to endogeneity biases, similar growth regres-
sions have been estimated using instrumental variable estimators at the cross-sectional level. The
positive and negative growth impacts of the rule of law and corruption, respectively, are conﬁrmed
when using instrumental variables suggested in the literature.
   The results of the panel regressions are then used to assess Nigeria’s future growth potential
based on diﬀerent scenarios of the covariates. The stabilization of oil prices at a higher level
than currently observed seems not suﬃcient for sustainable growth rates in the country. A steady
accumulation of human as well as physical capital are the main ingredients for reaching an estimated
GDP per capita growth rate of 5%, and a slight improvement of the institutional quality indicators
is estimated to add another percentage point.
