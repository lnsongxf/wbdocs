SUMMARY REPORT
     Acknowledgements


     The South West Indian Ocean Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (SWIO-
     RAFI) is a joint initiative between the World Bank Group(WBG), the Indian Ocean
     Commission (IOC), and the five participating Island States of the Comoros,
     Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and the Archipelago of Zanzibar—a semi-auton-
     omous Region of Tanzania.

     The SWIO-RAFI was implemented by a WBG led by Doekle Wielinga and Alanna
     Simpson and Julie Dana, with support from Emily White, Emma Philips, Liana
     Razafindrazay, Luis Corrales, Richard Murnane, Richard Poulter, Samantha Cook,
     Simone Balog, Stuart Fraser and Vivien Deparday, with technical inputs from AIR
     Worldwide.

     The technical materials used in this summary report were produced by a team from
     AIR Worldwide, led by Aaron Michel.

     The report greatly benefited from data, information and other invaluable contribu-
     tions made available by the participating Island States, United Nations International
     Secretariat for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), other development partners and pri-
     vate sector partners.

     We would like to thank the financial support from the European Union (EU) in the
     framework of the Africa Caribbean Pacific (ACP)-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction
     (NDRR) Program,1 as well as the ACP-EU Africa Disaster Risk Financing (ADRF)
     Initiative2, both managed by GFDRR. In the GFDRR secretariat, the team we would
     like to particularly thank Luis Tineo, Manuela Chiapparino, Henriette Mampuya and
     Rossella Della Monica who all contributed to the success of the project in terms of
     liaising with the ACP Secretariat and the EU.

     The team greatly appreciates the support and guidance received throughout the
     project from Mark Lundell, Sameh Wahba, Bernice van Bronkhorst, Olivier Mahul,
     and Christoph Pusch.

VI   SOUTH WEST INDIAN OCEAN RISK ASSESSMENT AND FINANCING INITIATIVE (SWIO-RAFI)
Executive Summary


The South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) Island States are highly exposed to adverse natural events. On average, 13
tropical cyclones with wind speeds exceeding 63 km/h form in the SWIO basin every year. The tropical cyclones
that form in this area can affect the SWIO Island States, resulting in affected population and financial losses,
caused by high winds, flooding and storm surges. These countries are also exposed to flooding from non-tropical
cyclone induced precipitation (e.g. monsoons), earthquakes, tsunamis, and other hazards such as drought, volca-
nic activity, and landslides. As a result, SWIO Island States face high levels of physical and financial risk exposure.

The review of historical catastrophic events in the SWIO region3 revealed that during the 50-year period of 1964–
2014, the Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and the Seychelles experienced a total of 100 significant adverse nat-
ural events4 of which 94 were related to hydro-meteorological phenomena (75 storms; 11 floods; and 8 drought
events). This figure does not include low-intensity, high frequency hydro-meteorological events that, with increas-
ing frequency, affect the SWIO Island States. The death toll of weather-related disasters during the period was
2,896 people (or 99.8 percent of all lives lost to major natural disasters including earthquakes and other natural
hazards), and the affected population was estimated at 14.4 million. In addition, physical damages resulting from
weather-related events were estimated at USD 3.1 billion.

The Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) requested technical and financial support from the WBG and other interna-
tional development organizations for its efforts to improve the understanding of the region’s disaster risks, as input
for the future implementation of disaster risk financing mechanisms. A key expected outcome of the IOC request
was the preparation of countries’ disaster risk profiles for tropical cyclone, flood triggered by non-tropical cyclone
rainfall, and earthquake hazards; as well as an initial evaluation of their potential fiscal and financial impacts under
different scenarios of frequency, intensity, and magnitude.

In response to the IOC’s request, and informed by the successful implementation of the similar initiatives in the
Caribbean and the Pacific regions (i.e. CCRIF; and PCRAFI, respectively), the WBG engaged in the implementa-
tion of the South West Indian Ocean Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (SWIO-RAFI). The main
goal of SWIO-RAFI was to provide a solid basis for, and to promote the implementation of cost-effective disaster
risk financing mechanisms that incorporate an improved understanding of the SWIO Island States’ risk profiles,
potential contingent liabilities, and their fiscal situations.

Ongoing disaster risk reduction and resilience building dialogues with the IOC were informed by the outcomes
of the SWIO-RAFI initiative and lessons-learned from the CCRIF and PCRAFI. Working with the regional organiza-
tion, and SWIO governments, this report seeks to substantially contribute to the dialogue and build an improved
understanding of regional and national disaster risks, through providing technical underpinnings to the findings
and recommendations, as presented in this summary report.

   in the EM-DAT database as having affected the Republic of Tanzania. The information, however, is not disaggregated to the subnational level
   as to determine whether or not the archipelago of Zanzibar was also affected by any of these events.

       Key Findings

       The main findings of the risk analysis for each participating SWIO Island State are presented below. Additional in-
       formation on country-specific disaster risk assessments is presented in Chapter 3. The risk analysis revealed that
       tropical cyclones and extreme non-tropical cyclone rainfall are the main drivers of disaster risk in the participating
       SWIO Island States.

       The increasing trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather related events across the entire SWIO re-
       gion, and the exacerbating effects of climate variability and change, pose additional challenges to the financial
       and fiscal sustainability of the region’s governments. These governments are confronted with increasing contin-
       gent liabilities resulting from the potential materialization of external shocks, particularly those triggered by weath-
       er and climate related hazards. The risk analysis provides the technical underpinnings for developing a regional
       framework for natural disaster risk financing, as well as comprehensive national disaster risk financing and insur-
       ance strategies that can help protect the countries’ development and social gains.


       SWIO Island States Risk Profiles

       The risk profiles presented in Chapter 3 identified Tropical Cyclone wind as the most impactful hazard in the
       region, particularly for Comoros, Madagascar, and Zanzibar, while earthquake shaking was found to have less
       loss-causing potential for all countries. The risk profiles provide detailed information of the risks that each Island
       State faces, but also give an indication of the frequency of events and the associated economic and fiscal losses.
       The Average Annual Loss (AAL) represents the broadest measure of risk in each country. The combined AAL for
       the ground-up losses are estimated at 225.8 Million USD, while there is a 2% chance that the region will face di-
       saster losses up to 1.4 billion USD.

Comoros

In Comoros the risk analysis indicates that, on average, TC and NTC flooding contribute similarly to the financial
risk, with an AAL of US 5.7 Million USD. However, infrequent (i.e., higher return period) TC events are expect-
ed to generate significantly higher losses than similarly infrequent non-tropical cyclone floods. Both TC and NTC
have larger impacts than EQ, which is consistent with historical observations in Comoros and the SWIO region
in general.

Madagascar

In Madagascar the risk analysis indicates that TC losses are both more frequent and more severe than losses due
to NTC flooding or EQ. The AAL is estimated at 101.9 Million USD. Both TC and NTC have larger impacts than
EQ, which is consistent with historical observations in Madagascar and the SWIO region in general. Exposure to
normalized losses in Madagascar are lower than many of the other SWIO Island States due to the large size of the
island and geographically diverse exposure, which, contrasting with smaller islands, is unlikely to be impacted in
its entirety by a single event.

Mauritius

In Mauritius the risk analysis indicates that TC losses are both more frequent and more severe than losses due to
NTC flooding or EQ, the estimated AAL of 113.2 Million is substantial. Both TC and NTC have larger impacts than
EQ, which is consistent with historical observations on the main island of Mauritius, Rodrigues, and the SWIO re-
gion in general. Particularly for TC, the exposure normalized losses in Mauritius tend to be higher than many of
the other SWIO Island States due to relatively concentrated exposure, which can be impacted in its entirety by a
single event.

    Seychelles

    In Seychelles the risk analysis indicates that NTC flooding losses are both more frequent and more severe than
    losses due to TC or EQ, which is consistent with historical observations in Seychelles, leading to an AAL of 2.8
    Million USD. Exposure normalized losses in Seychelles are lower than many of the other SWIO Island States due
    to low probability of significant loss from any peril and the geographically diverse exposure, which is unlikely to be
    impacted in its entirety by any single event.

    Zanzibar

    In Zanzibar, the risk analysis indicates that NTC flooding losses are both more frequent and more severe than loss-
    es due to TC and EQ, the AAL is estimated to be 2.2 Million USD. Infrequent (i.e. higher return period) TC and EQ
    events have the potential to generate significant losses in Zanzibar, but these events are considered rare.


    Country-Level Dialogue, Demand, and the Current State of Risk Financing

    At the inception of the SWIO-RAFI Risk Financing project, dialogue related to risk financing was initiated, two
    countries, Madagascar and Comoros, expressed interest in technical assistance in this area, specifically in the area
    of gaining a better understanding of current sources of financing for disaster losses.

    In Madagascar, an initial review of impacts on the budget from TC Chezda was undertaken; two cyclones and
    extensive flooding caused considerable damages and losses. It is estimated that the government faced over
    USD8 million in fiscal revenue losses, while public spending increased by almost USD14 million and an interim re-
    port was produced which can be used as input to future work. It was also found that the financial capacity of the
    Government of Madagascar (GoM) to deal with the impacts of disasters remains weak, and relies heavily on finan-
    cial support from international partners as well as on budget reallocation.


    The Status of Risk Pooling in the Region

    The principle of risk pooling is used frequently in the management of catastrophe risks, and over the past decade
    it has been used to establish sovereign catastrophe risk pools, including the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Financing
    Facility, the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Financing Facility, and the African Risk Capacity.

    In 2014, African Risk Capacity established ARC Insurance Company Limited (ARC Ltd) to manage the risk taken
    on through underwriting a pool of weather and other disaster risks for the region. Currently seven African coun-
    tries purchased drought insurance cover from ARC Ltd. During the 2015-2016 ARC formally launched its tropical
    cyclone product targeting Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius and Comoros.

    The significant investment made by member countries and donors to establish ARC, combined with the invest-
    ment ARC made to extend its product range to include cyclone coverage, have created a path to risk pool mem-
    bership for SWIO Island States.

    During the implementation of the SWIO RAFI the WBG established the Africa-wide ADRF Initiative, which is work-
    ing in parallel on the issues of risk information, financing and insurance. To increase efficiency the SWIO RAFI
    project activities have been integrated into the ADRF Initiative, which can support specific requests for technical
    assistance to e.g.: (i) support the development of risk financing strategies at regional, national and local levels to
    help countries make informed decisions; (ii) improve post disaster financial response capacities and mitigate the
    socio-economic, fiscal and financial impacts of disasters in countries; and (iii) enhance data sharing and data col-
    lection efforts at national and sub-national levels.

General Recommendations on Risk Financing

Many governments around the world are adopting a strategic approach to risk financing that uses a range
of pre-planned, pre-negotiated financial instruments that can help address varied needs and face different
hazards. Options available to governments include: (i) contingency/reserve funds to finance relief, rehabilitation,
reconstruction and prevention activities for national emergencies (ii) contingent loans, and; (iii) market-based risk
transfer solutions.

Combining instruments enables governments to take into account the evolving needs for funds.

      SWIO-Specific Recommendations to Strengthen Risk Financing

      SWIO governments face critical challenges for financial resilience to natural disasters. Most SWIO Island States
      have restricted options for securing immediate liquidity and are constrained by their size, borrowing capacity, and
      limited access to international insurance markets. To strengthen fiscal policy, and for the ability to better respond
      to needs in the event of a disaster, the following recommendations might be considered by SWIO countries, build-
      ing on the risk modelling work undertaken as part of this project:

      •	    Evaluate feasibility of establishing contingency/reserve funds;
      •	    Consider using contingent loans to help strengthen the government’s capacity for disaster risk management
            and improve access to liquidity following a shock;
      •	    Participate in knowledge sharing and global dialogue on lessons learned from existing sovereign risk pools,
            including the African Risk Capacity;
      •	    Invest in building insurance markets;
      •	    Integrate capacity building on risk financing into work undertaken by Ministries of Finance on related topics,
            such as debt management, public financial management, management of contingent liabilities.

      Specifically, for Madagascar, where the dialogue in risk financing is more advanced than other SWIO Island States,
      the areas for potential collaboration are: (i) operationalizing the National Contingency Fund;(ii) establishment of a
      specific budget line for disaster response; (iii) strengthening the understanding of insurance coverage through the
      regional risk pool; (iv) identify gaps in the current financing framework and suggest financial solutions.

The population of Comoros in 2015 was approximately
790,000. The most populous island is Grande Comore.                                                                                    Infrastructure

The risk modeling suggests that, on average, Comoros experiences nearly USD5.7 million in combined direct
losses from earthquakes, floods and tropical cyclones each year. According to the risk profile, the residential sec-

nearly 6 percent.

     For example, results suggest that a 100-year return
     period tropical cyclone event could produce direct
     losses of USD43 million, equivalent to 75 of the 2014
     GDP, and require approximately USD9.9 million in
     emergency costs.


     The highest losses take place in Anjouan, which ex-
     periences nearly 80% of the AAL for the three perils
     combined, In addition to the direct losses, an annu-
     al average of nearly USD1.3 million is estimated for
     emergency costs.

     It is important to note that an important risk on Grand
     Comore, the Khartala volcano, was not included in this
     analysis.

     Exposure to normalized losses in Madagascar are low-

     the large size of the island and geographically diverse

Tropical cyclones are by far the most significant risk,                    floods. Table 3.3 summarizes the annual probability of
causing approximately 80 percent of the average an-                        exceeding the ground-up losses generated by each
nual loss per year. Flooding is the next largest risk, ac-                 modeled peril and for all modeled perils combined,

     rect losses of USD1.9 billion, equivalent to 16 percent
     of the 2015 GDP, and require approximately USD430
     million in emergency costs.

     Particularly for tropical cyclones, the exposure normal-
     ized losses in Mauritius tend to be higher than many of
     the other SWIO Island States due to relatively concen-
     trated exposure, which can be impacted in its entirety
     by a single event.


     The highest losses take place on the Main Island, which
     experiences nearly 90% of the AAL for the three per-
     ils combined, with the remaining losses occurring on
     Rodrigues. In addition to the direct losses, an annual
     average of nearly USD26 million is estimated for emer-
     gency costs.

percent of the total replacement value.

Seychelles experiences on average over USD2.8 million in combined direct losses from earthquakes, floods and
tropical cyclones each year. According to the risk profile the residential sector experiences 52 percent of the com-
bined losses and the commercial sector 35 percent.

     losses of USD16 million, equivalent to 1 percent of the
     2015 GDP, and require approximately USD4.3 million
     in emergency costs.

     Exposure normalized losses in Seychelles are lower
     than many of the other SWIO Island States due to low
     probability of significant loss from any peril and the
     geographically diverse exposure, which is unlikely to
     be impacted in its entirety by any single event.


     The highest losses take place on Mahé Island, which
     experiences nearly 75 percent of the AAL for the three
     perils combined, with the remaining losses occurring
     on the other two Inner Islands. In addition to the direct
     losses, an annual average of nearly USD640,000 is es-
     timated for emergency costs.

     Note that the exposure data were not collected for the
     Outer Islands and are not included in the Risk profile.

The residential sector accounts for 74 percent of the total replacement value, followed the commercial sector with
11 percent. In terms of construction type, buildings with masonry and concrete walls account for nearly 70 percent
of the total replacement value.

Zanzibar on average over USD2.2 million in combined direct losses from earthquakes, floods and tropical cyclones
each year. According to the risk profile the residential sector experiences nearly 87 percent of the combined loss-
es and the commercial sector nearly 11 percent.

     In terms of absolute amount and amount relative to
     the value of local assets, the highest loss takes place
     in the Kusini-Pemba region. Of the country’s two main
     Islands, Zanzibar Island has slightly higher absolute
     flood losses than Pemba Island, but Pemba Island has
     higher losses relative to local assets. In addition to the
     direct losses, an annual average of nearly USD500,000
     is estimated for emergency costs.

     BOX 4.1.  On Pre-Requisites for Regional Risk Pools

          Significant strides have been made over the past decade on disaster risk financing and risk pooling. Support from bilateral
          donors, multilateral development banks, and regional organizations has led to the creation of a number of regional sover-
          eign-level risk pooling mechanisms, including the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Financing Facility, the Pacific Catastrophe
          Risk Financing Facility, and the African Risk Capacity. Lessons learned from those experiences have indicated that there are
          a number of key pre-requisites, including:
           •	 Confirmed, well-documented demand from member countries
           •	 Political coherence and institutional leadership among groups of countries
           •	 Investment in risk assessment and risk modelling for participating countries
           •	 Investment in preparation, negotiation, and implementation, estimated to take 3-5 years and require an investment of
              USD5-15 million.
           •	 Proof-of-concept ability to transfer risk to capital markets
           •	 Implementation support and/or complementary technical assistance from impartial third party

       The range of instruments offered by the World Bank Group to help countries strengthen financial resilience to disasters has
       evolved over the past 15 years in response to client demand. Instruments can be arranged prior to a natural disaster, or after
       a shock. They include:

       Ex ante Instruments (planned, negotiated, and put in place prior to a natural disaster shock)

       •	   Investment Project Financing can be used to strengthen the capacity of country systems to respond to crisis and
            invest in resilience.

       •	   A contingent loan for natural disasters, the Development Policy Loan with Catastrophe Deferred Draw-Down
            Option (CAT-DDO) allows countries eligible to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-
            ment (IBRD) to secure immediate access to budget support of up to USD 500 million, or 0.25 percent of GDP (whichever
            is lower) following declaration of a national emergency. Since the introduction of the instrument in 2008, CAT-DDOs
            have been used in 13 countries for an aggregate amount of USD2.3 billion. These loans also provide a platform for
            policy reform which has proven to be a key driver to strengthen national risk management capacity. Under IDA-18, the
            CAT-DDO will be adapted to also address pandemic risks and be made available to low income countries.

       •	   A Contingent Emergency Response Component is a contingent component built into IDA projects which allow for
            pre-agreed process of allocating undisbursed resources to emergency response in the event of a shock.

       •	   The Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM) provides rapid access to undisbursed IDA resources to address immedi-
            ate post-crisis financing needs. It allows a country to access undisbursed IDA balances to address immediate post-crisis
            financing needs. The IRM has been used to respond to natural disasters. Once specific prior actions are met, the IRM
            provides for pooling of uncommitted resources across projects to allow IDA countries to make use of USD5 million or 5
            percent of undisbursed funds soon after an emergency.

       •	   The Bank has arranged a number of innovative, market-based risk transfer solutions that provide levels of protec-
            tion depending on the type, frequency, and severity of the event. Weather hedges—based on an underlying weath-
            er index—transfer the risk to the financial markets. Payments are triggered by adverse weather events according to
            pre-specified conditions (e.g. levels of rainfall, seasonal temperatures, etc.). The Bank offers intermediation services for
            index-based weather derivatives to both middle and low income countries. Catastrophe bonds transfer the risk of a
            natural disaster to investors by allowing the issuer to not repay the bond principal if a major natural disaster occurs. The
            MultiCat Program—a bond issuance platform developed by the Bank—transfers diversified risk to private investors.
            Through its work on intermediating cat risk transfer transactions for member countries, the Bank has helped member
            countries transfer more than USD1.5 billion of risk to the private markets.

       Ex post Instruments (planned, negotiated, and put in place after a natural disaster shock)

       •	   IDA’s Crisis Response Window – is an effective tool for countries to mount emergency responses, as well as build long-
            term resilience and crisis management capacity in a systematic way.

       •	   Emergency Response Loans – can be used to provide immediate relief following an event. Examples include USD200
            million Nepal Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Project and the USD80 million Malawi Emergency Recovery Project.

       •	   Budget support through Development Policy Operations can provide fiscal adjustment after a crisis, much need-
            ed countercyclical financing, and policy advice to help countries protect public investment and services and build
            targeted social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable.
