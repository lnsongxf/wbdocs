EMPLOYER SURVEY
   SNAPSHOT—2016
This snapshot was prepared by a team comprising Maria Laura Sanchez Puerta, Alexandria Valerio, Margo
Hoftijzer, Anam Rizvi and Johanna Avato. The team appreciates the leadership and technical support pro-
vided by Luis Benveniste, David Robalino and Mary Hallward-Driemeier. Helpful peer review comments were
received from Halil Dundar, Johannes Koettl and Michael Weber.

World Bank regional teams were led by Meskerem Mulatu (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia), Johannes Koettl
and Indhira Santos (Macedonia), Halil Dundar (Sri Lanka), and Xiaoyan Liang (Yunnan Province, China).

The program received technical support from Emanuela DiGropello, John Earle, David Margolis and Gaelle
Pierre. Financial support to implement the STEP skills measurement surveys was received from the Multi
Donor Trust Fund for Labor Markets, Job Creation and Economic Growth (MDTF).

1.	 The question asks the employers to rank a               The variable for how important or problematic the
    defined set of skills as “most important,” “sec-        various labor constraints are to business operations
    ond most important,” and so on; for example,            and growth is calculated similarly.
    for job-related skills this goes on until “fifth most
    important.” At least one or more skills from the        Regular Use of Skills
    list are not selected by employers.                     The variable of the number of regularly used skills is
                                                            computed as follows:
2.	 For each skill, the weighted percentage shares
    of how important it was rated to be is listed.          1.	 The employer is asked if the job of the respec-
                                                                tive Type A and B worker regularly involves a set
3.	 Each share is then “weighted” as follows: 0 for
                                                                of seven skills.
    (all) skills not mentioned; the highest number
    for the “most important” category (5 in the case        2.	 Each firm is assigned a value from 0 to 7 depend-
    of most important job-related skill); the second            ing on the number of skills that the workers reg-
    highest number for the “second most impor-                  ularly use, which results in two variables; that

                                                                Type B workers.
4.	 The index results from the sum of the weighted
    shares for each skill.
