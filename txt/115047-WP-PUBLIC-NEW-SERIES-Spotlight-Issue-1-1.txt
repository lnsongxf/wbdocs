﻿L  How can solar powered products provide electricity at night. when
there isn't any sunshine? The secret is the batteries. Batteri es can
store the electricity made during the day so you can use it whenever
you want. Here are sorne other solar facts that are interesting to
know:
HERE'S ANo*rHER
AAWI/N6 FACT: REMOVIN&
SALT FROM SEA WATER IS ONE
OF THE o4aisT COMMERCIAL
USES OF SOLAR ENER&Y.
It takes less than 9 minutes for sunlight to travel the
150 million kilometres between the sun and the earth.
in one hour, the sun provides Earth with more energy
than the entire world uses in a year. In 20 days the sun
could provide as much power as all of the worlds
fossil fuels combined.
Food can be cooked or dried and water can be
disinfected using solar energy. In fact, when you hang
your washing in the sun. you are using solar energy to
dry your clothes,
Using solar powered products causes no pollution or
harmful environmental effects.

﻿MORE REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE
PORTABLE SOLAR POWER
*Portable solar products let you study at night for an improved education.
*Solar energy gives you the power to choose your own working hours.
Many solar products can charge cell phones.
*There's no need to buy fuel or batteries as the light charges off the sun, which is free.
*Portable solar products are safer than other lighting solutions because they do not
negatively affect your health.
IT
TIPS FOR USING YOUR PORTABLE
SOLAR PRODUCT
* To make the most out of your portable solar product, you need to leave the solar panel in
direct sunlight, storing the battery and light safely.
* Move your solar panel out of shady areas to ensure it gets the maximum charge.
* If the solar panel is dirty, wipe it clean with a soft cloth, to ensure it absorbs more energy.
