    GFDRR has also been successful at improving the enabling environment for DRM through policy dialogue and

    and an explicit objective to mainstream DRR seem to be enabling factors for influence.

    What evidence exists that GFDRR is achieving progress against the intended impact on
    the resilience of people to natural disasters?

    Limited evidence was found of impacts achieved at-scale as of early 2015. The relatively young age of GFDRR’s
    portfolio and the time often required to reach impact are contributing factors to this conclusion. Some activities
    show potential to achieve impacts—particularly those linked to larger World Bank investment operations or broad-
    er government initiatives, which can strengthen the potential for downstream results and sustainability. Activities
    like one-time training events or conference attendance support appear less likely to achieve impact.
