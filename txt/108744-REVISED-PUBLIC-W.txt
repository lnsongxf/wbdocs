                         This paper is a synthesis of the findings of reports that look at the drivers of performance in energy and water utilities
                         in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper also provides other insights on issues that complement the findings of
                         these reports. The following people contributed to this summary note: Caroline van den Berg, Pedro Antmann,
