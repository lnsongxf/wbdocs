Dear Readers,

We are truly delighted to share with you this compilation of an almost two-year journey, on which we embarked
with 14 courageous World Bank innovators. Belonging to such a data-rich organization as ours, we realized in the
summer of 2014 that a growing trend in the private sector – big data – could really enhance the way we achieve
our results.

Big data capitalizes on the vast sources of data available to us today, from cellphone records to taxi GPS data,
satellite images or new media. These reams of data, when anonymized and analyzed, can provide us with a
wealth of information, such as the travel patterns of individuals in a crowded city or the path of a flu virus.

So we started to look for big data ideas within the Bank and found a few colleagues who were trying out new
initiatives. We learned that many faced similar challenges, such as lack of access to certain types of data, a
desire for world-class data science expertise, lack of storage and computational capacity, a desire for good
practices on handling privacy, opportunities for peer-to-peer learning, and platforms and norms for sharing data
and software. There was also need for seed and growth funding to kick-start the high-potential, but often high-risk,
big data initiatives.

We realized the importance of creating a big data program with strong projects that could inspire others. Following
up on this instinct, we launched the Big Data Innovation Challenge – not knowing what to expect, as this was a
concept so new to our staff. We weren’t even sure if we would get more than 10 proposals, and were pleasantly
surprised to receive 131 innovative ideas, from which we chose 14 winners.

And what a diverse group of winners they were, from tracking rural electrification in India using satellite imagery,
to analyzing taxi hailing services in the Philippines to reduce congestion, to using cellphones to measure road
conditions in Belarus, and analyzing social media content in Brazil to understand citizens’ political sentiment.

In November 2014, the winners all received seed funding to test their pilot ideas, as well as technical help from data
scientists from the newly established Big Data team in the Bank’s Innovation Labs.

Our journey with these teams has continued during the course of several months, during which we have seen ideas
tried, failed, refined and field-tested. Each story became a personal quest for us and we are proud that many of
these are now ready for scale-up and adoption in operations.

This publication profiles stories from the Challenge winning teams and finalists, showing how data on an
unprecedented scale has the potential to be transformational in its effects.

We hope you will find these stories as inspiring as we have.

ii BIG DATA innovation challenge
Introduction


Big data can sound remote and lacking a human dimension, with few obvious links to development
and impacting the lives of the poor. Concepts such as anti-poverty targeting, market access or
rural electrification seem far more relevant – and easier to grasp. And yet some of today’s most
groundbreaking initiatives in these areas rely on big data.

SUMMARY
Climate change means traditional calendar-based decisions about what and when to plant
are no longer reliable for farmers. New approaches are urgently required to provide relevant
and timely information for decision making. In Colombia, the International Center for Tropical
Research (CIAT) has combined long-term data on rice harvests and climate patterns, and
analyzed it to provide essential information for crop planting decisions. This project draws
on the Colombian experience. The team partnered with rice-growing experts from Argentina,
Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, helped them prepare cropping and climate data, and held a workshop
to analyze their data. The technique combines the two databases on harvests and weather,
and relates each harvest to the corresponding climate sequence for approximately 120 days
between sowing and reaping. The data is analyzed to unravel underlying correlations between
climate factors and yield variability. This enables identification of climate sequences that
are favorable or unfavorable for cropping in specific areas. By matching these with seasonal
forecasts, the system can advise farmers on what variety of rice to plant for the anticipated
conditions, and when to plant it. To support field data capture by farmers, the project also
created a web platform and an Android app. The tool can be applied to any crop or location,
providing farmers with data-driven information to help them decide what, when and where
to plant.

SUMMARY
Access to financial services is essential to development efforts. Across Africa, financial
inclusion remains below potential – partly due to the challenge for financial institutions in
developing products for the low-income mass market. This project uses available data in an
innovative way to help providers offer affordable financial services to previously unbanked
people. By combining big data analytics and socio-economic research in Ghana, Uganda and
Zambia, the team created a powerful tool to increase adoption and use of digital financial
services (DFS). This enabled them to establish a statistical customer profile for an active DFS
user. They then searched the big-data set to identify matching profiles among phone-service
customers who are not yet DFS users, and mapped their locations. These are the customers
most likely to become active users of DFS. This intelligence can be used for product
development and targeted marketing campaigns to increase the supply of financial services
to the previously unbanked. It also offers valuable insights for the World Bank’s drive for full
global financial inclusion by 2020. In Ghana, the use of project findings has already led to the
financial inclusion of more than 70,000 people.

                      The Philippines’ 180,000km of local roads are vital for linking people to social

SUMMARY
Local roads that give ‘last-mile’ access to a destination are essential for promoting inclusive
growth. But improvements in local road networks typically depend on national financing
and involve numerous decentralized projects, making it hard for policymakers and citizens
to ensure the development of efficient road networks. In response, this project developed
OpenRoads, an interactive multi-media portal and set of digital tools to track nationally-
financed projects to improve local road networks in the Philippines. The platform links official
road data with crowd-sourced geo-coded video and image data from mobile devices, to
validate the state of the country’s extensive road network. It can be used by all stakeholders
working to promote better road investments, including ordinary citizens. Leveraging low-cost
open-source mapping technology and mobile pictures and videos, it organizes a wealth of
rich geo-tagged imagery and feedback contributions, turning fragmented data into timely
information. By geo-tagging, processing and analyzing the imagery, it captures the state of
local road networks and road investment projects. This allows greater digital transparency
and feedback, improving results and value for money for public investments in last-mile rural
road access.

SUMMARY
Property rights are critical to economic growth and social stability, yet almost 75 percent of
the world’s population lacks access to formal systems to register their land rights. In a new
approach to recording property rights quickly and cheaply, this project used Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones. These record imagery which is processed into
high-resolution orthophotographs (aerial photographs corrected to have the same lack of
distortion as a map). The process generates accurate, cost-effective and up-to-date maps
and 3D computer-generated landscape models in a fraction of the time of conventional aerial
surveys. In Kosovo, the team used a UAV to map villages where the men were killed in the
Balkan conflicts and the women lack formal property title. They are now using the new maps
to help the women define their property boundaries and officially register their rights. They
also deployed the UAV successfully in the fast-growing city of Ferizaj, to support a government
program for unregistered land owners to legalize their property rights. The initiative can be
scaled up globally, especially to secure land rights in developing countries.

SUMMARY
Congestion has known negative impacts on economic growth and can exacerbate urban
air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Effectively addressing congestion requires
accurate traffic speed and flow data, but resource-constrained transport agencies are
challenged to collect these data, as modern tools tend to be financially and technically out of
reach. In response, the Open Traffic program leverages open-source software and innovative
partnerships to substantially reduce the cost of traditional traffic data collection and analysis,
while simultaneously improving the quality. The first scalable, open-source program of its
kind, the project built on work with the Cebu City Government in the Philippines to develop
an open-source platform for collecting, visualizing and analyzing traffic speed data derived
from taxi drivers’ smartphones. Using GPS data from an on-demand taxi service, Open Traffic
successfully analyzed peak-hour congestion, travel time reliability and corridor vulnerability
across 10 Southeast Asian cities, and has prepared travel time analyses for select origin-
destination pairs. This analysis would not previously have been possible without substantial
time and resources. It shows that the next generation of congestion management solutions
will leapfrog the capital-intensive approaches of the past, enabling traffic management
agencies to make affordable, evidence-based planning decisions. Open Traffic has now been
deployed in Cebu City for live testing.

SUMMARY
Where citizens lack means of voicing discontent with institutions and governments, they
can embrace extreme forms of protest that quickly escalate. To explore the relationship
between citizens’ feelings about governance institutions, their trust in government, and
civil unrest, this project conducted sentiment analysis of tweets made during protests
surrounding the 2014 Soccer World Cup in Brazil. The team harvested 11 million real-time
tweets and used visual analytics techniques to extract search terms for the collection
of relevant historic tweets. They used a visual analytics tool to carry out sentiment and
text analysis, then followed a structured approach to explore how Brazilian citizens felt
about their state institutions, how these feelings connected to their sentiments about
government and politicians, and how such sentiments translated into collective behaviors.


The analysis showed citizens expressing negative sentiment about the national
government’s low investment in services such as education, health and water, relative
to lavish spending on the World Cup. The negative tweets were forms of social
protest that may have led to other forms of protest, including demonstrations. These
findings supported the relative deprivation theory of what causes social protest (the
theory that people feel grievance leading to protest when they feel deprived relative
to some external standard). They suggest domestic policy priorities for Brazil’s
government and resonate with wider policy discussions on wealth inequality.

SUMMARY
Electricity is essential to human wellbeing worldwide, yet 1.2 billion people still live without
it. Key to improving service provision is accurate tracking of the availability and supply of
electricity at local level. By collecting and analyzing a unique historical archive of nighttime
satellite imagery, this project developed a novel data-intensive strategy to improve the
monitoring of electricity provision to rural areas across the developing world. Drawing
on a multi-terabyte image archive spanning over 8,000 nights since 1993, the team used
computationally intensive methods to extract and analyze patterns of light output observed
nightly over all 600,000 villages in India. This pioneering dataset paints a dynamic portrait
of rural energy access over two decades, enabling observation of how access to electricity
has expanded, and identification of villages that remain dark. It also enables the detection of
power supply irregularities. These insights are particularly useful in rural and remote regions
where traditional monitoring is difficult. To make the data accessible to governments, power
companies, regulatory agencies and other users, the team developed an online visualization
platform, India.Nightlights. The site allows users to see how light output has evolved over two
decades, from state level right down to individual villages. Ultimately, the approach could help
optimize electrification planning according to an accurate understanding of electrical supplies
on the ground.

SUMMARY
Poverty must be located accurately if development interventions are to be effectively targeted
and monitored. However, expensive data collection and processing mean national poverty
estimates in developing countries are often outdated. In response, this project explored the
use of indicators derived from satellite data to predict geographic variations in poverty. The
first component examined how well publicly available low-resolution satellite indicators such
as nighttime lights and land type contribute to poverty prediction, and how this depends on
the method used to build the prediction model. When satellite indicators were applied to
the models in Pakistan, which is unusual in that it can generate district poverty estimates
from a detailed household survey, they did not improve the accuracy of predictions. The rich
survey information meant satellite-based indicators contributed nothing new. However, in Sri
Lanka, which is more typical in generating poverty estimates from a census (meaning fewer
indicators), even freely available satellite indicators improved the accuracy of predictions. In
both cases, the team found models selected using an innovative statistical technique called
Lasso to work best for predicting poverty at a more local level, with sizeable benefits when
there are many variables.


When high-resolution satellite data indicators – such as cars, built-up area, shadows, roof type
and road type – were combined with Sri Lankan census data, preliminary results showed that
satellite indicators track regional differences in poverty extremely well. They demonstrate that
high-resolution satellite imagery is a valuable complement to household survey data, with
potential to help generate more accurate and updated local poverty maps and refine targeting
in development initiatives.

SUMMARY
Latin America is highly urbanized, with above-average crime rates. Its cities are typically
unplanned, with high socioeconomic inequality, yet the association between crime and
infrastructure has not been clearly defined or quantified. Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, collects
considerable geo-coded data on urban infrastructure and has reliable geo-coded information
on population and crime. The recent development of the world’s largest Bus Rapid Transit
system has led to the modification of infrastructure in several parts of Bogotá. These changes
present an opportunity for studying the association between crime and infrastructure.
Drawing on rich data, this project quantified the occurrence of crimes in relation to specific
characteristics in the built environment. Through risk terrain modeling (RTM), the team
identified locations near public hospitals, schools, drugstores and bus stations as being
associated with assault and homicide. The modeling also revealed peak times of day for
crime, and predicted areas of the city more likely to experience future crime. Combined with
local stakeholder perspectives, RTM analyses can reliably suggest action to reduce crime
associated with particular environmental factors. The methods are widely applicable in other
locations and for other crimes.

SUMMARY
Road agencies constantly face the challenge of developing cost-effective asset
management strategies despite limited resources and modest understanding of road
infrastructure conditions from users’ perspectives. This project piloted an innovative
solution through an app called RoadLab, developed using accelerometers in smartphones
carried in moving vehicles. This automatically evaluates the roughness of road surfaces
and identifies major damage, such as potholes. It also allows road users to manually
submit reports of road accidents or safety hazards, along with precise GPS information.
The crowdsourced data is analyzed to extract information on the condition of road
surfaces users travel over. Developed in collaboration with the Belarus authorities,
RoadLab gives road agencies comprehensive and frequent information on road surface
condition over wide areas. This enables them to prioritize investments effectively for
maintaining infrastructure, and to assess road surfaces before and after maintenance
work. By promoting citizen engagement and enabling road agencies to respond more
effectively to users’ concerns, this approach also enhances government accountability.
Built with the aim of scaling up, RoadLab can easily be modified to other countries and
has the potential to become a key input for road network management worldwide.

Real-time Assessments: How Markets
Are Working for the Poor Alvaro S. Gonzalez
						
   Research suggests that many markets in which the poor transact are
   volatile, fragmented and suffer weak competition, reducing people’s ability
   to escape poverty. This project analyzes existing micro-level price data to
   provide policymakers with near-real-time information on how well markets
   are working, so they can implement policies to improve them for the poor.

by everyday activity, and use it to promote development.
