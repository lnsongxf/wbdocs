                        Background and presentation of the Report

Bulgaria under the guidance of the Minister of Health is undertaking a major reform of its health system.
One input to the reform is a joint study with the World Bank on health financing in Bulgaria (The World
Bank Diagnostic Report)1. The report evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of Bulgaria’s health
financing system in terms of the three health financing functions of revenue raising, risk pooling, and
purchasing of services. It assesses each of these financing functions in terms of the health financing
goals of improving health outcomes, financial protection, and consumer responsiveness in an efficient,
equitable, and sustainable manner.

The assessment of the health financing system documented significant strengths in the system, but also
major challenges in terms of the purchasing function and current hospital payment practices. These
challenges included unsustainable growth in hospital spending; lack of incentives for efficiency, quality,
or cost control, and strong incentives for hospitalization over treatment in less expensive outpatient
settings. Fundamental problems with the current hospital payment system using Clinical Care Pathways
(CCPs) were highlighted.

The Minister of Health’s ‘Concept Note Health 2020 Goals’ that was approved by the Council of
Ministers in February 2015, also raised strong concerns about hospital efficiency, the need to pay for
results, and the sustainability of the entire health financing system, for which hospital spending
accounts for about one-half. “Introducing a system of payment of hospital activity based on results
from diagnosing and treatment activities” was stated as one of the main measures to achieve health
reform priority objectives2.

Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) are one of the most widely used hospital financing systems globally in
OECD, EU and increasingly in emerging market countries. Bulgaria has been studying and developing
DRGs since the mid-1990s. While The World Bank Diagnostic Report provides a detailed assessment of
all of Bulgaria’s provider payment systems including their inter-linkages and provides overarching
recommendations on payment reforms including DRGs. Therefore, this report does not repeat what is
detailed in the Diagnostic Report, but rather it is intended to serve as a practical guide for implementing
DRG-based financing in Bulgaria, building upon both the country’s substantial past investments and its
current expertise. It was written as part of the World Bank’s Advisory Services on Health Financing and
is based on the premise that a decision to adopt DRGs was seriously considered by the Government of
Bulgaria, as reflected in the Government’s request to include a draft DRGs Action Plan in the
deliverables of the Advisory Services.

Purpose of this report

The purpose of this report is to provide information to Bulgarian decision-makers on how Bulgaria can
move towards implementing a DRG-based hospital budgeting and payment system. The report was
prepared by a team of Bulgarian and international DRG experts who have been involved in the country’s
DRG assessment and planning since its inception. The report is intended for a wide-ranging audience
that includes high-level policy-makers who are weighting the benefits of implementing DRGs, technical
staff who may be tasked with implementing the Action Plan, and other key stakeholders who may be
less familiar with the use of case-mix as a mechanism to provide payment to hospitals.

The report has a two-fold purpose:

        First, it provides a primer about case-mix systems in general, and DRGs in particular, as well as
         the technical steps necessary to implement DRGs. It also describes the significant work
         conducted in Bulgaria to date and the array of technical knowledge and infrastructure that exists
         in the country.

        Second, it provides a draft Action Plan containing necessary steps with a timeline and budget
         that, together, outline the technical and political activities necessary to reform the current
         hospital payment system. Given the Bulgarian context, the suggested approach is to begin
         movement towards DRG implementation by conducting a rigorous pilot test of using DRGs for
         payment and budgeting with a small number of hospitals. This is a useful approach as a pilot
         project allows all stakeholders time to learn, time to make and test policy decisions, and time to
         evaluate future directions in a short-time frame. Such an approach is also politically palatable. If
         Bulgaria wanted to move directly to full implementation of DRGs, the information in this report
         can easily be adapted to support such a step. The Action Plan contains a number of activities
         that will need to be carried out by different stakeholders and experts. The report describes the
         roles and responsibilities across different institutions for developing, implementing, and
         maintaining a DRG-based payment system but purposely does not provide specific
         recommendations on which institutions should do what since there is no “one right way” for
         Bulgaria to move forward but rather there are many options and we leave it to Bulgarian
         decision-makers to determine what would be best in terms of division of labor/tasks across
         institutions. The Action Plan also builds upon Bulgaria’s significant knowledge about, and
         readiness to implement, DRGs for hospital budgeting and payment — including its developed
         health management information systems (HMIS) processes. Our expectation is that the Action
         Plan will serve as the basis of many discussions and revisions will be made to both the tasks
         included and the timing of both specific tasks as well as the overall timeline. The timeline is
         intentionally aggressive and may require some modification based on discussions that decision-
         makers will have.

Information provided in the following chapters
Given its importance, technical complexity, political sensitivity, and the high level of erroneous
conventional wisdoms about DRGs, the report includes a significant amount of background information,
detailed technical implementation information, and a thorough assessment of the Bulgarian context and
readiness to engage in system reform. Because the report is directed at such a varied audience, the
content is presented in different chapters, so each type of reader can gain the most useful information
in the most convenient manner.

This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             2
The first part of the report is fairly general; the second half is quite specialized, and is designed to aid
technical staff in moving swiftly to begin a DRG pilot project, if the stakeholders determine to do so.
Readers with a strong working knowledge of case-mix tools, DRGs, and/or the country’s experience with
financing systems are encouraged to skip sections and/or chapters that present this information.

The content of the chapters is as follows:

        Chapter 1 presents background information on various hospital payment methodologies, and
         describes case-mix payment systems, which are the most common tool. It describes case-mix
         systems’ uses, risks, and benefits, and presents background information on the most widely
         used case-mix method – the DRGs. This chapter will be useful for those who wish to learn about
         the overall concept of hospital financing methods, case-mix systems in general, and DRGs in
         particular. Stakeholders who wish to compare DRGs with the current process in Bulgaria (i.e.,
         CCPs) will also benefit from this information.

        Chapter 2 provides an overview of the current Bulgarian situation, including the use of CCPs to
         create hospital contracted budgets and to pay facilities for their services. It is intended to inform
         decision-makers about pilot testing a DRG-based payment system to improve how health care
         funds are distributed. This chapter will be useful for those who are less familiar with Bulgaria’s
         history with DRGs and/or its current use of CCPs. The World Bank Diagnostic Report presents
         more detailed information about CCPs, the challenges associated with the use of this tool, and
         the benefits from the current process.

        Chapter 3 presents the primary technical steps required to effectively and successfully
         implement a DRG-based payment system, and describes Bulgaria’s readiness and/or experience
         with each step. It provides detailed information about the technical decisions and computations
         that must be made to mitigate risks and effectively use DRGs. It also describes the roles and
         responsibilities across institutions for developing, implementing, and maintaining a DRG-based
         financing system. This chapter will be useful for those who wish to understand Bulgaria’s
         readiness to implement DRGs and the context for the process described in the Action Plan.

        Chapter 4 presents the Action Plan and the associated activities to build upon Bulgaria’s past
         work and infrastructure to pilot-test a DRG based payment system. The Action Plan presents a
         timeline, budget, and activities for implementing the technical steps detailed in Chapter 3. The
         detailed steps and the timeline provided stem from our understanding of Bulgaria’s current level
         of expertise, the processes achieved to date, and what is needed to move forward with a pilot
         implementation but ultimately the Action Plan will need to be reviewed and revised by
         Bulgarian decision-makers. This Chapter also describes existing HMIS processes (i.e., data
         collection, storage, ownership, and communication) and will be most useful for those who seek
         a greater understanding about the activities that need to be conducted in order to proceed with
         a pilot DRG implementation.

  Chapter 1 – A Primer on Case Mix and Diagnosis Related Groups
1.     This chapter presents brief information on hospital payment methodologies, provides detailed
information on the most common method used for paying hospitals (case-based, case-mix), describes
the use, risks, and benefits of this tool, and describes the most common case-mix method, DRGs.
Technical information is presented in text boxes and footnotes for those who wish to gain a deeper
understanding of these concepts.

2.      This chapter is useful for those who wish to learn about hospital financing methods, case-mix
systems in general, and DRGs in particular. Stakeholders who wish to compare DRGs with the current
process (i.e., CCPs) will also benefit from this information. Readers who are already familiar with case-
mix tools and DRGs, or who do not need this information, are welcome to skip this chapter.


    1.1.           Introduction to Hospital Payment Systems
3.       Health care purchasers or payors have a variety of different ways they can purchase health care
services. From a policy perspective, they want to obtain value for the money they spend. Different tools
generate different incentives and disincentives, therefore selection of tools to pay for health care
services is important and must be done carefully. For example, historically, many purchasers used input
tools — such as the number of beds a hospital has or the number and types of equipment available— as
the basis for its payment system and/or to create hospital budgets. This method does not create
efficiency incentives nor relate what is being “purchased” in terms of hospital services or treated
patients, etc.

4.       As a result, over time, purchasers of health care services have moved to using output tools —
such as the number of bed days produced or the number and types of patients discharged. The number
and type of patients discharged best describes the mix of cases a hospital treats and is the most widely
used tool to pay for health care services provided by
hospitals. Measuring outputs is useful as it allows Different tools can be used to distribute
payors to purchase services in a similar manner across money in the same way, and the same tool

inputs as they receive a fixed amount of money for ways. For example, in the U.S., case-based

management autonomy and flexibility.

5.       Regardless of the tool used, purchasers will need to have accurate and complete clinical and
cost data in order to create an effective and fair payment or budgeting system. The product purchased
needs to be measurable, and the costs associated with the activity or unit of measure must be clearly
identifiable and known. Otherwise, it is impossible to distribute health care resources efficiently, fairly,
or equitably.

                                                                                                                             4
    1.2.           Introduction to Case-Mix Concepts

6.      One popular output-based tool that is commonly used to finance hospital services is per-case
payment, also commonly referred to as “case-based payment” or “case-mix payment.” This tool is used
to create payment systems and/or global budgets for hospitals.

7.      A “case” may be defined in a variety of ways: it might be defined as a patient discharged from
the hospital or from a specific department. It might be defined as a certain combination of diagnosis and
procedures treated over a short timespan from admission to discharge, and include all of the services
provided (i.e., labs, tests, devices, etc.). It may be defined as a case that spans a longer period of time,
commonly referred to as an “episode of care,” such as a pregnant woman who receives pre- and post-
delivery care as well as care related to the actual birth. Case-mix can be used for many purposes (see
box), but the most widespread use around the world is to distribute limited health care resources.

         Some Common Uses of Case-Mix                        8.       Using case-mix to pay hospitals is viewed as a
                                                             balanced approach to financing because it aims to

9.      The term “case-mix” refers to an interrelated — but distinct — set of patient attributes
including:

        Resource intensity: the relative volume and types of diagnostic, therapeutic, and bed services
         used to manage a particular illness.
        Severity of illness: the relative levels of loss of function and mortality that may be experienced
         by patients with a particular disease.
        Prognoses: the probable outcome of an illness including the likelihood of improvement or
         deterioration in the severity of the illness, likelihood of recurrence, and the patient’s probable
         life span.
        Treatment difficulty: the patient-management problems that a particular illness presents to the
         health care provider; these are associated with illnesses without a clear pattern of symptoms,
         illnesses requiring sophisticated and technically difficult procedures, and illnesses requiring
         close monitoring and supervision.
        Need for intervention: the consequences (in terms of severity of illness) that would result from a
         lack of immediate and/or continuing care.

10.     Clinically, “case-mix” typically refers to the severity of the patient’s condition and the difficulty
associated with providing care to that patient. For example, a hospital with a higher mix of complex

European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             5
cases, is viewed as seeing patients who are more severe, more complicated in terms of treatment
difficulty, at a greater risk of mortality, requiring more interventions and resources, and/or with a worse
prognoses.

11.     From an administrative or regulatory perspective, “case-mix” refers to the resource-intensity
demands that the patient places on the institution; some patients require a higher level of resources,
resulting in larger costs to provide them with high-quality, appropriate care. While the two
interpretations of case-mix are often closely related, they can vary widely for certain kinds of patients.
For example, terminal cancer patients are severely ill and have a poor prognosis, but often require few
hospital resources beyond basic nursing care.

12.     With respect to hospital payment or budgeting systems, case-mix tools are used to measure the
types of patients treated in the hospital setting (versus only counting cases or looking at the volume);
analyze the differences in resource intensity of various types of patient care; and to allocate resources
equitably and efficiently based on hospital output (versus input).

13.     Different case-mix tools exist around the world. Some measure the production of inpatient
hospital care (i.e., DRGs), while others measure the production of outpatient care (i.e., Ambulatory
Payment Classifications, Ambulatory Visit Groups, etc.), still others can measure Home Health Care,
Long-Term Care, Skilled Nursing Facility care, etc.

14.     Despite the different types of case-mix systems that exist as well as new ones that are being
created, they all typically share the following common characteristics of being:
     Medically and clinically meaningful;
     Involve similar (i.e., homogenous) resources;
     Use routinely available demographic, clinical, and cost data that can be statistically analyzed
        and validated; and
     Involve a manageable number of groups/categories (i.e., neither too few nor too many) without
        compromising clinical or resource homogeneity.

      1.3.         Benefits and Risks of Case-Mix Tools

15.      Key benefits of using case-mix as the basis of a hospital payment or budgeting system include:

     Increasing transparency: Case-mix systems help distribute funds in an objective and data-driven
      manner to ensure that hospitals receive funds that are directly linked to the number and types of
      cases treated rather than based on input measures or subjective criteria such as hospital location
      or ownership.
    Increasing efficiency: Case-mix systems incentivize hospital efficiency by rewarding outputs rather
      than inputs, and rewarding hospitals that provide services the most efficiently (e.g., below the
      average or median cost). Hospital payments can be made (and/or budgets contracted) at a
      predictable fixed or national price that reflects cost variations among different inpatient clinical
      services. Hospitals receive a fixed amount of money for a certain average length of stay by case-
      mix classification groups; this incentivizes them to be efficient in their care delivery and reduces
      both patient length of stay and the costs per patient.
    Recognizing and promoting equity: Case-mix systems foster equality among hospitals and ensure
      that providers are treated fairly. Any unique characteristics or circumstances that might increase a

                                                                                                                             6
          hospital’s costs that are outside of the facility’s control can be addressed through the use of
          adjustments (i.e., hospital type, location, teaching vs. non-teaching, etc.).

16.       Key risks that come with using case-mix that must be monitored and mitigated include:

         Discharging patients “quicker” and “sicker” from the hospital;
         Providing sub-optimal care (i.e., fewer procedures and/or less care may be provided to generate
          savings or profits);
         Reporting of fraudulent diagnosis and/or procedure codes resulting in ‘up coding/DRG-creep’ to
          earn more money;
         Inappropriate transfers to other hospitals;
         Volume increases;
         Cherry picking (also referred to as “cream skimming”) of patients where hospitals may select
          only certain types of patients and turn away others or encourage them to seek care elsewhere.
          These risks along with others as well as possible mitigation measures are further discussed in
          section 1.5.

17.       Such risks are valid concerns and must be addressed by countries that use case-mix tools to
finance hospital care. Addressing them is done by implementing strong up front contracting rules and
processes while also carefully monitoring the data. Clinical and quality measures should be monitored to
ensure that hospitals do not try to take advantage of case-mix payments by engaging in inappropriate
clinical practices that negatively impact patient care and outcomes.3

      1.4.          Understanding DRGs

18.     DRGs are a form of case-mix tool based on diagnosis and procedures and a specific grouping
algorithm that assigns a payment level based on the patient treatment’s relative resource-intensity.
They are the most well-known and widely used
type of case-mix tool used to classify acute care      Minimum Basic Data Set for Assigning a
inpatient hospital cases. Patients are assigned                  DRG to an Inpatient

                                                       death)
3 These include looking at mortality rates, morbidity rates, infection rates, transfer rates, re-admission rates, days in the intensive
care units, etc. During the early years of DRG implementation in the U.S., hospital discharges were carefully monitored in order
to identify and prevent negative outcomes. Because hospitals knew they were being monitored, they did not attempt to behave in
inappropriate ways; instead, they were incentivized to provide high-quality health care in an efficient manner. They no longer had
a financial incentive to buy the most expensive drugs and/or devices, or to keep their patients in the bed longer than needed, so
they changed these behaviours. Hospitals made trade-offs to reduce their costs while continuing to provide the proper care to
their patients.

classification system provides a way to relate the type of patients treated by a hospital (i.e., its case-mix)
to the costs incurred by that hospital.4

19.     DRGs were first designed and developed in the late 1960s at Yale University in the United States
in order to create an effective framework to monitor service utilization within hospital settings. DRGs
were designed to relate a hospital’s mix of patients and the resources required to treat those patients to
the hospital’s overall costs. DRG groups were created to be both clinically meaningful and resource
homogenous. A hospital that has a more complex mix of cases is expected to expend more resources
and thus incur more costs than a hospital treating a less complex mix of cases. A hospital with the
higher mix of cases would thus receive more money than a hospital with a lower mix of cases, assuming
both hospitals had a similar case-load or volume.

20.     In 1983, the U.S. created a national DRG-based hospital prospective payment system (PPS) for
all Medicare patients, which was managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS)
Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).5 This very basic DRG system was used to pay U.S. hospitals
for care provided to Medicare beneficiaries and incentivize the hospitals to become more efficient. In
2007, the U.S. Medicare program replaced the original DRG system with Medicare Severity-adjusted
DRGs (MS-DRGs), which was a major refinement to the groupings. At the same time, the U.S.
government began to tie inpatient reimbursement to the quality of care provided to patients.

21.     Although this initial DRG system was used to address care delivered primarily to the elderly, the
use, application, and types of DRG classification systems have grown significantly over the years. 3M
Health Information Systems (3M HIS) created some of the first expanded systems, including All-Patient
DRGs (AP-DRGs), All-Patient Refined DRGs (APR-DRGs) and International Refined DRGs (IR-DRGs). DRG
groups range in size from 500 groups to more than 1000.

22.      Internationally, many governments have created more specific DRG systems, such as the
Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (AR-DRGs), Nordic countries’ Nord-DRGs, Hungarian DRGs,
German DRGs, and many more. Much development has occurred over the years to address some of the
limitations that exist with DRG systems such as improving the definitions and relative weights of many
non-surgical/non-intervention DRG groups. A selected list of countries around the world that have
studied and/or implemented the use of some type of DRGs to serve as the basis of their hospital
payment or budgeting systems is provided in the chart below.




4 Ideally, costs of DRGs are based on the ‘efficient costs of production,’ not only actual incurred costs. In the absence of detailed
studies of hospital production efficiency, this is often done by defining ‘efficient’ as the mean or median costs of comparab le
hospitals.
5 The U.S. Congress did this by amending the Social Security Act, which governs the U.S. Medicare program. Medicare is a

social insurance program for the elderly, disabled, and those with end-stage renal disease that is financed by payroll taxes on the
working age population, premiums from program enrollees, and general revenue contributions from the Government.

    1.5.      Misconceptions, Concerns, and Questions about Using DRGs as the Basis
       of a Payment or Budgeting System

23.     Despite the expansion of DRGs internationally, many concerns and misconceptions exist. Some
concerns stem from a lack of understanding about DRGs and case-mix tools. Others stem from a
misunderstanding of how DRG-based payment system’s impact on doctors and medical specialists. Table
1, below, addresses the most common concerns and misperceptions. Many of these concerns have also
been raised by Bulgarian stakeholders over the years.

 DRGs are a prospective payment tool and cannot be            DRGs measure the resource-intensity of the types of cases
 used to create hospital budgets.                             treated; they can be used for a variety of purposes,
                                                              including as the basis of a case-based payment system
                                                              and/or to develop contracted hospital budgets.
 DRG is a tool to reduce or cut the amount of money           The total amount of money available to fund hospital
 available to fund hospitals.                                 services is a policy decision. DRGs in and of themselves do
                                                              not have the power to increase or decrease the funds
                                                              available. The tool only distributes the available funds in a

 DRGs are a tool used to control doctors and how              DRGs create efficiency incentives, which can benefit

                                                              no prescriptive rules or requirements about what care

 Using DRGs will reduce the quality of care that              DRGs do not automatically cause the quality of care to

 The health care system needs to be better financed           As noted above, the amount of finances available in the

 of a payment or budgeting system.                            from the DRG process itself. DRGs help distribute the

 Implementation of DRGs depends on having a large             Implementing DRGs does require clinical data from the
 amount of high-quality data to group patients /              country to be available, and different countries have
 cases into DRGs.                                             begun with different amounts of data. For example, six
                                                              months of clinical data can be enough to begin a pilot

                                                              volume caps or a spending cap set by the payor.
                                                              Additionally, monitoring volume can help with this to
                                                              ensure that hospitals are not admitting patients
                                                              inappropriately, or admitting patients that could be
                                                              treated in the outpatient setting, or selecting only certain
                                                              kinds of patients while turning others away or

 Hospitals will report diagnosis and procedures in a          Yes it is possible that hospitals may try to do this and it is
 way to maximize their money/payments                         commonly referred to as “DRG-creep.” There are two
                                                              types of DRG-creep. The first is that hospitals’ coding
                                                              naturally improves because money is tied to their coding.
                                                              The second is that hospitals may try to cheat or game the

             Chapter 2 – The Bulgarian Context: CCPs and DRGs
24.      The purpose of this chapter is to provide an understanding of the current Bulgarian situation,
including the tool currently being used to create hospital contracted budgets and to pay hospitals
throughout the year, and an assessment of how well it functions compared to other case-based tools.
This background is provided to inform decisions about whether the country would benefit from pilot-
testing the use of DRGs for hospital payment. Such a shift to the use of DRGs might remedy some of the
challenges presented by CCPs and improve the efficiency, equity, quality and consistency of health care
delivery.

25.     This chapter will be useful for those who are not familiar with Bulgaria’s use of CCPs today
and/or Bulgaria’s history with DRGs. Those who are already familiar with this history, or do not need this
background can skip this chapter. For those who seek more detailed information about CCPs, the
challenges associated with the use of this tool, and the benefits from the current process, are invited to
review this information in the World Bank Diagnostic Report.

    2.1.           Use of CCPs to Create Hospital Contracted Budgets

26.     Since the transition, Bulgaria has implemented major health system reforms, most notably
through the introduction of a mandatory health insurance system in which the National Health
Insurance Fund (NHIF) acts as the main public purchaser of health care services. As part of these
reforms, the NHIF’s method for hospital contracting was changed to case payments in 2001 (based on
CCPs) and global hospital budgets in order to promote efficiency and quality of care. (Previously, the
central government used a norms-based resource allocation methodology and line-item budgets to set
contracts.)

27.     CCPs were originally intended as clinical guidelines. The current CCP system is a combination of
diagnosis and procedure requirements, administrative requirements, staffing and equipment
requirements, clinical guidelines/protocols, documentation and patient education requirements, and a
series of contracting rules. Each CCP algorithm, which is defined in the National Framework Contract,
describes components necessary to provide services in a safe and appropriate manner (i.e., eligible
diagnosis; minimum number of hospital medical staff, non-medical personnel, and/or equipment; etc.).
Discharges are assigned a CCP based on information about the patient’s diagnosis and the procedure(s)
delivered to the patient. Providers are contracted to provide specific CCPs, and reimbursed for them by
the NHIF at a price negotiated by the Bulgarian Medical Association (BMA) and the NHIF.

28.      The CCPs are used as a global budgeting tool to help prepare the national budget for the
provision of inpatient care. This budget is comprised of regional budgets that are determined based on
historical data about the number of reported cases, by CCP, provided by each hospital in the region. (In
2015, for example, budgets are 90-95% of the previous year’s allocation.)

29.     CCPs are also used as a payment tool. The final payment to hospitals is based on the actual
number of cases treated, by CCP (i.e., based on submitted claims). Hospitals that do not treat the
projected number of cases receive less than the budgeted amount. Hospitals that treat more than the
projected number of cases may receive payment for the extra cases, which is usually based on a political
decision, but they may see a penalty or reduced budgets in the next year.


This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             11
30.       Some benefits for CCPs include:
         Both hospitals and physicians are familiar with CCP requirements and the overall contracting
          process.
         Hospitals have the necessary infrastructure in place to submit CCP required information and
          understand how the NHIF audits claims for CCP information.
         CCPs provide a common understanding of a patient’s general treatment path and the clinical
          care the patient should receive.
         CCPs also include information about personnel, staff, equipment, and other capacity that the
          hospital must have in place in order to provide services. These requirements to the extent they
          are intended to ensure patient safety and quality are useful particularly in the absence of other
          guidelines or regulations such as requirements or conditions hospitals must meet in order to
          contract with the NHIF or mandatory Hospital Accreditation.

31.     CCPs are an effective tool for their intended original use, which is to describe the type of clinical
care/services patients should receive; they can be considered a type of output-based financing tool,
since CCPs aim to measure hospital production. But, because CCPs were not designed to pay hospitals,
we do not believe they are the, most appropriate tool for distributing limited health care funds in a fair
and equitable manner.

32.      In fact, over the years, CCPs have created challenges in the Bulgarian health care marketplace,
since they do not promote efficiency and are likely to result in increased costs stemming from the
provision of unnecessary services and longer lengths of stay. Additionally, CCP prices are negotiated
rather than being based on objective cost data and since the relative weights of CCPs are not based on
statistical resource costing algorithms, the weights do not likely reflect resource cost differences
accurately among cases. And, because CCPs are generated by the presence of certain conditions and
the provision of certain tests and procedures, providers have little incentive to capture complete
medical information about the patient’s health and health care needs. Thus, a complete and accurate
picture of morbidity is likely unavailable to health care institutions, payors, and planners.

33.     In summary, as a tool, CCPs are best-suited to describe clinical care. They can also continue to
be useful to describe necessary hospital conditions/standards for contracting, but should not continue
to be used to pay hospitals as the use of CCPs for payment has inevitably created inequalities in the
health system; incentivized inefficiency at the hospital level; resulted in unnecessary lengths of stay and
admissions; and resulted in the provision of a large range of unnecessary services. Instead, a different
tool — such as DRGs —is being considered by Bulgarian decision-makers as an option for improving the
equity and efficiency of their hospital payment system, which we support.


      2.2.         Bulgaria’s History with Case-Mix and DRGs

34.      Bulgaria’s long history with case-mix and DRGs is summarized below. It is useful to understand
this history to guide potential future activities to pilot the implementation of DRGs for a new payment
or budgeting system. Annex 1 provides more detailed information on this history of activities from the
1990s to the present for interested readers. Studies about using DRGs in Bulgaria have been on-going
since the mid-1990s, and multiple projects have been conducted to-date. In the mid- to late-1990s, the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Agency for International Development

European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             12
(USAID) awarded a technical assistance project to Solon Consulting and 3M HIS designed to introduce
case-mix in selected Eastern European countries, including Bulgaria.

35.     During this project, the country created a simple clinical data collection software tool, which was
used by selected hospitals to begin gathering basic data. Hospital staff received training so they could
consistently capture and report patient registration and clinical information. Additional software
systems have been created and refined over the years; for example, a software allowing for automated
top-down or step down cost accounting process and patient level costing for inpatient cases.

36.     In the early 2000s, technical experts and officials at MOH and NHIF pilot-tested DRGs for
payment purposes; among other outcomes, the project evaluated various grouper options and
contracting models. After careful consideration, the Australian classification, procedure coding, grouper,
and coding standards were selected.

37.      In 2010, the MOH began work to obtain a licensing agreement from the Australian government
for the grouper software. The Council of Ministers approved the guidelines, terms, and timeframe for
implementing a new DRG-based hospital financing model. The MOH and NHIF were authorized to
prepare a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations with the Australian government to purchase a
classification system. The agreement was signed in 2011, confirming Bulgaria’s right to use the ARDRG
classification system (version 6) until 2016.

38.      Currently, data are readily available throughout the country. Bulgarian experts have collected
and analyzed clinical and cost data, and used them to create country-specific relative weights. Data from
over a million inpatient cases have been grouped into DRGs; by 2008, approximately 92% of all inpatient
clinical data was being collected and grouped into DRGs using Version 4.5 of the Australian Grouper
(ARDRG).

39.     A special department was created in the National Centre of Public Health and Analysis (NCPHA),
and staffed by experts who have worked on previous projects for the introduction of DRGs in Bulgaria.
Technical experts have also prepared initial budget simulations of the impact of a DRG-based payment
and budgeting system. A wide variety of trainings have occurred on technical DRG components,
including coding, costing, and hospital management.

40.    In short, there are a number of experts in Bulgaria who have significant technical knowledge
about how to use DRGs to pay hospitals, and, over the past 20 years, much of the necessary background
and planning work and data analysis has been conducted to facilitate a pilot implementation of a DRG-
based payment system.

    2.3.           Moving from CCPs to DRGs

41.      Conceptually, Bulgaria moved from input- to output-based financing years ago; nonetheless,
problems remain. Despite this, and the aforementioned changes to the Bulgarian system — including
hospital autonomization and the adoption of contracting between the NHIF and providers — improved
efficiencies have not been fully realized in the health sector, as detailed in The World Bank Diagnostic
Report.




This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             13
42.      One reason is that, as a tool, CCPs are being used for budgeting and payment. The unnecessary
clinical stipulations and administrative requirements (unrelated to patient quality of care and safety)
that are embedded in the CCPs, CCP price negotiations, and the lack of spending cap enforcement have
created distortions and inefficiencies in the health system. As a result, the benefits of a true, output-
based case-based financing system are not being experienced. In order to create the appropriate
incentives to consolidate services, increase efficiency in the use of hospital resources, and reduce
hospital over-capacity, Bulgaria intends to move away from using CCP as the basis for its hospital
payment system and considers using DRGs, the approach increasingly used in OECD, EU, and emerging
market country health systems.

43.      In order to proceed, the report recommends to undertake a pilot DRG-based payment system
implementation project to explore whether and to what extent a DRG-based tool can generate
efficiency incentives, improve quality of patient care, and reduce unnecessary hospitalizations. The
country could continue using CCPs for their intended purpose: to define clinical pathways and guidelines
and to outline hospital conditions of participation to ensure patient safety and quality, while moving
towards using DRGs as the basis of its hospital payment system. Implementing a DRG-based payment
system can facilitate an equitable distribution of limited resources, greater transparency, and efficiency
incentives that are not in place today.

44.     Whatever tool is used as the basis of a hospital payment system must be implemented carefully
and accompanied by a consistently enforced auditing and monitoring function, processes largely absent
today. It should be noted that all case-based payment systems – in fact all payment systems - have
inherent limitations and risks, and must be carefully monitored to ensure that patients have effective
access to care, that providers are reporting accurately, and that payments or budgets are computed
appropriately.

        Chapter 3 - Implementing a DRG-Based Financing System
45.      This chapter presents specific information that details the primary technical steps required to
effectively implement a DRG-based financing system (either pilot implementation or full-scale national
roll-out). This chapter also provides detailed information about the technical decisions and
computations that must be understood before DRGs can be used as a basis to pay hospitals. It also
describes the roles and responsibilities across institutions for developing, implementing, and
maintaining a DRG-based financing system.

46.     In addition, this chapter includes an assessment of Bulgaria’s situation with respect to each step.
Bulgaria has a long history of studying DRGs, technical experts, and much of the infrastructure necessary
to begin a pilot implementation of a DRG-based payment is in place. The HMIS readiness for DRG
implementation is assessed and is presented in detail in Annex 2. Readers who do not need to
understand each technical step’s specific details can review the Bulgaria-specific information under each
technical step to understand where the country is with respect to the readiness of the step described.

3.1.     Background of Necessary Requirements

47.      Consideration to implement a DRG payment or budgeting system involves addressing the eight
steps listed below. Each is described in general, along with an assessment of Bulgaria’s readiness. The
latter is important for both technical staff and Bulgarian Stakeholders to be aware of, as it drives the
preparation of the DRG Action Plan and budget provided in the next Chapter.

48.     The following steps are required to move forward with a DRG-based payment or budgeting
system (each is described in detail below):

    1. Create a standardized method for coding patients’ clinical morbidity;
    2. Develop a hospital data-reporting system based on patient level data (the same minimum basic
       clinical data set data reported by all hospitals, for each discharged patient, using the same
       format);
    3. Implement a classification system and grouper software that assigns patients into DRGs;
    4. Design a costing methodology and collect hospital cost data for use in creating relative weights
       and hospital case-mix indices (both of these allow analysis of the intensity differences among
       treated cases and hospitals);
    5. Obtain expenditure data/available budget data to develop a national base price (or reference
       price) that represents the average cost of a case;
    6. Select a set of adjustments that may be required to cover costs that are outside the hospital’s
       control and simulate the impact of using one or more adjustments;
    7. Select and discuss transition options to mitigate large payment redistributions among hospitals
       from the current method of budgeting hospitals to the new method based on DRGs so that a
       smooth and careful migration can occur;
    8. Create a quality monitoring board and/or auditing body to monitor coding, costing, and the
       overall implementation of the new financing system.




This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             15
49.     Countries in the beginning stages of looking at implementing DRGs may take longer to complete
some of the steps above (i.e., introducing a coding system, collecting data, etc.). Countries that already
have a coding system in place and a history of clinical data collection may be able to move more quickly
towards implementation.

50.     While most of these steps are primarily technical in nature, they have political aspects to them,
for which decision-making and stakeholder input is critical. Simulating the impact of various policy
options will be important to help inform decision makers on the impact of their selected/desired policy
choices and on the implications of timing and/or funding that may be required. Fortunately such
capacity is available to assess the impacts of alternative policy choices.

3.2.     Steps for Implementing Case-Mix Systems

Step 1: Create a standardized method for coding patients’ clinical morbidity

51.      A standardized method for coding the patient’s clinical morbidity requires the selection and use
of a diagnosis and procedure coding system. Examples of coding systems include the World Health
Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 9 (ICD-9) or version 10 (ICD-
10), or a locally adapted version, such as the U.S. clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) or the Australian
modification (ICD-10-AM). For diagnosis coding, most countries use a version of the ICD-10. There is
greater variability in the systems used for procedure coding. For example, some countries use the U.S.
modification to the ICD-9 procedure coding system (ICD-9-CM), while others use the Australian
Classification of Health Interventions (ACHI). Still others use a homegrown procedure coding system.
Regardless of the system used, it is important that hospitals are trained and understand how to record
complete and accurate diagnosis and procedure information.

52.    Countries that seek to change their coding systems while they are also considering the move to
a DRG-based payment system will benefit from adopting a coding system that is already used to classify
or group cases into DRGs. Doing so mitigates the need to map from one coding system to another over
time, enables the use of a simpler system, and, in some cases, results in more accurate DRG
assignments.

53.      The “minimum basic data set” of key demographic and clinical data elements that must be
collected — along with diagnosis and procedure codes — includes: age, gender, admission date,
discharge data, discharge status, and any other information needed to assign patients into DRG groups.
It is important however for implementers to discuss and agree upon specific data-sharing processes and
determine ownership of the data that is collected and analyzed at the central level.

         The Bulgarian context

         Bulgaria currently uses ICD-10 to code diagnosis, and ICD-9-CM to code procedures. A shift to
         using ACHI was intended to begin on January 1, 2015, but has not yet been implemented,
         although certain aspects of “going live” have been completed (for example, translating and
         publishing ACHI codes). Additionally, relevant legislation is enacted calling for the use of ACHI
         but, until it is used, mapping tables from ICD-9-CM to ACHI can be used for the purposes of
         assigning DRGs.



This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             16
         Bulgarian hospitals have a long history of coding diagnosis and procedures; a cursory review
         of hospital data reveals that many hospitals report more than just a primary diagnosis code.
         These facilities often report one or more secondary diagnoses to capture co-morbidities and
         complications as well as one or more procedures to describe the clinical care given. In addition
         to the coded data, Bulgarian hospitals already collect all of the other necessary information
         included in the minimum basic data set for being able to assign DRGs to cases.


         This is very useful for the purposes of creating a                  All of the country’s hospitals have the
         DRG-based financing system. Doctors and                             necessary IT infrastructures and have
         medical professionals involved in coding will                       implemented various types of HMIS,
         need training in ACHI once it starts being used,                    including the free “Specialized
         however. Additionally, all information systems                      Software for Hospitals,” allowing for
         and software will need to be updated to reflect                     the collection and transmission of the
         the use of ACHI.                                                    minimum basic data set for DRGs.

         In terms of data existence, ownership, and sharing, there is a large amount of inpatient
         clinical data at the NHIF and the NCPHA. At present, each organization considers this
         information as its own and does not share it with the other. This makes it difficult to use all of
         the available data dynamically to calculate all of the parameters, conducting statistical
         analyzes, and running simulations. This information-sharing barrier should be overcome and
         formal data-sharing mechanisms established between the NHIF, NCPHA and MOH so that all
         available clinical and cost data can be used. Alternatively, if this is not possible, then hospitals
         would need to engage in duplicate reporting activities so that all of the necessary data is
         available at the institution responsible for preparing DRG simulations and calculations.

Step 2. Develop a hospital data-reporting system based on patient-level data

54.     Data reporting from hospitals to the central level must occur either manually or electronically.
Twenty years ago, when DRGs started to be more widely used around the world, clinical data reporting
largely occurred on a manual basis, with statisticians, nurses, and administrative staff abstracting the
minimum basic data set manually from patient charts and entering the information into an Excel file that
was transmitted to the central level. Today, data recording and collection primarily occur through the
use of electronic tools. Data are also transmitted more real-time through electronic means to the central
authority.

55.     The lack of timely, accurate, and complete data is typically the most significant problem that
hampers case-mix development projects. Adequate data are not always readily available, particularly if a
country does not have a history of capturing clinical data and submitting it to a central authority.

56.     In addition, case-mix implementation projects can come to a halt when decision-makers expect
100% accuracy and completeness of data before a project can move forward (i.e., they let the perfect
become the enemy of the good). While each country should strive to correct its data limitations, expert
experience indicates that data only improve after use, when hospitals know that their data are being
used to determine payment (rather than just being collected for study). For this reason, incomplete or
even imperfect clinical and/or cost data do not have to be barriers to moving forward with DRG-based
financing implementation.

         The Bulgarian context

         From an information systems perspective, processes are already in place to submit
         information from the hospitals to the NHIF on a daily basis using predefined XML formats
         (which contain all data elements needed for DRG assignment and much more). All hospitals
         are able to produce and transmit this data using existing software solutions from different
         vendors or software provided free-of-charge by the NCPHA. NHIF has software that handles
         the daily reports of the hospitals, imports data into a central database, performs various claim
         level audits and data validations, and calculates the reimbursable amount.

         In addition, approximately 200 hospitals voluntarily report their inpatient clinical data and
         their expenditure or cost data at the hospital, department, and patient level to the NCPHA for
         use in case-mix analysis. (The country has benefitted from the development of software that
         has been provided, for free, for hospitals to use to report clinical data.) If the government
         decides on expanding DRGs beyond the pilot-testing described in this report, then it will need
         to require all hospitals to report clinical and expenditure/cost data to a central entity (such as
         the NCPHA) to ensure that complete data are available for analysis and modeling. Processes
         are being developed to establish operational feedback for hospitals to help them clear any
         coding mistakes and avoid them in the future.

Step 3. Implement a classification system and grouper that assigns patients to DRGs

57.     The classification system is the basis on which the patient’s clinical information (specifically,
diagnoses, procedures, and other basic demographic and clinical data) is used to assign patients into
case-mix groups — in this case, into DRGs. Although the terms “classification” and “grouping” are used
interchangeably, a “grouper” is actually the software that has the classification system’s logic embedded
within it; the grouper software assigns inpatient cases into DRG groups based on the clinical data and
the minimum basic data set.

58.     This is the opposite of how CCPs work. With CCPs, there is no process of classification or
grouping because hospitals code only the exact diagnosis and medical procedures needed to assign the
CCP. In other words, hospitals pre-select the CCP (and often preselect CCPs with higher reimbursement
rates/prices) and then provide the treatment and medical procedures noted in the requirements under
the CCP. This is not the case with DRGs, since patients are classified into a DRG group based on software
logic that considers the combination of diagnoses and medical procedures reported as having been
performed (a physician cannot assign the DRG).

59.       The difference between DRGs and CCPs is important, because it underscores that DRGs were
developed using statistical methods to evaluate both clinical and resource homogeneity; CCPs were
created more subjectively based on discussions with and recommendations from specialists about which
diagnosis and procedures belong to different CCPs with little to no statistical analysis conducted of the
clinical or cost data.

60.     A classification system and grouper are pre-requisites to the implementation of a DRG-based
financing system. The ability to receive coded data about diagnosis and procedures from hospitals, and

use software to assign (i.e., “group”) these data into DRG groups is essential for developing a fair and
objective payment system that relies on objective underlying clinical and cost data.

61.      There are many available groupers, most of which are fairly similar and based on the original
concepts used by the U.S. Medicare’s DRGs. Some groupers are more advanced than others, and include
severity and other variables that impact resource consumption. A key question is whether a country
should create its own grouper, buy a grouper, borrow grouper logic from another country, or adapt an
existing grouper for its own use.

62.      There is no one correct answer and each country must evaluate its existing situation, the
political and practical needs, and the funds available before determining whether to embark on the
process of creating a “country-specific grouper.”

63.     Countries that are implementing case-mix payment systems should evaluate the strengths and
weaknesses of different groupers. One consideration is whether the software uses the diagnosis and
procedure coding systems being used by the country. This is critical, since the combination of various
diagnoses and procedures creates the DRG groups. If the underlying diagnosis and procedure
information being collected in the country does not match that of the grouper software, mapping tables
must be used to align the two. This is not an insurmountable problem, but creates an extra step that
could result in more time and resources being required. This step may also create some noise in the
final DRG assignments.

64.     Another consideration in selecting the grouper is where the country is in the process of
implementing a DRG-based payment system. During the study and pilot-testing phase, most countries
either borrow a grouper or obtain a low-cost research license. If the country decides not to proceed with
implementation, this saves the costs of buying a system or building a country-specific tool.

65.     Whether or not it is necessary to create a country-specific grouper is a widely debated subject
among experts. The best way for a country to resolve this question for itself is to conduct analyses to
determine whether a borrowed grouping system can be effectively implemented, or whether major
gaps exist in classifying the patients. If the latter situation exists, then a country-specific grouper may be
necessary.

66.     Most countries find that making minor refinements to existing groupers is sufficient, since DRG
groupings represent diagnoses and diseases that typically apply globally. Hence, many countries elect to
borrow a classification system and DRG grouper from another country and modify for their own use.
Very few countries have spent the significant time, effort, and money to develop their own DRG grouper
software. (In fact, experts believe that the primary reason countries create their country-specific own
groupers is to meet political needs, including obtaining clinical buy-in and ownership of the system,
rather than to address specific technical needs.) Regardless of the system used, the ultimate goal is to
ensure that the DRG groups used as the basis for financing appropriately classify patients into clinically
meaningful and resource-homogenous groups.

         of Health Interventions (ACHI) has been translated and adapted for use in the Bulgarian
         context.

         From a technical informatics perspective, existing processes can easily be adapted to assign
         DRGs to cases (instead of CCPs) and to compute a DRG-based reimbursement for the case
         (instead of assigning a CCP price). Of course the quality and completeness of coding will
         improve in time if DRGs are used, but what is available today is sufficient to begin.


Step 4. Design a costing methodology and hospital cost data to create relative weights and hospital
case-mix indices

67.     It is important to implement a standardized costing methodology in order to develop patient
level cost information. Some countries only use a step-down or top-down costing approach to derive
patient level costs. In very simple terms, this method estimates patient-level costs by allocating
departmental-level costs down to the patient-level using various metrics. Many countries have begun
DRG pilot implementation efforts with only aggregate data available to estimate patient-level costs and
then, over time, adopted other techniques.

68.     Other countries have begun by using both top-down and bottom-up costing methods; this
allows an allocation of administrative and ancillary department expenditures to the patient-level (i.e.,
top down) while also accounting for specific, direct, patient-level costs (i.e., bottom-up costing).
Bottom-up costing is more time-consuming and expensive, but can generate a more accurate and
complete picture of cost to treat each patient.

69.      Having more accurate patient level data allows for the development of more accurate country-
specific relative weights, which is critical in computing hospital case-mix indices (discussed below), and
other key elements of a DRG-based payment system. Relative weights and case-mix indices both allow
an analysis of the relative resource-intensity differences involved in treating various types of cases (i.e.,
cost of a normal delivery vs. a cesarean section). These concepts and their formulas are defined below.

Country-specific relative weights

70.      A relative weight is a measure of the expected cost of a           Relative Weight of DRG “X” =
given type of case (i.e., DRG), relative to the cost of the overall
average case. Hence, relative weights express the “costliness” of             Average cost of “DRG X”
one DRG relative to an average case. They function in the payment Overall average cost of a case
model as a multiplier of the base price (or reference price) to
generate the final DRG price. Because of their critical nature, it is
important to have an accurate set of relative weights; if this is not available, then other financing system
policies should be used to mitigate any potential large financial impacts.




This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             20
71.      For each DRG, a relative weight is
calculated that reflects a ratio of the                                    Example:

allows identification of the cases that are
inside or within the norm (i.e., inlier cases) and those outside of the norm (i.e. outlier cases). A further
technical step is required for the proper computation of the relative weighs which involves converting
cases with very high or low lengths of stay or cost, as described in the footnote6.

72.       Once relative weights are calculated, they must be reviewed to ensure that they make sense
from a clinical and resource use perspective. For example, an adjustment may be required to relative
weights that were created based on a small number of cases. These DRGs’ relative weights require a
clinical review by doctors from different specialties.

73.      Additionally, if the relative weight of a medical DRG (i.e. normal delivery) is higher than the
relative weight of a surgical DRG (i.e., C-section), review and adjustment will be required. This review
process is critical, especially in the early years of a system being introduced, since the cost data are likely
to be less robust. The review process can also involve comparing country-specific relative weights to
those computed in other countries.

Case-mix index

74.      As described above, relative weights allow a comparison of the resource intensity of one DRG
compared to another. The case-mix index (CMI) is a similar concept; it is a measure of one hospital’s
overall output of cases (volume and type of cases) compared to the average for all hospitals. Like
relative weights, the CMI is a unit-less number that allows a comparison of the differences in resource-
intensity to treat patients across hospitals. A hospital with a CMI of 1.0 represents patient of average
intensity.


6
  Relative weights are calculated using only inlier cases, therefore mathematical calculations are used to convert “outlier” ca ses
into “inliers” so that a true picture of the total number of patients treated and costs, on average, can be generated. This is
important, since DRG financing reflects payment for the average case and there are large differences in the standard deviations
among cases (e.g., surgical DRGs tend to have lower standard deviations then medical cases). Converting outliers into inliers
requires creating equivalent cases from actual cases. This allows an accounting of the resources required to treat non-standard (or
outlier) cases, compared to the resources required to treat standard (or inlier) cases. The conversion of outlier cases into
equivalent cases allows for the standardization of all cases on the basis of resource consumption. Standard and outlier case
definitions are based on data analysis and discussion with statisticians, clinicians, and economists. Ultimately, using equivalent
cases rather than a straight count of case volume is a better way to calculate each hospital’s contracted budget.

accurate coding practices exist. If two
hospitals have similar contracted budgets,
but very different case-mix indices, one
should ask why to understand whether the budgets are appropriate or not. If both hospitals have a
similar average cost per patient and share similar hospital characteristics (i.e., type of hospital, location,
etc.), then it might be said that the hospital with the higher CMI is more efficient as it is able to treat
more resource intensive patients for the same average cost as hospital treating less resource intensive
patients per it’s lower case-mix index. On the other hand, if the hospitals do not share similar
characteristics, then the fact that both have the same contracted budget may be reasonable if the
higher budget for the hospital with the lower CMS reflects additional money to cover costs that are
outside of the hospital’s control (i.e., the lower CMI hospital is located in a rural area).

76.     The CMI, hospital characteristics, cost structures, historical budgets, and future contracted
budgets must all be examined thoughtfully in order to have meaningful discussions about efficiency and
future hospital financing policies.

         The Bulgarian context

         Bulgaria has a long history of using both top-down and bottom-up costing to generate patient
         level cost information. Top-down costing is used to allocate non-medical (administrative,
         ancillary and support) departments costs to medical departments. In addition, bottom-up
         patient-level costs that are currently captured include (but are not limited to): medications,
         medical devices, supplies/consumables, implants, lab and imaging tests, operation
         procedures, invasive and other diagnostic procedures, etc. Both top-down and bottom-up
         costs are used to generate the final cost for each treated patient in most Bulgarian hospitals.

         Bulgaria is unique in that it has focused on capturing both types of costs since the beginning of
         DRG costing work in the country, in the 1990s. Therefore, existing Bulgarian cost data can (and
         should) be used to create the first round of Bulgaria-specific relative weights. The weights
         must be reviewed carefully and can be compared to those of other similar countries to
         determine if any anomalies exist and/or if refinements are required.

         As discussed above, the data that are currently available are sufficient for a use in a pilot DRG-
         financing project; in fact, Bulgaria has much more complete data than most other countries
         had when they began with DRG-based financing. Using these data to establish a national
         average price is discussed in the following section.

         If Bulgaria decides to implement a full-scale DRG-based financing system, technical experts
         should conduct a detailed review of the current costing methodology and make any necessary
         revisions so that even more accurate and robust cost data can be collected in the future.

Step 5. Obtain and use financial data to develop a reference price

77.      Once the CMI and volume of each hospital patients are computed, they need to be translated
this into a financial equivalent. To develop contracted hospital budgets, for example, one must define a
price so that one can multiply the CMI of a hospital by the volume by the price (called “reference or base
price”).

78.      The reference price represents the cost of the “average” hospital case. This value can be
computed at different levels (i.e., the hospital, peer group of similar hospitals, or national level) by
dividing the total money available or the total
money spent in a previous year to treat                           Reference or Base Price =
patients by the product of the equivalent                 Target expenditure or available budget
cases and the case-mix index. When this is          Sum of equivalent cases across all DRGs x CMI (1.0 at
calculated for each hospital, we can have a         national level if the relative weights are normalized)
sense of how the average cost per patient
varies by hospital and in comparison to the
national average. This information can inform
decision-makers how to move from the existing payment and budgeting system which may reflect
historical inefficiencies and inequities to a new one based on DRGs. The expectation under DRGs is that
ultimately a single national reference price would be used rather than hospital prices since all hospitals
should be able to provide the same clinical care (or “produce the same DRGs” in terms of resource
consumption) for the same average cost and hence receive the same average payment.

79.     Simulating the financial impact of using one reference price or another is necessary to evaluate
what types of payment or budget redistributions would occur by moving from the existing to a new
financing system. This in turn helps determine whether the impact needs to be moderated by the use of
adjustments or transition options, which are further described below.

80.      Countries can elect to begin with the           Hospital “A” Base or Reference Price =
hospital’s own reference price, which allows              Target expenditures for Hospital “A”
for what is often called “shadow-budgeting”                Sum total of equivalent cases * CMI
during the first year of DRG implementation
before migrating to a national reference
price. This allows hospitals to receive their same budget in the first year of DRGs as they did in the
previous year and is useful in countries where there is not a long history of coding, costing, data
collection, etc. Shadow budgeting allows hospitals and policy-makers time to learn the principles of
case-based payment and to develop policies under the new financing mechanism. Other countries
begin by using a portion of the hospital’s own price and a portion of the national price to set the overall
reference price with the goal of migrating to 100% use of the national price. Beginning in this manner
balances the need to move ahead with a new payment system while respecting the fact that hospitals
need time to learn and adapt to a new system while also giving decision-makers time to refine and
implement adjustments and policy decisions.

81.     The latter process can occur by gradually using an increasing percentage of the national price
and a decreasing percentage of the hospital’s price — until a single national price is in effect. (This is
described in more detail in the “transition options” section below.) The speed of migration from
hospital-specific prices to a single national price depends on factors such as: goals for the health system,

This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             23
availability of clinical data, accuracy and confidence in the relative weights and their underlying cost
data, technical capacity, hospital readiness, and the political desire to move more or less rapidly.

82.     Once the reference price is computed, new hospital-contracted budgets can be calculated
simply by multiplying the selected reference price (i.e., hospital-specific, national, or a mixture of the
two), the CMI, and the number of equivalent cases.

83.     A final and important consideration for setting the reference price is whether any money will be
carved out and set aside to fund necessary adjustments such as outliers, unexpected increases in
volume, etc. Doing so lowers the base price, but gives payors money to fund other policies. If money is
not carved out, then the payor will have to identify and allocate new funds to cover these policies.
Working with technical experts to run simulations on various parameters and analyzing the resulting
impact is critical to guide decision-making and to mitigate any large payment or budget redistributions
which if allowed to occur, can place the entire system implementation at risk

         The Bulgarian context

         Each country’s starting point to decide how to migrate to DRG-based financing fundamentally
         starts with a comparison of how the existing system to the new one. Bulgaria uses CCP-based
         financing in which each CCP is assigned a price, and that same price is paid to all hospitals.
         Hence, it has a culture of using a single national base or reference price.

         For this reason, the migration path for Bulgaria from CCP to DRG-based financing would likely
         focus on how the product prices are set (CCP vs. DRG), rather than whether hospital-specific
         prices or a single national price should be used in the new system.

         For Bulgaria, the major change in the hospital payment system would be the shift to DRG
         prices based on relative weights, with relative weights and payments being based on hospital
         cost data. Relative weights multiplied by the national price create a DRG price list. This is
         conceptually equivalent to the existing CCP price list, but underlying processes and data used
         to generate the DRG price list are very different from the way that the CCP price list is
         generated. The change from negotiated CCP prices to empirically driven DRG prices is likely to
         create large shifts in newly contracted budgets for some Bulgarian hospitals.

Step 6. Generate a set of adjustments to cover costs that are outside the hospital’s control

84.     The implicit principle in using DRGs as the basis of a payment system is that hospitals receive
funds based on the type and volume of patients treated rather than on the number of beds or other
structures (i.e., staff, equipment etc.), processes (i.e., number of hospitalization days), or variables that
are considered inputs or intermediate outputs. If DRG prices are not set appropriately, however, or if
other aspects of the financing system are inappropriately accounted for (which affect the true cost
differences across hospitals), adverse or perverse incentives could result and negatively impact system
implementation and, more importantly, the provision and quality of patient care.

Types of adjustments

85.       One way that decision-makers can ensure the payment system is equitable is through the
utilization of “adjustments,” a set of policies and/or transition mechanisms, which simultaneously create
incentives for hospitals to improve efficiency and quality of patient care, while enabling a smooth
implementation of the new financing system with minimal risk to both the provider and the payors.

86.      As discussed above, adjustments may be warranted in order to account for variations in hospital
costs for aspects of care that are truly outside of the hospital’s control. Any adjustment that is
implemented must be supported both conceptually and empirically; the additional costs considered for
adjustment must be outside the control of hospital management and the adjustment factor must make
a significant and systematic difference with respect to inpatient costs per discharge.

87.     Countries can begin with the assumption that no adjustments are needed and then use data and
regression analyses to determine what adjustments, if any, are needed to cover real cost variations that
may exist. Initially, most countries begin with only a few adjustments in order to keep their
implementation simple. Many countries make adjustments for inflation, specialty hospitals, and outliers
because these are typically beyond a hospital's control. Other standard adjustments include: local area
labor costs, urban/rural location, teaching status, and having a disproportionate share of certain types of
patients (i.e., low-income patients).

88.     Once adjustments have been selected, there are different ways to introduce them. A common
method is to simply pay for the actual costs by making a separate, direct payment. A second option is to
use a multiplier (or factor or coefficient) to adjust the base price used. A third option is to address
certain costs (such as outliers), by using specific formulas. A fourth option is to provide case- or DRG-
level adjustments by using hospital peer group averages or individual hospital base prices, rather than a
national base price as mentioned in the previous section to mitigate impact from the old system to a
new system of financing.

89.     Risk mitigation occurs by using adjustments and transition options. For this reason, it is critical
for technical experts to run simulations in order to understand the impact of various adjustments on the
new system, and to select which adjustments to use. This ensures hospitals that require protection
against costs outside of their control receive those protections in a pre-determined way as
implementation of the new payment or budgeting system occurs.

90.       The following are the most common types of adjustments:
         Inflation
         Geographic location
         Local wages
         Direct and indirect health professions education
         Specialty hospitals
         Outliers

91.    Annex 3 describes these adjustments in detail for those who wish to understand the concepts
more fully.

         The Bulgarian context

         Experts in Bulgaria have a great deal of experience and ability in thinking about policy options
         to address outliers. Over the last few years, they have prepared a number of outlier
         calculations and can share this with work decision-makers.

Step 7. Developing methods to implement adjustments and/or transition options and simulating them
to allow for a smooth and careful migration to a new financing system

92.      Adopting a DRG-based financing system will inevitably alter the resources that are available to
specific hospitals. For this reason, changing a country’s financing method to a DRG-based system must be
done slowly and methodically in order to monitor and mitigate risks appropriately. Otherwise, large and
destabilizing shifts can occur as a result of the existing biases, care delivery patterns, constraints, and
incentives that differ from the new method. Providers, payors, and decision-makers all need time to adapt
to a new method of financing with minimal financial risk. A gradual transition enables stakeholders to
fully understand new concepts including new coding systems, the importance of documentation,
electronic clinical data reporting, cost data collection and reporting, and simulation modeling. For this
reason, the methods used to implement adjustments and the pace of transition depends on many
factors, including political considerations, existing hospital readiness, and the accuracy of clinical and
cost data reporting.

93.     Regardless of which of the methods described are used, technical experts must assess the
impacts of using various adjustments and transition policy options on the new system, and select which
option to use. The two most widely used transition options are blending different base prices over time
to arrive to the national base price, and using risk corridors to mitigate losses and gains, or a
combination of the two. These methods are described below.

Blending Different Base Prices

94.     The concept of blending utilizes two base prices in varying percentages so that, in the initial
years, historical funding is preserved and only a small part of the contracted budget comes from the
new financing method. This option mitigates the large financial impacts that can occur when moving to
a new financing system. Key considerations in timing the shift to using 100 percent of the national price
include the country’s current system and how different it is from the new one, the level of impact
hospitals would be expected to face each year, the quality and accuracy of the underling clinical and cost
data, and the pace of change desired by decision-makers.

95.     The most widely used strategy is to blend the                Hospital Budget Formula =
hospital’s own base price with a national price so that              Base Price * Hospital CMI *

majority of hospitals’ contracted budgets/payments are
based on their own historical experience, and a smaller
percentage of their contracted budgets/payments are based on the national experience.

96.    For example, if decision-makers want to migrate to a new financing system fairly rapidly, then
they might expect hospitals to adapt over a period of three years from their own base price to the

                                                                                                                             26
national average. In this case, hospital budgets are calculated using the hospital’s own average cost or
base price, and this value will differ from the national-level base price (it could be higher or lower).

97.     The Table 2 here shows how blending can occur over three to four years where a portion of the
hospital’s budget/payments are
based on its own base price and a Table 2. Blending Prices Over 3 to 4 Years
portion of it is set using the                                  2016 2017        2018      2019
national price. If the government National Base Price %          0%      34%      66%     100%
wanted to migrate in three years, Hospital Base Price %         100% 66%          34%       0%
then in the first year of system implementation, it would compute the hospital’s overall budget based
on 33% of the national price and 66% on the hospital’s own price and migrate over three years to the
hospital’s budget being based on 100% of the national price. A four-year migration as shown in Table 2
allows for the first year of system implementation to be 100% budget neutral with the hospital’s
contracted budget being kept essentially the same as the previous year in recognition that hospitals
need time to adapt.

Risk Corridors

98.     Under a risk corridor, limits are placed on the amount of money that hospitals can gain or lose in
any one year. Risk corridors are a useful transition tool because contracted budgets/payments are often
based on historical information, and newly coded and/or costed data could vary significantly from what
is reported under the new financing system. If what is contracted varies from the hospital’s actual
experience, a risk corridor provides the hospital with additional money and also limits the payor’s
exposure to paying out more than is expected.

99.     Using risk corridors is also helpful if the first year of the new financing system is based 100% on
a hospital’s own base (i.e., the four-year blending/transition policy described) as this still allows for
some gains and losses under the new system and can help hospitals more quickly learn and adapt to the
new system.

100.     A risk corridor states that:
        Hospitals cannot gain more than “X”% over the previous year’s contracted budget/payments;
        Hospitals cannot lose more than “Y”% over the previous year’s contracted budget/payments.

101. Both “X” and “Y” need to be defined based on budget simulations and through discussions with
decision-makers. For example, typical ranges include, +/- 3% or +/- 5%. It is important to note that “X”
and “Y” may also be dependent on whether a blending strategy is also utilized. Using risk corridors
creates incentives for hospitals to code accurately and completely, to perform efficiently under the new
system, and protects both hospitals and payors from experiencing large shifts during the early years of a
new financing system implementation.

102. Using a risk corridor also requires data analyses and modeling and is also dependent on the
funds the government has available to put towards use of this transition mechanism. Similar to the
discussion about allocating funds for adjustments, decision-makers must either hold funds back from
the overall amount of money available for contracting to fund the risk corridor, or allocate additional
funds to cover this.

         The Bulgarian context

         As noted above, it is likely that a DRG-based pilot payment system implementation in Bulgaria
         would begin with use of a single national price, since there is already a culture of using a
         national price. The major change for Bulgaria at this time has to do with the type of case-
         based tool used and, specifically, shifting from using CCP prices to DRG prices that are based
         on empirically derived relative weights that measure resource-intensity differences better than
         CCPs do.

         This will result in a redistribution of resources, which means some hospitals will receive larger
         total payments/budgets, and some will see lower funding levels. Stakeholders will need to
         make decisions on whether and what adjustments to utilize and what types of transition
         mechanisms are necessary to adopt to support migration to a new financing system, to
         promote efficiency objectives, and to create better alignment of incentives across care settings
         (i.e., hospital care vs. ambulatory care for one-day stay cases vs. outpatient care, etc.). Using
         adjustments is a good strategy to mitigate risks during the first few years of a new financing
         system implementation.

Step 8. Create a quality monitoring board and/or auditing body to monitor coding and costing data
and other aspects of the new financing system

103. Most countries grapple with the question of whether efficiency incentives created by using a
DRG-based payment or budgeting system go too far in incentivizing hospitals to cut costs beyond what
might be “reasonable” (essentially reducing existing waste and inefficiency but without reducing the
quality of care provided to patients).

104. Some of the questions raised by DRG
                                                                    Key Monitoring & Evaluation Questions:
critics about DRG cost-cutting incentives (see
box) are important to understand and
address. These questions are common with                       Are hospitals eliminating unnecessary and/or

105. Implementing a sustainable payment system that is fair to both the payer and the provider
requires strong contracting rules and an auditing and monitoring component along with a commitment

                                                                                                                             28
to link payment to high-quality health care, favorable patient outcomes, to evaluate hospital activity,
and to prevent the system from being cheated or “gamed.”

106. Under DRG-based financing, hospitals know they are receiving money for the patient with an
average length of stay and average costs for the DRG rather than the actual length of stay or the actual
cost of the case. The system of averages creates both positive and negative incentives. Positive
incentives include increasing efficiency and reducing waste, while maintaining or improving the quality
of patient care. Negative incentives or risks include trying to maximize profits by treating patients with
too few services or procedures, or transferring them to another hospital, or discharging patients
inappropriately early (i.e., “quicker and sicker”), etc. This must be carefully monitored.

107. It is clear that a DRG payment or budgeting system creates incentives for hospitals to operate
more efficiently in their treatment of inpatients; their selection of drugs, devices, equipment, and capital
investments; and in their determination of the most appropriate care setting (e.g., inpatient, day-
surgery, outpatient, etc.) where patients receive care. Behavioral changes that occur by hospital
managers and physicians ultimately enable limited health care funds to be allocated and used
appropriately, without compromising patient’s access to care or quality of care.

108. In addition, clear penalties for fraudulent behavior must be communicated to providers up-front
to reinforce that inappropriate care delivery (i.e., discharging patients before they are well,
inappropriately coding patient care and/or conditions), will not be tolerated and that consequences
such as being forced to pay back funds, dropped from NHIF participation, and, legal action could be
taken against provider as needed. Key data elements to monitor include but are not limited to: lengths
of stay, mortality rates, morbidity rates, re-admission rates, reporting incorrect diagnosis and/or
procedure codes to generate higher-paying DRGs, higher-than-expected transfer rates, unexpected
volume increases, higher-than-expected outlier cases, and in general, incorrect or potentially fraudulent
data. Assessing these elements helps to ensure that the DRG-based financing system is being
implemented in a way that mitigates risk, and is working as expected.

109. In addition, aligning incentives across care settings and payment mechanisms used for different
care settings is critical and must be carefully considered. For example, providing much higher payment
to hospitals for procedures that are only one-day stays could create the perverse incentive of hospitals
admitting patients who might otherwise be treated in an outpatient specialist clinic. Waiting times to
receive certain specialized tests and services is another example; hospitals should not be incentivized to
admit patients who could otherwise be treated in the outpatient setting. These and other similar issues
must be addressed over time in order to see the best results of implementing a DRG-based payment or
any hospital payment system


         The Bulgarian context

         An Auditing and Quality Monitoring function must accompany any DRG implementation in
         Bulgaria. Our understanding is that there is an auditing and monitoring department within the
         NHIF that could be tasked to conduct the types of activities described above. This
         department’s capacity and knowledge must be assessed.

         Nevertheless, what is key for decision-makers to know at this time is that a strong auditing

         and monitoring function must accompany a DRG pilot or full-scale implementation. Without
         such an entity to carry out the necessary functions, the overall implementation of DRGs would
         be at risk. If sufficient capacity does not exist within the NHIF, it may be possible to strengthen
         it, or decision-makers may determine a new entity is required which could be a part of the
         Ministry of Health, or the NCPHA, or a separate organization altogether.

         It is critical that this entity, regardless of where it is housed, engage in the types of data
         monitoring activities described above. This entity should also provide hospitals with feedback
         reports so they are aware that their data, reporting, outcomes, and other indicators are being
         monitored. Moreover, penalties must be implemented for negative patterns and/or behaviors
         — otherwise hospitals will continue to game the system and quality of care could be
         compromised.

         It should be noted again that the risks described above are not unique to DRGs, but exist with
         most payment/budgeting systems, including Bulgaria’s CCP system today. The key to
         eliminating such risks is auditing, monitoring, transparency, and holding providers
         accountable.

3.3.     Bulgaria’s Readiness and Key Next Steps to Implement DRGs-Based Financing

110. Implementing DRGs as the basis of a payment or budgeting system requires two key elements to
be in place: technical readiness and political will. “Technical readiness” means that there must be
sufficient knowledge and capacity to accurately create, analyze, and implement a DRG-based payment
or budgeting system. Further, an implementation approach must be decided. Generally speaking, there
are two broad options: (1) to begin implementation slowly with all hospitals included; or (2) to begin
with a small number of hospitals so that policies can be “piloted” and refined before broader
implementation occurs. The report proposes that Bulgaria proceeds with DRGs by doing a pilot
implementation with a small number of hospitals in order to select policy options, to determine how
best to use DRGs and CCPs together, and to build consensus and momentum in the country before
proceeding with broader implementation. Note however, that it is possible to move forward with full
DRG implementation involving all hospitals given the high level of technical capacity in the country.

111. The previous section described the necessary technical steps and activities that must be in place
to implement a DRG based payment or budgeting system. It also described the current Bulgarian context
for each step. As a result of Bulgaria’s long history of studying DRGs, much technical expertise has been
developed in the country, and Bulgaria can leverage this experience to begin a pilot DRG-based payment
or budgeting system implementation. Existing knowledge and expertise can also be supplemented by
using outside experts, by consulting the literature, and working with Ministries of Health and Health
Insurance Funds in neighboring countries.

112. Additionally, the country already has in place certain infrastructure components that are
essential to a DRG system. Hospitals already have the health information systems technology to record
diagnosis and procedure codes, to submit data to a central authority in an electronic format, and to
capture cost data using a simple costing software. The HMIS and information technology (IT) capacity
exist to inform and guide a pilot DRG implementation project. Of course, this infrastructure and capacity
should be refined, central-level technical capacity expanded, and hardware and software upgrades

this can be found in Annex 2.

113. The second element, political will, is                     Hospitals have IT infrastructure and systems that

114. In Bulgaria, technical capacity exists and the Government’s health reform program advocates
improvements in hospital efficiency. However, there are many misconceptions about what DRGs are,
their impacts and the country’s readiness to implement. It might be that these misconceptions are being
tactically used as arguments against a reform which would change the status quo and bring greater
transparency and objectivity to hospital payments than the current CCP method. Bulgaria has the
technical capacity, data, and infrastructure in place — in fact, other countries have successfully
implemented a DRG-based system with far less technical readiness. Since 2010, although a number of
political decisions have been made to support the use of DRGs, the system has not yet been
implemented as a method for paying hospitals.

     Chapter 4 - Action Plan and Budget to Implement a Pilot DRG
                     Payment or Budgeting System

115. This Chapter outlines the primary Action Steps and associated activities to pilot-test a DRG
system for budgeting or paying hospitals in Bulgaria. For those seeking a deeper understanding of the
Action Steps and budget, Annex 4 provides additional detail. It lists specific activities under each Action
Step and an estimated time frame for completing the work. The detailed steps stem from Bulgaria’s
level of expertise, milestones already been achieved, and outline what is still needed in order to move
forward with a pilot implementation program. Budget figures are given in U.S. Dollars and inclusive of
both a low and high estimate in order to provide a sense of the cost range associated with specific
activities, depending on what decisions are taken.

    4.1.           Rationale for a Nine-Month Action Plan Timeline for Implementation

116. Should the Government decide to move ahead with a pilot implementation, the suggested nine-
month timeframe could be deemed overly expeditious. This choice however, made in consultation with
experts, is deliberate and reflects the technical readiness to proceed. In other words, the international
and local technical experts on the team agree that this pilot test can occur in the short nine-month
timeframe but the flexibility exists to expand this timeline to a longer period of time if determined by
Bulgarian stakeholders. The final timeframe will depend upon the actual technical capacity available, the
desire and speed to implement reforms, the budget available, resolution of any information systems
issues, etc. and the Government’s actions to manage the reform.

117. The Action Plan and Budget must be used as a “living” document that will require additions
and/or adjustments as decision makers and technical experts sit together to plan their way forward with
a pilot implementation. While the plan has been tailored to the specific Bulgarian context (i.e., taking
into account the past technical work, current knowledge, and available data), we fully expect decision-
makers to review and revise it to meet their needs, timeframes, and overall health system goals.

118. For example, decision makers may determine that a new costing system is not necessary; this
activity would be removed from the Action Plan, along with the associated budgetary estimate. Review
of the Action Plan must be a collaborative one that includes Bulgarian decision-makers and Bulgarian
technical experts. International (and independent) technical experts could also usefully contribute to the
discussion. The Plan can then be revised to meet the identified goals on an appropriate timeframe and
within the parameters of Bulgaria’s political and economic environments.


    4.2.           Main DRG Action Plan Implementation Steps and Estimated Costs

119. The implementation plan contains the following main tasks, each supported by activities that
are detailed in Annex 4. The main tasks described are tailored to what is needed in Bulgaria at this time
and therefore do not conform to the general steps outlined in Chapter 3 for DRG. The budget estimates
are intended to serve as a starting point for decision-makers and technical staff to work through and
adapt based on the specific decisions that are made with respect to DRG implementation. The costs of

Each of the Main Tasks is broken out below. Readers can either go through this detail or refer to the full
Action Plan in Annex 4.

Main Task 1: Developing Infrastructure and Institutional Capacity to Support Rapid Implementation

120. Institutional ownership, technical capacity, and knowledge are critical components that must be
developed in order to support Bulgaria’s transition from CCP-based to DRG-based payments. Having
institutional awareness and technical knowledge on how to implement a DRG-based payment or
budgeting system in the content of broader health system goals is critical, as using DRGs to structure
inpatient hospital payments will impact other care settings, as well.

121. The goal of any capacity-building work is to create the necessary capacity and knowledge on all
key DRG technical aspects of implementing, expanding, and maintaining a case-mix based financing
system (i.e., coding, costing, data collection, grouping, data analysis, etc.). It is necessary to improve the
capacity of local stakeholders, staff, and institutions — especially around the more highly technical
payment policy issues described in previous chapters (i.e., updating the relative weights, simulating
various adjustment options, etc.). Existing knowledge on these topics exists among local technical
experts especially at the NCPHA and should be leveraged.

122. As a first step towards pilot DRG implementation, senior decision-makers at the MOH, the NHIF,
the BMA, the Ministry of Finance, and other key stakeholders must be fully briefed on the major
technical concepts related to implementing a pilot DRG-based payment or budgeting system and the
necessary decisions that must be made in the short-term in order to begin preparatory activities for a
pilot implementation with the selected pilot hospitals.

123. These stakeholders must clearly articulate the political decision and commitment to conduct the
pilot-test using the DRGs tool to finance hospital care. Stakeholders must gain a more balanced
understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of CCPs and DRGs and should understand that CCPs and
DRGs can co-exist in a new, more effective system. It will be important to create champions and manage
the opponents.


This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             33
124.     Specifically, stakeholders must clearly understand that:
        The manner in which CCPs are used for hospital financing is flawed;
        DRGs can be implemented as an output-based financing system with appropriate efficiency
         incentives;
        Open-ended budgets will not be allowed; in other words, hospitals will have to live within the
         means of their contracted budget unless there are extenuating circumstances;
        Annual updates will be made using data and will be made transparent to all stakeholders;
        The impact of DRGs will be closely audited and monitored;
        Any fraud or abuse detected will be addressed with penalties.

125. Another key step is the creation of an Implementation Strategy Team (IST) comprised of
decision makers, stakeholders, and technical experts. The IST should meet regularly (ideally weekly) to
address specific topics with the expectation that policy issues will be discussed and decided upon. The
IST should be responsible for overseeing the necessary technical and policy actions described in the
Action Plan in Annex 4. For example, they should be in charge of ensuring that the Parliamentary Health
Commission or Council of Ministers re-releases and/or re-signs the document calling for DRG
implementation, which was originally signed in 2010.

126. Additionally, defining institutional roles and responsibilities and ensuring the designated
institutions have the appropriate, trained staff needed to carry out the necessary activities is essential to
pilot test a DRG-based payment or budgeting system. Specifically, designating one or more institutions
and/or departments within existing institutions to be responsible for developing, simulating,
implementing, and maintaining all technical aspects of introducing DRGs is necessary for successful and
sustainable long-term implementation. From a technical perspective, existing capacity within the NCPHA
Case-Mix Office can be leveraged for the pilot implementation.

127. Development and refinement of all technical and policy-related activities must occur in a
meaningful and consistent manner. A clear delineation of roles and responsibilities by “institution,” will
ultimately be necessary to ensure a successful and sustainable implementation of a DRG-based payment
or budgeting system especially if expanded to more hospitals beyond the pilot which is what we expect.

128. These decisions include determining what institutions (i.e., MOH, NHIF, etc.) are in charge of
maintaining and updating the classification system, the coding system and rules; the on-going
development of the grouper software; and the development of annual pricing updates are critical and
must be addressed. There is no single correct way to assign roles and responsibilities — and the process
for doing so varies greatly by country — but these decisions must be made in order for system to
succeed. One common approach is to have the payment authority take ownership, as it ultimately bears
responsibility for the fund allocation and payments.

129. The MOH should issue official statements to hospitals about the pilot DRG financing
implementation, and stress the importance of attending diagnosis and procedure coding training
sessions held by the NCPHA. In addition, the MOH should release an Order requiring all hospitals to
submit their clinical data to the NCPHA. Specifications on the required data elements should be
discussed with the NCPHA, as they can provide a detailed list of the data element. Pilot hospitals should
feel the impetus to report data and view their voluntary involvement in the pilot financing as something
that is both highly regarded and valued with respect to national policy-making. Finally, the MOH should
work closely with the NCPHA to evaluate the infrastructure needs required.

European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             34
Main Task 2: Creating Hospital Processes and Conducting Trainings

130. Expanding the existing technical capacity that exists in Bulgaria requires investment of both time
and resources so that staff and institutions are better equipped with all necessary infrastructure and
knowledge. Without this type of capacity building, long-term success and sustainability of the process
will be jeopardized.

131. Hospital must be selected for the pilot implementation. Selection criteria should include
geographic location, size, type of hospital (i.e., public, private, regional, municipal, university, etc.),
submission of clinical and cost data, and any other parameters Bulgarian decision-makers deem
important.

132. It is recommended that Bulgaria begin with a small group of pilot hospitals so that policies can
be tested and refined. A group of 20-40 hospitals to be included since this is a small enough group to be
manageable in the short implementation time frame provided but large enough to provide meaningful
results. If decision makers would like to include more hospitals in the pilot, that likely fine as long as all
of the included hospitals are able to receive training on coding, costing, data quality, data submission,
and an overview of DRG fundamentals before their financing is changed from CCPs to DRGs. Involving
them in adjustment and transition policy discussions may also be useful as they are part of the team
testing DRGs and should be included.

Main Task 3: Implementing a Coding and Classification System

133. Bulgaria has already conducted a significant amount of work to implement a coding and
classification system. Additional details related to this work can be found in Annexes 1 and 2.

134. The translation and adaption the Australian Classification of Health Interventions (ACHI) has
been completed. In addition, the necessary legislative base exists for the implementation of ACHI as an
official coding system for medical procedures in Bulgaria. ACHI was officially introduced with Ordinance
of Minister of Health first published in GG No 75, 9, in September 2014. Afterwards it was changed with
GG No 106, 23, in Dec 2014. This second ordinance indicates use to begin as of March 31, 2015. Text in
the Ordinance specifies that the NHIF is obliged to update all of its documentation and its information
systems by the end of 2015.

135.     To date, the following activities have been completed:

        Translating the classification system (including the main diagnostic categories and diagnostic-
         related groups, as well as coding standards);
        Regrouping all data with version 6.0 of the Grouper;
        Conducting a detailed analysis of the relative weights;
        Calculating relative weights by using Bulgarian data and comparing them with foreign relative
         weights of countries using a similar coding system;
        Mapping the medical procedures from ICD-9 CM to ACHI;
        Mapping the medical diagnoses from ICD-10 to ICD-10 AM;
        Translating and publishing updates of ICD-10 (2004-2014).




This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             35
136. Currently, the greatest need with respect to implementing the coding and classification system
is to ensure that all hospitals are trained to report complete and accurate diagnoses and procedures in a
manner required by DRGs. (See above, training.)

137. ICD-10 diagnosis coding and ACHI procedure coding training materials must be created for use in
the facility trainings, along with in-person and e-learning materials. These materials will be used to
“train the trainer” so that staff can conduct regional coding trainings for pilot hospitals (and,
subsequently, all other hospitals).

Main Task 4: Engaging in Clinical Data Collection and Analysis

138. Before data collection and analysis can occur, the central and local level clinical data collection
software must be refined, if needed. Clinical data can then be collected on a monthly basis from
hospitals participating in the pilot project (and, subsequently, all other hospitals). These data must be
reviewed for accuracy and completeness, and feedback provided to hospitals on errors, average number
of codes reported, top diagnosis and procedures etc.

139. In addition, the following basic data collection and software maintenance functions will need to
be addressed annually:
     Improve, update and maintain the data reporting application;
     Improve, update and maintain the data submission module/application;
     Maintain the central database;
     Maintain the grouper software;
     Develop and maintain web portals, such as the hospital management reporting portal;
     Conduct data analysis activities.

Main Task 5: Assessing and Analyzing Grouping Systems and Data Processing

140. Bulgaria already has an agreement in place with the Australian government to use Australian
DRGs. Thus in this regard, there is likely not much work that will need to occur until the license comes
up for renewal in June 2016. Maintaining the existing grouper software and continuing to group hospital
clinical data will be the main activities that need to occur on a regularly basis. Grouped data will need to
be analyzed and management reports provided to participating hospitals (i.e., top 10 DRGs, average
length of stay by DRG, etc.)

141. If Bulgaria expands the pilot project to full DRG-based financing implementation for all hospitals,
then it may be desirable to develop a Bulgarian grouper, but this is not a necessary activity in the short-
term.

Main Task 6: Conducting Costing to Develop Relative Weights

142. Initial activities include determining whether the existing expenditure data collection process
needs to be reviewed and/or refined, and whether a costing study is needed to support the creation of
Bulgarian DRG relative weights. (The current data may suffice.) This involves identifying the costs that
are being collected and streamlining their capture across all hospitals, and then developing and
implementing costing standards.



This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             36
143. Hospital staff may require training to ensure the accuracy of the cost data collection process.
Data are to be collected and analyzed on a monthly basis, and hospitals provided with feedback. When
six months of data have been collected, the first set of relative weights can be generated, and compared
to previously calculated relative weights in Bulgaria and those from weights obtained from countries
that resemble Bulgaria. Using different weight sets, hospital case mix indices should be computed and
analyzed, and the relative weights adjusted using both quantitative data and qualitative clinical input
from physician experts who may be able to provide more information about the costs of certain clinical
services and procedures, especially newer ones that may not be evidenced in the collected data.


Main Task 7: Developing a Contracting System and Migrating to DRG-Based Contracting

144. The BMA, National Consultants, and the NHIF should work closely to refine all of the CCPs to
create a smaller number of CCPs (i.e., approximately 30-40) organized along body systems (i.e.,
Cardiology, Respiratory Diseases, Nervous System, etc.) that would be truly useful as clinical guidelines.
This work should involve a review of clinical guidelines, pathways, and protocols used around the world.

145. A review of external guidelines will help the National Consultants and the NHIF create a more
robust set of revised CCPs that should provide physicians with more meaningful clinical and quality
information, and also allow the NHIF to ensure that minimum contracting standards are in place, while
allowing the removal of restrictive administrative requirements.

146. This work should occur in tandem with the movement to a pilot-DRG based payment or
budgeting system. It is possible that for a few years, both systems would be used as a method for
determining hospital budgets but over time the idea would be to migrate away from CCP-based
financing and towards DRG based financing.

147. The primary activities under this DRG Task are related to understanding adjustments and
transition policies and simulating them. It is likely that many different parameters will need to be
simulated, but before technical staff can simulate, they will need decision-makers to select specific
policy options of interest for analysis.

148. Additionally, a review and revision of the existing National Framework Contracting process will
likely need to occur in order to allow for DRG-based budgeting and payment to occur for the pilot
hospitals as well as all hospitals over time if that decision is taken.

149. To achieve the goal of efficiency, decision-makers will need to establish fair payment/budgeting
policies which includes allowing for specific adjustments, outliers, and an appropriate transition time
frame so that hospitals have time to begin harnessing the efficiency incentives inherent in a DRG-based
payment system as they slowly migrate away from the current CCP mechanism. Two such incentives
include reducing the patient’s length of stay and migrating cases from the higher-cost hospital setting to
a lower-cost day stay or outpatient setting. Hospitals focused on efficiency will begin making changes
naturally since they will receive a fixed amount of money based on the average case for a particular DRG
for an average length of stay. To the extent possible, they will provide care in a manner to reduce the
number of days in the hospital and also may try to treat the patient on ambulatory basis (i.e., cataract
surgery, patients with hypertension, etc.).



This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             37
150. Decision-makers can directly incentivize hospitals to make such changes by offering a financial
benefit for certain behaviors it would like to see adopted. For example, if the payment for a specific
inpatient DRG was set at the same rate as the payment to treat the patient as a day case or an
outpatient case, hospitals would be strongly incentivized to treat the case in a day-surgery or outpatient
setting as the cost would be lower but the same payment level would be realized. This should only be
done after careful analyses have been done on short-stay DRGs (i.e., those with 0-, 1-, or 2-day lengths
of stay) and a clinical review by physicians on certain types of patients seen in hospital today that should
not need to over time, assuming other care settings are available. Options for aligning incentives
between inpatient hospital care and one-day stays as well as outpatient cases should be analyzed and
simulated, and options communicated to hospitals once they are selected to be a part of the new DRG-
based payment or budgeting system.

151. Promoting complete and accurate coding and data reporting and encouraging the provision of
high-quality care in the right setting is also critical and can be facilitated by communicating the penalties
for fraudulent reporting as well as poor quality of care (see below under auditing and monitoring).

152. In addition, hospitals should have the autonomy to hire and fire staff and to use funds saved by
providing high-quality, efficient care, in a manner they believe is appropriate (i.e., investing in
equipment, making repairs, etc.). If existing laws do not support hospital directors being able to use
“profits/surplus” in a manner to benefit the hospital, there will be little incentive to increase efficiency
or to provide care in the most appropriate clinical settings.

Main Task 8: Auditing and Monitoring

153. There is an auditing and monitoring department within the NHIF. Decision-makers must
determine if this is the department that will handle auditing and monitoring activities related to DRG
implementation and if so, then the capacity of this department will likely need to be strengthened. If a
separate auditing and monitoring body is created, then staff determinations will be important; will staff
be redeployed from other departments/institutions or will new people need to be hired?

154. Regardless, training must be provided on how to review information and data from a DRG
coding and documentation perspective. In addition, existing auditing software and/or data edits will
need to be updated so they edit claims based on DRG data issues and parameters rather than CCP
requirements.

155. Case-mix (and, hence, DRG) is only a tool — its efficiency depends upon implementing it in a
way that creates the right incentives to promote and increase efficiency, transparency, objective
resource allocation, and reduction of waste and corruption in the health sector. This can only occur if
appropriate laws and regulations, are created, implemented, and upheld. There must be accountability
in the system, which means engaging in auditing and monitoring activities, and enforcing penalties (i.e.,
fines) for identified fraud and abuse. There must also be a commitment to honoring budget ceilings,
otherwise hospitals have no incentive to be efficient.

156. Existing laws and regulations that create negative or competing incentives from those created
by using DRGs for financing, must be addressed; otherwise, the potential benefits of a DRG-based
financing system will not be realized. Auditing and monitoring mechanisms let providers know that their
actions are being watched. All parties need to know their data will be reviewed to identify patterns of

European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             38
inappropriate lengths of stay, re-admissions, or otherwise incorrect or fraudulent cases (i.e., reporting
incorrect diagnosis or procedures simply to generate higher paying DRGs).

157. Technical experts in Bulgaria already have knowledge on using statistical methods to examine
things such as inappropriate length of stay cases and readmission rates by trending patterns by hospital,
by peer groups of hospitals etc. This can be done to see if certain hospitals systematically have outliers,
for example or have high readmission rates (high must be defined using statistical methods). A re-
admissions policy may also need to be implemented in order to mitigate risk on the side of the
purchaser overpaying for care by simply not allowing additional payments for hospitals who readmit a
patient with the same diagnosis within 15 or within 30 days. These are just a few examples of the types
of issues that need to be discussed, analyzed, monitored, and communicated to hospitals.

158. Auditing and monitoring inpatient clinical data is critical to ensure that the incentives created by
the DRG payment mechanism are being harnessed appropriately, are not placing patients at risk, and do
not create unintended impact on the outpatient or day care settings.

    4.3.           Caveats about Budget Estimate

159. The Action Plan and budget provided in Annex 4 describe the activities believed necessary to
complete over a nine-month period to begin pilot testing a DRG-based payment system in
approximately 40 hospitals and to work with those hospitals during the first year of the implementation.

160. It should be noted that no funds have been budgeted for some of the described activities; this
occurs when it is believed that existing staff can either complete the work within their current job
descriptions, or be redeployed to new activities at no additional cost. Additionally, for some activities,
both a “low” and a “high” budget estimate are provided. This range indicates that the activity can be
completed in different ways, each of which carries a lower or higher cost based on specific
implementation decisions.

161. For example, if existing space is used for meetings or for trainings (i.e., conference rooms at the
MOH, the NHIF, or the NCPHA), there will be no space rental costs and the only expenses will be minimal
costs for refreshments. If these activities are held in rented space, there would be a higher cost for
them. Even so, the cost could be higher or lower depending on exactly how and where the activity takes
place.

162. Some activities show only a small range in the costs. For example, training costs are fairly well-
known, so there is less variation in these estimates. (Training costs were estimated by local experts
based on their knowledge of costs and their expectation of a certain number of attendees.)

The Excel version of the Action Plan and Budget contains notes about these issues, so readers can gather
more detail, if desired. If the assumptions are incorrect, Bulgarian decision-makers and technical experts
can update and/or correct the figures provided.

163. The budget estimate does not cover expansion of a DRG-based system to all Bulgarian hospitals.
If such an expansion is undertaken, a specific Action Plan with dedicated activities and budget would
need to be prepared based on the lessons learned and information gathered during the piloting phase.
The budget for a full roll-out is likely to contain additional costs related to activities such as considering

                                                                                                                             39
the development of a Bulgarian grouper, or buying a new costing system. The Action Plan’s budget does
not include these items, since they are not needed during a pilot-test.

164. In conclusion, the budget amounts provided in the Action Plan are initial estimates of what local
and Bulgarian experts believe are needed to begin a DRG-pilot implementation with approximately 40
Bulgarian hospitals. These estimates should serve as a starting point for discussion among Bulgarian
decision-makers and technical experts and should be adapted based on actual decisions taken. They
should not be viewed as an impediment to implementing a DRG-based pilot payment system.

    4.4.           Summary

165. There is no single right answer on how to develop, pilot-test, and implement a DRG-based
payment system, nor is there a single answer as to where the case-mix functions should be housed. It is
critical, however, to have capacity, knowledge, clearly defined institutional roles and responsibilities,
and political commitment. What is clear is that technical capacity and knowledge, and the existing staff
and HMIS/IT infrastructure, can be leveraged to begin a DRG pilot implementation. Investment and
upgrades will be needed over time, but neither staff nor systems are an impediment to Bulgaria being
able to begin with DRGs.

166. To date, a significant amount of work has been conducted to study, and prepare for, DRG
implementation; the heavy lifting, in terms of technical work, has been conducted. Successfully
completed activities include building hospital and national IT and HMIS infrastructures; developing
crucial software and providing training on its use; and collecting necessary data in a national repository.

167. The activities outlined in the Action Plan are intended to ensure that the pilot test to migrate
from CCP-based contracted budgets and hospital payments to DRG-based ones will foster organizational
and functional changes at the hospital and central levels. They will also create and align incentives
across care settings, and develop additional capacity among stakeholders. They are designed to ensure
that this effort will be successful and that the outcomes can be used to evaluate whether a broader,
national roll-out is of interest.

168. By using the DRG and CCP tools as they were originally intended, Bulgaria can accomplish a fair,
transparent, and data-driven allocation of its limited resources — and ensure that clinical protocols and
contracting standards remain in place to ensure patient safety and quality of care.

169. While nine months is a rapid timeframe, the experts consulted believe that this plan is feasible,
since Bulgaria has a large amount of existing data and strong infrastructure. Given the country’s
advanced state of technical readiness, it is preferable to generate momentum quickly, and concentrate
the preparation activities, in order to begin a pilot implementation. This is the assumption under which
the activities plan was prepared, but can be easily revised if a longer timeframe is needed.

170. Clearly the Government as part of its Health Reform Plan must decide on what are the best
policies to improve hospital efficiency and improve the sustainability of the health system. If the steps
in the action plan are carried out in a timely manner, Bulgaria will be well-positioned to begin a pilot
DRG implementation in short-order and expand it out over time. It should be noted, however, that the
pilot introduction of a DRG-based financing system will not solve the country’s broader health system
issues. It will have the intended benefits of creating incentives for hospitals to consolidate health care

        Annex 1. Bulgaria’s History in Studying Case-Mix and DRGs
171. This Annex provides a summary timeline of past case-mix and DRG related efforts in order to
ground future work. The information was provided in oral history from experts who were involved with
the first pilot projects that began in the mid-1990s. The timeline may contain some factual errors, which
is a risk when working from memory and oral history.

1990s
    In late 1993, Robert Fetter, one of the developers of the U.S. DRGs, was invited to Bulgaria. He
      first familiarized experts from Bulgarian health institutions with the fundamentals of a case-mix
      approach and DRG-based system.

        In 1994 - 1995, a technical assistance project to introduce case-mix in Eastern Europe was
         awarded to Solon Consulting and 3M HIS by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
         (DHHS) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

        1996-1999: Bulgaria was one of four countries that received technical assistance through the
         technical assistance project. In Bulgaria, the project sought to provide the MOH and NHIF with
         education and information about DRGs. During this project, a simple clinical data collection
         software tool was created and installed in 11 hospitals so they could begin collecting minimum,
         basic data to be used to group inpatient cases into DRGs. Five computers and a server were
         placed in a Municipal hospital and approximately 15 computers distributed to hospitals in the
         region. The ICD9-CM diagnostic and procedure coding system was translated into Bulgarian, and
         training and certification on ICD9-CM coding was conducted. In addition, the definition of the
         minimum data set and forms to be used to gather the data were completed, and training
         conducted so hospitals could consistently capture and report patient registration and clinical
         information. Accounting and expenditure data were also collected using Excel; an Economist on
         the project team used these data to model step-down costing and compute relative weights
         using Bulgarian data. (We believe this was the first set of relative weights created in Bulgaria.)
         The project included other activities, but the main focus was to provide education and training
         on DRGs, their use, and the major technical steps required to implement such a system.

         A case-mix office was also created as a separate entity in the MoH involving the experts engaged
         in the technical assistance project. Because no budget was approved for this entity, the team
         was moved to the NHIF to organize its work.

2000s

        2000: Another simple piece of software was created to automate the step-down cost accounting
         process and extend costing for inpatient cases. A total of 21 hospitals participated in the pilot
         project.

        2001: In the beginning of the year, the NHIF needed to decide how to begin reimbursing hospital
         care. All of the data since 1996 (from more than 500,000 cases) were recollected and grouped
         and some analyses were done. An Australian consultant (Dr. Don Hindle from the Medical
         Faculty of the University of New South Wales) was invited to Bulgaria to present Clinical Care
         Paths (CCPs). With strong support of the Minister of Health and the NHIF, CCPs were selected

European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             42
         for use in organizing hospital reimbursement. While CCPs were not developed for this use,
         misconceptions existed about DRGs suitability for contracting purposes, which influenced a
         preference for CCPs. There may also have been a misperception that DRGs require more data
         collection about admission and discharge information, as well as the capacity to code and report
         cases, neither of which was well-developed in Bulgaria at that time. The first 30 CCPs were
         created by the NHIF, based on a list of diagnoses and procedures that came from a small list of
         DRG groups.

        2000 – 2001: The political situation changed dramatically in 2001. The majority of the staff with
         experience in DRGs (both at the MOH and the NHIF) were replaced. At this time, much of the
         DRG work came to a halt, including studying new reimbursement concepts. Nonetheless, the
         NHIF continued with creating more CCPs.

        2001 – 2003: Coding training was planned and delivered to doctors, coders, and economists. A
         cost accounting project also was in place during this time, but a project to collect electronic data
         from hospitals was not completed. Data collection was at a standstill.

        2003 – 2005: The Bulgarian and Australian governments signed an agreement to obtain a
         research license. At the same time, a Bearing Point project was occurring in Bulgaria, through
         which the primary author of this report, Ms. Jugna Shah, was working with technical experts and
         officials at the MOH and the NHIF to pilot-test DRGs for financing. This project focused on the
         following activities:
              o Work with the Head of the NHIF to expand technical capacity within the case-mix office;
              o Prepare grouper software selection criteria and evaluate various grouper options;
              o Discuss policy decisions, DRG implementation options, and contracting models with the
                  MOH Deputy Minister and the head of the NHIF (presentation on DRG contracting
                  available on request);
              o Draft a discussion guide on determining institutional roles and responsibilities;
              o Prepare an implementation timeline with required political and technical decisions

        2003 – 2004: The existing ICD-9 and ICD-9-CM diagnoses coding system was changed to ICD-10
         WHO. Clinical and expenditure data collection began again involving approximately 40 hospitals;
         3M worked with Bulgarian counterparts to group approximately 1 million cases in both the 3M
         International Refined Grouper and the Australian Grouper. A meeting occurred between
         Bulgarian counterparts and an Australian grouper software company to discuss the terms for
         obtaining a grouper software license. After a careful evaluation and cost-benefit analysis of
         various groupers, Bulgarian experts selected the Australian classification, procedure coding,
         grouper, and coding standards.

         MOH conducted a tender for the provision of the Specialized Software for Hospitals (SSH); the
         system was required to contain clinical and expenditure data collection software for hospitals,
         interface for data collection activities with the NHIF, and DRG grouping interface and analyses.

        2005: the MOH purchased servers, network switches, and Personal Computers (PCs) for 154
         hospitals.

        2006: Clinical and expenditure data collection software were installed in Bulgarian hospitals and

                                                                                                                             43
         training provided to approximately 1200 people. Clinical and expenditure data collection began
         using the “Specialized Software for Hospital” (SSH) system.

        2007: Gamma Consult created data validation software for the NHIF’s use. A free version of this
         software (without the validation checks) was provided to the hospitals. Approximately 156
         hospitals collected data in 2007 and an additional 92 hospitals were given the software. They
         had been expected to close, and so were not included in the original software rollout, but they
         did not close and subsequently began reporting data. By March, clinical and expenditure data
         were being reported by all hospitals that had received the software. Private hospitals were also
         given the opportunity to participate.

        2008: By the end of the year, approximately 92% of all inpatient clinical data was being collected
         and it was grouped into DRGs using Version 4.5 of the Australian Grouper.

         From 2008 until 2010, the NHIF assigned the BULL SIVECO consortium to develop an integrated
         information system for NHIF. During this process, it was decided that the “Specialized Software
         for Hospitals” would be the sub-system where the reports of the medical institutions for
         hospital care would be filed, and that this sub-system would be integrated with the NHIF’s large
         information system. In parallel, an interface was developed to import Excel files containing the
         Clinical Pathways reports.

        2009: The contract between Gamma Consult and the NHIF, which had begun in 2005, was
         completed. The primary author of this report, Ms. Jugna Shah, was invited to speak at the V
         National Conference “ICT In Healthcare: The Challenge of the 21st Century” in Sofia, Bulgaria on
         October 15, 2009. (This presentation, entitled, “Using Case-Mix Financing Methods to
         Restructure Hospital Payments and Measure Hospital Production: DRGs vs. CCPs,” is available on
         request.) Gamma Consult agreed to update the software if NHIF made certain changes to
         hospital requirements. NHIF received ownership of the software from the MOH but did not do
         much with it.

         The software was made available free-of-charge to over 320 medical institutions; at this time,
         the NHIF central database covered over 95% of the hospitalizations in the country.

        2010: The Ministry of Health began working on obtaining approval to implement DRGs and also
         to obtain a licensing agreement from the Australian government for grouper software. The
         Bulgarian Council of Ministers approved the guidelines, terms, and timeframe for implementing
         a new hospital financing model, using DRGs (available on request) and authorized the Minister
         of Health and the Governor of the NHIF to prepare a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations
         with the Australian government for the purchase of a classification system.

        2011: The NHIF did not make much progress with exploring DRGs as a financing tool, but did ask
         hospitals to continue reporting clinical and expenditure data using the software provided.
         Gamma Consult continued to provide minimal updates to the software on a pro bono basis. The
         data continued to be grouped into DRGs, but the quality of the data was not examined and
         there were no efforts to improve data collection.

         The Minster of Health signed a License Agreement between Australia and the Bulgarian MOH

                                                                                                                             44
         confirming the right to use the classification system ARDRG version 6 until June 2016 (effective
         on February 1, 2012). This agreement was ratified through an act adopted by the 41st National
         Assembly on December 14, 2011, SG No.102 of 2011.

         Problems arose between the new NHIF management team and the NHIF case-mix department.
         The new NHIF director wanted to merge the case-mix department into the Information
         Technology Department, and indicated that they did not want to pay for the grouper software
         (which was provided pro bono in the first place). During this time, the grouper software was
         transferred back to the MOH, which transferred the Specialized Software for Hospitals (SSH)
         software to the NCPHA.

         As a first step for implementing DRGs in Bulgaria, a special department was created in the
         National Centre of Public Health and Analysis (NCPHA) staffed by experts who have worked on
         previous projects for the introduction of DRGs in Bulgaria. The department was responsible for
         collecting, grouping, and analyzing the data. The department was also asked to prepare a DRG
         implementation and activities plan, which it did based on previous implementation plans. A
         leading Bulgarian DRG technical expert was appointed as the Director of the NCPHA, which
         houses the case-mix department. The Director and the Minister of Health negotiated with the
         Australian government to finalize negotiations for the specialized DRG grouping software; this
         was obtained using financing from a World Bank DRG Project, and provided to the NCPHA by
         order of the Minister of Health. The classification department focused on maintaining the data
         collection process.

         To develop an effective case-mix office, additional staff were needed to conduct analysis,
         prepare relative weights, simulate budgets, analyze trends and patterns, etc. The Director of the
         NCPHA lacked sufficient time to work on case-mix and DRG-related activities, and hired another
         DRG expert to run the case-mix department (this individual had been the Deputy Minister in
         2005 and had a large working knowledge of DRGs). Many of the DRG processes were initiated
         again, including preparing an infrastructure plan and revised work plan (available on request).

        2012: The Minister of Health was replaced and the Director of the NCPHA departed; the newly
         hired DRG expert remained in charge of the case-mix department and continued with data
         collection, grouping, and analysis activities. A Committee was formed to monitor the
         introduction of DRGs, which includes representatives from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of
         Finance, NHIF, and NCPHA.

         In April, the classification system and grouper software was provided to the NCPHA by the MOH.
         Unfortunately, this transfer removed the hospitals’ obligation to report their data, since the
         data provision requirement was part of the hospitals’ contract with the NHIF. While many
         hospitals have stopped reporting data, and the volume of data is declining, fortunately, over 200
         hospitals still continue to report.

        2013: The NCPHA grouped 2012 data and prepared several analyses on the use of DRGs; this
         was published in the Bulgarian Journal of Public Health. The papers addressed DRGs and CCPs,
         their performance differences, key issues, and possible next steps for Bulgaria to implement
         DRG-based financing.

         The XML format for reporting medical institutions’ daily activities for hospital care was launched
         in February. It contained all of the details from form No. 7 of NHIF – Direction for
         hospitalization. Medical institutions generate the XML files and upload them in the NHIF portal.
         The introduction of this XML format is now available in the HOSP database and can be used to
         group cases into DRGs.

        2014 - 2015: During 1st quarter, the head of the case-mix department was asked to leave the
         NCPHA. Despite this change some has work continued on data collection and grouping.
         Additionally, the NCPHA case-mix team translated the Australian procedure coding system in
         preparation for its implementation in 2014 (hospitals had been reporting their data using Excel),
         but the implementation date was postponed to 2015. A new World Bank project was signed in
         2014, which includes a focus on studying the use of DRGs. The primary author of this report,
         Ms. Jugna Shah, was asked to join the World Bank team to study the possibility of implementing
         DRGs in Bulgaria for hospital financing.

        In 2015, the former head of the case-mix department was asked to return and work on
         implementing a DRG-based financing system. The result of the collaborative work between the
         World Bank team and Bulgaria counterparts is showcased in this report.

    Annex 2. Current status of HMIS systems and IT infrastructure
            from the point of view of DRG implementation
172. This Annex provides an overview of the current status of hospital management information
systems, and the NCPHA, NHIF, and MOH information systems with respect to DRG implementation.

1. First steps in the preparation of Bulgarian hospitals and NHIF for the implementation of DRG from
   an IT perspective

173. A standardized method for coding the patient’s clinical morbidity uses a preselected diagnosis
and procedure coding system. Hospital reporting of these data to the central / national level in
electronic form is a prerequisite for developing, implementing, and maintaining a DRG-based financing
system. These data include diagnosis and procedure codes, as well as the “minimum basic data set” of
key demographic and clinical data elements: age, gender, admission date, discharge data, discharge
status, and any other information needed to assign patients into DRG groups.

174. It is also important to implement a standardized costing methodology and system for use in
reporting cost data from hospitals to the central / national level via electronic form. This information is
used to create country-specific relative weights that are then used to compute hospital budgets and
other key elements in the DRG-based payment system.

175. Cost data can be provided at the hospital / department level, and then allocated by DRGs; this
process is called “top-down costing.” Alternatively, department-level costs can be stepped-down to the
patient-level and combined with directly captured patient-level costs; this type of costing is called
“bottom-up costing.”

176. Two Bulgarian pilot studies of DRGs were conducted: the first in 11 hospitals between 1996 and
1998, the second in 40 hospitals from 2003 to 2004. In addition, three DRG classification systems were
evaluated (HICFA 12.0, AR DRG 4.7, and 3M International Refined DRG’s). Based on this work, the
Bulgarian MOH decided to implement Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and software that
created the capacity to electronically report clinical and cost data, and to implement DRGs.

177. In 2005, the MOH purchased servers, network switches, and Personal Computers (PCs) for 154
hospitals. In 2006, the MOH assigned the development of the “Specialized Software for Hospital” (SSH)
system to be used for hospitals’’ electronic reporting and to support the introduction of DRG.

178. During 2006–2007, the system was developed and implemented in 246 medical institutions
providing hospital care (with a total workforce exceeding 1,500) and the NHIF. The system includes two
sub-systems — hospital and central — that are described below.

179. (1) The hospital sub-system is made available to the medical institutions for free and includes
two modules, the “in-patient registration and clinical pathways” module and the “costing and financial
analyses” module.

    (1.1.) “In-patient registration and clinical pathways” module automates the activities involved in
    collecting clinical data by allowing registration of data for:

        admission of inpatient to hospital;
        inpatient transfers between hospital departments;
        inpatient discharge;
        all data for outpatients and exams;
        coding of referral, admission, and discharge diagnoses; diagnoses for comorbidities and
         complications; and medical procedures (surgical and diagnostic) according to ICD-10 WHO and
         ICD-9-CM.

180. The module also allows input of data in predefined formats from the Hospital Information
System of the medical institution (if any). It fully conforms to the legislation and reporting requirements
of the MOH, NHIF, and the NCPHA and is subject to update according to changes in legislation and
regulations.

    (1.2) The “Costing and Financial analyses” module has several features, including processes to:
     automate the operations for collection of cost allocation data;
     allow for data input or import of expenditure data by department in predefined formats from
        hospital accounting and human resources software;
     allow for data input or import of expenditure data at the patient/case level from pharmacy and
        store management, laboratory, and imaging software at the patient (inpatient case) or

2. Current status of hospitals’ IT infrastructure and HMIS systems, and their capacity to implement
   DRGs

181. Since 2000, there has been an increasing initiative by hospitals to implement information
systems. This process has been particularly intensive since 2006, as a result of the implementation of the
“Specialized Software for Hospitals.”

182. At present, all hospitals in the country have built a basic IT infrastructure and implemented
HMIS by different providers; several still use the “Specialized Software for Hospitals” that is provided
free-of-charge. All implemented systems cover the basic functional capabilities of this specialized
software.

183. The number of hospital workplaces where HMIS have been implemented varies from several
workplaces in very small hospitals to several hundred workplaces in the big university and regional
hospitals and large private hospitals. Currently, about 12,500 HMIS workplaces are in use (including
those using specialized software) in about 350 hospital hospitals; this is an average of over 30
workplaces per medical institution.



This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             49
184. To operate these systems, all hospitals have built and maintain, at a minimum, the following IT
infrastructure:
     local area network;
     a server for the database and organized data archive;
     workstations and printers;
     Internet connectivity for verification of the patients’ Social Security status from the NRA web
         site services and daily exchange of data with the NHIF;
     personal ID document readers and internet connectivity; after April 1, 2015, they will perform
         online registration in the NHIF database for all patient admissions and discharges, using the
         personal ID document within four hours of the event;
     IT staff or an agreement with an external IT company to provide IT infrastructure maintenance
         and operation services.

185. The scope of HMIS that has been implemented by different medical institutions varies widely,
including, at a minimum, the following:
     accounting software;
     warehouse and pharmacy reporting software (sometimes part of the accounting software);
     human resource and payroll software;
     clinical data encoding and reporting software with no less capacity than that of the Specialized
        Hospital Software;
     hospital products and services costing software with no less capacity than the Specialized
        Hospital Software.

186. In the majority of hospitals (about two-thirds), many other HMIS components have been
introduced, including:
     electronic ordering of medicines and consumables, reporting of costs for medicines and medical
        products at the inpatient level;
     laboratory information systems maintaining laboratory analyzer interface, electronic ordering of
        laboratory tests, and bar coding of specimens;
     electronic ordering of image examinations, storage of diagnostic images in PACS with possible
        access by hospital departments, and even elements of DICOM Workflow;
     patients’ hospital nutrition, diet, and electronic orders;
     contract management and reporting to the additional voluntary health insurances funds;
     calculation and invoicing of additional services used by the patients;
     coverage and preparation of the majority of a patient’s the medical data in the system and filing
        it into an electronic medical record of the patient.

187. The following functions have been recently implemented and are used on a daily basis by some
hospitals:
    providing patients with on-line (WEB) access to laboratory results, image examination results,
        checks, and discharge letters.
    real-time control of patient’s treatment costs in relation to the expected revenues from
        different sources (NHIF, CCP), payments by the patient, payments from additional health
        insurances, etc. The balance of the expected revenues relative to costs is being monitored with
        every medicine provided by the hospital pharmacy, each laboratory or imaging test,
        examination or consulting provided, etc.


This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             50
        electronic medication prescriptions, control of maximum doses, drug interactions, medicines
         administration control, and use of mobile devices at the patient’s bed.

188. The hospitals have built the capacity and conduct daily reporting of all operations, medicines
and medical products, electronically in the form of an electronically signed XML within the next working
day, with all data being ICD encoded and not subject to amendment, except in extraordinary
circumstances.

189. A conclusion can be drawn from the above overview that the hospitals have IT infrastructure
and systems that greatly exceed the minimum functionality required to introduce DRG reporting and
payment. The adaptation of the systems that must be performed in the course of DRG introduction is
small, compared to the system’s current capabilities.

3. Status of the NHIF’s IT systems with respect to the exchange of data with hospitals and capacity
   for introducing DRGs

190. Until 2007, the NHIF collected and processed the hospitals’ reports on paper and using Excel
files that contained minimum medical data. The Excel files were imported and processed using a
software program called “HOSP” that the NHIF developed with the help of external experts. This
database does not contain all of the information needed in order to group cases into DRGs.

191. From September 2007 to December 2011, the “Specialized Software for Hospitals” sy stem was
implemented and operated at the NHIF; all medical institutions that are contractual partners with the
NHIF were obliged to provide medical data and data on costs incurred for medical treatment at the
inpatient level, on a monthly basis. As of 2009, the software was made available free-of-charge to over
320 medical institutions; at this time, the NHIF central database covered over 95% of the
hospitalizations in the country.

192. In parallel to the data collection from hospitals by the Specialized Hospital Software, the NHIF
preserved the clinical pathways reporting in Excel and the reports processing model in the HOSP
software product. After the expiration of the “Specialized Software for Hospitals” warranty period, in
March 2009, the NHIF neither invested in nor contracted further maintenance and development
activities. It did, however, continue using the software until December 2011.

193. From 2008 to 2010, the NHIF assigned the BULL SIVECO consortium to develop an integrated
information system for NHIF (the contract was for more than BGN 15 million). In the course of the
system implementation, it was decided that the “Specialized Software for Hospitals” would be the sub-
system wherein the reports of the medical institutions for hospital care would be filed, and that this sub-
system would be integrated with the NHIF’s large information system. In parallel, an interface was
developed to import Excel files containing the Clinical Pathways reports.

194. In December 2011, NHIF terminated the operation of the “Specialized Software from Hospitals”
and the system was moved to the NCPHA. Following this, the NHIF made an assignment to develop a
mechanism for daily reporting of the work done by the contractual partners of the National Health
Insurance Fund (NHIF) (the contract was for BGN 1.27 million), and continued the development of the
HOSP software as a system for processing Clinical Pathway reports.



This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             51
195. The XML format for reporting the activity of the medical institutions for hospital care was
published in December 2012, and launched in February 2013. It contained all of the details from form
No. 7 of NHIF – Direction for hospitalization. The medical institutions generate the XML files with their
hospital systems and upload them in the NHIF portal, signing them with a qualified electronic signature.
The introduction of this XML format is now available in the HOSP database and can be used to group
cases into DRGs. The XML reports are processed by the HOSP software; the results, including identified
problems, are returned to the medical institutions via the NHIF portal in the form of a text file.

196. Since May 2013, the hospital medical institutions have been reporting daily in XML format, with
reports including all patients discharged the previous day, their diagnoses, treatments, medicines and
medical products covered by the NHIF. There is the possibility to also include the patient’s discharge
letter.

The medical institutions’ report to the NHIF usually do not include all of the patients admitted to, and
discharged from, the medical institution; instead, they include only those patients who have Social
Security and whose care is subject to payment by the NHIF.

197. Below are input fields (i.e., data) of AR DRG 6.0 Grouper used to group an inpatient; the
asterisked fields (*) are compulsory fields, while those marked with a hash (#) are conditional:
MRN - Medical Record Number.
Admission Date # - This field is only required if age and/or length of stay are to be calculated from dates.
Separation Date # - This field is only required if Admission Date is entered and length of stay is to be
calculated from dates.
Separation Mode * - This is a compulsory field and the output cannot be viewed if this field is left blank.
Date of Birth # - This field is only required if Admission Date is entered and age is to be calculated from
dates.
Age in Years # - This field is required if age is not calculated from dates and age is greater than 1 year.
Age in Days # - This field is required if age is not calculated from dates and age is less than 1 year.
Admission Weight # – This field is required if age is less than 1 year and should be entered if supplied in
the medical record.
Sex * – This is a compulsory field (valid entries are: M, F or U).
Acute LOS # – This field is only required if length of stay cannot be calculated from dates.
Non-acute LOS – This is an optional field but should be entered if supplied in the medical record. This
will help identify LOS outside the acute setting.
Leave Days – This is an optional field but should be entered if supplied in the medical record. This will
help better define the acute LOS by identifying the time the patient spends out of the acute setting.
Same Day Flag – This is calculated using dates or Acute LOS. May be overwritten if required. Valid
entries are 1 (Same Day) or 0 (Not Same Day).
MHLS * – This field captures the mental health status and is optional but should be entered if supplied in
the medical record. The default for this field is 9 which means ‘not applicable.’
Diagnoses Codes – The Principal Diagnosis (PDx) is required. All other diagnosis fields are optional, but if
any Dxs occur in the medical record, they are necessary for correct grouping.
Procedure Codes - All procedure fields are optional, but are necessary for correct grouping if supplied in
the medical record.




This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             52
198. Based on the list above, and knowing the content of the XML file for the hospital daily report,
we can conclude that all the data needed for DRG Grouping of inpatients are transferred and available in
the NHIF via existing systems of hospitals and NHIF.

199. There are a few issues to resolve prior to implementation of a DRG system, but these could be
done easily. These include:
   (1) Procedures and diagnoses in hospital systems and XML files are coded by ICD-9- and ICD-10
       WHO ver. 2004, but AR DRG Grouper 6.0 uses ICD-10-AM 7.0 and ACHI 7.0. This issue can be
       resolved by using mapping tables that have already been created by NCPHA. Once ICD-9-CM
       procedure coding is replaced with ACHI 7.0 (Bulgarian translation), the procedure codes will be
       native; meaning, there will no longer be a need to use mapping tables.
   (2) Some of the CCPs impose certain diagnosis and procedure coding requirements that might be
       unusual for DRGs. This can be handled by special processing of diagnosis lists when exporting
       codes to the DRG grouper and by fixing unusual coding rules in CCPs during the annual CCP
       updating process.

200. Since the operation of “Specialized Software for Hospitals” was discontinued in December 2011,
the NHIF does not collect cost data at the department- and patient- (inpatient) level anymore, nor does
it require hospitals to report these data on a regular basis even for CCPs reimbursement price
calculation. Many hospitals continue to report this information on a voluntary basis to the NCPHA.

4. State of the NCPHA’s IT systems with respect to data exchange with hospitals and capacity for the
   introduction of DRGs

201. The “Specialized Software for Hospitals” system was transferred from the NHIF to the NCPHA in
December 2011. Since then, many fixes and updates of the system have been made in order to keep it
operational, ensure that it is aligned with changes in the business model and reporting requirements of
NHIF and the National Social Security Institution (NSSI), and preserve its functions for collecting and
processing medical and cost data for the purposes of DRG. No investments have been made for its
further development, however.

Below is the list of major fixes and updates made since December 2011:
     Migrating and installing databases from NHIF to NCPHA;
     Development from scratch of a new version of the “Web and E-mail interfaces” module that
        uses a qualified professional digital signature;
     Licensing an MS SQL Server 2012 Standard and upgrade of the central part to this version of SQL
        server;
     Setting up the AR DRG 6.0 Grouper and integrating it by developing a new version of the
        “Interface to DRG Grouper” module and implementing a mapper developed by NCPHA between
        ICD-9-CM and ACHI 7.0 and ICD-10 to ICD-10 AM;
     Regrouping all data since 2006 with version 6.0 of the AR DRG Grouper and updating the
        interface;
     Calculating relative weights using Bulgarian data and comparing them with the relative weights
        of countries using a similar classification system;
     Updating the “Specialized Software for Hospitals” to address legislative changes throughout the
        years.


This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             53
202. Exchange of data between medical institutions and the NCPHA occurs monthly using the
encrypted XML files. The NCPHA continues to collect both clinical data and cost data from hospitals.
Although all hospitals have the ability to provide clinical information and information on costs incurred,
only about 200 of them provide such information to NCPHA.
The NCPHA’s IT infrastructure was also upgraded in 2012 by buying new servers, storages, and PCs with
a budget of about BGN 500 thousand.

5. State of the MOH IT systems with respect to the introduction of DRGs

203. At present, the MOH does not support databases and systems relevant to DRG software, other
than those in NCPHA.

6. Suggested activities for implementation of DRGs, from an IT perspective

204. Based on an analysis of prior initiatives and the current status of IT systems in hospitals, NCPHA,
and NHIF related to DRG implementation, we can conclude following with respect to a potential pilot
test:
        There are enough hospitals that have IT infrastructure and HMIS systems that can produce
           and report clinical and cost data at the patient (inpatient) level to proceed with a pilot test;
        The NCHPHA’s IT system and the “Specialized Software for Hospitals” system are functioning
           and can easily serve the process of pilot testing DRGs, with minimal upgrades and
           maintenance services;
        It is reasonable (and could be very helpful) in the pilot implementation to overcome formal
           barriers and provide access for NCPHA to inpatient clinical data that has been available to
           the NHIF since 2013, for the purposes of DRG Grouping. These data could aid the pilot
           implementation by facilitating a precise simulation based on DRGs for all of the hospitals in
           the country.

205. Following are suggested improvements, from an IT perspective, to assist the pilot
implementation of DRGs:

             Training and continuity:
                  o Plan, define and publish a date after which ACHI 7.0 will replace ICD-9-CM, and
                      prepare a new version of data collection software and a central system that will
                      work with the new procedure coding system after the planned date;
                  o Prepare an e-Learning environment for distant training and testing to guarantee
                      stable results over time:
                           Using e-Learning environment to prepare and publish training courses and
                              test preparation materials for ICD-10-AM diagnosis and ACHI 7.0 procedure
                              coding systems, based on which, a constant training process can be run;
                           prepare and run refreshment courses on diagnoses and procedure coding
                              subject;
                           prepare and run training courses available for hospital staff on DRG topics;
                           prepare and run training courses for costing;
                  o Organize a web forum for news, publications, questions and answers related to
                      changes in coding and costing requirements.

             Clinical data collection, coding and classification:
                   o Develop and provide Pilot hospitals with a new version of data collection software
                       or/and new interface/export logic to make data submission to a central location
                       simple;
                   o Define and develop in a central part of the data collection software analytical
                       reports related to quality of coding by hospital, coder, CCP, DRG, etc. for the
                       provision of feedback to hospitals;
                   o Define and develop analytical reports in a central part of the data collection
                       software related to DRG grouping results, by hospital and coder, representative of
                       each DRG, relationship between DRG and CCP to support this analysis of grouped
                       data;
                   o Develop management reports in a central part of the data collection software that
                       can be provided to hospitals with grouping results/ hospital feedback reports (i.e.,
                       Top 10 DRGs, average length of stay by DRG, etc.) and an upgrade of the central
                       software to produce these reports;
                   o Develop interface with NHIF for provision of clinical data from hospital reports for
                       DRG grouping;
                   o Upgrade of a central part of the data collection software, the software with
                       functionality for analysis of the homogeneity/distribution of cases grouped under
                       the same DRG and evaluation of the need to define new groups;
                   o Develop a Bulgarian grouper, only if a national roll-out is decided after the pilot
                       implementation occurs;
                   o Develop a WEB page for manual grouping and a WEB service for batch grouping
                       available to hospitals;
                   o Maintain regular updates of data collection software and/or new interface/export
                       logic to keep it in conformance to legislation changes.

             Cost data collection and analysis
                  o Upgrade and maintain in a central data collection software functionalities to
                      support abovementioned functionalities and provision of second level support

             Help Desk and support services for the period of the Pilot implementation

206. For a potential national roll-out, the current data exchange process in NHIF can serve the DRG
implementation on national level without the need for big changes. Some changes will be needed
depending on the status of the NHIF information system at the time of DRG implementation, including:

             DRG grouping of reported cases must be done, which is relatively simple to implement;
             There might be a reason for hospitals to receive information back for DRG assignments after
              DRG grouping in NHIF as well as errors that have occurred via a structured (XML) response
              file;
             All budgets and reimbursement amounts currently calculated based on CCPs need to be
              changed to DRGs;
             All claim validation and fraud detection logic has to change to DRGs.

207. In summary, all instruments developed in the pilot DRG implementation process would be
applicable to a national roll-out if such a decision is taken. As with the pilot test, the national roll-out will
not require any significant improvement of the existing IT infrastructure, although some refinements
and investment will be needed.

    Annex 3. Description of the Types of Adjustments That Can Be
    Made to Hospital Budgets to Account for Costs Outside of Their
            Control under a DRG-Based Payment System
208. Case-mix classification systems are inherently comparative; since averages are used to compute
budget amounts, hospitals are explicitly compared to each other. Yet, hospitals vary considerably across
dimensions that include their role in health care delivery; rural vs. urban location; differential wage
rates; and use of technology in various combinations for treatment or maintenance of technological
capacity. These factors affect hospital costs and complicate efforts to make direct comparisons between
hospitals. Directly adjusting contracted budgets to compensate hospitals for valuable activities that are
outside of the hospital’s direct control is one way to ensure equity in the budget allocation and financing
processes.

209. It is reasonable to provide adjustments to hospital budgets to account for legitimate patient
care expenses that are beyond their reasonable control. Appropriate outlier payment policies enable the
incentives that are inherent in a DRG-based financing system to exist. It is a politically important policy
to use especially in the early days of system implementation, as it helps control the limitations inherent
in any DRG-based financing system — such as the use of imperfect cost data to develop relative weights
— and facilitates acceptance by providers. For both pilot testing and broader implementation, decision-
makers must carefully study the use of adjustments to identify what adjustments and payment
parameters are necessary and appropriate to use to create an equitable financing system that promotes
the incentive to provide the “right amount of care in the “right care setting.”

210.     The following are the most common types of adjustments:
        Inflation
        Geographic location
        Local wages
        Direct and indirect health professions education
        Specialty hospitals
        Outliers

Each type of adjustments is described in detail below.

Inflation

211. Inflation is a factor that is truly outside of the individual hospital’s control. Hospitals are likely to
expect that the base or reference price will be adjusted for inflation on an annual basis to account for
the rising nature of the cost of living, which is outside of their control. Using an adjustment factor for
inflation is the simplest example of an adjustment to the base price, and one that is typically warranted
to be made annually or as needed.

Geographic Location




This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             57
212. Location is beyond the hospital's control in the sense that it is necessary to have hospitals
located all across a country to provide citizens with access to care. Location is likely to influence
inpatient costs and thus may warrant an adjustment.

213. For example, rural hospitals need to maintain certain stand-by capabilities, which are costly but
may not be fully utilized, while urban hospitals may incur higher property and wage costs.

214. It is reasonable to examine the impact of geographic location using statistical analyses and
simulation models to determine whether an adjustment is needed. To conduct such an analysis,
hospitals can be divided into “urban” and “rural” groups by designating hospitals located in an area with
a population density greater than some specified number as “urban” and those in an area with a
population lower than a specific number as “rural.” Other possible criteria for grouping by location are
the size of the community or other metrics already being used by the country to delineate geographic
location.

215. After hospitals are divided into groups, financial impact can be computed using a simulation
model beginning with the assumption that no geographic adjustment would be provided. If the results
show certain types of hospitals being disproportionately impacted then this or one of the other
adjustments may be warranted.

Local Wages

216. In the United States, the Medicare program recognizes that labor costs vary across areas and
provides a direct adjustment by using different wage indices. U.S. labor costs have a particularly
significant impact on a hospital’s viability — but this may not be the case in other countries. To the
extent that inputs costs vary in different areas, it is appropriate to consider the provision of an
adjustment to account for wage variations and other costs that impact treatment costs.

217. The need for this adjustment can be met through an adjustment for a correlated variable, such
as urban/rural location as described above. Again, statistical analyses and simulation models are
required to examine whether hospital budgets are systematically influenced by local wage rates.

Direct & Indirect Health Profession Education

218. Another potential adjustment is for hospitals that provide a significant amount of teaching for
health professionals such as physicians, nurse practitioners, certified nurse-midwives, physician
assistants, etc. These institutions may be official teaching hospitals, or may simply be facilities with large
expenses associated with both direct and indirect graduate medical education.

219. Hospitals that provide training typically incur both direct and indirect costs. Direct educational
costs include salaries for residents and other trainees, teaching salaries, and potentially a portion of
overhead directly attributable to the education function. Direct education costs are usually excluded
from hospital budget/expenditure calculations and are typically passed through (i.e., paid as they are
incurred or on a formula basis), subject to payment limits. Indirect education costs include the
additional patient care costs (e.g., additional tests ordered by intern and residents for teaching
purposes.



This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             58
220. If teaching hospitals’ case-mix is, in fact, affected by their teaching status, a separate payment
outside of the financing system reflecting only the direct costs would be insufficient to compensate for
the overall type of care being provided in these facilities. In these cases, the DRG rates may also need to
be adjusted to account for the indirect costs. For example, a certain percentage may be added-on to
rates for hospitals that are designated as teaching facilities. Another option is to create a separate base
price for the teaching hospitals peer group, and use that rather than the national reference price to
calculate their contracted budgets. If these facilities are funded through another source, such as the
Ministry of Education, then this type of adjustment may be unnecessary.
Specialty Hospitals

221. Case-mix financing systems work best for hospitals that treat a wide range of patients, since
payment is based on a concept of averages. It is inherent in the concept of DRG financing and other
case-mix systems that hospitals will lose money on some cases and make money on others. They lose
money when they are inefficient or if certain patients present complications that result in longer-than-
average lengths of stay; they make money when they are efficient or patients are treated in a shorter-
than-average length-of-stay.

222. This concept does not work well, however, for hospitals that treat very specific cases that group
into just a few DRGs, such as Pediatric, Maternity, Emergency/Trauma, Cancer, Cardiology hospitals.
Without an adjustment to the base price to cover certain structural and/or equipment costs associated
with specialty care, these facilities are likely to be underfinanced through no fault of their own. For
these facilities, the “law of averages” concept inherent in DRG-based financing systems may not work.

223. Decision-makers should examine data from these facilities to assess whether they are being
systematically penalized under a DRG-based financing system. This information will help determine
whether an adjustment is appropriate.

Outliers

224. Since case-mix classification systems are based on average treatment costs, hospitals and payors
must be protected against cases that are abnormal with respect to the amount of resources required for
treatment. Abnormal or non-standard cases are called “outliers,” and generally fall into two categories:
length of stay outliers (very short- or very long-stay cases) and cost outliers (cases with abnormally high
costs).

225. Most countries use an outlier adjustment to create a different mechanism to pay for cases that
meet outlier criteria. Determining what the best formula for identifying outliers and paying for them is
complex and again requires data analysis and simulation modeling so that an appropriate payment
formula can be created to pay for very short or very long stay hospitalizations or for very costly cases.

226. Under a DRG-based system without an outlier adjustment, hospitals receive a single price for
the DRG regardless of the length of stay. For example, if the average length of stay for a certain DRG is
seven days, and the patient is discharged or transferred on the second day, the hospital would receive
the full DRG payment (if there is no short-stay outlier policy). Similarly, if the patient was kept in the
hospital for twenty days, the hospital would still receive the same DRG payment (again, if there is no
outlier policy).



This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             59
227. Such a system creates an incentive for hospitals to treat certain types of patients as one-day
stays if they think they can benefit from hospitalizing the patient for a short period of time (i.e., 1-2
days), and receiving the full DRG payment for the average stay. In this scenario, the payer would
overpay for the case; with the longer stay case, the hospital would face additional costs that are
reasonable but that go uncovered. Both of these outcomes are inappropriate and unfair. Conversely,
with an outlier adjustment, hospitals would be paid more appropriately for the care provided and would
not be penalized for caring for patients who require a much longer hospital stay due to complications,
comorbidities, or other factors outside the hospital’s control.

228. To create a fair and equitable financing mechanism that incentivizes hospitals to provide the
right amount of care in the right setting, countries implementing a DRG-based financing system typically
implement an outlier payment policy. A common approach for doing so is to set certain limits around
the average length of stay for each DRG. These limits help determine when a case is considered to be a
“short-stay case” (discharged before a pre-defined lower length of stay limit) or a “long-stay case”
(discharged after a pre-defined upper length of stay limit). Both are length of stay outliers: they are
outside the normal distribution of a bell curve from a statistical point of view (see figure, below). Cost
can also be used to set limits: cases discharged before a pre-defined lower cost level is reached, or after
a pre-defined upper cost level is reached.




229. As the above diagram shows, either cost or length of stay can be used to describe cases that fall
outside the norm. In the early years of DRG-based system implementation, countries typically use length
of stay outliers rather than cost outliers, until there is more confidence in the cost data. Once cost data
are refined and reflective of hospital activities, cost outliers can be simulated and considered for use
instead of data on length of stay.

230. In order to arrive at the normal distribution illustrated in the diagram above, mathematical
formulas must be used to “trim out” (or remove) data above or below a certain standard deviation from
the mean. These cases are either fully removed from the data set or brought back to the limits of what is
considered within the curve limits. In this manner, actual cases are converted into what are called
“equivalent cases.” For example, 4 actual short-stay cases may get converted into 2.6 equivalent cases in
terms of resource consumption, while 4 long-stay cases may become 12 equivalent cases.


This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance” co -financed by the
European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
                                                                                                                             60
231. The decisions about the appropriate statistical parameters to use, and how to treat the data
that have been trimmed, require policy discussions and are critical steps that create the baseline for
calculating the future base price. This is because the number of actual or equivalent cases affects the
denominator in the base price calculation, and sets up the DRGs’ parameters for what are considered as
short- and long-stay cases.

232. Data analysis will help determine whether to finance these cases differently from those that fall
within the bell curve’s normal distribution.7 Implementing an outlier adjustment means that hospitals
are paid less than the actual base price for cases that do not reach the lower limit of the average length
of stay bell curve, and paid more for cases that exceed the higher limit.




7 To generate a bell curve for each DRG, an average length of stay distribution chart should be created using statistical methods to
set the DRG’s lower and upper limits. Cases that fall outside of the bell curve should be reviewed. On the lower length of st ay
side, cases must be examined to see if they should have been provided as a one-day stay or in an outpatient/ambulatory
environment. Patterns can be studied by case type and by hospital to identify incentives that systematically result in some DRGs
and/or hospitals having very short lengths of stay while others have very high stays. For cases that consistently exceed the upper
limit, decision-makers must determine whether that is due to inefficient hospital practices, lack of incentives, competing
incentives (such as under-the-table payments), or poor quality of care being provided.
