Preface

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are now widely recognized as engines of economic growth and key contributors to sustainable
gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries, including those in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. These businesses
predominantly operate in the manufacturing and service sectors and create employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled persons.
However, market conditions and regulatory environments are not always supportive of the growth of SMEs and access to formal finance
is one of the main obstacles they face.

IFC’s Financial Institutions Group (FIG) in MENA provides investment and advisory services to the region’s banks and other financial
institutions to build their capacity in SME banking so that they can profitably and sustainably reach out to the SME sector. This is achieved
through providing equity finance, lines of credit, risk sharing facilities, trade finance, disseminating best practices, improving processes and
products, and streamlining delivery channels. Ultimately, IFC’s goal is to increase the number of banks and financial institutions that offer
financial and banking services to SMEs in a profitable and sustainable manner. IFC is recognized globally as an SME finance market leader
owing to its global expertise and knowledge.

There is a huge demand for Islamic products by SMEs in the MENA region and, according to this study, approximately 32 percent of such
businesses remain excluded from the formal banking sector because of a lack of Shariah-compliant products.

In order to reach out to SMEs demanding Islamic products, and as part of IFC’s initiative to enhance its SME investment and advisory services
offerings to Islamic financial institutions, we needed to better understand the market from both the demand and supply sides in order to identify any
gaps or niches where IFC could assist and add value. With this objective, IFC commissioned a study in nine countries of the MENA region, which
includes Pakistan, to better understand the demand and supply for Islamic banking products (both asset and liability products and other banking
services) in the SME sector. The countries chosen for this study are: (1) Iraq, (2) Pakistan, (3) Yemen, (4) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, (5) Egypt, (6)
Lebanon, (7) Morocco, (8) Tunisia, and (9) Jordan.

The scope of the study was to: (i) identify the countries in the MENA region facing gaps in financing and banking needs of SMEs in the Islamic
products space; (ii) conduct a supply side benchmarking to review current capacity of financial institutions to offer Islamic products to this sector;
(iii) conduct a demand side benchmarking to identify key SME customer needs for Islamic products and see how well they are currently being served;
and (iv) review the current enabling environment and readiness levels of banks in terms of the regulatory framework and Shariah compliance.

The study reiterates several of the now well researched and documented reasons for the lack of access to finance for SMEs. However, more
importantly, the study reveals that, there is a potential gap of $8.63 billion to $13.20 billion for Islamic SME financing within un-served and
underserved SMEs categories, with a corresponding deposit potential of $9.71 billion to $15.05 billion across these countries. This is due to the
fact these un-served and underserved SMEs do not borrow from conventional banks, only owing to religious reasons. This potential is a “new to
bank” funding opportunity, which is still untapped, as banks and other financial institutions lack adequate strategic focus on this segment to offer
Shariah-compliant products.

This Regional Executive Summary provides a comparative analysis of the SME potential across these countries and the opportunities
available to Islamic institutions to tap this potential. The nine individual country reports provide a deeper insight into the SME landscape and
potential opportunities for Islamic banks in each country. The reports also highlight the measures that banks may need to take to successfully
target the Islamic banking potential of SMEs.

Foreword
In recent years, banks in Pakistan and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have become increasingly interested in targeting
the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector and have realized that many small businesses demand Shariah-compliant banking. While the
IFC has conducted several studies to determine the gap in financing and use of banking services for SMEs, it was still not clear how many of
them were excluded due to religious reasons.

To provide clarity on the subject, IFC commissioned a study to better understand the demand and supply for Islamic banking products
(both asset and liability products as well as other banking services) in the SME sector in Pakistan. The scope of the study covers (i) gaps in
SMEs’ banking needs in the Islamic products space; (ii) supply-side benchmarking to review the current capacity of financial institutions to
offer Islamic products to SMEs; (iii) demand-side benchmarking to identify key SME needs for Islamic products and see how well they are
being served; and (iv) review of the current enabling environment and readiness levels in terms of the regulatory framework and Shariah
compliance.

This report on Pakistan reveals a ‘new to bank’ Islamic funding and depository opportunity, primarily due to un-served and underserved
SMEs (approximately 20 percent to 25 percent), who do not borrow from conventional banks due to religious reasons. This potential is
untapped as banks and other financial institutions lack adequate strategic focus on this segment to offer Shariah-compliant products.

Despite many SMEs exhibiting strong interest for Shariah-compliant products, narrow product offerings, limited outreach, and restricted
operational capabilities are hindering this sector’s growth. However, if banks and other financial institutions are able to implement the
recommendations outlined in this report, they would be able to capitalize on this significant opportunity at the bottom of the pyramid.

The successful implementation of these strategies by banks could lead to the following “new to bank” potential:

In addition to the potential offered by un-served and underserved enterprises, the well-served conventional portfolio also offers significant
‘conversion/migration’ potential. Although the well-served enterprises have sufficient financing available, they are nonetheless inclined towards
Islamic banking. However, they do not approach Islamic banks due to the non-availability of Islamic banking products or cumbersome
transactional processes. Such segments could offer a ‘conversion/migration’ potential of 5 percent to 8 percent of the current SME portfolio.

Executive Summary
   The objective of this study is to ascertain the number of SMEs who
   do not borrow because of religious reasons, reflecting a need that
   is unmet. How many SMEs borrow the bare minimum required
   to survive and would have borrowed more if Islamic financing
   options were available. Also, how many SMEs prefer Islamic
   banking, but choose conventional banks for their banking needs
   because of the lack of adequate Islamic banking facilities?




The small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is a key component of Pakistan’s economy. It accounts for 30 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP), 25 percent of exports of manufactured goods, and 35 percent of the manufacturing value added1. It also employs more
than 78 percent2 of the non-agricultural workforce. The SME sector can play an important role in revitalizing Pakistan’s economy and
ensuring inclusive growth in the long term. However, SMEs face numerous problems such as low levels of skill and training, corruption, and
inadequate public infrastructure. One of the biggest problems affecting the development of SMEs in Pakistan is inadequate access to finance.

The banking system in Pakistan has been reducing exposure to SMEs over the past few years, primarily due to macroeconomic factors and
the SMEs’ poor business conditions, which make lending to them a risky proposition. In addition to this, the banks themselves have yet to
build requisite capacity to serve this segment. SME lending by the banking sector as a whole declined to $2.7 billion (6.8 percent of the total
lending) in 2012 from $3.8 billion (11.7 percent of total lending) in 20083. Moreover, Islamic banks, which have traditionally followed an
even more cautious approach when lending to SMEs, further reduced their exposure to just 4.1 percent of all loans in 2012 ($100 million)
from 9.8 percent in 2008 ($145 million)4. However, banks are looking to reach out to the SME sector, and with improvement in business
conditions and banks’ capacity, Islamic lending to SMEs is expected to revive.

Access to finance is a major issue for SMEs in Pakistan; well-served SMEs account for just 11 percent of the total SME population, whereas
22 percent of the SMEs are underserved and 67 percent un-served5. Religious belief is a key reason hindering SMEs from opting for formal
financing. Approximately 20 percent to 25 percent6 of SMEs (accounting for more than 150,000 enterprises) do not opt at all for formal
financing or borrow less than 20 percent of their requirements due to their religious beliefs7. This type of sentiment has been growing
stronger, especially over the past five to six years. Although these SMEs are creditworthy, they are excluded from accessing funding from
banks as Shariah-compliant products are either not available or not properly understood by these SMEs or involve lengthy processes, making
the execution of Islamic transactions cumbersome.

SMEs in Pakistan
     SMEs in Pakistan are an important part of the economy. They
     can play an important role in developing the country. However,
     their potential is currently affected by poor access to finance and
     an unfavorable business climate. The government needs to take
     urgent steps to address these problems and ensure sustainable
     sector growth.




Definition

There is no singular, comprehensive definition of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Pakistan, and various authorities use different
criteria to define them.17 The country’s SME landscape has already been well documented by IFC in several of its earlier publications.
Therefore, an exhaustive overview of the definition is not presented here. The most widely acknowledged and used definition of small and
medium enterprises is that given by the State Bank of Pakistan (SME Prudential Regulations and Microfinance Prudential Regulations).



SMEs’ contribution to Pakistan’s economy

The SME sector has emerged as the backbone of the country over the last few years, generating employment and driving economic growth

SMEs form an important component of Pakistan’s economy, playing a pivotal role in inclusive growth.
They account for 30 percent of national gross domestic product (GDP), 25 percent of exports of
manufactured goods, 35 percent of manufacturing value added18, and employ more than 78 percent19

geography

SMEs ownership patterns are highly skewed towards sole
proprietorship, which accounts for 74 percent of the total, followed by
registered partnerships (13 percent) and societies (about 2 percent)22,
among others. Sole proprietorship is the preferred ownership pattern
in the country as minimum regulatory requirements are involved in
establishing such organizations.

A large proportion of SMEs (reportedly 20 percent to 25 percent or

to religious reasons despite banks’ efforts to reach out to the SME

would rather remain excluded from formal financing.

to the business environment, such as high levels of corruption

Current Status of Islamic Banking in Pakistan
     Pakistan’s banking sector has gone through a three-stage
     evolution process from conventional banking during 1948–1980
     to profit and loss sharing (PLS) banking in the 1980s and 1990s to
     the current mix of PLS and Shariah-compliant banking.




An overview of Pakistan’s banking system

Currently, approximately 3430 commercial banks, including private, public sector, and foreign banks, and four specialized banks operate in
Pakistan. Of these, five are Islamic banks and 12 are conventional ones with Islamic windows31. The industry has faced a few challenges due
to the global financial crisis and the subsequent deterioration in the domestic fiscal situation, which resulted in the public sector borrowing
significantly from banks. Although a rise in non-performing loans (NPLs) tested the sector’s resilience, it continues to play a key, pivotal role
in the country’s economy.

The increasing role of private banks (which hold 81 percent32 of commercial banking assets) in the banking sector has led to a higher level
of professionalism and service orientation. Value-added services such as web banking and mobile banking have also helped revolutionize the
sector.

During 2006–2012, Pakistan’s banking assets expanded due to a rise in the number of new banks launched and an increase in branch
penetration across the country. Development and growth of Islamic banking has also contributed to asset and deposit growth during the
period. The number of branches in Pakistan has significantly increased. It is estimated that the country currently has approximately 9,52833
branches.

The state of Islamic banking in Pakistan

Islamic banking in Pakistan can trace its origins back to the late
1970’s when steps for the Islamisation of the banking and financial
system were introduced

Pakistan was among the first three countries in the world to attempt
to implement interest-free banking at a comprehensive/national
level. Considering the magnitude of the task, it was undertaken in
a phased manner. Islamisation measures included the elimination
of interest from the operations of specialized financial institutions,
including House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC), Investment
Corporation of Pakistan (ICP), and National Investment Trust
(NIT), in July 1979 and that of commercial banks from January
1981 to June 1985.

SBP has also provided a Shariah compliant framework, including a Shariah board at the central bank level, a Shariah advisor at the indi-
vidual bank level, mandatory internal Shariah audits, and periodic Shariah inspections by the central bank.

Although Islamic banking assets account for just about 8.6 percent41 of the country’s total banking assets, the segment has grown rapidly
over the last few years. The rapid rise in Islamic banking assets was due to an increase in the number of Islamic banks, growth in the number
of branches, measures taken by the government and the central bank, better asset quality metrics, and greater demand for Shariah-compliant
products from customers.

With regard to deposits, Islamic banking penetration has increased rapidly over the years. Customers have had an increasing tendency to hold
deposits in Islamic accounts, raising the penetration of Islamic deposits from 2.6 percent in 2006 to 9.7 percent in 201242.

There are currently five full-fledged Islamic banks in Pakistan and 12 conventional banks with Islamic windows. As of December 2012,
the country had approximately 1,097 Islamic banking branches, up from just 15043 in December 2006. The Punjab province accounts for
the maximum number of Islamic banking branches (476), followed by the Sindh region (369), and KPK (120)44. The widening network of
branches alludes to the rising demand for Islamic banking and the efforts taken by banks to expand their reach across the country.

Growth of deposits in the Islamic banking sector has significantly outpaced that of the overall banking system. The trend is expected to
continue in the near future due to the increasing religious sentiment in the country and penetration of Islamic banks into smaller towns.
Depositors also perceive Islamic banks as less risky vis-à-vis conventional ones. Moreover, Islamic banks have been investing quite heavily in
Sukuk offered by the central bank during the last couple of years.

Asset quality of Islamic banks is better than the overall industry average

Islamic banks in Pakistan have traditionally followed a more cautious approach toward lending, enabling better control over asset quality
vis-à-vis conventional banks. The sector’s ratio of NPLs to total loans is significantly lower than the banking industry’s historical average,
which has helped create a positive image for Islamic banking in the country.

Textile and energy are the major sectors that avail of Islamic banking products in Pakistan

In terms of sector concentration, textiles and energy (production and transmission) receive almost 30 percent48 of Islamic banking funds.
The textiles sector was the largest recipient of Islamic banking funds during the past few years, in line with the trend witnessed in the overall
banking industry. Despite an increase in the share of Islamic funds to the agribusiness sector, it remains underpenetrated.

In 2010, the IFC, in conjunction with the SBP, conducted a detailed assessment to identify the top ten priority SME sub-sectors in Pakistan
and evaluate their financial needs. The sectors included manufacturing (comprising sub-sectors such as textiles and chemicals, among others),
wholesale and retail trade, social and community services, and transport, storage and communication. While these sectors were found to
be highly attractive, the statistics with regard to advances made to these sectors varies with the information published periodically by SBP.
Currently, these sectors receive just 4.1 percent49of Islamic lending.

The cost of funds for Islamic loans was in the range of 5 percent to 8 percent50 in 2011. Most banks maintained a stable rate between 2009
and 2011. The cost of funds of Faysal Bank increased during the period due to the high amounts of non-remunerative deposits, which were
not deployed during the period.

Islamic and conventional banking exposure to the SME sector in Pakistan has declined during the past few years (in terms of the total
lending / financing) owing to high levels of NPL rates associated with the sector

Under the current scenario wherein asset quality is deteriorating and NPLs are increasing constantly, banks, particularly Islamic banks, are
taking a more cautious approach towards lending.

The SME sector is considered riskier and has been severely affected by this safety-first approach. Funding to the sector has decreased
considerably over the years, with conventional and Islamic banks preferring to divert funds to safer asset classes. Additionally, the limited
number of products on offer to SMEs and the lack of product reengineering have contributed to a
decline in lending to the SME sector. Lending by conventional banks to the SME sector declined from
$3.8 billion in 2008 to $2.7 billion in 2012, while Islamic banks’ lending to the sector also declined         “ ….Financing to SMEs is the

Islamic Banking Opportunities across SMEs
   There is a potential opportunity to tap the SMEs’ demand for
   Islamic financing in Pakistan and address the unmet needs of the
   un-served and underserved SME population, owing to religious
   beliefs. The opportunity is currently worth an estimated $2.6 to
   $3.8 billion.




Access to finance for the SME sector

Penetration of formal financing channels is relatively low in Pakistan, largely restricted to medium-sized enterprises in larger cities, while
access to finance is a major constraint for the SME sector

Small and medium enterprise (SME) financing in Pakistan has gained momentum in the last decade due to various initiatives undertaken
by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the government, such as the introduction of prudential regulations for Islamic SMEs. However,
the sector’s credit gap remains wide and ranges from $2.6 billion to $3.8 billion (sourced from figure 18) of “new to bank” financing
requirements.

Most of the borrowers are based in Pakistan’s three largest cities (Karachi, Lahore, and Faisalabad), which together account for more than 50
percent of the country’s total SME financing, while the 20 largest cities account for nearly 85 percent of financing. Moreover, these borrowers
are largely medium-sized enterprises. Small enterprises generally obtain funds through informal mediums57.

Access to finance is a major issue for SMEs in Pakistan; well-served SMEs account for just 11 percent of the total SME population, and the
other two categories are:

•	 Underserved SMEs: These enterprises, which represent 22 percent58 of the total SME population, avail of formal financing (Islamic or
   conventional) that meets less than 20 percent of their requirements.

•	 Un-served SMEs: These represent 67 percent59 of the SME population who do not borrow at all for various reasons, including religious
   beliefs.

Religious belief is certainly one of the key reasons hindering some SMEs from opting for formal financing. Approximately 20 to 25 percent60
of SMEs (accounting for more than 150,000 enterprises) do not opt at all for formal financing or borrow less than 20 percent of their
requirements due to their religious beliefs61. This sentiment has been growing stronger, especially over the past five to six years. Although
these SMEs are creditworthy, they are excluded from accessing funding from banks as Shariah-compliant products are either unavailable or
not properly understood by these SMEs or involve lengthy processes, making the execution of Islamic transactions cumbersome.

SMEs in Pakistan prefer short-term financing, which is in line with the characteristics exhibited by the sector in other emerging economies
where small businesses adopt a short-sighted, reactive approach to business planning and management.

Informal channels fulfill major credit needs of Pakistan’s SME sector

Most SMEs in Pakistan operate as sole proprietorships or family businesses. These enterprises primarily engage in cash transactions and,
thus, prefer to acquire funds through informal channels. Moreover, a large number of SME owners, especially outside urban areas, are
not financially literate regarding their banking needs. They prefer informal funding routes because they are based on trust and offer more
flexibility in terms of documentation, repayment, timing and transactions costs, which formal financial institutions do not provide.

While SMEs opine that most of their current requirements are met
by Islamic banks, they would prefer an Islamic structure similar to
overdraft facilities, known as “running finance” or “current finance”
offering, by conventional banks. While some Islamic banks offer a
“running Musharaka” structure that resembles an overdraft facility
offered to a larger corporate, banks should consider providing
SMEs with a similar structure due to the high demand and large
future potential.

From a liability perspective, Islamic banks meet all the requirements
of SMEs through current accounts, savings accounts, and financing
against deposits. Banks should also broaden their product and
service offerings to SMEs through non-borrowing services, such
as cash management, payments, collections, and trade finance
solutions. Other measures include appointments of dedicated
SME business managers and encouraging SMEs to use mobile and
Internet banking. Banks such as Meezan, Bank Alfalah, Bank Al
Habib, Habib Metro, and Standard Chartered Pakistan are adept
at providing such facilities to SMEs. Banks can also explore the

Note: Well served medium scale enterprises which account for the remaining 11 percent of the SME population have been excluded from the
calculations.



Possibility of a bull-case scenario: The possibility of a bullish scenario is based on the assumption that SMEs across the country would
have greater access to Islamic banks with Shariah principles that would appeal to them and prompt them to avail of financing from formal
channels. It is also assumed that customers and bank employees would be educated on the various Islamic finance structures. Banks would
also start offering various non-borrowing and value-added services. It is estimated that 20 percent of the un-served population and 15
percent of the underserved population, which stayed away from banks due to religious reasons, would start banking with Islamic banks. This
would result in an Islamic financing potential of $3.8 billion to the SME sector.

Possibility of a bear-case scenario: Under a bearish scenario, it is estimated that banks would be able to tap a maximum of 15 percent of the
SME population that does not currently bank due to religious reasons. Furthermore, banks are assumed to increase their branch penetration
in urban areas and introduce more diversity in Islamic structured products. Loan processing would also be made easier for SMEs. This would
result in an Islamic financing potential of $2.6 billion to the SME sector.

The manufacturing sector is likely to account for a large proportion of the funding opportunity

From a funding perspective, the manufacturing sector holds significant potential. This is based on the fact that, currently more than 70
percent68 of the Islamic SME finance goes toward the manufacturing sector. Further, due to the capital-intensive nature of operations, which
ensures that adequate collateral can be provided, this sector could be a first target of Islamic SME financing. Moreover, manufacturing activity
has a significantly higher economic impact. SMEs in the manufacturing sector contributed 25 percent to exports and their value addition to
the sector was about 35 percent69. Manufacturing enterprises have higher employment potential. Other viable sectors for funding are hotels
and restaurants and wholesale and retail. However, most enterprises operating in these sectors are likely to be less capital-intensive, smaller in
size, and informal in nature. The funding potential is small as demand for capital from these establishments is likely to be low and sporadic.

Islamic banks could also tap a new depository potential of $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion within the SME sector over the next few years

Note: This depository potential does not take into account the potential that could arise from offering non-banking activities



Based on the assumptions that margin requirements for un-served and underserved enterprises are 50 percent and 30 percent, respectively,
the deposit potential for these enterprises would be $2,500 to $25,500.

The potential also assumes that Islamic banks would offer a larger variety of diversified depository products similar to conventional banks
(including confirmed rate fixed deposit). Under a bullish scenario, where Islamic banking penetration improves across Pakistan and banks
offer additional deposit products to target SMEs more aggressively, the combined deposit potential is expected to be $1.3 billion. Alternatively,
if branch penetration is less satisfactory and the number of products offered to SMEs remains limited, the deposit potential is expected to
be $0.8 billion.

Islamic banks could attract SME customers of conventional banks (especially well-served mid-sized SMEs), increasing Islamic financing by
$3.1 billion to $4.9 billion and depository base by $0.5 billion to $0.7 billion

In addition to the ‘new to bank’ funding and depository potential, Islamic banks possess considerable potential to convert or cannibalize
the existing funding/lending and deposit portfolios of conventional banks, primarily pertaining to the existing well-served SMEs (mostly
middle-sized enterprises). These mid-sized SMEs deal with conventional banks due to the non-availability of appropriate Islamic banking
products, complex Islamic transactional processes, and most importantly, stringent access to finance provided to SMEs by Islamic banks
(currently, Islamic banks’ SME sector penetration is just 4 percent vis-à-vis the conventional banks’ 7 percent)70. However, considering the
availability and feasibility of adopting Islamic banking products as an alternative to conventional banking, 5 percent to 8 percent of these
mid-sized SMEs would shift to Islamic banking specifically due to religious reasons. This could provide Islamic banks a funding conversion
or cannibalization opportunity of $3.1 billion to $4.9 billion and deposit conversion of $0.5 billion to $0.7 billion.

Strategic operational adjustments can help Islamic banks target SMEs more effectively

In order to capitalize on the funding and depository potential, Islamic banks need to look beyond the conventional ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach
and provide SMEs with customized value additions, much akin to what many conventional banks are now increasingly offering. The required
competency framework is highlighted below where banks would need to acquire the required proficiencies for building and managing a
successful “Islamic SME Banking” business:

     prevents SMEs from evolving into larger and more sustainable

     services to aid and facilitate growth.

V.	 Organization and Systems

     Better training for SME professionals: There is a shortage of
     staff knowledgeable about Shariah-compliant products across
     financial institutions due to the inadequate amount of time
     and effort spent on training them. To rectify this, financial
     institutions need to incorporate better training procedures into
     their organizational frameworks. Investing in employee training
     would allow Islamic banks to serve SMEs more effectively and
     help increase market penetration.

VI.	Risk Management

     Adopt better and more sophisticated methodologies: Most
     financial institutions rely on traditional banking approaches to
     identify and target viable SMEs. Financial institutions need to
     incorporate appropriate credit evaluation techniques (such as
     behavioral scoring, credit scoring, and cash flow and program-
     based lending) and build stronger early warning systems and
     collections frameworks to target and manage SMEs better, price
     products more effectively, and reduce risk exposure.

     Streamline loan application processes for SMEs: SMEs face
     difficulty in applying for loans due to the amount of documentation
     required and the long approval process (exceeding more than a
     month). Most SMEs lack the documentation required to apply

Conclusion
   Pakistan’s Islamic financing market for SMEs is estimated to be
   worth $2.6 to $3.8 billion over the next few years, comprising
   SMEs that are creditworthy but do not borrow from conventional
   banking institutions due to religious beliefs.




Pakistan’s banking system has evolved significantly and is a vital component of the country’s economy. Islamic banking is one of the fastest-
growing sub-segments in the sector, with assets expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38 percent over the last six years.
Shariah-compliant assets account for 8.6 percent of overall banking assets in Pakistan72. During the same period, Islamic deposits increased
at a CAGR of 42 percent73. The central bank is developing a strategic five-year plan (2013–2017) for Pakistan’s Islamic banking industry,
especially focused on Islamic finance for the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector.

Pakistan’s SME sector accounts for -30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), 35 percent of manufacturing value added, and 25 percent
of exports from the manufacturing sector74. SMEs continue to benefit from various government initiatives aimed at promoting the sector.

The sector remains significantly underfunded despite such measures. Bank lending to SMEs as a percent of total lending declined to 6.8
percent in 2012 from 11.7 percent in 200875. Lending to the sector by Islamic banks dropped to 4.1 percent in 2012 from 9.8 percent in 2008,
primarily due to the cautionary approach taken by banks to maintain their asset quality76. The lack of awareness about Islamic banking and
the limited range of Islamic products available for SMEs are two factors responsible for the decline in Islamic SME lending. Additionally, it
is estimated that about 20 percent to -25 percent77 of SMEs do not approach banks for finance due to religious reasons.

Most SMEs seek finance to meet their working capital requirements and rely largely on informal sources for funds. Islamic banks offer
deposit products as well as trade finance and cash finance products under the Murabaha and diminishing Musharaka structures. However,
they should consider offering SMEs the equivalent of conventional overdraft facilities (offered by conventional banks). The most important
steps that Islamic financial institutions need to take to tap the SME sector are similar to what several conventional banks are now doing,
i.e. streamlining their product offerings (make them more SME-focused), investing in a well-trained workforce, improving processes, and
expanding their presence in rural and urban areas alongside SME clusters. Islamic banks should also consider offering the SME sector non-
borrowing services, such as cash management services and branchless banking, etc. However, banks in Pakistan would need guidance and
support to successfully implement this strategy as they lack the requisite knowhow and expertise.

From a funding perspective, the manufacturing sector offers Islamic banks the highest potential (say over 50 percent, based on the fact
that, currently, more than 70 percent of Islamic SME financing is towards the manufacturing sector78) over the next few years due to the
underlying potential and the capital intensity of operations.

Several initiatives are being undertaken to improve the reach of Islamic banking in Pakistan. However, it is important that SMEs and bank
employees are educated on the various aspects and benefits of Islamic banking and awareness increases about products and structures. If
banks were to successfully tap SMEs that do not bank due to religious reasons, the potential funding opportunity in the SME sector could be
$2.6 billion to $3.8 billion. There is also a depository potential of $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion from this segment.

Islamic banking, as a practice, has immense potential in Pakistan. The strong perception about Islamic banking and the high growth exhibited
by the sector would bode well for the sector over the next few years. Islamic banks should capitalize on the potential within this sector
by diversifying its products and services, easing transactional procedures, reducing documentation, training staff on the various aspects of
Islamic banking, and improving existing infrastructure and capacity to better serve the needs of the SME population.

Implementing these measures would enable Islamic banks in Pakistan to tap the SME sector’s demand for Islamic
finance more effectively and spur growth in the industry

•	 Percentage of enterprises eligible for banking services (based on credit criteria, proximity to bank / financial institutions etc.)

•	 Challenges faced while accessing banking / financing services

•	 Awareness about Islamic banking services, and willingness to avail such services
