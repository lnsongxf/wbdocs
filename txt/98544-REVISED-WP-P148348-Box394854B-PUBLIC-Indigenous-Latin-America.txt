     per day for extreme poverty (an average of national extreme poverty lines in the region) and US$4 a day for moderate poverty, which are more appropriate in
     light of prevailing costs of living in the region. This estimate combines poverty rates calculated from household surveys and population trends calculated from
     censuses of the late 2000s, in countries with available data (Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru).

9	 	 Parallel to this report, the World Bank carried out a series of dialogues, both in Latin America and worldwide, which included a workshop held November 25–27,
     2013, in Washington, DC, where eight members of Abya Yala (AY), a regional network representing some 40 indigenous organizations from North and South
     America, recommended identifying indicators that better reflect their own views and needs of development. A second meeting took place in late January 2014, in
     Kuna Yala, Panama, and a draft of this report was presented and discussed at the United Nations World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, celebrated Sep-
     tember 22–23, 2014. This final version incorporates, to the best of the authors’ abilities, the views and recommendations of the indigenous delegates present at
     these events.

      the indigenous population in two by adopting the term peasant for the sedentary indigenous farmers of the Andes and native for the Amazonian indigenous
      peoples. As a result, a majority of the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking populations favored the use of “peasant communities” (comunidades campesinas) and
      rejected the more internationally accepted label “indigenous communities.” This semantic distinction has had not only demographic consequences, but also

28	 	 Another important factor associated with language replacement—and culture change in general—is formal education. This is not to say that formal education or
      Spanish proficiency necessarily erodes indigenous cultures, but the way formal education is being implemented in indigenous milieus in much of the region is
      not contributing to their development with identity. This need not be, as abundant evidence on intercultural bilingual education shows. IBE can offer indigenous
      peoples the alternative of taking part in and benefiting from the prosperity of the state without having to renounce their languages and cultures (see “Education”
      section for more information).

     Box 1 | Language as a Category of Exclusion



      In the settlement of El Mayor, in northern Mexico, the Cucapa people (also known as Awiłł Kwñchawaay) are
      facing restrictions over their fishing rights, in part because this group has failed to satisfy the official criteria used
      to recognize indigenous peoples. One of the key arguments used to delegitimize the Cucapa’s demands for
      land titles and fishing rights is their adoption of Spanish as their primary language. While native speakers of
      the Yuman-family language have been reduced to a handful of elders, the younger generations have adopted
      Spanish in their daily lives. Although this did not previously pose a problem, many of their members are now
      “finding that a lack of fluency in their indigenous language and traditions is increasingly delegitimizing their current
      legal claims.”29

      The Cucapa case illustrates the extent to which language proficiency can not only undermine the right of attaining
      food security and preserving customary forms of production, but also—and more remarkably—reinforce existing
      forms of discrimination. If in previous decades the Cucapa were excluded for not being properly integrated into
      national society (that is, for not speaking Spanish), they now face the risk of being discriminated against on the
      basis of not being properly “indigenous” (that is, for not speaking a native language). The role that languages
      can play in the recognition of indigenous rights has become so critical that other groups, such as the Pataxó of
      northeastern Brazil, have made strenuous efforts to adopt a foreign indigenous language (Maxakali) to fulfill the
      demands of authenticity enforced by Brazilian government agencies.30

      Establishing rigid criteria of language proficiency can also hamper development programs that might help
      indigenous people overcome poverty. Among the Cucapa, several projects based on ecotourism have been
      halted because sponsors require “a certain level of ‘cultural knowledge’ and reflexivity… [and] language
      competency is often used as the indicator for such qualities.”31

      Screening out indigenous populations on the basis of noncompliance with externally defined features of
      indigeneity can therefore have serious social consequences, as well as negative outcomes in terms of promoting
      development—such as the impossibility of reclaiming fishing rights or collective land titles.

      In sum, self-identification not only reasserts indigenous peoples’ agency to decide their forms of adscription,
      but it also allows accounting for the changing and historically specific character of indigeneity, as well as the
      distinctive ways indigenous peoples cope with national society, market forces, state politics, and development
      agencies. Establishing rigid criteria for the identification of indigenous people can therefore trigger negative
      consequences for those who do not meet all the “relevant” benchmarks—giving rise not only to stereotypical
      and discriminatory notions of “generic,” “new,” or “fake” indigenous peoples, but also to concrete forms of social
      exclusion, displacement, and violation of rights.

a	 For countries without census data available for the end of the decade, the indigenous population was estimated by applying the percentage of the
   last census to the 2010 projection of the national population.
b	 The indigenous population was estimated using “self-identification” in all the censuses, except for Peru, which provides only “mother tongue” as a
   means of identification. In this case, the indigenous population was estimated by identifying as “indigenous” all the members of a household where
   the head of the household speaks an indigenous language.
c	 In Bolivia, only respondents 15 years of age or older were asked if they self-identified as indigenous, so the estimate in the table extrapolates the
   percentage of indigenous population in the segment “15 years of age or older” to the segment “14 years of age or younger.”
d	 Includes people who self-identify as belonging to an indigenous group and people of indigenous descent.
e	 In Nicaragua, self-identification includes indigenous peoples, Creoles, and mestizos. The latter two categories were not included in this estimate
   for consistency with the rest of the report, though they are usually listed as indigenous population in the official data of the country.
f	 The regional estimate was constructed as a weighted average, using country population as weights.

     Rural migrations, partly sparked by agrarian reform and the emergence of economic opportunities
     around the railway system, the airport, and a growing industrial sector, accelerated El Alto’s growth
     during the second half of the twentieth century. Today it hosts over 800,000 people, mostly Aymara.
     With the transition to El Alto, Aymara-speaking dwellers began to organize themselves in juntas de
     vecinos (neighborhood organizations), and already by 1979 these local associations had gained a
     certain degree of autonomy, structured around the Federación de Juntas Vecinales. Through collective
     organization, “El Alto residents saw a larger share of municipal resources being spent in the city center
     and thus demanded access to and control over their own financial resources.”72

     During the 1980s, with the privatization of tin mines and the implementation of other policies that
     deteriorated the living conditions of many rural families, there was a massive influx of miners to El Alto,
     which triggered an 11-fold increase in the informal sector from 1989 to 1995 (at an average rate of
     130 percent per year). Today the informal sector is one of the main economic activities in El Alto. The
     widespread informality in El Alto has transformed juntas into the main political voice for indigenous
     people.

     In El Alto, the juntas thus became the most important grassroots organizations. Neighborhoods
     organized the boards to plan, finance, and build basic infrastructure and provide services. The boards
     were the main instrument used for building the city and were also a tool of mediation, representation,
     and accountability in both public and private spaces. El Alto has also become a place to express
     indigenous forms of urbanization and beauty.73

women in Latin America struggle within the                           movement and create coalitions with the feminist
indigenous movements to keep their unity and to                      movements gaining a more prominent political

      Although many questions remain, the region’s continued and persistent FPIC practice is starting
      to shed light onto some of the requirements and best practices for its successful implementation.
      Despite numerous setbacks, stakeholders across the region increasingly accept that FPIC is essential
      to sustainable decision making. Their perseverance is starting to bear fruit.

      While the issue of consent as an objective or an outcome, as well as the controversy over indigenous
      peoples’ right to veto decisions, continues to prompt heated debates, Colombian constitutional law
      practice has shed light on the requirements for the cases in which the ultimate decision has to be
      taken by the government. In those cases, according to the Colombian Constitutional Court, the
      authority’s decision must:

           -	 Be free from bias and authoritarianism;
           -	 Be objective, reasonable, and proportional to the state’s constitutional mandate to protect the
              social, cultural, and economic identity of the indigenous community; and,
           -	 Provide the necessary means to mitigate, correct, or repair the resulting impacts, present and
              future.

      In addition, echoing the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Colombia’s Constitutional Court has
      gone further to suggest indigenous peoples may have binding decision-making power in cases of
      large-scale development projects or measures that might threaten their cultural and material survival.101

      One of the lessons learned concerning the material dimension of FPIC is the need for quality, unbiased
      baseline information on the situation of indigenous people. Quality baseline information allows
      proponents to identify measures that should be consulted on with indigenous people. Here, again,
      one can refer to the Colombian experience with the law on reparations to the victims of violence.102 In
      that case, a diagnosis by the Constitutional Court of the situation of indigenous communities resulting
      from the decades of violence singled out indigenous people as having been particularly vulnerable to
      the injustices that the law was meant to address. The court’s report triggered a FPIC process that has
      been hailed as one of the most successful in Colombian history.103

      Crafting Costa Rica’s Biodiversity Law (1998) showed that a strong, principled basis for FPIC
      negotiation, backed by political will, can deliver solid outcomes. In setting out to legislate under the

                                                                                                                                                CONTINUE

      Convention on Biological Diversity, Costa Rica defined the parameters of the legislation as based on
      the following principles: 1) equal access to and distribution of the benefits from the use of biodiversity;
      2) respect for human rights, particularly of groups marginalized because of cultural or economic
      conditions; 3) sustainable use of biodiversity components to respect the development options
      of future generations; and 4) democracy as a guarantee of greater participation of all citizens in
      decision making. Accordingly, the Biodiversity Law was the result of extensive consultations including
      indigenous people, farmers, industry, scientists, and other relevant stakeholders. Consultations with
      indigenous people were conducted separately as a special and distinct group. After two failed drafts,
      the final Biodiversity Law passed in Costa Rica is hailed as an example of sustainability. Among other
      things, it requires consultations with indigenous communities before conducting any research on
      genetic resources, and benefits-sharing arrangements for any commercialization of those resources.
      In addition, the law was designed to allow refinements and adjustments in consultation with those
      affected, including indigenous people.104

      Though outside the confines of state–indigenous peoples relations, the experience and practices
      of UN agencies in Nicaragua also demonstrate that including broad representation of indigenous
      peoples to participate in decision making can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the result. In
      2009, Nicaragua’s UN offices supported the creation of the Consultative Committee of Indigenous and
      Afro-Descendant Peoples (in Spanish, CCPIAN). The CCPIAN is made up of 12 members including
      indigenous representatives, Afro-descendant representatives from the Caribbean coast, and three
      eminent individuals known for their experience, knowledge, and commitment to indigenous and Afro-
      descendant peoples’ rights. It offers advice to UN agencies working in Nicaragua to help them better
      incorporate the rights of indigenous peoples into UN programs and activities, with program objectives
      and activities discussed and agreed jointly. CCPIAN members also serve on the program’s executive
      and advisory boards. Its contributions to the decision-making process of UN agencies in Nicaragua
      have led to improvements in the coherence and overall benefits of UN programs for indigenous
      peoples in the country.105

      From these and other cases, it seems that, at minimum, striving for adequate FPIC implementation
      requires that the following aspects are considered:

      Representation: Identified indigenous representatives should be vetted by the communities they
      purport to represent. Before engaging in the process of FPIC, there needs to be a clear understanding
      about who can represent and who can make a decision for an indigenous community (which are not
      necessarily identical). While local leaders tend to have the skills and experience needed to engage
      directly with development actors, it is important to ensure that their actions and viewpoints convey
      the interests of all individuals, especially of those members who lack voice or face greater vulnerability.
      Moreover, indigenous peoples’ representation should be wide, meaning that—where possible—there
      is direct community participation in addition to elected representatives; or, alternatively, that the
      communities, through their own procedures and channels, express conformity with being represented
      and, where applicable, are bound by the word of their designated representative(s).
                                                                                                                                                     CONTINUE

      Indigenous institutions and procedures: During the implementation of FPIC, all actors must make
      sure that indigenous institutions, procedures, and decision-making instances are respected and taken
      into account. The involvement of indigenous authorities and institutions not only enables the broad
      participation of local stakeholders, but also reasserts their legal rights as culturally distinct societies.
      Indigenous institutions can also help avert the exclusion of women, elders, or individuals who live
      in geographically remote areas or under conditions of voluntary isolation. Likewise, indigenous
      institutions can also expand the degree of accessibility to critical information inasmuch as they can
      offer timely and culturally appropriate translations, especially concerning aspects such as land use,
      natural resources, environment, and social impacts.

      Time: Sufficient time must be allotted for the correct implementation of FPIC. Procedural constraints
      and contractual conditions, particularly those that set rigid time limits, can exert significant pressure
      and set a pace for the decision-making process that can hardly be compatible with indigenous
      peoples’ traditions and processes. Limited time frames usually lead to uninformed or non-consensual
      decisions about any future project. Furthermore, inappropriate time frames also impose unfair limits
      on the number and geographic reach of stakeholders that can participate in the process. Finally,
      operating under flexible and mutually agreed time frames can be another form of inclusion, insofar
      as it permits traditional institutions and leaders to function according to their own procedures and
      phases of deliberation and decision making.

      Flexibility: Interested parties need to remain open and flexible during the entire process. Given the
      complexity and lengthiness of FPIC, it is important for actors to be willing to change along the way.
      Agreements that are made during the first stages of the process might be disputed further down
      the line, or might require more information or time for deliberation. Moreover, community structure,
      leadership positions, and collective priorities might change dramatically over time. Thus, it is important
      to view FPIC as an organic endeavor in which the rules, methodologies, and objectives can be subject
      to continuous revisions.

    Box 4 | Ethnicity and Chronic Poverty in Rural Guatemala


     Indigenous people in Guatemala have historically faced economic and social exclusion. During the civil war
     (1960–96), many indigenous communities in the western highlands were affected by the internal armed
     conflict. The historic legacy of decades of violence and exclusion contributed to a morbid association
     between belonging to an indigenous household and chronic poverty. In 2011, for example, three out of four
     people living in persistently poor rural areas (chronically poor areas) belonged to an indigenous household
     (figure B4.1).

     Methodological note: data calculated using poverty maps for 2000 and 2011, for rural areas only. Chronically poor municipalities are those where rural poverty rates
     were above 75 percent at the beginning and end of the decade (2000 and 2011). Improved municipalities are areas where rural poverty was above 75 percent in 2000
     but below 75 percent in 2011. “Majority indigenous” are municipalities where more than 50 percent of the population is indigenous.




     Even though there is evidence of progress in some geographic areas with a high proportion of indigenous
     population—that is, the share of people in rural areas that improved was similar in indigenous and non-
     indigenous municipalities (see figure B4.2)—in general, indigenous people in chronically poor areas are
     persistently worse off than non-indigenous people. In chronically poor areas, adults living in municipalities
     with a majority of indigenous population had lower education levels and smaller improvements during the
     2000–11 period. In addition, school attendance rates were lower for indigenous children in these areas
     (see table B4.1). Malnutrition rates were also high for indigenous people, regardless of whether they lived
     in chronically poor or improved municipalities. However, in areas that showed improvement, the share of
     indigenous population was lower than in chronically poor areas (that is, in both areas this share was higher
     than 50 percent).

     Finally, chronically poor indigenous municipalities are more likely to be located in the northern and
     southwestern regions of the country. In contrast, the indigenous municipalities that improved were more
     likely to be in the northwestern and central regions (figure B4.3). This evidence suggests that low initial
     endowments and context matter in the dynamics of chronic poverty.

Methodological note: These marginal effects were estimated using OLS regressions on income per hour, controlling for ethnicity, gender, experience (defined as potential experi-
ence, which is equal to the difference between age and years of schooling minus six years), square of experience, marital status, educational attainment (complete primary, complete
secondary and tertiary), age cohort (18–24, 25–44, 45–54, 55–65 years of age), number of children in the household (compared with country’s median), type of work (wage workers,
self-employed, and no-wage workers), informality status, and size of region of residence (defined by population). Observations included only people from 18 to 65 years of age, out of
the agriculture sector and in urban areas for the urban estimate (the urban model, in addition, controls for sector of work including construction, commerce, manufacturing, transport,
mining and utilities, and other services); and people from 18 to 65 years of age, in the agriculture sector and living in rural areas for the rural estimate. These probabilities are statistically
significant (at least p<0.01).

Box 5 | Two Cases of Self-Driven Development in the Health Sector


In southern Chile, since the late 1980s, Mapuche organizations have been working toward improving
biomedical health care access for rural Mapuche families. They promoted community-driven
strategies of management and biomedical care, complemented with Mapuche medical practices and
knowledge. Today, these Mapuche organizations co-manage (with the Health Service of Araucania
Sur) the Mapuche Medicine Center at the Hospital de Nueva Imperial, the Makewe Hospital, and the
Intercultural Health Center Boroa Filulawen.

These initiatives were conceptualized within a framework of “intercultural health,” through which
indigenous communities collectively assume and coordinate the provision of biomedical care in their
territories, but according to their own views and needs, and in harmony with their traditional health
practices and knowledge. After 15 years of work, these three experiences of self-development have
not only improved health care inclusion in rural areas, but they also have spurred cultural and political
empowerment, becoming a model for intercultural health care for the region.

From a different position, the Servicios de Atención y Orientación al Indígena (SAOI), envisioned
and implemented by indigenous professionals working at the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, have
provided assistance and orientation to indigenous patients in major hospitals of the country since
2005. The service began with two pilot experiences in Maracaibo, in the west of the country, that
sought to improve access of indigenous patients who were often alienated from biomedical facilities
by cultural and linguistic barriers. Through bilingual and intercultural attention, provided by specially
trained indigenous professionals, indigenous families were guided through bureaucratic proceedings,
received translation during medical visits, were followed up during treatments, and received culturally
sensitive advice. The success of the first SAOI increased the demand of the service both from
indigenous people and from health workers in other regions.

Over time, the SAOI have also become creative environments for intercultural exchanges between
indigenous and biomedical healing practices and knowledge, allowing the introduction of culturally
pertinent facilities and diets as well as indigenous health knowledge and specialists into the hospital
environment. Despite the ups and downs of the Venezuelan economy over the past years, indigenous
personnel, health workers, and indigenous patients themselves have not only kept the SAOI services
alive, but have expanded their outreach to 32 hospitals in 12 states around the country. In nine years
of service, the SAOI have assisted over 380,000 indigenous patients, constituting one of the most
remarkable experiences of intercultural adaptation of public health care services in the region.

status has considerable negative impacts on                                status is associated with considerably lower
educational outcomes. In general, indigenous and                           school completion rates, regardless of age and
rural women have higher levels of illiteracy and                           geographic area. In Bolivia, the primary school

                  Box 6 | Gender, Location, and School Completion among Indigenous Bolivians



                   Educational attainment in Bolivia is significantly lower among women, ethnic minorities, and rural
                   residents, in spite of universal education policies that date to the 1930s and major education reforms
                   during the 1990s. Educational attainment in rural areas is generally better for men than women,
                   regardless of indigenous/non-indigenous status. For example, 7.6 percent of women have no
                   schooling, while the corresponding figure for men is 4.9 percent. Also, about 86 percent of women
                   and 92 percent of men are literate (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, 2011).

                   Women in rural areas and women who belong to indigenous groups have lower educational attainment
                   than any other group. The primary school completion rate for indigenous women in rural areas is half
                   the rate for non-indigenous men, at 25.6 percent vs. 52.5 percent. The disparity in the secondary
                   school completion rate is also large, at 9.8 percent vs. 22.9 percent. The combination of gender and
                   indigenous status is associated with considerably lower completion rates, regardless of age and
                   geographic area. Compared with non-indigenous men, non-indigenous women and indigenous men
                   are 9 percent and 10 percent less likely to complete primary school, respectively, while indigenous
                   women are 29 percent less likely to do so. Indigenous women are also 23 percent less likely to
                   complete secondary school than non-indigenous men (see figures B6.1 and B6.2).

        These persisting gaps between boys and girls could be associated with several factors: 1)
        pregnancy, for instance, is a common reason for dropping out of school; 2) many schools do not
        have separate sanitary facilities for girls, which is particularly problematic as girls get older and start
        to menstruate; 3) if schools are located too far away, traveling might be considered a “risk” for girls;
        etc. In more indirect terms, in households that have limited resources, boys are often privileged
        over girls when prioritizing between children to be sent to school; gendered curricula and schooling
        practices tend to also silently exclude girls. Also, the presence of younger siblings (in preschool)
        increases the probability of older sisters to be out of school, as they often help with domestic
        activities and take care of their younger siblings. It has therefore been argued that increasing the
        coverage of preschool programs could have a positive effect on school enrollment and attendance
        of older indigenous girls.133

    Box 7 | Indigenous Peoples’ Rights to Education


     Part VI of ILO No. 169 (Articles 26–31) grants indigenous peoples several educational rights, including
     the right to be educated in their own languages and cultures, with content based on their own history,
     knowledge, value systems, social practices, and technologies, as well as the right to maintain their
     own educational institutions under state funding. It also calls for equal access and opportunity to
     attain educational services at all levels and without discrimination. Article 30 moves a step further as
     it indirectly promotes interculturalism as a route for fostering a dignified image of indigenous peoples
     in contemporary society.

     The 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ratifies and expands most of the
     above mentioned aspects, and although issues related to the education of indigenous people are
     to an extent a crosscutting topic through this declaration, Articles 11 to 15 relate to the educational
     rights to which indigenous peoples are entitled. Articles 11 and 12 state the right to practice and
     maintain their present and future cultural traditions and customs, including their religious and spiritual
     practices and ceremonies, as well as the responsibility of states to protect and provide access
     to their religious and cultural sites. Article 13 and 14 establish that indigenous peoples “…have
     the right to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their histories, languages,
     oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures, and to designate and retain their own
     names for communities, places and persons” as well as to “…establish and control their educational
     systems and institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their
     cultural methods of teaching and learning.” The declaration determines that “states…in conjunction
     with indigenous peoples, take effective measures, in order for indigenous individuals, particularly
     children, including those living outside their communities, to have access, when possible, to an
     education in their own culture and provided in their own language” (Article 14, numeral 3). All of these
     considerations are linked to a higher-order right related to the dignity and aspirations of indigenous
     peoples and, as in the case of ILO No. 169, the states should take effective measures, in consultation
     with indigenous peoples, “…to combat prejudice and eliminate discrimination and to promote
     tolerance, understanding and good relations among indigenous peoples and all other segments of
     society” (Article 15).

     In 2009, the UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples carried out a study on the
     rights to education. The study identified lessons learned and challenges related to the implementation
     of these rights. Among the main lessons learned, the study referred to the adoption of laws and
     policies on the education of indigenous people, as well as to the provision of the necessary financial
     resources. As to the challenges encountered, the study prioritized the following:  lack of control
     over educational initiatives for indigenous children, lack of consultation on the development and
     implementation of educational services provided to indigenous people, limited consideration given
     to autonomy and participation of indigenous people in the delivery of educational services, and most
     generally the imposition of mainstream education on indigenous children.
