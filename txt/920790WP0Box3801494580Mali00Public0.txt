THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

      The geotechnical survey is necessary for establishing the cost of the

      company (LABOGEC) carry out the geotechnical survey. The survey is
      done by digging 6 wells in the construction plot. On average, each well       30 days     XOF 600,000

      Request and obtain building permit

      The application for a building permit will be filed at the City Council
      with jurisdiction for the construction area (Bamako District for this
      case). An agent receives the documents and verifies that they are
      complete. A processing fee (frais de depot) of FCFA 50,000.00 will be
      charged. The agent will subsequently issue a receipt indicating the day
      the permit will be ready and the fees that should be paid for the
      certificate (frais d'instruction). This same agent has 3 days to forward
      the application documents to the Ministry of Urbanisme.

      Upon receipt of the documents, the Ministry also has 3 days to forward
      the documents to the other agencies involved. One week later, the
      agencies will meet to discuss their comments on the documents. The            19 days      XOF 50,000

      Ministry will then take 3 additional days to send the file back to the City

      documents needed are not in the file, the agent would not accept the
      file and would request that BuildCo complete the file and re-submit it.

      If there is no response within this deadline, BuildCo may file a
      complaint and the City Hall has 8 days to respond. If there is no
      response within this time period, the silence-is-consent rule applies.

      Receive inspection from Regional Urban Planning Department - I

      Officials from the Regional Urban Planning Department are always on
      patrol to check projects without building permits. The possibility of
      receiving an inspection is noted in the authorization letter of the
6     building permit, but these are conducted randomly. There are                   1 day        no charge

      like the one in the case study would receive at least one such
      inspection whereby officials of the Regional Urban Planning
      Department would check whether or not BuildCo has a building permit.

        Given the silence-is-consent rule, some companies begin construction
        without the building permit. In such cases, these companies provide the

      new trends have appeared: transformers might be obtained from Ivory
      Coast, Morocco, Tunisia, within one month.

      The client can either wait for the utility to buy the transformer or buy it
      themselves directly to gain time.



      Agency: Store (overseas)



      The client obtains the external works and meter installation from
      Energie du Mali (EDM)

      The client can choose to hire either EDM or a private firm for the external
      works. In the latter case, the private firm would need the
      authorization/certification of EDM in order want to install the material.
      In practice, it is assumed EDM will carry out the works because it is less
      expensive and as such, is often the client’s choice. EDM subcontracts
      when it is not able to face the demands of its customers.

      In this case, an expansion (installation of a transformer) of the network is
      necessary.

      • The quotation for the cable and the material:
      If a company resorts to EDM and uses an overhead cable (not an
      underground cable), EDM will deduct XOF 2,300,000 from the total
      amount of the works. This explains mainly why EDM is cheaper.
      If the cable is dealt with by a private company, the beneficiary will not
      have this reduction but will be able to charge other customers the use of
      cable. Yet, after 5 years, this cable becomes the property of EDM.
4     • The quotation for the transformer                                       45 calendar days   XOF 12,750,526.8
      EDM proposes 2 types of transformers:
      An overhead transformer at 160 kVA costing XOF 4,407,000
      A pad-mounted transformer at 160 kVA costing XOF 4,538, 280
      Private companies tend to charge more for their transformers (higher
      margin).

      The type of service (overhead or underground) depends on the exact
      location of the building. On the left shore of Niger river, part of the
      service is overhead and another is underground (in any case, that side of
      the river is already saturated and cannot accommodate new customers).
      On the right shore, about 90% of installations are overhead, so it is
      assumed the service to connect to will be overhead.
      In this case, the total cost would be about XOF 13 – 13.5M. EDM would
      deduce XOF 2.3M from this, and then the client will need to pay an
      additional 10% of the final cost to EDM.

       The buyer should perform due diligence before entering into a sale
       agreement with the owner of the property. Due diligence can simply be
       done by requesting from the buyer the number of the property lot. With
       the given number, the buyer can personally go to the Land Registry and
       ask the register clerk to provide him with a certificate called “Réquisition
       Foncière”. This is done very promptly by searching the property lot
       number and making a copy of it. The information included in the                 2 days             3,500 FCFA

       certificate relates to property’s area, its exact location, the name of its
       actual owner (and all previous ones). It also includes all information
       relating to potential mortgages or liens encumbering it. The certificate
       engages the state’s responsibility and is more important than the deed
       of ownership presented by the seller. The deed can be outdated and not
       reflect the actual situation or it might be a fake.

                   Mali made paying taxes less costly for companies by reducing
                   the corporate income tax rate—though it also introduced a new

                   paying taxes by introducing a single form for joint filing and
                   payment of several taxes.
