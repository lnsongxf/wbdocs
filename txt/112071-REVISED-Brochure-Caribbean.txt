Resilience to Climate Change
and Natural Disasters
BUILDING RESILIENCE
Hurricanes Irma and Maria were a stark reminder that growing                                                                                           Storm Irma
exposure to natural disasters represents a real threat to
development prospects in the Caribbean. The World Bank
initiated projects to support climate resilience and enhance
disaster preparedness and emergency response in the islands
of Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines. The focus is mainly on making infrastructure
more adapted to extreme weather events and natural hazards
and improving government capacity to monitor, prepare for,
and finance climate risks.
Securing access to financial resources before a disaster strikes
is also important. In response to Hurricane Irma, the World
Bang Group has also expedited preparation for a contingency
line of credit like the Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option
for the Dominican Republic, and other countries are discussing
the option. Following hurricane Irma, a fast track emergency
recovery project is also being prepared for Antigua and
Barbuda.

  THINKING BLUE GROWTH
  Harnessing marine resources while preserving the Caribbean Sea’s health can help countries address
  key challenges such as high unemployment, low growth, food security, poverty and resilience to climate
  change. World Bank report “Toward a Blue Economy: A Promise for Sustainable Growth in the Caribbean”
  estimates that the Caribbean Sea generated $407 billion in 2012, representing almost 18 percent of
  Caribbean GDP, including mainland Caribbean coastal countries. The World Bank Group is accelerating
  progress in this area by supporting the implementation of the Eastern Caribbean Regional Oceanscape
  Policy (ECROP) endorsed by all 11 heads of state of the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States
  (OECS), and advising governments on concrete actions to generate sustainable blue growth.
