          The objective of this report is to update the Government of Bangladesh, think tanks
          and researchers, the general public as well as the Bank’s senior management on the
          state of the economy, outlook, risks, progress on structural policy reforms and key
          challenges the economy is currently facing. The coverage includes developments in
          the real sector focusing on growth, inflation, and poverty; external sector
          developments focusing on the balance of payments, foreign exchange reserves and
          the exchange rate; fiscal developments focusing on revenue mobilization, public
          expenditures, and deficit financing; financial sector developments focusing on credit
          and interest rates; and monetary developments focusing on reserve money and
          broad money growth trends. The update also covers assessment of public
          expenditures as a follow up to the Public Expenditure Review Update completed in
          June 2015 and includes an analysis of the transmission of international food prices
          to domestic prices.

   Executive summary: On a stable path




Progress on reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity need to be further enhanced in the near-term by sustaining
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and remittances growth, creating jobs, containing inflation, and making progress on improving
the quality of public service delivery. Private investments need to increase significantly to achieve the government’s 7 percent growth
target for FY16. Moving forward in the immediate future, stronger attention is needed to (i) achieve safety and labor rights
compliance in the garment industry, (ii) complete the critical ongoing road, electricity and gas development projects, (iii) implement
the Public Private Partnership (PPP) law, (iv) improve the efficiency and solvency of the banking sector through better banking
supervision and oversight by the Bangladesh Bank and corporate governance reforms in public banks, and (v) provide access to
serviced land to domestic and foreign investors through the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) initiative.

                               with 6 percent the previous year. Growth was driven by rise in industrial growth
                               from 8.2 percent in FY14 to 9.6 percent in FY15. On the demand side,

                          The gap between rural and urban food inflation narrowed. Prudent aggregate
                          demand management helped limit inflation volatility while declining international
                          commodity prices contributed to reducing inflation. There is evidence of
                          asymmetric inflation inertia in Bangladesh. Domestic price response to international
                          price decreases is much slower than the response to international price increases.

                          on the buying side of the foreign exchange market to prevent any significant

                          over six months of imports.

 course.                  has continued. These show that the monetary policy stance pursued by the
                          Bangladesh Bank in recent years has indeed worked in achieving its broad
                          objectives. Broad money growth in FY15 languished below the Monetary Policy
                          Statement (MPS) target primarily because of shortfall in domestic credit growth,
                          reflecting weak demand for credit both from the private sector and the central
                          government.

                          With the 7th Five Year Plan proposing to stay on a disinflationary path (reducing
                          inflation to 5.5 percent by FY20), the appropriate stance is to continue what has
                          generally worked. Bangladesh Bank has to be credited for adhering to the ongoing
                          stance with relatively minor adjustments despite pressures for switching to an
                          expansionary policy.

 remains challenged.      Average earnings are estimated to have declined by 7 percent in FY15, compared
                          with 7.5 percent growth last year. Slower credit growth over the last 4 years has also
                          brought to the fore the accumulated effects of substandard credit practices and
                          governance issues. State-owned banks’ performance was much worse than the
                          private commercial banks (PCBs), attributable to the poor quality of the board and
                          management. A number of big financial scams led to a general erosion of investors’
                          confidence in banking stocks. The credit and risk management status in the
                          banking sector remains unsatisfactory.

 Fiscal policy            Overall, the fiscal deficit in FY15 was contained at 3.6 percent of GDP despite
 plagued by revenue       underperformance in tax collections due to political disruptions and a shift in the

                        FY14 to 1.4 percent in FY15, driven by increase in non-bank borrowing which
                        exceeded the original budget target by 93 percent. Due to a shift in the composition
                        of domestic finance from low to high interest cost sources in recent years, interest
                        costs (Tk. 351 billion) are beginning to dwarf spending on many sectors critical for
                        development (health Tk. 125 billion, primary education Tk. 145 billion, fuel and
                        energy Tk. 185.4 billion). However, public debt as a share of GDP has remained on

                  should be allowed to operate and reserve buffers may be used through sterilized
                  intervention to cushion the shock and smooth exchange rate volatility.

                  Prolonged slower growth in advanced and emerging markets may have an adverse
                  impact on garment exports, thus widening the trade deficit. However, the relatively
                  low-income elasticity of demand for garment exports and Bangladesh’s significant
                  cost competitiveness would act as mitigating factors. Greater exchange rate
                  flexibility would need to be coupled with some fiscal easing, with possible budgetary
                  provisions needed to beef up existing safety net schemes for the affected poor.

                  Persistent dollar strength can further erode the cost advantage in the European
                  market in particular, which is Bangladesh’s largest export market, and global markets
                  in general. Greater downward flexibility in the US$/Taka exchange rate would need
                  to be combined with fiscal easing while resisting further nominal exchange rate
                  appreciation against the US$.

                  Further deterioration in the solvency of state-owned banks. Assuming failure to
                  recover all nonperforming loans (NPLs) and measuring capital on a conservative
                  basis, the additional recapitalization needs of state-owned banks could be between
                  2-3 percent of FY15 GDP. Undercapitalized banks should be held accountable for
                  improving their financial performance. Stricter oversight of their lending activities
                  and more aggressive recovery of bad loans is needed, backed by recapitalization
                  contingent on agreed reforms to improve longer-term viability.

                  Contingency plan to tackle macro slippage such as large current account deficit,
                  exchange rate volatility and rising inflation; urgent attention to stemming financial
                  sector insolvency; and prioritizing the completion of ongoing reform initiatives
                  ought to reign high in the policy makers’ radar screen in the near term.

   A. Recent Economic Developments, Outlook, and
   Challenges




Poverty reduction and growth have been robust to political turmoil, policy uncertainty, infrastructure deficit, and high cost of doing
business. Sustainability of growth is the major issue given the lack of appetite for reforms and lackluster progress in the
implementation of transformative public investment projects. Favorable international prices and prudent demand management
has helped reduce inflation. A sustained but declining balance of payment surplus led to further reserve accumulation to prevent
nominal appreciation. The financial sector’s exposure to risk remains disconcerting. The fiscal deficit has been contained despite
revenue shortfall and public debt is at a low risk of distress.

  Box 1: Disconnect Between Outcome and Proxy Indicators
   The rise in growth in FY15 is hard to reconcile with some key proxy indicators of growth. The proxy indicators on
   private investment are at odds with the FY15 estimated investment outcomes. The growth of credit to the private
   sector was only 13.2 percent in FY15. Total investment in export processing zones (EPZs) achieved a growth rate of
   13.1 percent (worth US$ 3.4 billion) in July-April of FY15 over the corresponding period of FY14, compared with 14.5
   percent in FY14 and 31.5 percent in FY13. Growth of payments against capital machinery import was 23 percent
   during the first nine months of FY15. However, the Center for Policy Dialogue (CPD) identified 30 import items (at
   HS 8-digit level), whose assessable value is more than Tk. 100 crore, which achieved over 100 percent growth during
   the period.2 More precisely, some of the items (airplanes and other aircraft, compression ignition, internal combustion
   piston engines, machines for treating metal including electric wire, and transformers) show very high growth in their
   value largely reflecting high growth in their prices during July-March of FY15. This is abnormal within the period of a
   year when most other items show either lower or negative growth.

   Real private investment grew by 8.7 percent in FY15, according to BBS. This is hard to back up with evidence
   showing any significant shift in investor confidence. In fact, a recent rapid business environment assessment survey,
   conducted by the CPD, found that a significant 62.5 percent of large entrepreneurs in Bangladesh generally agreed that
   money laundering was taking place through the formal banking system quite extensively. The survey also indicated a
   rather weak private investor confidence. About 60.7 percent survey respondents believed that the investment
   environment could deteriorate further in the near term. The major impediments towards private investments include:
   corruption, inadequate infrastructure, inefficient government bureaucracy, government instability and limited access to
   financing. Most of the respondents were rather pessimistic about the ongoing initiatives to improve infrastructure (67.8
   percent) and their prospects of timely completion (76.7 percent).


 Estimated FY15                Of the 6.5 percent overall provisional growth estimate for FY15, agriculture
 growth came largely           contributed 0.5 percentage points (compared to 0.7 percentage points in FY14),
 from industry                 industry’s contribution is estimated at 2.7 percentage (compared to 2.3 percentage
 underpinned by a              point in FY14 and 2.6 in FY13), and the contribution of the services sector is

rise in                  estimated at 3 percentage points, compared to 2.9 in FY14 (Table-1). Over the past
manufacturing            five years, the average increase in the GDP growth rate was 0.01 percentage point
growth.                  per year. Manufacturing is estimated to have achieved a significantly higher growth
                         of 10.3 percent in FY15 in real terms despite the severe disruption of the supply
                         chain during the political turmoil. The services sector’s estimated growth rise from
                         5.6 percent in FY14 to 5.8 percent in FY15 is also a puzzle.

                      growth of Bangladesh’s
                      competitors were significantly higher in recent years. These include Cambodia,
                      China, India, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand (Table-3). The drastic fall
                      in export performance reflected the impact of a violent and uncertain political
                      environment, uneven developments in major export destinations, falling global
                      commodity prices and the volatile exchange rate of the Euro.3 The growth rate of
                      exports in the EU did slightly less badly than the US market, but both declined
                      significantly relative to the previous year. Little progress was made in product and
                      market diversification since export performance in non-traditional markets and
                      export of non-RMG products did not show much improvements (just 0.2 percent
                      growth in FY15 compared with 3.5 percent in FY14). In both the US and EU
                      markets, several of Bangladesh’s export competitors of RMG products performed
                      considerably better than Bangladesh. RMG exports from Pakistan, Vietnam and
                      Cambodia to the EU market and from Vietnam, India, Honduras and Sri Lanka to
                      the US market increased at much faster rates. This suggests external factors cannot
                      solely account for the export growth slowdown.

 Preference erosion   Bangladeshi RMG exports are facing fierce competition in both the US and EU
 could worsen.        markets with competitors that have received or may receive preferential treatment.
                      Pakistan has emerged as a strong competitor in the EU market since it gained the
                      EU’s ‘GSP Plus’ facility. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has just been
                      concluded. It is likely to induce further preference erosion for Bangladeshi RMG
                      products in the US market vis-à-vis those from developing countries, such as
                      Vietnam, in the medium term. Bangladesh may need to focus more on the EU
                      market, which does not impose duty on Bangladeshi exports and has a more flexible
                      rules of origin requirement.

                      Bangladeshi policymakers should continue negotiations with their US counterparts
                      for restoration of GSP and more favorable market access for RMG products. Such
                      access will necessitate faster implementation of labor standard-related commitments
                      on Bangladesh’s part (Box-2). Bangladeshi exporters of RMG products need to
                      attain fully compliant status as soon as possible through the ongoing Accord and
                      Alliance initiatives. This can provide an edge in terms of competitiveness since
                      buyers are more comfortable sourcing products from countries that have formal full
                      compliance status.

                      3RMG export volume increased 58 percent, but low price offers from buyers and
                      depreciation of euro took away most of the effect of volume growth on the dollar value of

  Box 2: Progress on Garment Industry Compliance Reforms
  It’s been two years since the Rana Plaza tragedy. Although much remains to be done to ensure the rights and safety of
  workers in Bangladesh’s garment industry, progress has been made. The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in
  Bangladesh in May 2015 reported an acceleration in the pace of improvement in working conditions in garments. The
  percentage of all identified issues has increased to 31 percent from 22 percent in the previous report. More than 1000
  Corrective Action Plans have been developed. The Accord verified the first 2 fully remediated factories where all
  safety corrections from the initial inspections were completed. There remain concerns about remediation delays in
  many inspected factories. There has also been progress in the implementation of the National Tripartite Action Plan
  for Building and Fire Safety and Alliance for Bangladesh Workers Safety. Table-4 summarizes progress on assessment:

  A total of 98 factories were referred to Review Panel, out of which 32 factories were closed, 27 factories were partially
  closed and 39 have been allowed to operate.

  The ILO and other NGOs are reportedly pleased with the progress made on worker safety, but worker rights issues
  have lagged behind other improvements. At the end of 2012, there were 122 unions in Bangladesh’s garment industry
  representing less than 3 percent of workers. The Rana Plaza collapse spurred an increase in both the number of unions
  and the number of workers joining them, resulting in a more than 20 percent increase in factory-level unions in the
  garment industry. The number of unions now stand at 437, representing nearly 5 percent of workers in the industry.
  The government has made the process of starting and registering a union easier and more transparent. This has helped
  spur their adoption, although there remains a lack of trust between companies and unions.

  Part of the remedial plans that came out of talks immediately following the Rana Plaza collapse was the need to
  establish worker safety committees at the city’s factories, so that employees would have a place to voice concerns about
  workplace safety. So far, those committees have not been formed because the government has been slow to draft
  policies for their creation.

                       on the rise.5

Non-food inflation         A decomposition of non-food inflation shows that average inflation has been
increase was               consistently increasing in medical care and transport, which led to an overall
narrowly based.            increase in non-food inflation. The declining trend in food inflation in recent
                           months can be largely explained by lower prices of rice at the retail level. The
                           global prices of almost all commodities, including food and fuel, declined sharply
                           throughout FY15. Most commodity prices declined due to ample supplies and
                           weak demand in international markets.

The transmission of    Administered petroleum prices have not been adjusted at all despite more than 60
international price    percent decline in crude oil prices in the last year and a half. Even in cases of
changes to domestic    market determined domestic prices, the long run response to international price
prices is uneven.      changes is muted (see analysis in Section-V). The domestic price response to
                       international price increases and price decreases is not symmetric. There is some
                       downward inflexibility in domestic nominal price adjustments.

A cautious stance      For the first time in FY15, year-on-year inflation stayed below 7 percent since July
on demand              2014 as did the twelve-monthly-moving average since November 2014. Food
management is still    inflation suffered setback in the first quarter of 2015 as the food supply chain was
warranted.             severely disrupted due to nation-wide and regional strikes (hartals) and blockades.
                       Non-food inflation was more resilient in the face of suppressed domestic demand
                       due to consumers’ inability to go out and spend. With stability since March 2015, a
                       gradual rise in domestic demand is natural as suppressed demand translated into
                       actual. This coupled with the government’s 6.2 percent target for FY16 implies that
                       the policy brakes on the price level cannot be eased any time soon.

Poverty reduction is   Poverty headcount based on US$ 1.25 per day PPP is projected to have declined
likely to have         from 43.5 percent in 2010 to 38.4 percent in 2015. This steady reduction is mainly
continued at its       attributable to improvements in the farm income of rural households. Indeed, the
historic pace          main contributor to poverty reduction between 2005 and 2010 was labor income,
consistent with the    largely driven by increases in farm income. World Food Program’s wage data
observed stable        suggests that agricultural daily workers’ terms-of-trade in some high poverty
growth.                divisions like Barisal, Khulna, and Rajshahi improved substantially in the first
                       quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in FY14. In addition, the estimated
                       patterns in poverty reduction are reinforced by the decline in food price inflation
                       from 8.6 percent in FY14 to 6.7 percent in FY15.

Measures of            Consumption inequality was estimated at 31 percent and 30 percent (Gini) in 2005
consumption            and 2010, respectively. Growth incidence curves in 2005-2010 reveal that
inequality such as     consumption growth was pro-poor – poorer households benefited from a larger rise
the Gini index are     in per capita consumption than those at the top of the distribution. The per capita
low and very stable.   consumption of the bottom 40 percent is likely to have continued to increase
                       responding to the increase in rural wages, expansion in agricultural output, and
                       reduction in food prices. Yet, differences in agricultural wages of male and female
                       agricultural workers remain very high. During the high agricultural season in FY15,
                       the average wage for female workers in the divisions of Barisal, Khulna, and
                       Rajshahi was only 197 Taka/day compared to 295 Taka/day for male workers.

                          Exchange Rate (REER) index of the Taka shows that the currency has been
                          appreciating for the last three years, while the nominal exchange rate has mostly
                          remained stable against the US$. In the 12 months ending August 2015, the REER
                          appreciated by 14.4 percent (Figure-6 on REER) due to higher domestic inflation
                          relative to inflation in trading partner countries and appreciation of taka against the
                          currencies of the same countries (Table-5). Bangladesh Bank continued to intervene
                          on the buying side to prevent taka appreciation against US$ leading to further
                          accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. The difference between the Real
                          Effective Exchange Rate based nominal rate and the inter-bank rate has widened in
                          recent weeks, indicating that the nominal exchange rate competitiveness gap is
                          widening. BB’s interventions in the foreign exchange market have limited the loss
                          of external competitiveness by stemming any further nominal appreciation of the
                          taka against the US$.

                     3. Monetary Management and Financial Developments

Monetary                  BB succeeded in keeping the FY15 broad money and reserve money growth in line
management on             with the target rates. Broad money growth slowed to 12.4—the lowest in the
course.                   current decade--while reserve money growth slowed to 14.3 percent over its stock at
                          end-June 2014. BB had to contain growth of net domestic assets to counter the
                          overshooting of target for net foreign asset growth. Private sector credit growth
                          remained subdued at 13.2 percent (Figure-7). This contributed to undershooting the
                          monetary growth target. Policy rates were not changed despite pressures from
                          stakeholders. With ample liquidity created by BB purchase of foreign exchange,
                          sterilization operations had to be continued, which adversely affected BB

                      refinancing schemes for women entrepreneurs and so on. Expansion of mobile

                        indirect tax revenue shortfall. NBR targets were revised downward in FY15 for the
                        second time since FY09. Efforts from non-NBR and non-tax sources have also
                        lagged behind the target growth in FY15. But non-NBR revenue improved slightly
                        from 0.3 percent of GDP in FY14 to 0.4 percent in FY15 while non-tax revenue
                        declined significantly from 1.9 percent of GDP to 1.5 percent. NBR attempted to
                        boost tax collection by launching a drive focused on collection of unpaid taxes by
                        tax dodgers and through resolution of pending tax related disputes in a speedy
                        manner, with limited results.

                        in June alone (Figure-13). Besides traditional impediments, political turmoil
                        disrupted implementation progress. Given the low level of private investment and
                        significant infrastructure deficit, better quality and timely implementation of the
                        ADP remains a policy priority.

 Implementation is      The overall FY16 budget deficit target is manageable (5 percent of GDP),
 the main challenge     notwithstanding highly ambitious revenue targets. Revenue-GDP ratio is projected
 in the FY16 budget.    to increase by 1.5 percentage point. This is not beyond the realm of possibility since
                        such an increase was achieved in FY08, but it has been rather rare. The expenditure-
                        GDP ratio is projected to increase by about 3 percentage points—well above the 0.8
                        percentage point annual increase achieved on average in last five years. Increase in
                        public sector wages and transfer payments account for 47 percent of the planned
                        increase in the expenditure-GDP ratio in FY16. Increase in the size of ADP
                        accounts for the rest. The size of ADP in FY16 is envisaged to increase by 29.3
                        percent relative to the FY15 revised ADP Improving the quality of ADP
                        implementation is difficult when the number of projects remain unmanageably
                        large.. Usual problems of too many projects with too little allocation have not been
                        addressed.

 Subsidies expected     Expenditure on subsidies in FY16 are projected to decline to 157.7 billion taka
 to fall further.       (slightly over $2 billion), compared with Tk. 230 billion (about $2.9 billion) in FY15.
                        Recent upward adjustments in gas and electricity prices will certainly help this cause.

                        These increases are projected to fetch about Tk. 34 billion to the public exchequer
                        annually. The government has committed to provide budgetary transfers of subsidy

                        Net wealth exemption limit has been increased from Tk. 20 million to Tk. 22.5
                        million with wealth surcharge reduced from 30 percent to 25 percent. Corporate tax
                        for publicly traded companies has been reduced from 27.5 percent to 25 percent.
                        New revenue generation measures include advance income tax of 0.6 percent on all

                   5. Structural Reforms

                        Interest rates on all government savings certificates reduced by 1.8
                        percentage points on average. Interest rate has been decreased from on average
                        13.1 percent to 11.4 percent in May 2015. At present, the highest and lowest interest
                        rate among the national savings certificate are 11.8 and 11 percent respectively. High
                        interest rate on all government savings certificates compared to deposit rates offered
                        by the commercial banks led to an increase in sales of these certificates, resulting in
                        high government borrowing well above the budget target for FY15 and hence this
                        decrease. However, even after the reduction, interest rates on government saving
                        certificates remain well above the deposit rates of the commercial banks.

                        Bangladesh Bank increased the size of Export Development Fund (EDF)
                        and Exporter’s Retention Quota (ERQ) of foreign exchange. The size of EDF
                        was raised by 33 percent to US$ 2 billion. Exporters can take foreign currency loans

                  from this fund at interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5 percent. Businesses from various
                  sectors, including garments, can take loans worth $1 million to $15 million for a
                  maximum of 180 days. ERQ allows the exporters to retain part of their export
                  earnings in foreign exchange in order to utilize for specific business expenses
                  without prior approval of the central bank. The ERQ for export of high domestic
                  value added merchandise, merchandise with high import content, and services has
                  been increased to 60 percent, 15 percent, and 60 percent from the previous 50
                  percent, 10 percent and 50 percent respectively.

                  Bangladesh Bank (BB) withdrew its mandatory guarantee provision against
                  any foreign loan to be taken by a local firm following the approval of the
                  Board of Investment (BoI). Foreign loans to be approved by the BoI no longer
                  require approval from BB for providing the guarantees like corporate guarantee,
                  personal guarantee, and third party guarantee to the lending agency against their
                  loans.

                  In the Agriculture and Rural Credit Policy FY16, Bangladesh Bank (BB) has
                  increased the farm loan disbursement target by 5.5 percent to Tk. 164 billion.
                  All banks have to disburse 2.5 percent of their loan portfolio to the farm and rural
                  sector, and at the end of fiscal year the undisbursed amounts will have to be
                  deposited to BB’s block accounts without any interest. To meet its target, BB has
                  incorporated some new issues and strategies which include expanding the coverage
                  of farm and rural credits, taking strategic steps to spread out rural banking, bringing
                  farmers under the institutional financial services, encouraging production of export-
                  substitute crops and emphasizing development of fisheries and livestock.

                  'The Financial Reporting Act 2015' has been approved by parliament to
                  ensure more transparency and accountability in financial reporting activities.
                  A separate regulatory body "Financial Reporting Council (FRC)" will be formed to
                  regulate the country's financial reporting activities. The council will monitor the
                  function of auditors, and ensure transparency and accountability in accounting and
                  auditing of financial organizations, including various governments, autonomous and
                  non-government institutions.

                  The Cabinet has approved 'Foreign Exchange Regulation (Amendment) Act,
                  2015'. The amendment updates the existing law on regulating the purchase and
                  selling of foreign currencies and securities. This will help the authorities track any
                  local or foreign resident to come up with information about their foreign exchange
                  or securities and immoveable or other properties abroad.

                  The Cabinet has approved amendment to “The Money Laundering
                  Prevention Act 2015”. According to this amendment, Bangladesh Bank’s financial
                  intelligence unit (FIU) will autonomously deal with money laundering. The police
                  will investigate the money laundering case, the Department of Narcotics Control
                  will investigate narcotics cases, the NBR will investigate custom related cases, and
                  the Anti-Corruption Commission will investigate the bribes and corruption. Murder
                  motivated by money will be investigated by joint investigation team. The law
                  provides imprisonment between four to twelve year and Tk. 2 million fine if
                  convicted.

               NBR has re-imposed 5 percent advance income tax on coal import. NBR has
               taken this decision to beef up the effort for achieving the FY16 revenue with
               relaxation of restrictions on coal-export by India. Bangladesh will import 1.6
               million tonnes from India against 4 million tonnes of domestic demand.

               The Government has given in principle approval to the National Social
               Security Strategy (NSSS). The strategy plans to cover 35.7 million people under
               the safety nets and bring all the social safety net programs under one umbrella to
               reduce leakage. The strategy is envisaged to be implemented under five clusters
               which are: i) children's program (for those below the age of 4) covering 7.5 million
               beneficiaries; ii) program for school-age children covering 17.9 million children; iii)
               program for working-age population covering 3.2 million beneficiaries; iv)
               comprehensive pension scheme for the elderly covering 5.5 million; and v) program
               for people with disability covering 1 million disabled people. There will also be
               some special programs to combat problems like vulnerabilities to climate change,
               environmental degradation and disaster preparedness. The NSSS is envisaged to be
               implemented in three phases: initial consolidation and coordination (2014-2020);
               coordination and implementation (2021-2025); and implementation of lifecycle
               program approach (2026-onwards).

               Government has approved the new pay scale for government servants.
               According to the new pay scale, the basic salary for civil servants almost doubled.
               Among 20 grades, the lowest grade salary is increased by 101 percent to Tk. 8,250
               per month and the highest grade salary is increased by 95 percent to Tk. 78,000. The
               Cabinet Secretary and those in equivalent posts will get Tk. 86,000 and a Senior
               Secretary Tk. 82,000. Increased salary will be effective from July 2015, so
               government employees will get their outstanding salary under new pay scale. In this
               pay scale also provides for average 5 percent annual increments on basic pay and a
               20 percent (on basic pay) festival bonus for Bangla New Year. The yearly
               increments will be 5 percent for the 6th to the 20th grade, 4.5 percent for the 5th
               grade, 4 percent for the 3rd and 4th grades, and 3.75 percent for the second grade.
               Pension for government employees will be increased to 90 percent from 80 percent
               for the 1st and 2nd grades. To implement this new pay scale, government has to
               spend an additional Tk. 159.04 billion in this fiscal year and Tk. 238.28 billion for
               next fiscal year.

               The Cabinet approved the ‘Civil Service Act, 2015’ with the provision of a
               permanent pay commission and administrative reforms. According to the act,
               government authorization will be required before a charge sheet is accepted against
               any public servant. However, there will be no bar for arresting, if the charge sheet is
               accepted by the court, and the agency like Anti-Corruption Commission wants to
               investigate allegations of criminal offence and file charge sheet against any public
               servant. Moreover, 10 different issues of public servants such as appointment,
               promotion, seniority, leave, posting, deputation and lien, conduct and discipline,
               retirement benefits, resignation and retirement will be framed for making the law
               operational. In addition, there will be separate framework for career and skills
               development, welfare and preservation of quota for disabled persons and backward
               communities.

                             The Public Private Partnership (PPP) Bill 2015 has been approved by the
                             parliament. Bill’s main aim is to attract more foreign and private investment in
                             infrastructure and service-oriented sector. Apart from the Annual Development
                             Programs, the PPP Office will have authority to draw any project. Currently, 42
                             projects are in various stages of implementation under the PPP where 16 projects
                             are for transport, 8 projects for economic zone, 6 projects for health, 5 projects for
                             civil accommodation, 4 projects for tourism, 2 projects for education, and 1 project
                             is for energy. Under this act, the government will set up Public Private Partnership
                             Kartripakkha board and the Prime Minister will be the chair of the board of
                             governors while Finance Minister will be vice-chairman.

                             The government has increased power and natural gas tariffs. The average
                             electricity price was increased by 2.93 percent to Tk 6.33 per unit (1 kilowatt-hour)
                             against the previous tariff of Tk 6.15 per unit. The power tariffs for irrigation and
                             consumers use up to 50 units remain unchanged at Tk 3.33 per unit. Electricity
                             prices adjust according to consumption level (Table-7). For household gas users,
                             the tariff for a single-burner stove has been increased to Tk 600 a month from Tk
                             400, while for a double-burner stove the tariff has been raised to Tk 650 from Tk
                             450. As per the new gas tariff, the power plants and fertilizer factories, which
                             consume around 46 per cent of the country's overall natural gas production, are
                             exempted from the increase (Table 8). This is hard to understand when fertilizer can
                             be imported at currently low international prices, which would free up gas for power
                             production and other priority industrial uses.

                         6. Outlook

The near term growth and inflation outlook is contingent on global commodity and labor market conditions, given Bangladesh’s
strategic dependence on external trade and remittances. With continued political stability and sound macroeconomic balances,
Bangladesh’s economy is projected to stay on the recent growth path, driven by recovery in exports and private investment growth.
Macroeconomic management will be challenged by overheating resulting from a positive output gap.

                              economies is projected to slow from 4.6 percent in 2014 to 4.2 percent in 2015. The
                              slowdown reflects the dampening impact of lower commodity prices and tighter

                              economies is expected to pick up to 4.7 percent, largely on account of the projected

                             With persistent current account deficit, the surplus in the overall balance of
                             payments is likely to shrink leading to slower accumulation of net foreign assets.
                             This will create space for domestic credit growth without overshooting the broad
                             money growth target which is rightly limited to 15.6 percent, about 2 percent higher
                             than the 13.6 percent nominal GDP growth. Various business and trade
                             associations have been calling for discriminatory exchange rate for exports, imports
                             and remittances to offset the loss of competitiveness due to real appreciation of the

                         7. Challenges

 Unresolved political uncertainty and prolonged slower growth in advanced and emerging markets can hinder export and private
 investment recovery while creating pressure on the balance of payments. Persistent dollar strength can further erode the cost

 consolidation efforts could slip. Greater downward flexibility in the exchange rate would need to be combined with some fiscal
 easing and speedier structural reforms and public investment to sustain growth and poverty reduction.

better exploited.        Structural reforms are particularly challenging in the following areas:

                            Financial. There has been no visible reduction in nonperforming loans as
                             habitual defaulters continue their delinquent behavior with impunity. Capital
                             reserves (tier 1) to risk-weighted assets are just 8.2 percent placing banks at
                             some risk in the event of significant defaults. While the Bangladesh Bank has
                             taken some steps to improve supervision by deploying digital technology to
                             investigate big financial transactions, inaction on making the defaulters
                             accountable has not helped change the game.
                            Energy. The drop in oil prices generated substantial fiscal savings because fuel
                             prices were heavily subsidized. Bangladesh has not made sufficient use of this
                             opportunity either to build fiscal space, which would allow an effective
                             counter-cyclical response in the event of an economic slowdown, or to invest
                             in infrastructure or human capital.
                            Fiscal. The government is still committed to implement the new VAT law from
                             July 2016. However, the FY16 budget was short in providing directions on
                             reforms to improve the effectiveness of public expenditure and revenue
                             administration. Also, local government finances need to be brought onto a
                             more sustainable footing, addressing expenditure and revenue mismatches
                             across different levels of government, and reinforcing local government
                             revenue capacity including through better property taxation.
                            Administrative. Administrative reforms to streamline court proceedings to
                             facilitate contract enforcement have generally stagnated. Much of the reform
                             agenda, including a broad-based reform of state-owned enterprises, remains to
                             be implemented. Issues that need to be addressed include: implicit and explicit
                             government guarantees, non-binding budget constraints, low efficiency, and a
                             lack of transparency and accountability.

 B. Selected Issues




                          1. Bangladesh Public Expenditure Review

The World Bank recently completed a Public Expenditure Review Update analyzing the major spending trends in Bangladesh.
It includes the overall macro-fiscal stance (deficits, debt, etc.) and the allocation of resources within the budget on both a sectoral
level (health, education, etc.) and a thematic level (wages, interest, etc.). The headline findings are positive, with broadly
sustainable fiscal deficits and public debt. However, many challenges remain including: (i) boosting revenue, which is among the
world’s lowest; (ii) reviewing fiscal risks posed by contingent liabilities, notably in pensions and SOEs; (iii) assessing the efficiency
and equity of subsidies, which have seen an eightfold increase in the last decade; (iv) reducing interest costs, which have reached a
quarter of total recurrent spending; (v) improving development expenditure planning and ensuring value-for-money of investment
projects; and (vi) ensuring sufficient resources are allocated not only to building new infrastructure but also to maintaining existing
infrastructure.

                              costs of up to 2.5 percent of GDP, while total guarantees are estimated at around 4
                              percent of GDP in FY15, including to non-financial SOE. Other vulnerabilities
                              relate to international fuel prices, as fuel and fertilizer subsidies absorb a significant
                              proportion of the budget, and currency depreciation. These risks could be
                              particularly large if several occur together and the government is not able to issue

                         b. Revenue	Mobilization	

  Bangladesh’s                A spurt in revenue growth raised revenue from 9.8 percent of GDP in FY09 to 11.2

                              challenging to turn economic growth into revenue growth. As a result, tax revenues
                              (which make up over 80 percent of all revenue) remain below expected for
                              Bangladesh’s level of development. Although reliance on border revenue has fallen
                              since FY10, custom duties, supplementary duties and VAT paid on imports still
                              made up almost 30 percent of total revenue in FY14.

Bangladesh has              With corporate income tax rates of up to 45 percent, firms face potentially high tax
among the highest           rates. In addition, the Doing Business 2015 survey estimated that businesses require
corporate taxes in          302 hours per year to pay their taxes, higher than India (243 hours), Sri Lanka (167)
the region but also         or Bhutan (274) but fewer than Pakistan (594).15 Tax effort – actual revenues
the lowest “tax             compared to potential collections given the country’s characteristics – are the lowest
effort”.                    in the region, averaging 64 percent over the period 2004-12. This is not surprising in
                            a country where only around 1 percent of the total population pay regular taxes.
                            Low collections and low tax effort reflect a need to simplify taxes, reduce the use of
                            exemptions and improve the tax administration including by enhancing compliance
                            and reducing corruption.


With low revenues           While the record in fiscal discipline has been commendable, it stems partly from a
and contained fiscal        lack of capacity among some ministries to spend allocated resources. As well as
deficits, public            having among the world’s lowest revenues, Bangladesh has the world’s lowest
expenditures are            public expenditures, at around 14 percent of GDP in FY14 world (Figure-15). An
also low.                   inability to absorb resources among some ministries, particularly in the development
                            budget, contribute to the low expenditure. With significant development needs,
                            including infrastructure requirements, and a weighty poverty challenge, public sector
                            resources must be used efficiently to make progress.

  region’s most                $304 in Sri Lanka. Out-of-pocket costs are estimated at close to two thirds of the
  limited public               total. It is also ranked has having the poorest quality of infrastructure by the World
  services and poorest         Economic Forum (WEF). The Global Competitiveness Report 2014-15 ranks

                               (119th), India (87th) or Sri Lanka (75th). Its road and railway infrastructure perform
                               particularly poorly.

 Recurrent expenditure makes up majority of public expenditure and total recurrent nearly doubled during the past decade, dominated
 by interest payments.

  Around two-thirds            Between FY10 and FY14, public expenditure grew by an annual average of around

  interest costs.              percent per year in FY06-FY11. Interest costs increased from a decade low of 1.7
                               percent of GDP in FY11 to 2.1 percent in FY14 (Figure-17). This is in a context of
                               a country where revenue rarely reaches 11 percent of GDP. In FY14, 24 percent of
                               total recurrent expenditure was on interest payments, up from a decade low of 19
                               percent in FY11. Between FY06 and FY14, interest payment increased faster than

 investment.                        investment over this period as investment remained constrained by a number of
                                    factors including limited access to serviced land, power and gas shortages,
                                    inadequate transport infrastructure and the difficulty in enforcing contracts. Total
                                    public investment increased from 3.9 percent of GDP in FY09 to 5.7 percent in
                                    FY14. In real terms, this represents an average annual increase of 15 percent.

                                    investments are financed through the ADP. However, an increasing proportion of

                         2. Pass-through of International Prices to Domestic Prices




There is a perception among the general public that prices in Bangladesh move only one way: domestic prices rise in response to
rise in international prices but do not fall when international prices fall. This section analyzes the domestic price behavior of
wheat, edible oil and sugar. It finds that the domestic and international prices move together in the long run. However, the
public perception is not entirely wrong in that domestic prices adjust to rise in international prices much faster than they do to
international price declines.

                            Different studies have found long run co-integration relationship between global
                            food price and domestic food price. Selliah et al (2015)22 conducted a study
                            examining the transmission of the global price shock in domestic market in Sri
                            Lanka with the monthly data covering January 2003 to December 2013. They found
                            that the domestic prices have co-moved with international food prices, and the pass
                            through effects of international food price to domestic price was highly significant.

                            Mortaza & Habibour (2008)23 examined the import price pass-through to domestic
                            prices for Bangladesh with the monthly data covering January 2000 to March 2008
                            for rice, wheat and edible oil. They also found long run stable relationships between
                            domestic prices and international prices for rice, wheat, and edible oil. This study
                            also showed the commodities with higher share of domestic supply face a lower

                            Here we report findings from a quantitative analysis of the relationship between
                            global and domestic prices by estimating an Error Correction Model (ECM) with
                            the monthly data from June 2010 to May 2015 on sugar, edible oil and wheat. If the
                            variables are co-integrated in long run, the ECM describes the adjustment speed of
                            domestic prices in response to international price shocks.

                            required to adjust international price in domestic market?

                            monthly international price in dollars for wheat, α is the constant, β is the price
                            transmission elasticity, and µ is the residual.

                                  soybean oil increase by 0.02 percent, and wheat increase by 0.05 percent. However,
                                  the short run elasticity for soybean oil and wheat are insignificant. The statistically
                                  significant ECM result suggests that 22 percent of the divergence from the long run
                                  relationship is corrected in each month for sugar. Correspondingly 13 percent of the
                                  divergence for soybean oil, and 23 percent for wheat. In other words, to adjust
                                  international price in domestic market, it takes around 5 months for sugar, 8 months
                                  for soybean oil, and 4 months for wheat.

               international prices. When international prices increase, a long run co-integration
               relationship exists between international and domestic prices for those
               commodities. The domestic price responds significantly in the long run (Table-13).
               To adjust to increases in international increasing price in domestic market, it takes
               nearly 1.8 months for sugar, 4.5 months for soybean oil and 2.9 months for wheat
               (Table-14). When international prices decrease, the long run co-integration
               relationship also exists for sugar, soybean oil, and wheat but it is not statistically
               significant for wheat prices. In the short run, statistically significant asymmetry is
               noticed for sugar and wheat. To adjust to decrease in international price in domestic
               market, it takes 2 months for sugar, 6 months for soybean oil and 5 months for
               wheat.

               In sum, the above analysis suggests:

                  There exists a long run equilibrium relationship between international prices and
                   domestic prices in Bangladesh in case of sugar, edible oil and wheat, but it is not
                   one-to-one. The long run elasticity is significantly less than one in all three cases
                   suggesting that other factors (exchange rate, market power) mediate the pass-
                   through from international to domestic prices.

                  The above are consistent with the Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016
                   finding that the extent of market dominance in Bangladesh is relatively high and
                   the effectiveness of anti-monopoly policy is low.

                  The time taken to adjust to changes in international prices varies. Domestic sugar
                   and wheat prices take 4.3 and 4.5 months respectively while edible oil prices take
                   as long as 7.7 months.

                  The response to price increase and price decrease is not symmetric. In all cases,
                   prices take longer time to fall than to rise. There is some downward inflexibility
                   in commodity price adjustments in Bangladesh.
