1. Estimating the value of human capital within the World Bank wealth accounting framework

The proposed approach to valuing human capital is fit within the comprehensive wealth accounting
framework developed by the World Bank (2006, 2011). The approach draws connections between
wealth accounting and the development accounting literature that explores the effects of education and
health on human capital, building on previous work by Arrow and coauthors (2012), UNU-IHDP and
UNEP (2012), Farreira and Hamilton (2010), Weil (2007), and others. The approach is extended to value
the loss of human capital due to air pollution and lack of access to clean water and sanitation.

The World Bank wealth accounting framework is underpinned by the notion that total wealth is equal to
the present value of current and future consumption in a competitive economy with constant returns to
scale, as demonstrated by Hamilton and Hartwick (2005). In the long run, the ability to consume is
limited by the various productive assets that comprise the economy. Thus, wealth is equivalent to the
summed value of those assets:

                                                      ∫

where Wt is wealth in year t, K is manufactured capital, H is human capital, N represents the stock of
natural resources, C(s) is consumption in the year s, and δ is the discount rate.

As a component of wealth, the value of human capital H is determined by the size of the workforce (L),
the quantity of human capital embodied in individual workers (h), and the shadow price (or social worth)
per unit of human capital (p). The value of H is the present value of the returns to human capital:

                                             ∫

where h is human capital per worker. Although there are a multitude of factors that influence human
capital, here the measure of h is limited solely to education and health. The relationship between
human capital and schooling is described by a simple Mincerian formulation:



where h is proportional to total years of schooling (n) attained and the rate of return to education (φ)
(Mincer 1974; Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare 2005; Arrow and others 2012). While the complete
Mincerian formulation would also include years of experience, Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare (1997) find
that introducing experience into the equation has only a small effect on aggregate levels and growth
rates in human capital and reduces the explanatory power of human capital in explaining differences in
worker productivity across countries, a finding confirmed by Caselli (2005). The stock of human capital is
adjusted to account for the health condition of the population (A), with the intuition that workers’
health influences their “energy and capacity for effort” (Caselli 2005: 708; Ferreira and Hamilton 2010):
As in Weil (2007), the health status of the population is proxied by the adult survival rate (v):



where ρ is the proportional effect of the survival rate on human capital.

Assuming that the labor market is competitive, the shadow price of human capital is equivalent to the
wage rate per unit of h, or what might be called the “rental’” price of human capital. Rents are the wage
premium paid to a worker with h units of human capital above the price of “raw labor” with zero units
of human capital (Weil 2009: 170; Pritchett 2001):




where w is the wage paid per unit of h, obtained by dividing the average wage per worker in the active
labor force above age 15 by the average stock of human capital per worker. The value of the human
capital stock is the present value of rents, or the present value of the wage premium attributable to the
human capital embodied in the labor force:


                                              ∑




2. Data and methods

Scope of the estimates: The stock of human capital in a country is composed of capital embodied in
youth (below age 15), working-age adults (15-64), and the elderly (age 65 and above): Htotal = Hyouth +
Hworking + Helderly. The scope of the estimates for valuing human capital is restricted to Hworking. However,
as a conservative approximation, Htotal is expressed in per capita terms as Hworking / (Pyouth + Pworking + Ptotal),
where P is the population of each sub-group (Hamilton and Liu 2013). Note that Hworking includes the
stock of human capital in all working-age adults, not just those that are currently employed (Arrow et al
2012; UNU-IHDP and UNEP 2012). In performing the calculation, H is valued for each five-year age
group between the ages of 15 and 64 and then summed.

The workforce: The total workforce L includes both active and non-active workers, assumed to be the
entire population, aged 15-64, at the beginning of the year. As defined by the ILO, the economically
active population (or active labor force) includes persons who “furnish the supply of labour for the
production of goods and services…. [P]roduction includes all individual or collective goods or services
that are supplied to units other than their producers, or intended to be so supplied, including the
production of goods or services used up in the process of producing such goods or services; the
production of all goods that are retained by their producers for their own final use; the production of
housing services by owner-occupiers and of domestic and personal services produced by employing paid
domestic staff.”1 The size of the active labor force is modeled by the ILO. Data may be obtained from
the WDI database.

Schooling: Data on average years of schooling per working-aged person are obtained from Barro and
Lee (2013) for 144 countries from 1970 to 2010 by five-year age group.2 Because the data on schooling
are estimated in five-year increments, values for in-between years are interpolated linearly. In
calculating price r per unit of human capital h (see “Wages” below), an adjustment was made to account
for the differences in schooling in the active labor force and the general adult population. This
adjustment was derived from ILO data on the average highest level of educational attainment in the
labor force; unemployment by highest level of educational attainment; Barro and Lee (2013) data on the
portion of the overall population by highest level of educational attainment, rates of completion or
incompletion, and years of schooling by level; and UNESCO data on the duration of primary, secondary,
and tertiary schooling in different countries’ educational systems.3 Adjustment ratios were computed
for 94 countries. For all other countries for which data were not available, the ratio in years of schooling
was assumed to be 1.

Wages: Average wages are derived from the Penn World Table 8.0 estimates of labor income as a share
of GDP (Feenstra et al 2013). The Penn World Table estimates include adjustments to reflect the income
of workers who are self-employed to the best extent possible given the limitations of country-reported
data (Inklaar and Timmer 2013). Total labor income is thus labor income as a share of GDP multiplied by
GDP. The average wage per worker is calculated as total labor income divided by the number of
currently active workers in the labor force over the age of 15. The average price per unit of human
capital h is the average wage divided by the average level of human capital of currently active workers in
the labor force over the age of 15. The price per h, or r, is assumed to be the same for all adults
regardless of current employment status (Arrow et al 2012), with the intuition that r is the wage that
unemployed individuals could receive in the labor market given their education and health. All prices
are expressed in constant year 2010 USD using market exchange rates.

Returns to education: Previous valuations of human capital by Arrow and coauthors (2012), UNU-IHDP
and UNEP (2012), and Ferreira and Hamilton (2010) have used a uniform rate of 8.5 percent. A review of
the empirical literature by Psacharopoulis and Patrinos (2004) found that, across all countries, the
average rate of return to education is around 9.7 percent. Here, the returns to education are
formulated in three different ways, and the results are compared. First, a uniform rate of 8.5 percent is
applied. Second, to account for the concavity in marginal returns for higher levels of education that is
observed in differences across countries, the rate of return is allowed to vary with schooling. Following
Hall and Jones (1999), a piece-wise linear function is specified with a slope (φ) of .131 for s ≤ 4, .101 for

  The Barro and Lee (2013) data are available in the World Bank’s “Educational Statistics” database, accessible at
http://databank.worldbank.org. As an alternative, because the Barro and Lee (2013) data are only updated once
every ten years or so, it would also be possible to use the in the World Bank education statistics database, which
include projections from 1990-2020.

4 > s ≤ 8, and .068 for s>8 (see, also, Caselli 2005). Third, the rate of return is allowed to vary by income
level, such that φ = .109 for low income countries, φ = .107 for middle income countries, and φ = .074
for high income countries (Psacharopoulis and Patrinos 2004).

Returns to health: For returns to health ρ, a benchmark value of 0.65 is taken (Weil 2007; Ferreira and
Hamilton 2010), meaning that an increase of 10 percentage points in the survival rate is associated with
a 6.5 percent increase in human capital.

Survival rate: An indicator of the health of the workforce, the adult survival rate is formulated as 1 -
adult mortality rate (AMR), where AMR is the probability that the average 15-year-old will die before the
age of 60. In the WDI, data for the AMR for 1970-2010 are available each year for more than 170
countries. Gaps in the data are interpolated linearly, although year-to-year coverage is relatively good.

Time period: The time horizon T for the present value calculation is the expected number of years that
the average working-age person will remain in the labor force. As is the case with other assets (World
Bank 2006, 2011), the time horizon is capped at 25 years, which is the length of a single generation.
Twenty-five years is also close to the average number of remaining years that adults will work between
the ages of 15 and 64 in the labor force of OECD countries (Liu 2011; Hamilton and Liu 2013). The time
horizon may be less than 25 years if the average age of the age group is above 39 or life expectancy is
less than 25 years.4

Social discount rate: In valuing human capital, the effective discount rate δ is the ratio of (1+ annual real
income growth rate) to (1 + annual real discount rate). Liu (2011) uses a rate of 4.58 percent for all
OECD countries. In the World Bank wealth accounts, a uniform rate of 4 percent is applied in valuing all
types of natural resources (World Bank 2006, 2011). Thus, δ is set at 4 percent.

Volatility: To correct for the problem of volatility in rental prices per unit h, annual rents from human
capital are taken as a five-year lagged average before the net present value of future rents is capitalized
over the 25-year time horizon. This smoothing technique is similar to the method used to compute the
net present value of all natural assets in the World Bank wealth accounts.

3. Results

Estimates of human capital in OECD countries in 2005 compared to previous estimates by Hamilton and
Liu (2013) are shown in Table 1. On the whole, the estimated levels of H per capita are close to the
numbers of Hamilton and Liu (2013), although the results are highly sensitive to the chosen rate of
return to education. Method 1, applying a uniform rate of 8.5 percent, yields estimates for OECD
countries within 15 percent of those calculated by Hamilton and Liu (2013) on average. Method 2,
allowing the rate or return to vary by years of schooling, underestimates human capital by 31 percent on
average compared to Hamilton and Liu (2013). Because they more closely approximate previous
estimates, the results using Method 1 are used for the following discussion.

  In reality, life expectancy was above 25 for virtually all of the five-year age groups below the age of 39, so to
simplify the equation, it may be omitted.

Notes: CWoN – The Changing Wealth of Nations (World Bank 2011); [1] – assuming uniform rate of return to education of 8.5%; [2] – allowing rate of return to
education to vary by total years of school; [3] – allowing rate of return to education to vary by income level; all dollar amounts are expressed in constant 2005
USD at market exchange rates to be consistent with Hamilton and Liu (2013).
Estimates of H for 17 of the LAC countries for 1995-2010 are shown in Table 2. For the most part, H per
capita has been on the rise. The exceptions are Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela, which experienced
periods of decline that correspond with decreases in real wages. Table 3 summarizes human capital per
capita by income and regional group in LAC compared to world averages. H per capita in middle income
LAC countries is higher than it is in middle income countries outside the region. Table 4 illustrates the
share of human capital in total wealth for LAC countries from 1995-2010, and Table 5 show how human
capital compares to the other components of wealth. The tables confirm the finding that human capital
is typically the single biggest component of wealth (World Bank 2011). At the same time, it is also
evident that the bottom-up estimation of wealth for some resource-rich countries may result in
exaggerated estimates of total wealth, as is seen with Bolivia, Chile, and Venezuela.5

 This is true for some resource-rich countries even without the inclusion of human capital or the intangible
residual. For example, estimates of natural capital exceed 100 percent of total wealth in Suriname and Guyana.

Comparing year-to-year changes in estimated H per capita with annual spending on education reveals
several points. First, average changes in H per capita are in some cases an order of magnitude larger
than spending, suggesting that a cost-based approach leads to underestimation of actual changes in HC.
Second, the cost-based approach does not allow for negative changes in HC. These declines in H may be
due to a stagnating wages, a shrinking workforce, or a drop in life expectancy. Finally, the volatility in
the H per capita numbers is apparent. For example, Mexico’s H per capita declined by USD 1,328 in
1995 but increased by USD 3,018 in 2000. This volatility is due primarily to year-on-year increases or
decreases in wages per unit h. A relatively small shift in the wage rate may result in large differences in
H because of how wages are multiplied in the NPV equation. This is also true for other assets, such as
fossil fuels, metals, and minerals.

4. Air pollution and lack of clean water and sanitation

In this section, the proposed approach to valuing H is extended to estimate the loss of H due to
mortality and morbidity from ambient air pollution (PM and ozone), household air pollution from solid
fuel use, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation. Losses of H are approximated as the present
value of foregone rents from H in the labor market. Each year of disability-free life lost is equivalent to
the annual rental price paid for educated workers, given the general health status of the population.
Annual losses in human capital are given by:
where D are disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to illnesses associated with pollution or lack of
clean water and sanitation, defined as years of life lost (YLLs) plus years lived with disability (YLDs); w is
the wage rate per unit of human capital; and h is the stock of human capital possessed by the workers
who suffer from illness. To be consistent with the method for estimating total value of human capital,
losses are restricted to the 15-64 population and DALYs are constructed by only counting for YLLs during
working age and adding YLDs. Because the results are only a partial measure of HC and are limited to
losses within working age, they should not be interpreted as an estimate of the loss of social welfare
from pollution or lack of access to clean water and sanitation, which would be much greater.
Furthermore, this method does not account for the effect of pollution and lack of improved water and
sanitation in reducing the amount of human capital possessed by the average working-age person. In
reality, part of the loss in human capital is already captured in the measure of the adult survival rate, the
indicator of the general health status of the population. Subtracting human capital losses from the
overall change in human capital to get net change in human capital would lead to double-counting.

Data on mortality and morbidity by risk factor and life expectancy are obtained from the Global Burden
of Disease 2010 study. The data are available by five-year age group for 1990, 2005, and 2010;
estimates of H losses were done for 2005 and 2010. Given different levels of education possessed by
people of different ages within the population, losses are calculated for each five-year cohort and then
summed. The summed loss of H is then compared to the overall change in H among the 15-64
population. Because the GBD provides low-end, mean, and upper-end estimates of morbidity and
mortality, summed losses are presented for this entire range.

The results for LAC show that losses in human capital among the working age population due to air
pollution and lack of improved sanitation and water are negligible compared to the overall change in
human capital or national income—typically less than 1 percent.
