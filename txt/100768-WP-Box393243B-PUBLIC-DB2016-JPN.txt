THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

                                                             STANDARDIZED COMPANY
Japan is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new               Legal form: Godo Kaisha
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and           Paid-in minimum capital requirement: JPY 1
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available         City: Tokyo, Osaka
information on business entry in that economy.
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,          Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       the name reservation at the Legal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of
       Justice. However, they need to check if the proposed company name     Less than one day

        Obtain consent of neighborhood

        Obtaining neighborhood consent can be carried out
        simultaneously with the previous procedure. The initial step is to
        post a sign with specific information about the planned
        construction on the plot. Thereafter, BuildCo must obtain the             30 days             no charge

        endorsement of all neighbors (companies) stating that they do
        not object to the construction of the warehouse.

        Agency: Local Authority



        * Hold initial consultation with local authority

        BuildCo must have clearance at the initial consultation phase
        with at least 14 different departments at the prefecture level.
        Due to stricter requirements of compliance with construction
        regulations, the process now takes around 24 days. The purpose
        of this consultation is to avoid the risk of resubmitting the
        application for the actual building permit which if submitted
   2    wrongly, or some parts require alteration, the process can take           24 days             no charge
        another 2 -- 3 months. Closer scrutiny is paid to the structural
        component of the drawings and plans. The rules require an
        engineer to resubmit an entire construction plan, even to change
        a peg or location of windows.

        must submit a building permit application. The local authority
        examines the application and issues the building permit.

      Normally, architects submit the application on behalf of their
      clients. The Fire Office is also involved in the permit examination
      process. The application must be amended when any changes
      are made after the building permit is obtained. In addition, a
      change permit must be obtained prior to final inspection by local
      authorities.

      After the falsification of structural calculation of buildings by
      former Architect Aneha became public knowledge in November
      2005, many Japanese local authorities and private inspection
      companies have had to spend extra time checking structural
      design documents in new applications. This situation is still very
      much true in many parts of Japan. There is also a spill-over effect
      on site inspections by privatized control institutions, and it is
      likely that the Japanese government will introduce more frequent
      and thorough inspection procedures in building construction in
      the near future. Building permit review and approval procedures
      became very stringent since the new Building regulation as of
      June 20, 2007. As of June 2007 any project exceeding 1,000 sq.
      m. will require a peer review process by an independent
      authorized structural engineer/agency. The engineers are
      generally hired by the Building Department to undertake this
      review. However, the amount of work and backlog on one hand
      and the number of available professionals on the other hand
      willing to work extra hours on the weekends has caused delays.
      The peer review may take about 30 days in addition to the 50
      days of building permit review period. In simpler cases the
      process may take on average 70 days.

      * Request and obtain workmen’s compensation insurance
      proof from Labor Control Office

      The Labor Control Office verifies worker compensation insurance
      for all companies annually. No cost is incurred for obtaining
      confirmation. Once a contractor obtains confirmation and
      insurance, it is valid for one year for any project of the
      contractor’s company. Application for worker compensation
      insurance is made with the local labor control office. The
      applicant must comply with the registration criteria. A worker        60 days       no charge
4
      compensation insurance fee must be paid within 50 days after
      the application is filed. Worker compensation insurance is valid
      for a year, and it must be extended every year between April 1
      and May 20. The insurance cost is 2.05% of the company's total
      personnel costs (1.25% paid by employer, 0.8% paid by
      employee).

        BuildCo requests the inspection. After the completion of the
        inspection, the certificate is issued within 3 business days. If there
        are any outstanding issues pointed out by inspectors, remedial
        work must be completed and the building re-inspected before
        the completion certificate is issued.

  10    The completion certificate is required to start occupying and             7 days        JPY 220,000
        using the building. This certificate is distinct from the land and
        building registration with the local authorities, and can be issued
        by the local authorities or by any of the authorized institutions at
        a very similar cost.

        Register the building with the Land and Building Registry

        The building registration involves two steps. First, the description
        of the building should be registered (usually through a notary
        public). This part cannot be done by BuildCo or its lawyer. No
        formal registration cost is required.

        Second, proof of building ownership should be registered. It
  12    takes about 10 to 14 days for the registration to be completed.          12 days        JPY 399,244
        The cost of proof of building ownership registration varies
        depending on the value of the building (0.2% of the building’s
        taxable value).

          Request and receive final inspection from Japan Building Center

          BuildCo requests the inspection. After the completion of the inspection,
          the certificate is issued within 3 business days. If there are any
          outstanding issues pointed out by inspectors, remedial work must be
          completed and the building re-inspected before the completion
          certificate is issued.

          registration with the local authorities, and can be issued by the local
          authorities or by any of the authorized institutions at a very similar cost.

          Register the building with the Land and Building Registry

          The building registration involves two steps. First, the description of the
          building should be registered (usually through a notary public). This
          part cannot be done by BuildCo or its lawyer. No formal registration
          cost is required.

          Second, proof of building ownership should be registered. It takes             12 days      JPY 399,244
    12
          about 10 to 14 days for the registration to be completed. The cost of
          proof of building ownership registration varies depending on the value
          of the building (0.2% of the building’s taxable value).

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

The threshold is defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis up
to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total tax rate below this threshold receive the same
score as the economy at the threshold.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business
taxpayer service centers or allowing for more deductions          recorded in Japan (table 8.1)?

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                            The most likely procedure applicable to our case study would be a
                                            reorganization (civil rehabilitation). Mirage may use the rehabilitation
                                            proceeding to gain time, find a new investor, or renegotiate its debt.
                                            The rehabilitation proceeding starts with Mirage (debtor) filing for
                 Tokyo,                     court-supervised rehabilitation with the Tokyo District Court. Mirage’s

                                            by creditors. BizBank will likely support the rehabilitation proceedings
                                            as according to the case assumption the continuation of Mirage’s
                                            operations as a going concern would fetch 100% of Mirage's market

                                             A reorganization (civil rehabilitation) procedure will approximately take

                                             The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
