THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the r anking on the
relevant indicator.

        Submit plans to Ministry of Public Works

        The application file should include 2 copies of the site plan; letter of
        request addressed to the Deputy Minister; the land deed; and the
        architectural, structural, and mechanical drawings. These documents are
        passed from one official to another for approval at the Ministry of
        Public Works (MPW) before the building permit is issued. Physically all
        departments are located in different parts of the city which may delay
        the approval.

        The documents are submitted internally at the MPW in the following
        order:
        • Office of the Deputy Minister, Technical Services
        • Office of the Assistant Minister, Technical Services (initial recipient)
        • Land-Use Planning and Zoning Division (initial site plan and
        document review). There are no thorough checks with the National
        Archives on the authenticity of the land documents, ensuring that is the
   1    responsibility of the owner of the warehouse.                                 1 day           no charge

        • Chief of Architecture (design approval)
        • Chief of Electromechanical Engineering (electrical and mechanical
        approval)
        • Chief of Engineering (structural approval and billing)
        • Finance Section (payments)
        • Land-Use Planning and Programming (signature on permit)
        • Office of the Deputy Minister, Technical Services (permit attached)

        A temporary building permit can be granted after the second step
        above, when the Land-Use Planning and Zoning Division conducts an
        initial site plan and document review. This temporary permit can be
        obtained within one week. It is granted for a maximum of 90 days, but
        this is an exception rather than the rule. In practice, a permit is
        accorded after all steps mentioned above have been completed. As a
        result of the weak enforcement of building regulations, partly a result
        of the post-conflict situation, many private construction projects take

      BuildCo must return to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) with the
      payment receipt and the application is then processed for final
      approval. The process at the MPW from submission of plans (procedure
      1) to approval used to take 3 months, but reforms introduced in 2008
      reduced the processing time for simple building permits to 1 month.
      The MPW established a 30-day statutory time limit for the issuance of
      building permits. The MPW also introduced a checklist to clearly define
      all of the documents required to complete the application. Now all
4     applications are scrutinized on submission to check for completeness          28 days       no charge
      and accuracy before being forwarded for processing. The reform
      eliminated the Minister’s signature on building permits for simple
      construction projects. By rule, the Minister's consent is only required for
      projects with a value greater than USD 1 million or that involve a
      foreign government. However, in practice the Minister or Deputy
      Minister still approves projects that are less than USD 1 million in value.

      Obtain construction clearance from the City Corporation of
      Monrovia

      After obtaining the design approval from the MPW, BuildCo must
5     obtain a separate construction clearance from the Planning Department          2 days       USD 560
      at the City Corporation of Monrovia. The Planning Department takes 1
      day to review the plans and then prepares a payment slip which is
      usually paid the next day.

      City Corporation of Monrovia as of May 1, 2009 abolished 3% fee
      charge, based on project value, for issuing a building permit and
      replaced it with a fixed fee of USD 0.04 per sq. ft. for new commercial
      and industrial construction projects.

      However, practitioners note that this fee is "negotiable". Applicants can
      pay a less amount, which is official, for a clearance that will last for a
      shorter period of time. There are no fee schedules posted at the City
      Corporation and often, builders are asked to pay much higher fees.

      The construction of the warehouse can commence after the building
      permit is obtained. There is no requirement to request inspections at
      any stage of the construction process. However, building inspectors
      and engineers are often dispatched from the Ministry of Public Works
      to inspect construction sites to see to what extent the construction
6     conforms with the originally submitted drawings. Over the course of 6 -       1 day        no charge
      - 7 months, inspections occur randomly at a rate of every 3 weeks or as
      often as every week. Construction work stops only if the plans have not
      been complied with.

        Water connections can be made if existing pipelines pass through the

        take 1 -- 2 weeks. The cost for water connection includes LRD 250.00
        for the connection itself and USD 50.00 for the meter. If a water
        pipeline does not pass through the area, then BuildCo must buy all the      14 days        USD 54

        Only Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) can carry out the external

        When the external works have been completed, and the electrician has
        finished doing the internal installation, the utility will inspect the wiring
        and turn on the supply.
        The client will need to pay a security deposit and a registration fee. The
        cost of the meter is included in the registration fee.

        Security deposit: Based on the requirement for the case study, it is
        estimated that the load will be 202 amps and that a 70 mm2 wire will be
        used. The deposit fee will correspond to 16% of the cost of 202 amps,
        approximately the monthly load. This deposit goes into an escrow
        account as a guarantee. If bills are not paid, then the amounts are     376 calendar days    LRD 5,156.28

        then he/she is reimbursed. And there are no interests on the escrow
        account.

        Registration fee: There is also a registration fee equivalent to 20% of the
        Bill of Quantity. When the type of material and the quantity needed has
        been determined, and also what needs to be done, and the labor cost,
        the customer will be required to pay a registration fee equivalent to 20%
        of the Bill of Quantity.

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
