Governments, donors and development partners are increasingly in need of high quality analytics to
proactively manage the financial costs of disasters. Objective analytics empowers stakeholders to
take risk-informed financial protection decisions based on sound financial and economic analysis.

Economic and statistical methodologies
for Disaster Risk Finance
Proven methodologies and standardized approaches are essential
to conduct DRF analytics work. The DRF analytics function
develops the economic and statistical methodologies needed
for DRF analytics. For example, we have developed a framework
for evaluating sovereign DRF strategies under the DRFIP Impact
Appraisal Project.

Case Study: Livestock Insurance in Kenya
DRF analytics supported a livestock insurance program in Kenya which
provides insurance cover to 14,000 farmers in Kenya. In February 2017
GBP1.7 million was paid to 12,000 pastoralists – an average of nearly
GBP140 per household – to compensate for the last seasons drought. The
DRF analytics function supported the development of quantitative tools to
assist in capacity building by providing key insights into the key drivers of
the Kenya Livestock Insurance Program design.
