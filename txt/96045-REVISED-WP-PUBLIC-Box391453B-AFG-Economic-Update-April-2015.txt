                                         Executive Summary

The political and security transition continues to take a heavy toll on Afghanistan’s economy. Economic
growth is estimated to have fallen further to 2 percent in 2014 from 3.7 percent in 2013 and an average of
9 percent during 2003-12. Political uncertainty combined with weak reform progress dealt a further blow
in 2014 to investor and consumer confidence, already in a slump from uncertainty building since 2013. As
a result, growth in the non-agricultural sectors (manufacturing, construction, and services) is estimated to
have fallen further in 2014. The agricultural harvest in 2014 was strong for the third year in a row, but was
up only marginally from the bumper year of 2012. Agriculture benefited from robust cereals production
thanks both to well distributed, timely rainfall and an increase in irrigated area for wheat cultivation. The
growth outlook for 2015 remains weak. Continued uncertainty and the difficult environment for reforms
mean that investor and consumer confidence show no signs of picking up, while unfavorable weather
conditions point toward a slight contraction in agriculture. Growth is projected at 2.5 percent in 2015.

Afghanistan has been in the midst of a fiscal crisis, with declining revenues leading to financing difficulties
in 2014. Domestic revenues fell from a peak of 11.6 percent of GDP in 2011 to 8.4 percent in 2014, because
of the economic slowdown and weaknesses in tax and customs enforcement. The decline in revenue
collection took place across all sources, including tax revenues, customs duties, and non-tax revenues. As
a result, in spite of measures to restrain expenditures, the authorities faced a financing shortfall in excess of
$500 million in 2014. This was proactively managed under difficult circumstances by drawing down cash
reserves, accumulating arrears, and exceptional donor assistance. The authorities curtailed civilian
operations and maintenance (O&M) and discretionary development expenditures, although overall
expenditures increased in 2014 because of higher security and mandated social benefit spending.

Restoring fiscal stability will require accelerating revenue enhancing reforms, additional discretionary
assistance, and prioritizing expenditures. The government began 2015 with a weak cash reserve position
and significant arrears, while reforms to improve revenues continued to stall through the first three months
of 2015. Afghanistan thus faces a financing gap in 2015 that is potentially as large as last year, against the
backdrop of a weaker cash position. The authorities reached agreement in March on a nine-month IMF
Staff Monitored Program (SMP) to address macroeconomic vulnerabilities by mobilizing revenue and
strengthening the financial sector. The macroeconomic framework also envisions rebuilding cash reserves
by year end. Successful implementation of the agreed reform agenda will be key to reining in
macroeconomic risks which remain high.

Afghanistan faces the dual challenge of restoring confidence in its economic prospects and addressing
formidable medium term development challenges. The new government articulated its development vision
and a bold reform program through its paper “Realizing Self Reliance: Commitments to Reforms and
Renewed Partnership” presented at the London Conference on Afghanistan in December 2014. The paper
presents the government’s plans for tackling corruption and building better governance, restoring fiscal
sustainability, bolstering private sector confidence, promoting growth, and improving security and political
stability. Successful implementation of this bold reform program under difficult circumstances is the major
challenge facing Afghanistan.

                                    1. Recent Economic Developments
The sharp slowdown in economic growth has continued in parallel with the protracted political
uncertainty and weak reform progress

Economic growth fell to an estimated 2 percent in 2014 as the protracted political transition and weak
reform progress dealt a further blow to confidence in the non-agriculture sectors. Economic growth
is estimated to have fallen to 2 percent in 2014 from 3.7 percent in 2013 and an average of 9 percent during
2003-121. Protracted political uncertainty and weak reform progress dealt a further blow to investor and
consumer confidence, which were already in a slump from uncertainty building since 2013 due to the
political and security transition. Anecdotal evidence and proxy data indicate that private investment
dropped further in 2014. The economy also faces headwinds from the drawdown in aid. As a result, growth
in the non-agricultural sectors (manufacturing, construction, and services) is estimated to have fallen further
in 2014. Furthermore, agricultural production was robust, but up only marginally from the bumper year of
2012. This helped buoy economic activity, particularly in light of the strong links between agriculture and
the rest of the economy, but was not strong enough to outweigh the confidence slump. Finally, restrained
spending on operations and maintenance (O&M) and discretionary development projects due to the fiscal
crisis would tend to put a damper on growth, although higher nondiscretionary development spending
helped support economic activity.

The agriculture harvest in 2014 was strong for the third year in a row, but was up only marginally
from the 2012 bumper year. Agriculture growth (estimated at 1.9 percent in 2014, compared to -0.2
percent in 2013 and 18.2 percent in 2012) benefited in large part from robust cereals production thanks both
to well distributed, timely rainfall and an increase in irrigated area for wheat production. Cereals production
grew 3.6 percent in 2014 reaching 6.7 million metric tons. Production of wheat, Afghanistan’s most

  Estimated growth for 2014 is based on a preliminary projection since national accounts figures for 2014 have not yet
been released. Estimated growth of 3.7 percent for 2013 is for the calendar year, for the non-opium economy, and
also incorporates a number of adjustments based on supplementary indicators of economic activity. It is thus different
from the growth rate reported by the Central Statistics Organization (CSO) for the 1392 solar year.

important staple crop, increased by nearly 4 percent. Nonetheless, despite the strong harvest, Afghanistan
has not yet reached self-sufficiency in cereals, with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Livelihoods
(MAIL) estimating that 0.24 million tons of imported cereals were required to meet the domestic demand.
MAIL also reported increases in the production of fruits, horticulture and livestock in 2014, although other
agricultural products declined.

 New investment activity dropped sharply again in 2014 across all sectors. The number of new firm
registrations dropped 26 percent to a total of 2,470 companies in 2014 (see Figure 4). This is on top of the
36 percent drop in 2013 after several years of rising numbers of new firm registrations during 2008-11.
The further decline in new firm registrations occurred across all sectors including construction,
manufacturing, and services, and also across both domestic and foreign investments. In the absence of
higher frequency national accounts data, new firm registrations can serve as a proxy for business confidence
and new investment activity in the private sector. While not a perfect indicator, it can help track investment
decisions that are sensitive to market conditions and political developments as potential investors delay
investments in the face of higher risks.                Figure 5: Opium production and area under poppy

insecure in the country. On the other hand, the farm-gate price of opium dropped by 20 percent in 2014.
As such, the total farm-gate value of opium production declined from US$950 million in 2013 to $850
million in 2014. This is about 4 percent of GDP, although the total export value of opiates is likely twice
as large. A number of factors could have contributed to the recent increase in poppy production, including
(i) the introduction of new production technologies (e.g. irrigation); (ii) fewer livelihood opportunities or
the expectation thereof; and (iii) the rollback of international forces and associated counternarcotic efforts
from the provinces. Although opium’s importance in GDP has been declining over time, it is likely an
important source of livelihood for a segment of the rural population.

Security continues to pose a significant risk for private investment and public service delivery, with
the number of conflict related civilian deaths rising in 2014. Although elections in 2014 were held
without major security incidents, according to
figures reported by the United Nations Assistance Figure 6: Number of civilian deaths, conflict related
Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the number of            4,000
conflict-related civilian deaths increased by nearly
25 percent in 2014, reaching unprecedented levels.       3,000

   Consumer price inflation dropped in 2014, as both food and non-food inflation softened. Period
   average inflation was recorded at 4.6 percent in 2014 compared to 7.4 percent in 2013. Both food and non-

   Both domestic factors and global price trends have driven the decline in CPI inflation. Food prices in
   Afghanistan are driven by a mix of domestic agriculture sector performance and global food prices, with
   imports still playing a significant role in meeting domestic demand of main food staples (including wheat,
   wheat flour, rice, and vegetable oil). Given strong domestic agriculture performance in 2014, as well as
   softening global food prices, particularly of grains, food price inflation closed the year at 2.9 percent in
   December 2014 compared to 9.8 percent in December 2013. On the other hand, non-food price inflation
   declined from 4.8 percent in December 2013 to -0.3 percent in December 2014. The drop in non-food
   prices was driven in large part by falling housing prices. Rental prices dropped nearly 10 percent in
   December 2014 compared to 12 months earlier. Furthermore, prices of communication services have also
   been declining since 2013. As a result of the expansion in internet services, access to fiber-optic network,
   and increased competition in the market, the price for 1 megabyte of internet usage has dropped from $300
   in 2012 to $35 in 2014.

   The pass through from falling global oil prices to lower transport prices in Afghanistan has been
   evident since January 2015. Global oil prices started to decline since September 2014 from above $100
   per barrel to around $60 by the end of the year. The effects of declining global oil prices on domestic prices
   in Afghanistan passed through with some time lag, starting in January 2015. Transport price inflation
   (which includes oil prices) dropped from 19.5 percent in September 2014 to 2.5 percent in January 2015

and further to -8.1 percent in February 2015. Although the weight of transport in Afghanistan’s overall
consumer basket is relatively small (4.7 percent), lower transportation costs also indirectly affect the prices
of most other consumer goods, particularly those that are imported to this landlocked destination. Box 1
provides a more detailed discussion of the impact of lower global oil prices on the real sector and fiscal
outlook for Afghanistan.


Box 1: The impact of declining oil prices on the Afghan economy
        Oil prices started to decline in mid-2014 from over $100 a barrel to around $60 by the end of the
year – the lowest since 2009. It is expected to remain at $70 or less in 2015 and to linger well below $100
over the next five years. Reports show that supply surplus, together with lower demand in the global
economy, have led to the collapse in oil prices. While this represents an adverse shock to oil exporters, it
may entail favorable results for a number of oil-importing countries.
Impact on the real economy…
         Afghanistan is an oil-importing economy. Its import bill for oil and gas amounts to around US$1.5
billion annually, almost a quarter of total imports. The overall impact of declining oil prices on the real
economy in Afghanistan is likely to be positive – at least in the short-term.
        Given that Afghanistan is landlocked and mountainous, transportation costs are significant. Lower
energy prices and thus lower transportation costs not only favor in-country movement of goods but also
reduce the import bill for other items too. This not only benefits the poor – through lower food prices – but
also reduces costs for local producers who mostly import their intermediate and primary goods by land
from Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia. The moderation in domestic prices improves welfare for the poor and
increases the purchasing power of consumers which – in its turn – increases private consumption and
domestic demand.

        On the other hand, with Afghanistan a potential natural resource exporter, a sharp and prolonged
decline in oil and commodity prices could negatively impact the incentives for investment in extractives.


                                                                                                                                                                        10 | P a g e
While the short-term impact of declining oil prices is favorable, the impact over the medium term could
thus be negative, particularly with the fall in oil prices coinciding with declining global commodity prices.
In particular, subdued energy prices over the long-term could discourage investments in oil extraction. Two
oil basins, namely the Amu Darya and the Afghan-Tajik, -- both multi-billion-dollar foreign investments –
have already been tendered. The Amu Darya project started operations in 2012, but suspended oil
production in 2013 due to security concerns. Currently, three oil basins (Tripul and Kushka, in the north-
west, and Katawaz in the south-east) could potentially come in the pipeline for tender over the next 3-5
years. While a long term decline in prices would have an impact on the prospects for potential investments,
current forecasts suggest that oil prices will gradually recover through 2020 and are set to increase over a
10-year horizon.
Impact on fiscal sustainability…
        The decline in oil prices is likely to have limited, if not neutral, impact on the budget. Unlike other
countries in the region, where fuel subsidies are a major transmission channel for price changes, the Afghan
government does not subsidize oil prices in any way.
         The impact on duties and taxes, both levied on basis of a fixed price per unit, will depend on the
extent to which demand will react to the softening of prices. Custom duties on oil and gas imports, are an
important source of government revenue: In 2013, the government collected $140 million in customs duties
on oil and gas, representing about a quarter of total customs revenues or 7 percent of domestic revenues
that year. The slowdown in economic growth and the withdrawal of international troops3 resulted in a
decline of fuel imports by over 30 percent in volume and an associated loss in customs revenue of nearly
$50 million in 2014. The tax take from the newly introduced fuel fee, on the other hand, has been relatively
low at around Afs 1.3 billion (equivalent to US$22.5 million) in 2014. The decline in fuel prices could
potentially spur demand and consequently have a positive impact on taxes of higher sales and imports.
However, economic developments, the decline in aid and the reduction of presence of foreign troops could
contain this effect. Finally, on the public procurement side, benefits from savings are unlikely to materialize
since fuel contracts are typically structured as multi-year commitments or financed by non-fungible donor
assistance.

  Fuel imports for the security forces are duty exempted and are not reflected in the official import statistics. However,
there is indication that some of the security-related fuel imports are actually sold for local consumption by traders,
implying a a positive correlation between security-related fuel imports and local consumption.

The sharp decline in revenues is a result of both the economic slowdown and increased weaknesses
in enforcement and compliance in both tax and customs administration. While the economic
slowdown is part of the explanation, weaknesses in tax and customs enforcement are a large part of the
problem, particularly given that the decline in

suspending bonuses and other benefits. Furthermore, the authorities accumulated arrears in operations and
maintenance (O&M) and discretionary development expenditures. The Ministry of Finance estimated total
arrears at the end of 2014 at about $205 million, of which around $50 million were accumulated under the
recurrent budget. Overall civilian O&M spending (chronically low and far below economic needs) declined
from Afs 18 billion in 2013 to Afs 16.3 billion in 2014. In addition, discretionary development spending
in 2014 was only half the amount recorded in 2013 (see Table 1).

Despite restraining civilian O&M and discretionary development spending, overall expenditures
increased in 2014 due to higher security and mandated social benefit spending. On-budget security
expenditures increased from Afs 119.3 billion in 2013 to Afs 137.4 billion ($2.4 billion) in 2014, driven by
higher spending in areas financed out of domestic resources as well as some on-budgeting of items that
were previously financed off-budget. The fiscal crisis has had little impact on security spending, which is
treated as a first priority and has thus been inflexible to resource constraints. Domestically-financed
security expenditures increased from Afs 31.8 billion ($575 million) in 2013 to Afs 43 billion ($750 million)
in 2014. Security grants are restricted to Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Ministry of Interior (MoI)
expenditures, while other security costs (particularly the National Directorate of Security) have increased
substantially over the past few years. Furthermore, the legislation on social benefits for families of martyrs
and disabled was amended in 2013 to revise certain benefits to almost threefold their previous rates. The
authorities have also indicated that increased conflict-related casualties resulted in higher payments of death
benefits to the families of security personnel in 2014. As such, social transfers almost doubled to Afs 20
billion in 2014. Overall, total discretionary spending (including recurrent and discretionary development)
increased by nearly 10 percent to Afs 238 billion in 2014, with higher security and social benefit spending
crowding out civilian O&M and discretionary development spending.

With lower revenues and higher expenditures, the fiscal crisis in 2014 was proactively managed under
difficult circumstances by drawing down cash reserves, accumulating arrears, and exceptional donor
assistance. As discretionary resources fell below discretionary expenditures, the fiscal crisis unfolded over
the course of the year with the authorities running through their cash reserves and accumulating arrears. At
the beginning to 2014, the opening cash balance was about Afs 21 billion or $370 million. This was
essentially drawn down to zero by the end of the third quarter, although some grants disbursed at the very
end of the year allowed the end-2014 cash position to recover to some extent. Despite the difficult
environment for managing cash flows, the authorities were generally successful in maintaining payments

for salaries and domestic contributions for security financing. Nonetheless, significant arrears in O&M and
discretionary development expenditures were accumulated in the second half of the year, with total
outstanding arrears at end-2014 of about $200 million. In light of the fiscal crisis, the authorities made
multiple requests for exceptional assistance during the second half of the year and received around $190
million in such funds, although not all was disbursed prior to the closing of the fiscal year. Even after the
exceptional assistance and not counting arrears (which are not booked as actual expenditures), the
discretionary deficit for 2014 amounted to about Afs 19 billion ($337 million), equivalent to about 1.6
percent of GDP.

Fiscal vulnerabilities remain high in 2015. The authorities started 2015 with a significantly lower level
of cash reserves. Furthermore, arrears in the recurrent and discretionary development budget need to be
repaid. On top of this, the authorities envision a fiscal gap of about Afs 8 billion ($136 million) in the 2015
budget, with an ambitious target of Afs 125.5 billion for domestic revenues. Unless revenue performance
improves dramatically compared to 2014, the financing gap for 2015 is likely to be much higher than
budgeted, with the authorities having a much smaller cash buffer on which to draw. Furthermore, with the
economy still in a sharp slump and the growth outlook weak, the scope for further expenditure austerity is
limited. As such, Afghanistan could well require additional discretionary financing in 2015, although this
would need to be combined with structural reforms to improve growth and revenue prospects in order to
chart a path toward sustainability.

The authorities reached agreement on a nine-month IMF Staff Monitored Program (SMP) in March
2015. The reforms supported by the program are intended to address macroeconomic vulnerabilities by
mobilizing revenue, strengthening the financial sector, and improving growth prospects. The reforms
envision a number of revenue measures, to be implemented by mid-2015, which are intended to generate

additional revenues for 2015. The macroeconomic framework also envisions rebuilding cash reserves by
year end. Successful implementation of the agreed reform agenda will be key to reining in macroeconomic
risks which remain high.

Trade deficit narrowed, thanks to strong exports growth and declining imports

Official exports increased for a second consecutive year, likely due to higher agriculture output as
well as improved recording. Official exports in 2014 were recorded at $621 million, up from $500 million
a year earlier. The increase in exports was primarily led by higher exports of agricultural products. Exports
of dried fruits and fresh fruits increased by more than 60 percent. Afghanistan’s exports basket is principally
comprised of agriculture-related products and commodities. Dried fruits and carpets are the two major
export items, which respectively make 35 Figure 17: Official exports, 2013 and 2014

downturn.

The Central Bank suspended the overnight deposits facility to encourage bank lending, while
preserving the capital notes as an alternative monetary policy instrument. In June 2014, Da
Afghanistan Bank suspended the overnight deposits facility for an undetermined period of time. The
decision was driven by the fact that the commercial banks were not lending enough, and instead deposited
their excess cash in the overnight facility to receive risk-free interest income. The overnight rate was 1
percent below the 28-day capital notes cut-off rate. With the suspension of the overnight deposits facility,
the Central Bank now relies on capital notes and foreign exchange auctions as instruments to manage
liquidity in the economy and to target the reserve money. The capital notes are short-term securities issued
by the Central Bank in the primary market to commercial banks and certified money dealers on a weekly
basis. In addition to the capital notes of 28-day and 182-day maturities, the DAB introduced a new capital
note with 1 year maturity in April 2013 and a 7-day capital note in January 2015. Total outstanding amount
in capital notes reached Afs 39.2 billion (equivalent to $675 million) in December 30, 2014.

                   2. Economic Outlook and Medium-Term Prospects
The growth outlook for 2015 remains weak. In light of the continued uncertainty and sluggish reform
progress, investor and consumer confidence in the non-agricultural sectors show no signs of picking up
before at least the second half of the year. Economic reform momentum has not yet picked up, and
parliamentary elections are scheduled for the near future which could further disrupt the political
consolidation process. Furthermore, unfavorable weather conditions point toward a contraction in
agriculture this year. Growth is thus projected to remain weak at 2.5 percent in 2015 before recovering to
about 5 percent during 2016-18. The growth projections remain highly fluid. With the economy stalled,
the timing and strength of any growth pickup depends on a reduction of the political uncertainty and
improvement in the pace of reforms. Furthermore, public development expenditures on essential
infrastructure and service delivery will need to play an important role in propping up economic activity
through the period of uncertainty. Restoring fiscal stability without sharp cuts in O&M and development
expenditures will be critical.

In the medium term, post-transition growth is projected at about 5 percent per year during 2016-18.
This is less than the average growth of 9.4 percent per year during 2003-12 that was fueled by the surge in
international aid and security spending. The post-transition growth outlook is contingent upon a relatively
stable political and security environment, with agriculture and services likely to be among the key drivers,
and extractive industries playing an increasing role in the medium term. Agriculture accounts for about a
quarter of GDP and is also linked closely to other parts of the economy, such as food and beverages (which
account for almost all of manufacturing), and parts of transport and retail. Afghanistan has the potential to
build on this foundation by reviving its historical position as an important exporter of fruits, nuts,
vegetables, and other higher value-added products. This will require investments in irrigation and extension
services to improve capacity, as well as efforts to build and improve downstream agro-processing activities.
On the other hand, extractive industries sector currently account for a very small share of GDP, but have
significant potential in light of Afghanistan’s deposits of copper, iron ore, and hydrocarbons. Unlocking

this potential will require progress on the legislative framework as well as securing financing for the
necessary infrastructure.

The medium term growth outlook is subject to serious risks which will need to be carefully managed .
The fragile political and security environment has been a considerable constraint to private investment and
growth. Continued violence, economic crime and systemic corruption also have often undermined progress
in Afghanistan’s governance and state-building agenda. Much will depend, therefore, on Afghanistan’s
success in achieving peace, stability and reconciliation.

A number of factors are likely to have affected poverty incidence since 2011-12. First, the sharp
slowdown in growth during 2013-15 would put pressure on underemployment and thus consumption across
the board. Second, agriculture experienced a bumper year in 2012 (growing by 18.2 percent, likely
postdating the 2011-12 household survey), although subsequent growth in the sector during 2013-14 has
remained relatively flat and unfavorable weather conditions points toward a contraction in 2015. Poverty
incidence in 2015 is thus projected at 38 percent. In the medium term, Afghanistan faces headwinds from
declining aid and a demographic youth bulge. In this context, making progress on poverty reduction will
require not only a pickup in overall growth, but also achieving steady growth in the agriculture sector,
reducing underemployment, mitigating climactic shocks, addressing regional disparities. Poverty incidence
is thus projected to decline only modestly to 35 percent by 2018, but is subject to a high degree of
uncertainty.

In light of the fiscal crisis, restoring fiscal stability will require accelerating revenue enhancing
reforms, additional discretionary assistance, and prioritizing expenditures. Reforms to improve
revenues continued to stall through the first three months of 2015 and a long delayed VAT appears to have
been further delayed. Afghanistan likely faces a financing gap in 2015 that is as large as last year, against
the backdrop of a weaker cash position. This would thus require additional discretionary assistance and
expenditure prioritization to mitigate impact on development outcomes. In the medium term, contingent
on improvements in tax and customs administration and additional tax measures, revenues are projected to
improve from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 11.6 percent by 2018. The natural resources sector also has
the potential to contribute to revenues in the medium term, but the timeline for this has become more
uncertain in light of weak progress in recent years. While the projected increase in revenues is ambitious,
it will still leave Afghanistan with an unfinanced fiscal gap of about 2 percent of GDP during 2015-18 (in
excess of the 20 percent of GDP gap already financed by existing commitments during this period). If
additional resources are not forthcoming to cover this gap, a more aggressive expenditure austerity path
would result, which would compromise development prospects and social outcomes as Afghanistan
struggles to restore stability.

Budget expenditures are projected to rise, with higher security and social benefit spending, so that
more aggressive austerity would squeeze essential development spending. Total budget expenditures
are projected to rise from 26 percent of GDP in 2014 to 30 percent in 2016. This increase is largely a result
of more security and development spending moving on budget from previously being undertaken directly
by donors. Afghanistan has considerable public expenditure needs in the areas of security, service delivery,
building essential infrastructure, and operations and maintenance (O&M). For example, delivering on goals
to improve education outcomes will require hiring increasing numbers of teachers. Prioritizing these


                                                                                                20 | P a g e
expenditure needs within the limited resource envelope will be critical to maintaining a pro-development
stance. With social benefits for martyrs and disabled increasing significantly in 2014, the authorities will
need to limit any further increases going forward. Although more detailed analysis of public expenditures
in needed, there appears to be limited space to adjust expenditures without adversely affecting growth
prospects and social outcomes. In light of mandatory increases in security spending, a more aggressive
expenditure consolidation path would directly squeeze essential civilian operating and development
spending. The resulting financing needs of the budget are, therefore, likely to remain substantial for the
foreseeable future. Moreover, channeling a greater share of development assistance through on-budget
expenditures is expected to enhance the medium term economic impact.

Donors have committed to considerable assistance for Afghanistan contingent on satisfactory reform
progress, although an acceleration of reforms and additional resources will be needed in light of
recent developments. At the December 2014 London Conference, the international community reaffirmed
its Tokyo commitment of providing $16 billion in development assistance for Afghanistan over 2012-15,
sustaining support through 2017 at or near the levels of the past decade, and providing continuing but
declining support through the Transformation Decade. These funds, contingent on satisfactory reform
progress under the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF), would allow Afghanistan to
progress toward sustainability and its development and infrastructure targets. Together with earlier pledges
on the security side, this means annual aid of about $8 billion—roughly equally divided between civil and
security aid. In light of the recent fiscal crisis, returning to a path of sustainability will require an
acceleration of reforms as well as additional on-budget assistance. Domestic revenue is an important
indicator in the TMAF, so that any additional resources will require a clear turnaround in revenue
performance by broadening the tax base, strengthening enforcement, fostering private sector development,
and developing the mining sector. Afghanistan may also need to explore its options on security
expenditures: current projections are based on a drawdown in ANSF personnel size from 352,000 to
228,000 between 2015 and 2017, although security experts indicate that this drawdown is no longer likely
to take place within that timeframe.

           3. Structural Policies for the Immediate and Medium Term
Afghanistan faces the dual challenge of restoring confidence in its economic prospects and addressing
formidable medium term development challenges. Growth has stalled and a deteriorating fiscal crisis
has emerged. In addition, medium term development challenges are formidable in the areas of aid
dependence, job creation for 400,000 new entrants into the labor force each year, high and persistent
poverty, low levels of human development and female labor force participation, and high levels of
corruption. Furthermore, fragility and conflict remain pervasive and undermine economic prospects as well
as social cohesion and stability. Addressing these challenges will require reforms from the new government
of Afghanistan in three areas: (i) restoring fiscal stability; (ii) restoring confidence and creating private-
sector jobs; and (iii) strengthening social cohesion and service delivery. Above all, high level commitment
to tackle corruption and strengthen governance across the board will be critical to delivering on the success
of reforms in these priority areas.

The new government articulated its development vision and a bold reform program through its paper
“Realizing Self Reliance: Commitments to Reforms and Renewed Partnership” presented at the
London Conference on Afghanistan in December 2014. The paper presents the government’s plans for

                                                                                                 21 | P a g e
tackling corruption and building better governance, restoring fiscal sustainability, bolstering private sector
confidence, promoting growth, and improving security and political stability. Successful implementation
of this bold reform program under difficult circumstances is the major challenge facing Afghanistan.

Restoring fiscal stability will require improving revenue mobilization, securing grant assistance, and
prioritizing government spending. The centerpiece of restoring fiscal stability is to improve revenue
performance. This will require immediate and credible measures to reduce leakages and strengthen customs
and tax compliance, exploring options for new taxes including the Value Added Tax (VAT) with an
adequate rate, and progress on the legislative and regulatory framework for the extractive industries sector.
Afghanistan will continue to require substantial grant assistance for the foreseeable future. The projected
total financing gap (for both on-budget and off-budget spending) while declining from more than 40 percent
of GDP in 2012, will remain above 20 percent of GDP through 2025. In order to ensure a pro-development
stance of spending within a constrained resource envelope, it will also be important to prioritize
expenditures through the development of a realistic and well-specified multi-year medium term expenditure
framework.

Afghanistan will need to restore investor confidence and create private sector jobs. Restoring investor
confidence will require addressing key weaknesses in the financial sector, investment climate, and land
tenure system. If confidence can be restored, growth is expected to be driven by agriculture, the services
sector, and over a longer term, extractive industries. As aid volumes are scaled down as a share of GDP,
growth will need to be led increasingly by the private sector. The target is to support growth of 5-6 percent
per year. This is less than the average growth of 9.4 percent per year during 2003-12 that was driven by
investment in reconstruction, expansion of services fueled by aid, and occasional surges in agricultural
production. Given its demographic realities, Afghanistan will need to aspire to create jobs for 400,000 new
entrants into the workforce each year and reduce chronic underemployment. This is remarkably ambitious
in an environment of fragility and volatility, so that a realistic target would be to hold the line on poverty
during 2015-18.

Agriculture is highly relevant to poverty reduction and job creation. Agriculture accounts for a quarter
of GDP and is also closely linked to other parts of the economy, including manufacturing (food and
beverages) and services (transport and retail). Agriculture is also highly relevant to poverty mitigation and
job creation, with more than 50 percent of the labor force tied to the sector. Driving agricultural expansion
will require focusing on those subsectors with the greatest potential: irrigated wheat, livestock, and
horticulture. Key policy and investment priorities include rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure and
improved on-farm water management, supporting adoption of higher yielding varieties, and improving
extension services.

The mining sector has significant potential for growth with modest employment impact, although the
impact of the sector can be enhanced through the resource corridor approach. Although extractive
industries currently account for a very small share of GDP, they have significant potential in light of
Afghanistan’s deposits of copper, iron ore, and hydrocarbons. Unlocking the potential of extractives will
require progress on the legislative and regulatory framework as well as securing financing for the necessary
infrastructure. Furthermore, a strong sector vision based on the Resource Corridor initiative can promote



                                                                                                 22 | P a g e
economic linkages by aligning actions and investments in four areas: physical infrastructure, livelihoods,
environmental and social impact, and governance.

Afghanistan will need to strengthen social cohesion and stability through improved and targeted
service delivery. Service delivery plays a dual role in Afghanistan: promoting social cohesion and trust in
public institutions, while laying the foundation for job creation and growth. With levels of education,
health, and infrastructure access among the lowest in the world, Afghanistan will need to continue
expanding service delivery across the board. In spite of significant improvements in school enrollment
rates over the past decade, only one out of four Afghans aged 16 or above is able to read and write or has
completed some formal level of schooling. It is therefore paramount that investments in education at all
levels remain a priority in Afghanistan’s development strategy. At the same time, special attention will be
needed in priority areas to enhance the impact on social cohesion and job creation within constrained
resources.

Afghanistan will need to tap the potential of regional integration to meet its energy and water needs
and to explore opportunities for labor migration. Energy and water will be critical for agriculture,
mining, and urban development, with needs expected to far outstrip capacity. Addressing both energy and
water needs will require prioritizing regional cooperation. Afghanistan will need to engage proactively to
establish its role as a transit route linking energy-rich Central Asian countries with energy hungry South
Asian countries. With four out of its five river basins part of international waterways, Afghanistan will
need to engage actively with downstream riparian countries to secure necessary water resources. Finally,
with domestic job creation expected to fall short of the growing labor force, Afghanistan should explore
opportunities for labor migration to Gulf countries.

Addressing challenges in the efficiency of service delivery will be critical in meeting the objective of
expanding access in a fiscally constrained environment. With unclear roles of provincial officials,
service delivery takes place in a complex governance environment with multiple stakeholders and informal
relationships. O&M arrangements are inadequate, with no overall asset registry and weak funding, budget
arrangements, and capacity for O&M provision. Corruption levels remain a serious concern and have the
potential to undermine improvements in public financial management. The capacity of core civil service
is inadequate and reliance on parallel civil service is high. Finally, the institutional structures for both
transport and irrigation investments are characterized by overlapping responsibilities and poor coordination.
Efficiency improvements will thus need to come from clarifying the subnational national governance
framework (including removing overlapping institutional mandates), improving O&M systems, further
strengthening public financial management, and improving the core civil service.

                Annex 1: World Bank Group Program in Afghanistan

1. The World Bank Group’s program in Afghanistan is governed by the joint Interim Strategy Note (ISN)
   for FY12-FY14, which focuses three themes: (i) building the legitimacy and capacity of institutions;
   (ii) equitable service delivery; and (iii) inclusive growth and jobs.4 The Bank also administers the
   Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) – the World Bank Group’s largest single-country
   multi-donor trust fund. The ARTF provides grant support to Afghanistan based on a 3-year rolling
   financing strategy. Together, International Development Association (IDA) and the Afghanistan
   Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) provide close to US$1 billion per year in grant resources (about
   US$150 million from IDA and about US$800-US$900 million from the ARTF). The ARTF is a key
   vehicle for providing Government with predictable and transparent on-budget financing and provides
   a platform for policy dialogue between Government and donors.

2. Since 2002, IDA has committed a total of $3.07 billion in grants (83 percent) and credits (17 percent)
   in Afghanistan. Thirty-six development and emergency-reconstruction projects and four budget-
   support operations have been committed as of end-February 2014. In addition, the ARTF has generated
   $7.99 billion from 33 donors, and committed $3.61 billion for the government’s recurrent costs and
   $3.79 billion for government investments programs. At end of January 2015 the active IDA portfolio
   was worth $835.98 million and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth $2.46 billion.

3. In fiscal year 2014, the World Bank Board approved two new IDA-financed projects and additional
   financing for an existing project totaling $106.7 million, plus the CASA-1000 regional project. The
   new projects included $50 million for the Development Policy Grant and $50 million for Access to
   Finance; the Financial Sector Rapid Response project received $6.7 million in additional financing. A
   regional project – CASA-1000 – was approved in March 2014 by the World Bank Group’s Board of
   Executive Directors for total grant and credit financing of $526.5 million. Of the total project financing
   for CASA-1000, Afghanistan receives $316.5 million in the form of an IDA grant. The FY14 IDA
   commitments fully utilized IDA-16.

4. In addition, in fiscal 2014 the ARTF approved $419.56 million in recurrent cost financing (of which
   $125 million was for recurrent cost baseline financing, $113.70 million for the Incentive Program,
   $146.96 million for AHP payment and O&M $33.90 million) and $580 million for Investment Window
   financing, including the Second Education Quality Improvement Program ($125 million), the Third
   Emergency National Solidarity Project ($200 million), the CASA Community Support Project ($40
   million), the Non-formal Approach to Training, Education and Jobs in Afghanistan ($15 million),Kabul
   Municipal Development Project ($110 million), and Kabul Urban Transport Efficiency Improvement
   Project ($90.50 million).

5. The World Bank has continued to engage in rigorous analytical work and placed increased emphasis
   on policy dialogue. These non-lending activities have been supportive of the Bank’s lending program
   and have played a crucial role in informing government of its strategic choices and advancing dialogue

  The process for preparing the next country strategy - Country Partnership Framework for Afghanistan has been
launched, with work on the Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) in progress.

                                                                                                     24 | P a g e
   between the Government of Afghanistan and its international development partners. In this regard, four
   pieces of analytical work stand-out; Transition Economics, Resources Corridors, Poverty Analysis, and
   Agriculture Sector Review. The Bank also prepared Policy Notes on key sectors of the economy to help
   guide its policy dialogue with the new administration.

6. IFC’s portfolio in Afghanistan has more than doubled since FY08 – from around US$8 million to about
   US$135 million to date. IFC is following an integrated advisory and investment strategy focused on
   improving the investment climate, building capacity, and supporting selective investments in sectors
   with high development impact and job creation. Currently, IFC’s portfolio includes two investments in
   the telecommunication sector – US$60 million in Mobile Telephone Networks (MTN) in a joint project
   with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and US$65 million in Roshan Telecom –
   along with a US$3 million investment in the hotel sector (TPS), and two operations in the financial
   markets (US$2 million equity in First Micro-finance Bank and a trade facility with the Afghanistan
   International Bank). Going forward, IFC is looking to expand its investment program in Afghanistan,
   in the areas of infrastructure, finance, manufacturing, agribusiness and services.

7. MIGA has US$155 million of gross exposure in Afghanistan, supporting telecoms and agri-business
   projects. MIGA recently launched its “Conflict Affected and Fragile Economies Facility”, which will
   boost the agency’s exposure in Afghanistan. MIGA is currently supporting three projects in
   Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with IFC in the telecoms sector (MTN). The other two are
   MIGA-only dairy and cashmere production projects.
