   Executive Summary
Even nearly ten years of solid growth cannot guarantee long-term income convergence. The
countries of the Latin America and Caribbean region (LAC), like other emerging economies, have
benefited from a decade of remarkable growth and some income per capita convergence towards
the United States and other industrialized countries. Yet, despite this recent progress, LAC still
faces a significant per capita income gap with the developed world. The studies in this volume
contribute to the ongoing debate on the reasons for this persistent income gap and the potential
drivers of convergence, and propose some broad avenues for reform.

Differences in total factor productivity (TFP), or efficiency in using the production factors,
such as physical and human capital, explain a large part of LAC’s persistent income gap. A
development accounting exercise conducted for this volume indicates that, if the average LAC
country closed its efficiency gap relative to the United States, its income per worker could double
from its current level, without any additional accumulation of capital.

To narrow this income gap, it is critical that the region reduces its efficiency gap. To that end,
the studies in this volume seek to identify the main candidates to explain the differences in
efficiency between LAC and the United States, as well as to look for factors that drive convergence
at all levels of the economy. Theory suggests two main channels through which the efficiency gap
can be affected: Technology adoption or innovation, on the one hand; and resource allocation, on
the other.

Macro-level evidence on the efficiency gap between LAC and the United States suggests that
resource misallocation is more important than the speed of technology adoption. At this
higher level of aggregation, the analysis in this volume shows that technology adoption explains
about one-fifth of the efficiency gap, leaving the rest to be explained by misallocation of resources.

The macro-level diagnostic is broadly confirmed at the sector level. At the sector level,
distortions and inefficient allocation of resources also hamper labor productivity growth and
convergence. In particular, low services sector productivity has reduced the contribution of the
structural change process to growth. In addition, while the manufacturing sector has displayed
unconditional convergence at the global level, this effect is subdued in LAC – as manufacturing
productivity growth has been slower in the region.

Furthermore, firm-level evidence for Colombia and Mexico also puts the spotlight on
resource misallocation. When looking at the drivers of firm-level productivity convergence in
these two countries, technology adoption and innovation emerge as the main drivers of
productivity convergence in the manufacturing sector. Improvements within the firm, not resource
reallocation between firms, are largely behind firms’ productivity growth of the last decade. This
is in line with the sector-level finding that improvements in resource allocation contributed less
than they could have to the growth of firms.

Resource misallocation can also translate into “pockets of inefficiency” associated with
relatively high poverty levels and exacerbated by macroeconomic volatility. Confronted with
poverty and a dearth of opportunities, poorer workers may not be able to move into high-

                                                  1
productivity sectors. They have no other choice than to perform basic activities, usually in the
informal sector, such as working in basic retail trade, becoming street vendors, or working in other
informal services. Since these insulated sectors are “pockets of inefficiency,” the lack of access to
finance and poor entrepreneurship prevent innovation and improved productivity. This
phenomenon is magnified by macroeconomic volatility.

At the same time, there is significant room for improvement when it comes to technology
adoption and innovation more broadly. In fact, the quality of the available technology in LAC
is low, and there is very little innovation. Although firms can use innovation to reach productivity
at the global productivity frontier, weak institutions reduce incentives to innovate. Only a few
firms catch up to the technological frontier – and even then, convergence seems mostly limited to
the domestic frontier, not the global one.

Understanding the reasons behind LAC’s income gap is a necessary step towards designing
appropriate growth strategies – particularly in the context of the current growth slowdown.
Drawing on the findings of the studies in this volume, a number of broad policy directions emerge:
(i) An increased focus on closing the efficiency gap – beyond mere factor accumulation – is critical
to reduce the income gap and improving LAC’s convergence prospects; (ii) eliminating distortions
that cause misallocation of resources will also improve the incentives to innovate; and (iii)
reducing macroeconomic volatility will alleviate the negative impact of the poverty gap on growth.

In practice, some of the key structural and macroeconomic approaches needed to speed up
LAC’s income convergence can be outlined. On the structural side, the main priorities for
improving resource allocation and the incentives to innovate include: (i) enhancing market
competition in key network industries (transport, financial, telecommunications, logistics,
communication and distribution services); (ii) increasing labor market flexibility (including skill-
mismatches and social barriers); (iii) removing informational frictions (including complex tax
regimes and credit rationing); (iv) strengthening property rights; and (v) improving the rule of law.
From a macroeconomic standpoint, policies aimed at addressing macroeconomic volatility would

     1. 1.                     Introduction

Beginning in the late 1990s, developing economies, including those in the Latin America and
Caribbean region (LAC), benefited from remarkable economic growth. The impact of such
growth on the welfare of millions of the countries’ citizens has been impressive. The accelerated
growth of the economies in LAC was underpinned by structural reforms and macroeconomic
stabilization, and propelled by a favorable external environment. From the early 2000s, growth
rates in LAC, were considerably above those in the earlier decades.1

Despite the higher growth rates and improved overall well-being, the LAC region has not
been able to close its historical income gap with the United States. In fact, LAC’s average per
capita GDP has hovered around 30 percent of U.S. per-capita GDP for more than a century.4 This
stands in stark contrast to the performance — during the last century — of Japan, the East Asia
and Pacific (EAP) “Tigers,” and, more recently, China and EAP’s middle-income countries

This volume looks into the reasons for LAC’s failure to consistently reduce its income gap
with the United States (and the developed world more generally). The starting point for the
analysis is a development accounting exercise,5 in which the income gap is decomposed into an
efficiency gap (differences in the efficiency of use of inputs) and a capital gap (differences in
physical and human capital).6 Recognizing the macroeconomic data’s varied quality and limited
ability to shed light on micro-foundations of convergence in per-capita incomes, we include other
levels of analysis. However, working at the macro, sectoral, and micro levels requires the use of
different, but complementary, empirical strategies.

The papers in the volume provide a multi-dimensional view of the possible causes of slow
productivity growth and convergence speed in the region. They focus on how efficiency,
including technology adoption, innovation, and allocation of production factors between firms and
sectors can influence productivity. Based on the questions asked and the availability of the data,
each paper adopts a different empirical approach, sample size, time horizon, and comparator
countries or regions. The first paper, by Francesco Caselli, explains differences in income using a

  See Caselli (2008): “Level accounting (more recently known as development accounting) consists of a set of
calculations whose purpose is to find the relative contributions of differences in inputs and differences in efficiency
with which inputs are used to cross-country differences in GDP. It is therefore the cross-country analogue of growth
accounting.” (p. 1, online version).

development accounting framework to measure the relative importance of gaps in terms of
efficiency, or total factor productivity (TFP), and the accumulation of quantity and quality of the
basic factors used to produce goods and services. The second paper, by Maya Eden and Ha
Nguyen, analyzes the relationship between the timing of technological innovations in the United
States and the timing of these innovations in LAC. The authors use aggregate and sector-level time
series data to identify the significance of these lags in technology adoption. The third paper, by
Marc Schiffbauer, Hania Sahnoun and Jorge T. Araujo, looks into structural change issues and
considers whether resources were increasingly allocated towards sectors, products, and
technologies with lower productivity, and how this could explain the region’s slow productivity
growth. The fourth paper, by J. David Brown, Gustavo Crespi, Leonardo Iacovone and Luca
Marcolin, focuses on Colombia and Mexico and analyzes the process and drivers of firm-level
convergence towards the domestic and global productivity frontiers.7 The fifth paper, by Ha
Nguyen and Patricio Jaramillo, measures returns to innovation among Latin American firms and
compares the returns of LAC countries, to those in the Europe and Central Asia region (ECA).
Finally, the paper by Konstantin Wacker examines the implications of poverty gaps (and their
interaction with macroeconomic volatility) for income convergence.

    1. 2.         Closing the Efficiency Gap Is Fundamental for Income Convergence

Differences in efficiency or accumulation of physical and human capital explain the gap in
income per worker between LAC and the United States. Output per worker can be thought of
as a product of human capital per worker, physical capital per worker (quality-adjusted labor), and
a term called total factor productivity (TFP) or “efficiency” (see Box 1.1). Growth in output per
worker can therefore be attributed to the changes in accumulation of factors of production or to
changes in efficiency.

Differences in efficiency—or total factor productivity (TFP)—explain a large part of the
income gap and variation across countries. Previous work, often relying on growth accounting,
had already stressed the role of TFP to explain a large part of growth variation across countries, as
well as the differences in the speed of convergence. Based on the aggregate production function,
low efficiency means low income per capita. But low efficiency also reduces incentives to invest
in equipment, infrastructure, and schooling. It reduces the potential returns on these investments
and, as a result, prevents faster capital accumulation and perpetuates existing income gaps. By
contrast, higher efficiency can reduce the income gap by improving returns on existing investments
and motivating increased investments in factors of production.8

  The domestic productivity frontier is defined as the average productivity of the top decile of firms, in terms of sales
per worker, in an economy or sector. The same indicator for the United States is the proxy for the international
frontier.

                                  Box 1.1. Total Factor Productivity (TFP) or “Efficiency”

    The analytical tool at the core of development accounting is the aggregate production function which maps the
    amount of physical and human capital (the aggregate input quantities) to the amount produced (the output
    quantities). Assuming that increasing the amount of inputs leads to an equivalent increase in outputs (constant
    returns to scale), the aggregate production function can be written in per- worker terms. Thus, using the augmented
    Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function, output per worker is a product of human capital per worker (adjusted
    for quality), physical capital per worker, and a term called total factor productivity (TFP) or “efficiency.”
    However, the TFP is subject to much controversy. Practitioners refer to it as technology, a “measure of our
    ignorance”, or the “Solow residual”. In this volume, we refer to it as “efficiency.” See Annex 2 for a literature
    review.

If the average LAC country closed its efficiency gap relative to the United States, its income
per worker could double from its current level, without any additional accumulation of
capital. The LAC region generally suffers from an efficiency gap and a capital gap, although there
is considerable heterogeneity within the region. Average factor accumulation per worker in LAC
is about 40 percent of that in the United States.9 LAC workers produce on average about one-fifth

  Caselli, in this volume, considers several calibrations to arrive to the estimates of relative capital and relative
efficiency for LAC countries. The capital and efficiency gaps vary depending on the sample (defined by data
availability) and whether or not quality of human capital measures are taken into account. Relative efficiency estimates
for LAC vary between 0.44 (broad sample, baseline calibration) to 0.6 (narrow sample, aggressive calibration). Broad
sample estimates are used throughout the overview.

of the output of U.S. workers (Figure 1.3).10 Their efficiency is about half of U.S. workers. In
addition, the stocks of physical and human capital in LAC are far lower than in the United States.
But part of this capital gap itself is likely to be explained by the efficiency gap and diminished
incentives to invest.

Slow technology adoption and misallocation of resources are the main candidates to explain
the efficiency gap between LAC and the United States. Annex 2 summarizes the empirical
literature on the determinants of TFP, or economy-wide efficiency. Based on this review, the
reasons for the efficiency gap include: (i) delayed adoption and diffusion of technology and lack
of innovation; (ii) poor allocation of resources between firms or sectors; and (iii) organizational
inefficiency (within firms).

The remainder of this chapter looks at technology adoption and allocation of resources in
LAC countries at the economy-wide (macro), sectoral, and firm levels. We review the lag in
technology adoption at the macro- and micro-levels between LAC and the United States and the
role it plays in income convergence.11 We also consider structural changes operating through the
technology and resources allocation channels that contribute to low efficiency.12 We consider firm-
level productivity and factor allocation between firms and sectors as drivers of the overall
economy-wide productivity.13 Because we find that innovation is the main driver of firm-level
productivity convergence, we look at factors outside the firm—such as institutions—that affect
incentives to innovate.14 Finally, this chapter looks at other factors—such initial poverty rates—
that can have an impact on convergence.15

     1.2.1.       The quality of technological make-up is low, and there is very little innovation

LAC’s relative technological backwardness is reflected in lower overall productivity,
idiosyncratic production structures in manufacturing, and lower innovation effort. The 40
percent efficiency gap in itself is a manifestation of LAC’s technological backwardness. This
means that the technologies used in LAC are less productive and obsolete compared to those in
the United States. Other factors—such as efficient allocation of resources—are also at play,
suggesting that the technologies used in LAC are less productive compared to those in the United
States. The level and quality of frontier or adaptation-based innovation are also good indicators of
the ability of an economy to invent or absorb technology.

   For each country, this exercise calculates the actual income per worker (based on actual factor accumulation and
efficiency) relative to the United States and the counterfactual income per worker (based on actual factor
accumulation) relative to the United States for the year 2005. The counterfactual income level is a hypothetical income
level for LAC economies, assuming that they used their physical and human capital as efficiently as the United States.
The actual income per worker in LAC amounts on average to one fifth of the U.S. level; the difference with the
counterfactual income level can be used to determine the size of the efficiency gap.

innovation are good indicators of the ability to invent or absorb technology. Defining innovation
as the introduction of new or improved products, only 22 percent of LAC firms innovate, compared
to 62 percent of firms in ECA. LAC firms have also not kept pace with industries in the EAP
region and other middle income economies.16 This means that less than a fifth of firms in LAC
have introduced a new or significantly improved product onto the market in the last three years
(see Figure 1.4).

Moreover, the quality of innovation and technological make-up in LAC tends to be low.17 In
addition, the ability of LAC firms to produce complex goods or perform “tasks” needed for
production is lower than in similar countries in East Asia. The difference is in terms of “knowledge
applicability.” Some knowledge (such as technology or processes) can be more readily adapted to
make new products in other sectors while other knowledge is limited in its scope of application.
Compared to EAP, LAC’s history of developing such abilities has been relatively erratic and
inconsistent (Figure 1.5).

Despite substantial progress achieved over the last 30 years, LAC countries have tended
towards lower export diversification than their peers in EAP. Overall, Latin America
succeeded in developing a relatively diversified manufacturing base over the last 30 years. The
region’s prospects for further diversification into new and potentially higher technology products
are higher than in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) or Sub-Saharan Africa. However,
LAC countries have lagged consistently behind EAP countries with similar levels of income in
terms of diversification and formation of clusters.18

The prevalence of “idiosyncratic” production structures limits the capacity of LAC firms to
absorb or imitate more productive foreign technologies. Economies that initially specialize in
exporting goods that embody broadly applicable knowledge subsequently grow faster. However,
the LAC region appears to have specialized in technologies that are “idiosyncratic,” or not well-
connected. An idiosyncratic export means that there are fewer capabilities to create products from
other product groups. Consequently, most countries in LAC have low and slow growing
knowledge applicability, except for Chile.

   By technological make-up, we mean the level of the available technology and the ability to use it effectively. We
also mean whether the technology is up to date.

As a result, manufacturing in LAC is less productive than the worldwide average. The
average growth of manufacturing labor productivity (net of year-industry specific effects) has only
been 1.2 percent, compared to 4.2 percent across all 104 countries with available data. There are
also substantial growth differences across the region. This calls for a more detailed analysis of
manufacturing productivity developments on a micro level, which we discuss throughout this
volume.

                                    1.2.2.         Innovation drives firm-level productivity catch-up

Aggregate productivity growth depends on productivity growth of individual firms and
allocation of factors between them.19 A country’s productivity rises because the firms’
productivity has risen (“within firm” aspect). However, it could also be that the more productive
firms within the country acquire more production factors and thus expand their production while
less productive firms decline in importance or went out of business (“between firms” aspect). This
section looks at what drives manufacturing firms’ convergence to the productivity frontier by
comparing manufacturing firm-level data for Mexico, Colombia and the United States.20 In these
countries, after 2000, the main driver of manufacturing productivity was productivity growth
within firms and not reallocation of factors or resources between firms.21

   The productivity frontier is defined as the mean of the top quartile of the firm-level distribution of value added per
employee. The U.S. frontier is taken as a proxy for the international productivity frontier.

important determinant of firm-level
productivity growth – with little contribution from the resource reallocation channel.23 This
is true even among more capital intensive firms, which seem to enjoy higher productivity growth.
The degree of engagement in international trade does not seem to influence productivity growth
positively, except in the case of the United States. On average, the “within” firm productivity
growth (that is driven by technological adoption or innovation) accounts for more than two thirds
of overall productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. In Mexico,  on average, changes in
allocation of factors between firms accounted for 22 percent of overall productivity growth and
for 8 percent in the United States. Reallocation made almost no contribution to productivity growth
in Colombia. This also means that Mexico and Colombia during the 2000s have done relatively
better on technology adoption than on reducing resource misallocation.

     Note: The covariance component describes the joint distribution of firms’ productivity and market share. The
     extent of resource misallocation can be inferred by the covariance term, with a larger positive value indicating
     that more productive firms use higher industry inputs shares. Increases in the covariance term would therefore
     imply improvements in the allocation of productive inputs (i.e. workers) across firms (within the industry).

      1.2.3.       Incentives to innovate are inhibited by weak institutions

In Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua returns to innovation are low,
creating little incentive for firms to innovate.24 Overall, it is found that, after a firm innovates,
its sales per worker increase by 18 percent.25 In contrast, in the Latin American countries for which
this analysis was conducted – namely, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua –
the difference in sales and sales per worker between firms that do and do not innovate is not
statistically different from zero.26 This indicates that returns to innovation in Latin America are
very small.

Institutional factors such as weak property rights protection and the rule of law explain such
low returns. Returns to innovation increase in LAC—disproportionately more than in ECA—with
better property rights protection (7.4 percent vs. 0.8 percent) and better institutions (12.6 percent
vs. 1.9 percent). Regulations and other institutional arrangements can prevent firms from absorbing
existing technologies or from innovating, even after correcting for the economic structure and level
of development. These weak institutions constrain technology adoption and reduce firm-level
incentives to innovate. This “innovation shortfall” due to these distortions seems particularly



24
   Innovation is an introduction of a line or a product that are new to a firm, but do not necessarily represent innovation
at the technological frontier.

and proxy by misallocation and competitiveness. They also show that the distance to the world knowledge frontier is
positively affected by “static wedges.”

   1.2.4.      Distortions leading to misallocation of factors explain most of the efficiency
       gap

Technology adoption explains about one-fifth of the efficiency gap between countries, leaving
the rest to be explained by misallocation of factors. The role of technology in the region’s
efficiency gap with the United States is a function of the speed of technology adoption. An
adoption lag of technology is the length of time between the invention of the technology and its
eventual adoption. Estimated at the macro level, the rate at which an economy adopts new
technology indicates the degree to which technology improves efficiency. Slow adoption indicates
that technology backwardness is indeed a major problem. Fast adoption means that other factors,
such as institutions and misallocation of resources, are more important. Any shock to TFP growth
in the United States that affects the adopting countries with a lag is a technology shock. Based on
the TFP time series data, we find that, on average, technologies in the United States are fully or
nearly-fully adopted by LAC firms after eight to 10 years (Figure 1.9). Assuming that the
technology frontier in the United States grows about 1 percent a year, an eight-year lag translates
into an 8 percentage-point widening of the productivity gap. This leaves 80 percent of the
efficiency gap to be explained by distortions leading to misallocation of factors of production.




                                                                         12

       Source: Eden and Nguyen (2014). Note: The figure depicts the marginal rate and cumulative adoption of
       frontier technology in LAC, based on a baseline estimation from Akcigit et al. (2014). Measured TFP growth
       is constructed as the growth of a Solow residual, at an annual frequency. The United States is the frontier
       country and the adopting country is a GDP-weighted average of LAC countries. Dotted line represents 90
       percent confidence intervals.

This result is consistent with the fact that technology adoption and innovation drove
convergence to domestic productivity frontiers in Mexico and Colombia. It is important to
distinguish between what explains the efficiency gap between countries and the drivers of the
observed convergence to domestic productivity frontiers. While technology adoption only explains
20 percent of the existing efficiency gap, based on macro-level evidence of shocks to TFP, this
does not mean that changes in the speed of technology adoption, or in conditions that determine
this speed—such as incentive structure for innovation, institutions, etc.—account for the same
share in the observed firm-level productivity increases. Indeed, we find that innovation has been
driving firm-level productivity, which in turn drove productivity convergence to the domestic
frontier in Mexico and Colombia; while the lack of improvements in between-firms factor
allocations prevented them from converging to the global productivity frontier. There has therefore
been very little reallocation of factors towards more productive firms: factors that experience little
change also contribute little to the dynamics of convergence.

There is some heterogeneity in the speed of technology adoption among LAC countries,
sectors of the economies, and specific technologies. Studies using data on specific technologies,
have estimated longer lags (about 20 years), potentially explaining about half of the efficiency gap.
We find, however, that the various results can be reconciled, taking into account the differences
between macro and micro-data estimations (see Box 1.2).

           Box 1.2. Reconciling the Different Technology Adoption Lags at Macro and Micro Levels

 Comin and Hobijn (2010) using microeconomic evidence on specific technologies find the technology adoption
 gap to be around 20 years on average. This, at least on the surface, is inconsistent with the result found in this
 volume and in Akcigit et al. (2014), which shows an eight-year lag for LAC. Eden and Nguyen, in this volume,
 discuss this result in detail and show that due to different definitions of technology adoption lag measured at macro
 and micro levels, these results are broadly in line. They reconcile the two findings with two insights. First,
 technologies tend to be adopted first in more productive firms. Because the first adopting firms tend to be more
 productive, the productivity gains from the first technology adopters are relatively larger than the productivity gains
 from later adopters. The macro-level adoption lag accounts for this, by weighting technology adoptions by their
 respective productivity gains. The micro-level adoption lag, in contrast, assigns equal weights to all adopters; thus,
 it is likely to be relatively longer than the macro-level lag. Second, more effective technologies are likely to be
 adopted faster. Technologies that improve productivity are more likely to be adopted faster, as the return to adoption
 is higher. This implies shorter lags associated with technologies that are more productivity enhancing. The macro-
 level adoption lag focuses on aggregate productivity gains from technology adoption, which is likely driven
 disproportionately by more productive technologies. In contrast, the micro-level adoption lag weighs technologies
 equally, and is thus likely to be longer. Since the relative importance of adopting firms and of productivity
 improvements matters for aggregate productivity, the macro-approach is more important to explain the latter.

Misallocation can affect efficiency directly, and through the optimal technology adoption
decisions by firms. Weak institutions can reduce firm-level incentives to innovate, and thus
become a binding constraint to innovation and technology adoption. Moreover, these weak
institutions can result in misallocation of factors and can affect efficiency through the optimal
technology adoption decision of agents.27

     1.2.5.   Distortions and factors outside the firm hamper productivity growth in
         manufacturing

LAC’s efficiency gap is not all about sectoral resource allocation, but also about inefficient
resource use within key sectors. Structural change has contributed less to growth in the region
not only due to the movement of labor from manufacturing to lower-productivity activities, but
also due to slower manufacturing productivity growth. Unconditional convergence in
manufacturing labor productivity across countries has emerged as an empirically robust stylized
fact.28 That is, manufacturing labor productivity in poorer countries is catching up (on average)
with manufacturing labor productivity in high income countries unconditional on developing
countries’ policies, qualities of institutions, education, or other growth determinants. In one
interpretation, this phenomenon can be attributed to the tradable nature of manufacturing as well
as to its cross-border technological transferability.29




27
   In a spin-off of the model in Akcigit et al. (2014) and Eden and Nguyen, in this volume, it is shown that technology
adoption incentives decrease with the level of distortions in economy, which they call “static wedges” and proxy by
misallocation and competitiveness. They also show that the distance to the world knowledge frontier is positively
affected by “static wedges.”

Firm-level productivity is also affected by factors and distortions outside of the firm,
including through spillover effects. One example, considered above, is the reduction in returns
to innovation caused by weak institutions. For example, when an industry improves overall
productivity, the firms in the same sector of the same country also improve their productivity.
However, the variation in productivity among firms within an industry can also hinder an
individual firm’s ability to catch up. That is, the spillover effect of improved productivity
dissipates with the distance from the frontier. The farther away a firm is from the productivity
frontier, the less it benefits from the improvements. Similarly, there was no evidence of spillovers
from the global frontier (which is generally more distant).

High labor costs and wage inequality also hinder convergence. In Mexico and Colombia, high
wages reduce the catch-up speed towards the domestic frontier. In Colombia, the wage differential
between skilled and unskilled workers also negatively affected productivity convergence. In
contrast, the opposite was true for the U.S. firms. This reflects the fact that convergence is more
difficult in an environment where high skills are scarce and costs of labor mobility are high,30 as
in Colombia, and where skilled workers thus earn a considerable wage premium.

     1.2.6.    Low labor productivity in “insulated” sectors reduces overall value added per
         worker

The movement of labor to the sectors with lower value-added per worker is correlated with
the overall slow growth in value added in LAC. When workers move to sectors with lower
value-added per worker, the growth in overall value-added is found to be lower.31 This aspect of
structural transformation appears to have been the pattern across the region in recent decades. In
seven out of a sample of nine LAC countries between 1990 and 2005, structural change was
associated with lower value-added per worker.32 The cases of Argentina and Costa Rica illustrate
the issue of labor productivity. In Argentina, a number of large services sectors with experienced
the highest increases in employment. While these “insulated” economic activities provide a large
number of jobs, they also tend to generate lower value added per worker. The result was an overall
decline in value added per worker in the entire economy. By contrast, in Costa Rica, while
structural change also shifted labor to services, the workers’ productivity was higher, thus resulting
in an overall increase in value added per worker in the economy. Figure 1.10 illustrates the cases
of Argentina and Costa Rica.

The role of the services sector in explaining the contribution of structural change to average
value-added per worker varies across the region. In cases where the tertiary sector remains
relatively less productive than the manufacturing sector, which seems the more common pattern
in the region, employment re-allocation from the latter to the former would reduce economy-wide
growth in value-added per worker in LAC. In contrast, higher services sector productivity helps
explain why countries such as Mexico and Costa Rica have seen structural change contributing to
aggregate productivity growth.

   The exceptions were Mexico and Costa Rica. High productivity in the services sectors explain why structural
change contributed to aggregate productivity growth in these economies.

Countries with deep initial poverty converge more slowly in income per capita. Although
there are additional forces influencing poverty and convergence, the initial poverty and associated
lack of opportunity do play a role in income convergence. Figure 1.11 shows how the convergence
speed of income per capita depends on the initial poverty level. Lower poverty gaps (on the left)
are associated with faster convergence speed while convergence speed slows down as poverty rises
(moving towards the right on the horizontal axis). Interestingly, controlling for poverty is sufficient
to observe convergence in a sample of 102 developing countries that do not converge
unconditionally.

Poverty and slow convergence reduce opportunities for low-skill workers and favor the
development of inefficient insulated sectors. Workers, facing poverty and lacking opportunity,
may not be able to move into high-productivity sectors, for any number of reasons.33 They have
no other choice than to perform basic activities, usually in the informal sector, such as basic retail
trade, becoming street vendors, or performing other informal services. Many of these services are
essentially non-tradable and do not operate in a competitive environment. In addition, because
these insulated sectors are “pockets of inefficiency,” the lack of access to finance and poor
entrepreneurship prevent innovation and improved productivity.

The LAC region’s relatively high poverty rates, given the levels of income, have hindered
convergence. LAC countries stand out for their higher than expected poverty gaps, given their
income levels. In addition, the region’s history of informality, limited access to finance, and skill-
mismatches have counteracted the “advantages of backwardness” that should otherwise have
helped these countries to converge towards higher income levels.
33
  For example, workers may not have the necessary education or skills, or they may not be able to move to another
part of the country, or they may not be aware of opportunities.

                                                                                                                                              16
This effect is magnified by macroeconomic volatility, potentially creating a vicious cycle. The
negative effect of poverty on growth further increases with macroeconomic volatility and
uncertainty because the poor will refrain from investing.34 This would prevent poorer workers from
moving to sectors that are more profitable and productive. This “missing reallocation” will thus
give rise to an ex post allocation inefficiency, that could adversely impact growth and poverty
reduction further.35 Figure 1.12 shows the impact of poverty on growth at different levels of
volatility (measured by the standard deviation of GDP). The adverse effect of poverty on growth
becomes more pronounced as GDP volatility increases.

            1. 3.                            What These Findings Mean for Growth Policies

Understanding the reasons behind LAC’s income gap is a necessary step towards designing
appropriate growth strategies. To inform the ongoing debate on growth strategies for Latin
America and the Caribbean, the findings of the papers in this volume point to a number of broad
policy directions:

                                     Prioritizing policies to reduce the efficiency gap is an effective way to address the income
                                      gap.
                                     Policies aimed at reducing distortions and misallocation of factors can improve both
                                      efficiency and the speed of technology adoption.
                                     Reducing macroeconomic volatility will improve income convergence by alleviating the
                                      negative impact of the poverty gap on growth.36

   Dixit and Rob (1994). Most countries in the region had relatively liberalized capital accounts – which gave rise to
boom and bust cycles (aside from Dutch-disease type effects on economic structure) – while being less open to trade
in goods and services which could help mitigate the adverse effect of volatility on growth (see Kose et al., 2006).
Notably, the situation in East Asia was quite the reverse.
36
   These results complement in a number of ways, the findings and conclusions of the 2010 IDB flagship The Age of
Productivity. While the present volume finds that addressing resource allocation issues would play a significant role
in addressing the efficiency gap, in line with the IDB flagship, it also shows the criticality (and the costs) of innovation


                                                                               17
        1.3.1. To reduce the income gap, close the efficiency gap

Closing the efficiency gap will lead to significant growth and welfare gains. If LAC had closed
its efficiency gap relative to the United States, the region’s income per worker would have been
twice as high as its current level. This result would not have required a massive savings or
investment effort to close the capital gap. In addition, efficiency improvements would themselves
have provided the incentive for investments, thereby reducing the capital gap.37

However, the supply-side angle—the determinant of TFP—is critical if LAC is to achieve
higher and sustained rates of non-inflationary growth. Since many of the economies in LAC
are already operating close to their full capacity, it is not enough to seek alternative (domestic)
sources of demand. The region’s economies also need to remove or relieve constraints to
productivity growth. Otherwise, policies that focus exclusively on stimulating aggregate demand
run the risk of further straining countries’ productive capacity and leading to inflationary pressures.

        1.3.2. To increase productivity, reduce distortions that lead to resource misallocation
               and weak incentives to innovate

Building more efficient economic institutions will improve the allocation of factors.
Misallocation plays a major role in explaining the LAC region’s overall efficiency gap.38 Barriers
for the flow of labor and capital to the most productive entities reduce aggregate productivity.
Where there is a great variety of efficiency levels within an industry, convergence is slow and the
benefits of knowledge spillovers are reduced. In addition, firms that are farther away from the
frontier find innovation efforts too costly and ineffective and cannot benefit from advances in
technology. Therefore, improving the allocation of resources towards more productive firms will
boost aggregate productivity and expand production further.

Identifying and addressing country-specific distortions that prevent resources from moving
to the most productive activities (sector or firm level). In a well-functioning policy and market
environment, capital and labor should move from firms and sectors with low productivity to firms
with high (marginal) productivity and allow the latter to grow and the former to shrink (or exit the
market). However, myriad policy and market failures can affect the efficient allocation of capital
and labor across firms. This reduces productivity because it gives an inordinate market share to
less productive firms, while restricting growth of the more productive ones. Some of the policy
inadequacies that discourage the ability of productive firms to survive and grow, and the closure
of unproductive ones include: (i) limited market competition in key network industries (transport,

for firm-level convergence as well as the importance of reducing macroeconomic volatility for the simultaneous
pursuit of growth and equity.
37
   Furthermore, as shown by other research, TFP can be interpreted as a measure of aggregate welfare and, TFP
comparisons across countries and time would proxy for welfare comparisons along the same dimensions. See Basu et
al. (2012).
38
   As noted by Jones (2015): “Development accounting tells us that poor countries have low levels of inputs, but they
are also remarkably inefficient in how they use those inputs. Misallocation provides the theoretical connection between
the myriad of distortions in poor economies and the TFP differences that we observe in development accounting.” (p.
55).

financial, telecommunications, logistics, communication and distribution services); (ii) limited
labor market flexibility (including skill-mismatches and social barriers); and (iii) informational
frictions (including complex tax regimes and credit rationing).

Therefore, the goal should be to lift productivity levels in lagging sectors that are receiving
labor and upgrade human capital across the board – so that newly-unemployed workers can
find jobs in more productive sectors that could potentially absorb labor.39 At the sector level, a
number of considerations follow from the analysis in this volume:

        Natural resource wealth, if appropriately managed, can generate economy-wide benefits.
         Although Chile’s economy is missing an industrialized manufacturing core, its economic
         performance has been impressive.
        High productivity services are not unlike manufacturing in some respects and could also
         potentially display unconditional convergence.40 Given the relatively low levels of service
         exports in LAC, a key policy goal for the region would be to make the services sector more
         productive and tradable.41
        “Insulated” economic activities—particularly in the tertiary sector—are less productive,
         but provide a large number of jobs. Enhancing product and labor market competition can
         remove the implicit protection that such insulated sectors receive and thus reduce resource
         misallocation.42

Innovation effort is the main driver of firm-level convergence, but certain factors prevent
firms from absorbing the technology that is readily available. Both the firm-level study of
convergence to the domestic frontier (innovation largely contributes to observed productivity
convergence), and the discussion on the “technology space” (the importance of knowledge
applicability as a growth engine) highlight the importance of innovation in the convergence
process. It takes about eight years for frontier technologies to have an impact on efficiency in LAC.
Moreover, macro-level factors, such as institutional quality and slow technology absorption,
reduce firms’ incentives to innovate and have a disproportionately larger negative effect in LAC
than elsewhere.

Removing distortions will also speed up technology adoption. Similar distortions adversely
affect both resource allocation and incentives to innovate, suggesting that certain “horizontal”
policies can operate through both resource allocation and technology adoption. To increase their
capabilities to innovate or absorb new technology, LAC countries need to invest more in human

   Rodrik (2013, p. 53): “(…) some service industries may be acquiring manufacturing-like properties (…) If such
service activities are also subject to absolute productivity convergence, as seems plausible, they could act as the
escalator industries of the future.” See also Ghani and O’Connell (2014).
41
   See World Bank (2013): “At any rate, rather than completely discarding it as an undesired Dutch Disease by-
product, proactive development policies should embrace sophisticated services as crucial to the Latin American path
to sustainable development.” (p. 45).
42
   Silva and Ferreira (2013) argue that low growth in the tertiary sector explains much of the divergence between LAC
and the United States after 1980.

capital and work towards removing distortions.43 Furthermore, a weak or adverse institutional
environment discourages firms from investing in new products. These distortions also affect the
ability of resources to move towards their most productive use, thereby contributing to resource
misallocation. Therefore, certain “horizontal” policies—focused on institutional strengthening,
human capital accumulation and infrastructure upgrading—can help raise efficiency through both
channels examined in this volume.44

       1.3.3. Reduce macroeconomic volatility to alleviate the negative impact of the poverty
              gap on growth

Containing macroeconomic volatility helps reduce the negative impact of the poverty gap on
growth. Policies that reduce macroeconomic volatility will also weaken the negative link between
“initial” poverty and income convergence. As a result, the potential vicious cycle between
relatively high poverty and aggregate growth can be addressed. This conclusion also supports the
notion that growth strategies need to take into account both equity and volatility. As a corollary,
policies aimed at addressing macroeconomic volatility would also have positive longer-run supply
response effects. 45

       1.3.4. Issues for future research

As this volume narrows the search for the determinants of LAC’s income gap, it also raises new
issues for future research. The volume emphasizes the relevance of closing the efficiency gap and
the fact that technology adoption only plays a limited role in this process. Issues of structural
change, innovation, and equity deserve more attention. Despite these insights, this volume is only
one contribution in an ongoing debate, with the need to focus on more detail on certain aspects.
For example, why do we see domestic convergence for firms’ productivity despite the fact that the
more productive firms are adopting new technologies faster than the less productive firms? Is this
because of the low importance of technology adoption for productivity or because domestic
convergence is a phenomenon of just the last decade (or of only Colombia and Mexico)? Does
LAC’s progress in terms of equity during the last decade contribute to this pattern and what is the
causal relationship between poverty, volatility, and convergence more generally? Under which
conditions does productivity-increasing structural change (between and within sectors) occur? We
hope that this volume provides a basis upon which these and other research questions can be
addressed.




43
    Examples of distortions include credit market failures that prevent firms from investing in “lumpy” and risky
innovations and labor market rigidities that act as barriers to new technology adoption. See Maloney and Rodriguez-
Clare (2007).
44
   This does not mean that “vertical” policies cannot be effective in some contexts. However, the appropriateness of
vertical approaches was not addressed in this volume.
45
   Therefore, by incorporating equity and volatility concerns, development policy design needs to go beyond the
“incomplete agenda” of Washington Consensus for growth in LAC. See Birdsall et al (2010).

Recent advances in development accounting confirm that the large income differences across
countries cannot be explained by differences in the accumulation of physical or human capital.
Instead, variations in total factor productivity (TFP) have been found to account for at least 50
percent of cross-country income differences directly (among others, Caselli, 2005; Caselli and
Coleman, 2006; Caselli and Feyrer, 2007). What is more, variations in TFP also indirectly affect
income differences through their impact on physical and human capital accumulation (Hsieh and
Klenow, 2010). It follows that a successful theory of economic growth and convergence needs to
explain why some countries experience high TFP growth while others lag behind. The subsequent
literature explaining TFP differences can be broadly classified into three different approaches.

I. Technology Diffusion and Adoption

A first strand of the literature extends endogenous growth theories to show differences in
international technology diffusion and adoption rates across countries (e.g., Barro and Sala-i-
Martin, 1997; Howitt, 2000). Among others, Keller (2004) summarizes the empirical evidence on
international technology diffusion documenting also the importance of geographic, economic, or
cultural distances between countries. He also measures that 90 percent of technology diffusion
occurs through indirect technology spillovers rather than through the acquisition of technology
licenses. Comin and Hobjin (2010) use data on the diffusion of 15 technologies in 166 countries
over the last two centuries and reveal significant lags in adoption (on average, countries have
adopted technologies 45 years after their invention). But why are firms in some countries more
successful or eager to adopt new technologies than firms in other countries?

Differences in the speed of diffusion have been associated with several economic factors
influencing the incentives of firms in developing countries to adopt new (foreign) technologies. It
should be noted that most of these contributions are based on theoretical models, in some cases
paired with some suggestive cross country or case study evidence. Several studies highlight the
role of cross-country differences in (the quality of) human capital (Benhabib and Spiegel, 1994,
2005; Hanushek and Kimko, 2000; Hanushek and Woessmann, 2012). However, while all of these
studies imply higher social relative to private returns from schooling, a number of studies reject
different returns empirically (e.g., Krueger and Lindahl, 2001), suggesting that there might be a
non-trivial mapping from (quality) measures of schooling to the quality of the labor-force. Other
explanations focus on transmission channels for the diffusion of technologies that differ across
countries, such as trade (Grossman and Helpman, 1995; Keller, 2002; Eaton and Kortum, 2002;
Caselli and Wilson, 2004) and foreign direct investment (Rodriguez-Clare, 1996; Larrain et al.,
2000; Xu, 2000; Javorcik, 2004; Antras and Helpman, 2004; Keller and Yeaple, 2009). Other
factors, that have been shown to affect (distort) the incentives of firms to adopt superior foreign
technologies include macroeconomic volatility (Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 1997; Aghion et al.,
2010); financial development (Benhabid and Spiegel, 2000; Levine et al., 2000), product market
competition (Aghion et al., 2001; Aghion et al., 2005; Aghion et al., 2009); industrial or innovation
policy (Grossman and Helpman, 1995; Hausman and Rodrik, 2003); or institutional barriers to
technology adoption (Parente and Prescott, 1999; Fisman, 2001; Acemoglu et al. 2002, 2005;
Faccio, 2005; Bloom et al., 2012).

II. Efficiency in Resource Allocation

A parallel strand in the literature focusses on cross-country differences in resource allocation
within or across industries to explain differences in TFP. These contributions document that
resources in developing countries are over-proportionally allocated towards sectors with lower
productivity. McMillan and Rodrik (2011) and Rodrik (2013a) show that such misallocations of
labor across sectors, in particular a decline in the manufacturing sector, lead to productivity
differences across countries. Similarly, Arnold et al. (2012) reveal strategic linkages between sub-
sectors in the economy that matter for firm productivity growth. Restuccia and Rogerson (2008),
Hsieh and Klenow (2012) and Bartelsman et al. (2013) show the extent to which the allocation of
resources across heterogeneous firms induce aggregate cross-country TFP differences. Hsieh and



                                                 24
Klenow (2012) reveal substantial differences in productivity growth over the life cycle of firms in
the U.S., Mexico, and India.

While the empirical significance and theoretical underpinnings of cross country differences in
resource allocation are by now well established, most approaches fall short in mapping these
distortions to specific policies. The fundamental question arises if policy distortions leading to
resource misallocation across firms are any different from policies affecting firms’ incentives to
adopt new technologies?

III.   Managerial Quality

Finally, other approaches argue that differences in the organizational efficiency of firms across
countries lead to cross-country TFP differences (Prescott, 2008). In particular, Bloom and Van
Reenen (2007) and Bloom et al. (2013) attempt to measure cross-country differences in managerial
efficiency based on surveys of management practices and find that managerial efficiency varies
significantly across firms in different countries.

     2. The Latin American Efficiency Gap
         Francesco Caselli47

     2. 1.       Introduction

The average Latin American country produces about 1 fifth of the output per worker of the US.
What are the sources of these enormous income gaps? This paper reports development-accounting
results for Latin America. Development accounting compares differences in income per worker
between developing and developed countries to counter-factual differences attributable to
observable components of physical and human capital. Such calculations can serve a useful
preliminary diagnostic role before engaging in deeper and more detailed explorations of the
fundamental determinants of differences in income per worker. If differences in physical and
human capital – or capital gaps – are sufficient to explain most of the difference in incomes, then
researchers and policy makers need to focus on factors holding back investment (in machines and
in humans). Instead, if differences in capital are insufficient to account for most of the variation in
income, one must conclude that developing countries are also hampered by relatively low
efficiency at using their inputs - efficiency gaps. The research and policy agenda would then have
to focus on technology, allocative efficiency, competition, and other determinants of the efficient
use of capital.48

I present development-accounting results for 2005 for three samples of Latin American countries:
a “ broad” sample of 22 countries, a “ narrow” sample of 9, and an “ intermediate” sample of 15.

The three samples differ in the data available to measure human capital. In the broad sample human
capital is measured in the context of a “ Mincerian” framework, where the key inputs are schooling
(years of education) and health (as proxied by the adult survival rate). In the narrow and
intermediate samples I augment the Mincerian framework with measures of cognitive skills, to
account for additional factors such as schooling quality, parental inputs, and other influences on
human capital not captured by years of schooling and health. The measures of cognitive skills are
based on tests administered to school-age children. In the narrow sample, the test is a science test
whose results are directly comparable between Latin America and the benchmark developed
country. In the intermediate sample the tests were only administered in Latin America and can be
compared to the benchmark country only on the basis of a number of ad hoc assumptions.

In all three samples I measure physical capital as an aggregate of reproducible and “ natural”
capital. Reproducible capital includes equipment and structures, while natural capital primarily
includes subsoil resources, arable land, and timber.

   For a detailed exposition of development accounting see, among others, Caselli (2005). For previous applications
with a focus on Latin America see Cole, Ohanian, Riascos, and Schmitz (2005) and Hanusheck and Woessman
(2012a). Cole et al. in particular stress the importance of TFP gaps, consistent with my findings.

                                                        34
Given measures of physical capital gaps, as well gaps in the components of human capital,
development-accounting uses a calibration to map these gaps into counter-factual income gaps, or
the income gaps that would be observed based on differences in human and capital endowments
only. Because these counterfactual incomes are bundles of physical and human capital, I refer to
the ratio of Latin American counterfactual incomes to the US counterfactual income as relative
capital.

For each of the three samples I present results from two alternative calibrations, a “ baseline”
calibration and an “ aggressive” calibration. The baseline calibration makes use of the existing
body of microeconomic estimates of the Mincerian framework in the way that most closely fits
the theoretical framework of development accounting. As it turns out, this leads to coefficients for
the components of human capital that are substantially lower than in much existing work in
development accounting - leading to relatively smaller estimated capital gaps and,
correspondingly, larger efficiency gaps. The aggressive calibration thus uses more conventional
figures as a robustness check.

When I use my benchmark calibration, irrespective of sample/cognitive skill correction, I find that
relative capital and relative efficiencies are almost identical. For example in the broad sample
average relative capital and average relative efficiency are both 44 percent - or roughly double
actual average relative incomes. Hence, both capital gaps and efficiency gaps are very large: the
average Latin American country has less than half the capital (human and physical) per worker of
the US, and uses it less than half as efficiently.

Using the aggressive calibration, capital gaps are naturally larger, and efficiency gaps
correspondingly smaller. Nevertheless, even under this “ best-case scenario” for the view that
capital gaps are the key source of income gaps, average Latin American efficiency is at most 60
percent of the US level, still implying a vast efficiency gap.

In assessing this evidence, it is essential to bear in mind that efficiency gaps contribute to income
disparity both directly – as they mean that Latin America gets less out of its capital – and indirectly
– since much of the capital gap itself is likely due to diminished incentives to invest in equipment,
structure, schooling, and health caused by low efficiency. The consequences of closing the
efficiency gap would correspondingly be far reaching.

Explaining the Latin American efficiency gap is therefore a high priority both for scholars and for
policy makers. It is likely that this task will require firm-level evidence. Firm level evidence would
also be invaluable in checking the robustness of the development-accounting results, which are
subject to severe data-quality limitations.

   2. 2.       Conceptual Framework

The analytical tool at the core of development accounting is the aggregate production function.
The aggregate production function maps aggregate input quantities into output. The main inputs
considered are physical capital and human capital. The empirical literature so far has failed to
uncover compelling evidence that aggregate input quantities deliver large external economies, so



                                                  35
it is usually deemed safe to assume constant returns to scale.49 Given this assumption, one can
express the production function in intensive form, i.e. by specifying all input and output quantities
in per worker terms. In order to construct counterfactual incomes a functional form is needed.
Existing evidence suggests that the share of capital in income does not vary systematically with
the level of development, or with factor endowments [Gollin (2002)]. Hence, most practitioners of
development accounting opt for a Cobb-Douglas specification. In sum, the production function for
country i is

                                                   y i = Ai k i hi1 ,           (1)

where y is output per worker, k is physical capital per worker, h is human capital per worker
(quality-adjusted labor), and A captures unmeasured/unobservable factors that contribute to
differences in output per worker.

The term A is subject to much speculation and controversy. Practitioners refer to it as total factor
productivity, technology, a measure of our ignorance, etc. Here I will refer to it as “ efficiency” .
Countries with a larger A are countries that, for whatever reasons, are more efficient users of their
physical and human capital.

The goal of development accounting is to assess the relative importance of efficiency differences
and physical and human capital differences in producing the differences in income per worker we
observe in the data. To this end, one constructs counterfactual incomes, or capital bundles,

                                                  ~
                                                  y i = k i hi1 ,               (2)

which are based exclusively on the observable inputs. Differences in these capital bundles are then
compared to income differences. If counter-factual and actual income differences are similar, then
observable factors are able to account for the bulk of the variation in income. If they are quite
different, then differences in efficiency are important. Establishing how significant efficiency
differences are has important repercussions both for research and for policy.
                                                                    ~
In order to construct the counterfactual y s we need to construct measures of ki and hi , as well as
to calibrate the capital-share parameter  . Standard practice sets the latter to 0.33, and we stick to
this practice throughout. In the appendix I present robustness checks using a larger capital share,
i.e. 0.40. This higher share implies somewhat larger capital gaps and somewhat smaller efficiency
gaps, though the main message of the paper is unchanged.50



49
   See, e.g. Iranzo and Peri (2009) for a recent review and some new evidence on the quantitative significance of
schooling externalities.
50
   There may well be significant heterogeneity among Latin American countries, and, more importantly, between Latin
America and the benchmark rich country, in the value of  . However, it is not known how to perform development-
accounting with country-specific capital shares. This is because measures of the capital stock are indices, so that a
requirement for the exercise to make sense is that the results should be invariants to the units in which k is measured.

Now   k /k 
        i   j
                
                    is unit-invariant, but   k
                                              i
                                                  i      
                                                       /k j j      is not.

                                                                              36
The rest of this section focuses on the measurement of physical and human capital.

Existing development-accounting calculations measure k exclusively on the basis of reproducible
capital (equipment and structures). But in most developing countries, where agricultural and
mining activities still represent large shares of GDP, natural capital (land, timber, ores, etc.) is also
very important. Caselli and Feyrer (2007) show that omitting natural capital can lead to very
significant understatements of total capital in developing countries relative to developed ones.
Hence, this study will measure k as the sum of the value of all reproducible and natural capital.

Human capital per worker can vary across countries as a result of differences in knowledge, skills,
health, etc. The literature has identified three variables that vary across countries which may
capture significant differences in these dimensions: years of schooling [e.g., Klenow and
Rodriguez-Clare (1997), Hall and Jones (1999)], health [Weil (2007)], and cognitive skills [e.g.
Hanushek and Woessmann (2012a)]. In order to bring these together, we postulate the following
model for human capital:

                                    hi = exp(  s si   r ri   t ti ).            (3)

In this equation, si measures average years of schooling in the working-age population, ri is a
measure of health in the population, and t i is a measure of cognitive skills. The coefficients  s ,
 r , and t map differences in the corresponding variables into differences in human capital.51

The model in (3) is attractive because it offers a strategy for calibration of the parameters  s ,  r
, and t . In particular, combining (1), (3), and an assumption that wages are proportional to the
marginal productivity of labor, we obtain the “ Mincerian” formulation

                               log ( wij ) =  i   s s ij   r rij   t t ij ,         (4)

where w ij ( s ij , etc.) is the wage (years of schooling, etc.) of worker j in country i , and i is a
country-specific term52. This suggests that using within-country variation in wages, schooling,
health, and cognitive skills one might in principle identify the coefficients  . In practice, there
are severe limitations in following this strategy, that we discuss after introducing the data.




51
   Some caveats as to the validity of the functional form assumption in (3) are in order. There is considerable micro
and macro evidence against the assumption that workers with different years of schooling are perfect substitutes [e.g.
Caselli and Coleman (2006)]. In this paper I abstract from the issue of imperfect substitutability. Caselli and Ciccone
(2013) argue that consideration of imperfect substitution is unlikely to reduce the estimated importance of efficiency
gaps.
52
   Note that this approach to the measurement of human capital is robust to a broad range of deviations from perfect
competition. In particular, the wage does not need to equal the marginal productivity of labour, but just be proportional
to it. Many models of monopsony in labor markets and monopolistic competition have this property

                                                                 37
     2. 3.       Data

We work with three samples, broad, narrow, and intermediate. The broad data set contains all Latin
American countries for which we have data for y , k , s , and r , all observed in 2005. There are
22 such countries (excluded are Barbados, Cuba, and Paraguay, for which we have no capital data).
The other two samples add alternative measures of t . The trade-off is that one measure offers a
more credible comparison with the benchmark high-income country, but is only available for 9
Latin-American economies. The more dubious but more plentiful measure is available for 15
countries. All but one of the countries in the narrow sample are also in the intermediate sample
(Trinidad and Tobago is the exception). The dataset also includes data from the USA, which we
use as the benchmark rich country.

Per-worker income yi is variable rgdpwok from version 7.1 of the Penn World Tables (PWT71).
Figure 2.1 shows per-worker income in each country in the broad sample relative to the USA, or
 yi /yUS . Countries that are also included in the narrow sample are in black, and countries that are
in the intermediate but not the narrow sample are in grey. With the exception of Trinidad and
Tobago, all Latin America countries have per-worker incomes well below 40 percent of the US
level, sometimes much below. The horizontal lines show the three (unweighted) sample averages,
indicating that the average country is only one fifth as productive as the USA.53

  In the narrow sample the average is higher due to the disproportionate weight of Trinidad and Tobago. Labor-
force weighted averages are reported in Table 7.1.

World Bank (2012) presents cross-sectional estimates of the total capital stock, k , as well as its
components, for various years. The total capital stock includes reproducible capital, but also land,
timber, mineral deposits, and other items that are not included in standard national-account-based
data sets. The basic strategy of the World Bank team that constructed these data begins with
estimates of the rental flows accruing from different types of natural capital, which are then
capitalized using fixed discount rates. I construct the total capital measure by adding the variables
producedplusurban and natcap.

Measuring the total capital stock as the sum of natural and reproducible capital amounts to an
assumption of perfect substitutability between the two capital types. To evaluate this assumption,
it is useful to conceive of GDP as the sum of the added values of the primary sector (essentially
agriculture and mining), where natural capital is heavily used, and of the secondary and tertiary
sectors (essentially manufacturing and services), where natural capital plays virtually no role.
Then, perfect susbstitutability is most defensible if the primary sector uses little or no reproducible
capital, or if the primary sector is a relatively small share of the economy. Admittedly, the former
assumption is not particularly credible, while the latter clearly does not apply to the typical Latin
American country. Intuitively, though, this should result in an overestimate of the capital gap, and
consequently an underestimate of the efficiency gap. If the primary sector is large, and
reproducible capital plays a significant role in the primary sector, reproducible capital and natural
capital should boost each other's productivity, resulting in a larger capital bundle than in the case
they are perfect substitutes. In other words, by assuming perfect substitutability we are
underestimating the total contribution of capital more in poorer, Latin American, countries than in
the richer, benchmark country.

Figure 2.2 shows total (reproducible plus natural) capital per worker estimates for Latin American
countries relative to the US, ki /kUS . The average Latin American worker is endowed with
approximately one fifth of the physical capital of the average US worker.

For average years of schooling in the working-age population (which is defined as between 15 and
99 years of age) I rely on Barro and Lee (2013). Note from equation (3) that for the purposes of
constructing relative human capital hi /hUS what is relevant is the difference in years of schooling
si  sUS . The same will be true for r and t . Accordingly, in Figure 2.3. I plot schooling-year
differences with the USA in 2005. Latin American workers have always at least three year less
schooling than American ones, and five on average.

As a proxy for the health status of the population, r , Weil (2007) proposes using the adult survival
rate. The adult survival rate is a statistic computed from age-specific mortality rates at a point in
time. It can be interpreted as the probability of reaching the age of 60, conditional on having
reached the age of 15, at current rates of age-specific mortality. Since most mortality before age

                                                    40
60 is due to illness, the adult survival rate is a reasonably good proxy for the overall health status
of the population at a given point in time. Relative to more direct measures of health, the advantage
of the adult survival rate is that it is available for a large cross-section of countries. I construct the
adult survival rate from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Specifically, this is the
weighted average of male and female survival rates, weighted by the male and female share in the
population.

          mean. Heavy solid line: narrow sample mean.

In Figure 2.4., I plot adult survival rate differences with the USA. Survival rate probabilities are
lower in Latin America than in the US, but perhaps not vastly so. On average, Latin American 15-
year olds are only 4 percentage points less likely to reach the age of 60 than US 15-year olds.54

Following work by Gundlach, Rudman, and Woessman (2002), Woessman (2003), Jones and
Schneider (2010) and Hanushek and Woessmann (particularly 2012a), we also wish to account for
differences in cognitive skills not already accounted for by years of schooling and health. The ideal
measure would be a test of average cognitive ability in the working population. Hanushek and
Zhang (2009) report estimates of one such test for a dozen countries, the International Adult
Literacy Survey (IALS), but only one of these is in Latin America (Chile).

As a fallback, I rely on internationally comparable test scores taken by school-age children. In the
narrow sample, I will use scores from a science test administered in 2009 to 15 year olds by PISA
(Program for International Student Assessment). There are in principle several other
internationally-comparable tests (by subject matter, year of testing, and organization testing) that

54
     The population-weighted mean survival rate in the broad sample is 0.85.

                                                          41
could be used in alternative to or in combination with the 2009 PISA science test. However there
would be virtually no gain in country coverage by using or combining with other years (the PISA
tests of 2009 are the ones with the greatest participation, and virtually no Latin American country
participated in other worldwide tests and not in the 2009 PISA tests).55 Focusing only on one test
bypasses potentially thorny issues of aggregation across years, subjects, and methods of
administration. Cross-country correlations in test results are very high anyway, and very stable
over time.56 Data on PISA test score results are from the World Bank’s Education Statistics.

Aside from the world-wide tests of cognitive skills used in the narrow sample, there are also two
“ regional” tests of cognitive skills that have been administered to a group of Latin American
countries: the first in 1997 by the Laboratorio Latinoamericano de Evaluación de la Calidad de
la Educación (LLECE), covering reading and math in the third and fourth grade; the second in
2006 by the Latin American bureau of the UNESCO, covering the same subjects in third and sixth
grade. These tests are described in greater detail in, e.g., Hanushek and Woessman (2012a), who
also argue that these tests may better reflect within Latin-American differences in cognitive skills.

From the perspective of this study, the main attraction of these alternative measures of cognitive
skills is that they cover a significantly larger sample. The biggest problem, of course, is that they
exclude the United States (or any high-income country) and so, on the face of it, they are unusable
for constructing counterfactual relative incomes. However, Hanushek and Woessman (2012a)
propose a methodology to “splice” the regional scores into their worldwide sample. While this
splicing involves a large number of assumptions that are difficult to evaluate, it is worthwhile to
assess the robustness of my results to these data.57

Needless to say measuring t by the above-described test scores is clearly very unsatisfactory, as
in most cases the tests reflect the cognitive skills of individuals who have not joined the labor force
as of 2005, much less those of the average worker. The average Latin American worker in 2005
was 36 years old, so to capture their cognitive skills we would need test scores from 1984.58
Implicitly, then, we are interpreting test-score gaps in current children as proxies for test scores
gaps in current workers. If Latin America and the US have experienced different trends in cognitive
skills of children since 1984 this assumption is problematic.




55
   The only exception is Belize, which participated in some of the reading tests administered by PIRLS (Progress in
International Reading Literacy Study).
56
   Repeating all my calculations using the PISA math scores yielded results that were virtually indistinguishable from
those using the science test.
57
   Hanushek and Woessman (2012a) splice the regional scores into world-wide scores that are themselves aggregates
of multiple waves and multiple subject areas - obtained with a methodology described in Hanushek and Woessman
(2012b).
58
   The method for estimating the average age of workers is described in footnote 25 of Caselli (2005).

The 2009 PISA science tests are reported on a scale from 0 to 1000, and they are normalized so
that the average score among OECD countries (i.e. among all pupils taking the test in this set of
countries) is (approximately) 500 and the standard deviation is (approximately) 100.59 The regional
scores are put on the PISA scale by Hanushek and Woessman’s splicing, so they can be directly
compared. Figure 2.5 shows test score differences t i  tUS for the narrow and intermediate
samples. Differences in PISA scores are very significant: the average Latin American student in
2009 shows cognitive skills that are below those of his US counterpart by about one standard
deviation of the OECD distribution of cognitive skills. Only Chile is a partial stand-out, with a
cognitive gap closer to one half of one standard deviation. Differences in Hanushek and
Woessman’s spliced regional tests are even more significant, with the average gap exceeding 1.5
standard deviations. Recall that the PISA scores are directly comparable between Latin American
and USA, while the spliced regional tests – while arguably giving a more accurate sense of within
Latin America differences – are less suitable for poor country-rich country comparisons. Hence,
the discrepancy in cognitive-skill gaps between the PISA and the regional scores implies that the
latter should be treated with caution.




59
   I say approximately in parenthesis because the normalization was applied to the 2006 wave of the test. The 2009
test was graded to be comparable to the 2006 one. Hence, it is likely that the 2009 mean (standard deviation) will have
drifted somewhat away from 500 (100) - though probably not by much. The PISA math and reading tests were
normalized in 2000 and 2003, respectively, so their mean and standard deviation are more likely to have drifted away
from the initial benchmark. This is one reason why I use the science test for my baseline calculations.

     2. 4.       Calibration

The last, and most difficult, step in producing counter-factual income gaps between US and Latin
America is to calibrate the coefficients  s ,  r , and t . As discussed, equation (4) indicates that,
using within country data on w , s , r , and t , one could in principle identify these coefficients by
running an extended Mincerian regression for log-wages. In implementing this plan, we are
confronted with (at least) two important problems.

The first problem is that one of the explanatory variables, the adult survival rate r , by definition
does not vary within countries. Estimating  r directly is therefore a logical impossibility. To
solve this problem Weil (2007) notices that, in the time series (for a sample of ten countries for
which the necessary data is available), there is a fairly tight relationship between the adult survival
rate and average height. In other words, he postulates ci =  c   c ri , where ci is average height
and the coefficient  c is estimated from the above-mentioned time series relation (he obtains a
coefficient of 19.2 in his preferred specification). Since height does vary within countries as well
as between countries, this opens the way to identifying  r by means of the Mincerian regression

                                       log ( wij ) =  i   s s ij   c cij   t t ij ,
where  r = c c .60

The second problem is that measures of t are not consistent at the macro and at the micro level. In
particular, while we do have micro data sets reporting both results from tests of cognitive skills
and wages, the test in question is simply a different test from the tests we have available at the
level of the cross-section of countries. Call the alternative test available at the micro level d . Once
again the solution is to assume a linear relationship di =  d ti . The difference with the case of
height-survival rate is that, as far as I know, there is no way to check the empirical plausibility of
this assumption. Given the assumed linear relationship, one can back out  d as the ratio of the
within country standard deviation of d ij and t ij . With  d at hand, one can back out t from the
modified Mincerian regression

                             log ( wij ) =  i   s s ij   c cij   d d ij ,             (5)
using t = d  d .

In choosing values for  s ,  c , and  d from the literature it is highly desirable to focus on
microeconomic estimates of equation (5) that include all three right-hand variables. This is because
 s , c , and d are well-known to be highly positively correlated.61 Hence, any OLS estimate of


60
   Needless to say if we had cross-country data on average height there would be no need to use the survival rate at
all.
61
   See, e.g., the literature review in Vogl (2014).


                                                              44
one of the coefficients from a regression that omits one or two of the other two variables will be
biased upward.62

A search of the literature yielded one and only one study reporting all three coefficients from
equation (5). Vogl (2014) uses the two waves (2002 and 2005) of the nationally-representative
Mexican Family Life Survey to estimate (5) on a subsample of men aged 25-65. In his study, w
is measured as hourly earnings, s as years of schooling, c is in centimeters, and d is the
respondent’s score on a cognitive-skill test administered at the time of the survey.63 The cognitive
skill measure is scaled so its standard deviation in the Mexican population is 1.64

The coefficients reported by Vogl are as follows (see his Table 4, column 7). The return to
schooling  s is 0.072, which can be plugged directly in equation (3). The “return to height”  c
is 0.013. Hence, the coefficient associated with the adult survival rate in (3) is 0.013 x 19.2 = 0.25,
where I have used Weil’s mapping between height and the adult survival rate. Finally, the reported
return to cognitive skills  d is 0.011. Since the standard deviation of d is one by construction,
and the standard deviation of the 2009 Science PISA test in Mexico is 77, the implied coefficient
on the PISA test for the purposes of constructing h is 0.011/77=0.00014.65

The coefficients in my baseline calibration are considerably lower than those used in other
development-accounting exercises. For schooling, applications usually gravitate towards the
“modal” Mincerian coefficient of 0.10. For the adult survival rate, Weil (2007) uses 0.65, on the
basis of considerably higher estimates of the returns to height than those reported by Vogl. For the
return to cognitive skills, Hanushek and Woessmann (2012a) advocate 0.002, which is more than
one order of magnitude larger than the value I derive from the Vogl’s estimates.66

The fact that the parameters calibrated on Vogl’s estimates are smaller than those commonly used
is consistent with the discussion above. In particular, the alternative estimates are often based on
regressions that omit one or two of the variables in (5), and are therefore upward biased. Another




62
   An alternative would be to use IV estimates of the  s, but instruments for the variables on the right hand side of
equation 5 are often somewhat controversial - especially for height and cognitive skills.
63
   The test is the short-form Raven’s Progressive Matrices Test.
64
   Needless to say there are aspects of Vogl’s treatment that imply the regressions he runs are not a perfect fit for the
conceptual framework of the paper. It may have been preferable for our purposes to include both men and women. He
also controls for ethnicity, age, and age squared, which do not feature in my framework. Finally, he notes that the
Raven’s core is a coarse measure of cognitive skills, giving raise to concerns with attenuation bias (more on this
below).
65
   Hanushek and Woessman’s splicing procedure implies that the same coefficient can be used for the regional tests
used in the intermediate sample. In particular, the relevant standard error is the average of the standard deviations of
Pisa science and math tests in Mexico, which is 80. Then we have 0.011/80 = 0.00014.
66
   This is based on Hanushek and Zhang (2009), who use the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) to estimate
the return to cognitive skills in a set of 13 countries. The value of 0.002 is the one for the USA.


                                                          45
consideration is that there is considerable cross-country heterogeneity in the estimates, and that
                                                                                                  , 68
researchers often focus on estimates from the USA, which are often larger.67

       average with regional-(PISA-) test correction.

On the other hand, Vogl’s regressions are admittedly estimated via OLS, and there is a real concern
with attenuation bias from measurement error. In order to gauge the sensitivity of my results to
possibly excessively low values of the calibration parameters due to attenuation bias, I will also
present results based on an “ aggressive” calibration, which uses a Mincerian return of 0.10, Weil’s
0.65 value for the mapping of the adult survival rate to human capital, and Hanushek and
Woessman’s 0.002 coefficient on the PISA test.69


67
   For example, in Hanushek and Zhang (2009), the estimated market return to cognitive skills varies (from minimum
to maximum) by a factor of 10! The estimate from the USA, which is used in Hanushek and Woessman (2012a) is the
maximum of this distribution.
68
   This is actually an issue with the capital share  as well. However, the issue there is less severe as observed capital
shares do not vary systematically with y , so it should be possible to ascribe the observed variation to measurement
error. In other words the patterns of variation in  do not necessarily raise the issue of model misspecification.
69
   As described above the Hanushek and Zhang estimate for the US comes from a test d different from t . In order to
go from their coefficient  d to the coefficient of interest t we need to multiply the former by the ratio of the
standard deviation of d US ,i to the standard deviation of tUS ,i . Since Hanushek and Zhang standardize the variable d ,
we just have to multiply by the inverse of the standard deviation of tUS ,i . But in the test we are using this is just 0.98,
so the correction would be immaterial use the same value both in the narrow and in the intermediate sample.

                                                            46
Figure 2.6 shows human-capital per worker estimates for Latin American countries relative to the
US, hi /hUS , under my baseline calibration. The full height of the bar shows the value of hi /hUS
when excluding cognitive skills, and is thus fully comparable across all countries in the figure. The
solid bars are the values when including cognitive skills. Irrespective of sample and cognitive-skill
correction the average Latin American worker is endowed with approximately 70 percent of the
human capital of the average US worker.

Figure 2.7 is analogous to Figure 2.6 but shows the aggressive calibration instead. Not
Surprisingly, using the aggressive calibration results in significantly lower relative human capital
for Latin America, since the impact of differentials in schooling, health, and cognitive skills is
magnified. Human capital gaps become particularly large when including the cognitive-skill
corrections.

In the large sample we lack cognitive skill information for more than half of the countries, so we
set  t = 0 . Figure 2.8 shows each country’s counterfactual income relative to the US (relative
capital) in 2005, ~y /~
                     iy , as well as the relative incomes y /y already shown in Figure 2.1. In
                         US                                           i   US
particular, for each country the overall height of the bar is relative capital, while the height of the
shaded bar is relative income.

As is apparent, there is a lot of variation in relative capital, ranging from 20 percent to almost 70
percent. This reflects considerable heterogeneity in rates of physical and human-capital
accumulation among Latin American countries, as seen above. Sample means are between 44
percent (broad and intermediate sample) and 49 percent (narrow sample). This means that
observed distributions of physical and human capital are consistent with Latin American workers
being between 44 and 49 percent as productive as USA ones. We can interpret this measure as a
measure of the capital gap between Latin America and the US.

In Figure 2.9 we extend our calculations to include information on cognitive skills based on
worldwide PISA test scores. The sample size correspondingly drops to 9 countries. The effect of
including cognitive skills under my baseline calibration is virtually nil: the mean remains
unchanged at 0.49. This result is expected given the very small calibrated “ loading” on cognitive
skills implied by Vogl’s estimates. Very similar patterns emerge when using the regional
scores/intermediate sample, as seen in Figure 2.10.

   2.5.2.       “Aggressive” Calibration

My baseline calibration uses coefficients for mapping years of schooling, health, and cognitive
skills into human capital that, taken individually, are lower than those presented in other
contributions. In this section I explore the robustness to my results to more commonly-used values.
Hence, I set  s = 0.10 , r = 0.65, and  t = 0.002 .

      per worker. Dashed line: broad sample mean. Light solid line: intermediate sample mean. Heavy solid line:
      narrow sample mean.

Results from the large sample using this aggressive calibration are shown in Figure 2.11. Given
the larger coefficients, counterfactual incomes are necessarily smaller than under the baseline
calibration. Yet quantitatively the difference is not very large. Average relative capital drops to 40
percent, so still roughly double relative income.

Figure 2.12 shows the results from the aggressive calibration using the PISA test scores. Including
cognitive skills in the calculation of relative capital has a much bigger impact than under the
baseline, because the coefficient on cognitive skills is an order of magnitude larger. The average
counterfactual relative income falls to 40 percent, compared with 49 percent in the baseline
calibration (within the same narrow sample). This is a large gain in explanatory power of
observables. For many countries, the gap between relative income and relative capital shrinks
considerably.

Finally, Figure 2.13 reports the results from the aggressive calibration when using the regional test
scores. Recall that these tests tend to show even larger cognitive gaps with the US.
Correspondingly, using these tests in combination with the aggressive calibration leads to an even
better alignment between relative capital and relative income.

   2. 6.        Implications for Efficiency Gaps

We have seen that, depending on cognitive skill correction, counterfactual income ratios (relative
capital) in Latin America tend to be much larger than actual income ratios. This discrepancy
implies that Latin America suffers from an efficiency gap as much as it suffers from a capital gap.

We can quantify efficiency gaps by noting, from (1) and (2), that

                                                  Ai   y /y
                                                     = ~i ~US .
                                                 AUS yi /yUS

Hence, Latin American efficiency gaps can be directly gleaned from Figures (2.8)-(2.13) by simply
dividing the height of the shaded bars by the overall height of the bars.

In Table 2.1, I report the sample averages of the implied efficiency gaps, for the various cognitive
skill correction - calibration combinations. For completeness I also report the corresponding
averages for relative income and relative capital, as well as labor-force weighted means.

Using the baseline calibration, average relative capital and average relative efficiency are almost
identical, irrespective of sample/cognitive skill correction/weighting. One way to put this is that
capital gaps and efficiency gaps contribute equally to Latin American income gaps. When using
the aggressive calibration, the relative importance of capital gaps increases, particularly when
adding the cognitive-skill corrections. Still, even under the most aggressive scenario average Latin
American relative efficiency is only 60 percent of US efficiency.70

In order to fully appreciate the importance of these efficiency gaps it is crucial to note that, under
almost any imaginable set of circumstances, physical (specifically, reproducible) and human
capital accumulation respond to a country’s level of efficiency. The higher A the higher the
marginal productivity of capital, leading to enhanced incentives to invest in equipment and
structure, schooling, etc. While quantifying this effect is difficult, most theoretical frameworks
would lead one to expect it to be large. Hence, it is legitimate to conjecture that a significant
fraction of the capital gap may be due to the efficiency gap.71

     2. 7.        Implications and Conclusions

There is a large gap in income per worker between Latin America and the USA: Latin American
workers are only about one fifth as productive as workers from the United States. A development-
accounting calculation reveals that both capital gaps and efficiency gaps contribute to this overall
productivity gap. In particular, a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of observable physical and human
capital per worker is roughly in the order of 40 percent on average of the corresponding US level
(capital gap) – implying that the efficiency with which inputs are used in Latin America is in the
order of 50 percent of US levels (efficiency gap). Reducing this efficiency gap would reduce the

70
   In the narrow sample it is probably best to focus on the labor-force weighted results, as the unweighted ones give
disproportionate weight to Trinidad and Tobago.
71
   In principle, one might also argue for a reverse direction of causation, with larger physical and human-capital stocks
leading to higher efficiency. In particular, this would be true if the model was misspecified, and there were large
externalities. But as already mentioned the empirical literature has not to date uncovered significant evidence of
externalities in physical and human capital.

                                                          53
overall productivity gap both directly, by allowing Latin America to reap greater benefits from its
physical and human capital, and indirectly, since much of the capital gap is likely due to the
efficiency gap itself: closing the efficiency gap would stimulate investment at rates potentially
capable of closing the capital gap as well.

These conclusions are contingent on the quality of the underlying macroeconomic data. There is
growing concern about the quality and reliability of the PPP national-account figures in the Penn
World Tables and similar data sets [e.g. Johnson et al. (2013)]. Similar concerns apply, no doubt,
to our proxies for human capital as well (as already discussed particularly in the context of
cognitive skills). It is true that such concerns are most often voiced in the context of implied
comparisons of changes, especially over short time spans: cross-country comparisons of levels
reveal such gigantic differences (as seen above) that they seem unlikely to be entirely dominated
by noise. Still, exclusive reliance on these macro data is highly inadvisable.

Fortunately, it is also increasingly unnecessary. The increasing availability of firm level data sets,
particularly when matched with employee-level information (e.g. about schooling), provides an
opportunity to supplement the macro picture with microeconomic productivity estimates
comparable across countries.

The benefit of producing such micro productivity estimates is by no means limited to permitting
to check the robustness of conclusions concerning average capital and efficiency gaps - though
this benefit alone is sufficient to make such exercises worthwhile. An additional benefit is to
uncover information on the within country distribution of physical capital, human capital, and
efficiency. A relatively concentrated distribution would suggest that efficiency gaps are mostly
due to aggregate, macroeconomic factors that affect all firms fairly equally (e.g. impediment to
technology diffusion from other countries). A very dispersed distribution, with some firms close
to the world technology frontier, would be more consistent with allocative frictions that prevent
capital and labor to flow to the more efficient/talented managers.

More generally, firm-level data is likely to prove essential in the quest for the determinants of the
large efficiency gaps revealed by the development-accounting calculation. After all, (in-)efficiency
is – by definition – a firm-level phenomenon. Most of the most plausible possible explanations for
the efficiency gap are microeconomic in nature – whether it is about firms unable to adapt
technologies developed in more technologically-advanced countries, failures in the market for
managers and/or capital, frictions in the matching process for workers, etc. It seems implausible
that evidence for or against these mechanisms can be found in the macro data. Yet understanding
the sources of the Latin American efficiency gap is unquestionably the most urgent task for those
who want to design policies aimed at closing the Latin American income gap.

   2. 8.       Appendix: Alternative capital share

Expanding on previous work by Gollin (2002), Bernanke and Gurkaynak (2001) present estimates
of the labor share in income for a cross-section of countries. Using the method which yields the
largest number of observations, they produce estimates for 13 countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean. In this group of 13, the average labor share is 0.62, implying a capital share of 0.38 -
larger than the standard development-accounting benchmark. An alternative method, which
Bernanke and Gurkaynak consider more accurate, yields estimates for 9 LATAC countries,
averaging, 0.61.

These estimates prompt me to explore the robustness of the results to an alternative choice of α,
namely 0.4. Before doing so, it is important to note that the US estimate of the capital share implied
by the figures in Bernanke and Gurkaynak is actually 0.29. Hence, while using 0.4 may more
accurately reflect the relative contributions of physical and human capital in Latin America, it
greatly distorts their relative contributions in the benchmark country. Unfortunately, as discussed
in footnote 4, I don't know of a method of doing development accounting that allows country-
specific capital shares, and preserves the unit-invariance of the results to the measurement of
capital. Perhaps 0.33 is a reasonable compromise, after all.

Another reason to be weary of the 0.4 figure is that deviations from perfect competition, both in
labor and product markets, are likely to weigh more heavily in Latin American countries than in
the USA. Both monopsonistic labor markets and monopolistic product markets are likely to result
in a labor share in income that is less than the elasticity of output to labor, i.e. our technological
parameter 1- α. Of course some of the difference with the USA may be due to true underlying
technological differences, or to differences in the sectoral composition of the economy. But the
presence of deviations from perfect competition should imply that 0.4 is too high an estimate of α
even for Latin American countries.

With these caveats, Table 2.2 presents the results for relative capital and relative efficiency when
using α =0.4 in the calibration. Compared to the case where α =0.33, capital gaps increase (i.e.
relative capital falls) and efficiency gaps correspondingly shrink (the relative efficiency of Latin
America goes up). The reason for this is that the gap in physical capital between Latin America
and the US is larger than the gap in human capital. Hence, when more weight is given to physical
capital, the overall capital stock of Latin America drops, decreasing the role for efficiency gaps in
accounting for income differences. Even so, relative efficiency only increases by 4 or 5 percentage
points, depending on calibration and sample. The big picture of large efficiency gaps remains
unchanged.

   3. Reconciling Micro- and Macro-Based Estimates of Technology
      Adoption Lags in a Model of Endogenous Technology Adoption
       Maya Eden and Ha Nguyen

   3. 1.       Introduction

There is a large and persistent income gap between countries in Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC) and the United States (US). In the year 2000, average income in LAC was only 23 percent
of the average income in the US. Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is among the leading factors of
the observed income gap. TFP in LAC, measured as the Solow residual after carefully accounting
for inputs, is about half of that of the US (Caselli, 2013).

LAC’s technology backwardness is being debated as one of the key factors that explain this large
TFP gap. To explain to what extent technology backwardness matters, it is important to precisely
estimate the technology adoption lags between LAC and the U.S.—the technology frontier. A slow
adoption lag would indicate that technology backwardness is indeed the problem. On the other
hand, a faster adoption lag would point to other factors, such as institutions and misallocation of
resources (along the line of Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). The two sets of issues have fundamentally
different policy implications. If technology adoption is key, the policy focus should be on
removing barriers to technology adoption (such as increasing international integration or
improving human capital). If institutions are more important, policies should aim to improve
domestic institutions and correcting the misallocation of resources.

The literature currently offers conflicting views about the speed of technology adoption in Latin
America. Micro-based evidence drawn from Comin and Hobijn (2010) suggests that adoption lags
at the technology level between the U.S. and Latin America are long – 20 years on average. An
adoption lag at the technology level is defined as the length of time between the invention and
eventual adoption of the technology. On the other hand, macro-based evidence from the work of
Akcigit, Alp, Eden and Nguyen (2014) (henceforth AAEN) suggests a much shorter lag. Based on
the TFP time series data and the assumption that any shock to TFP growth in the US that affects
the adopting countries (LAC) with a lag is a technology shock, they find that the lag is about only
8 years. Which number is right affects the debate about the role of technology adoption in LAC’s
convergence.

This paper argues that the two findings might be consistent, and for the purpose of explaining TFP
gap, the macro-based number is more relevant. We reconcile the two findings with two insights.
First, technologies tend to be adopted first in more productive firms. Since the first adopting firms
tend to be more productive, the productivity gains from the first technology adopters are relatively
larger than the productivity gains from later adopters. The macro-level adoption lag accounts for
this, by weighting technology adoptions by their respective productivity gains. The micro-level
adoption lag, in contrast, assigns equal weights to all adopters - thus, it is likely to be relatively
longer than the macro-level lag. Second, more effective technologies are likely to be adopted
faster. Technologies that improve productivity by more are likely to be adopted faster, as the return
to adoption is higher. This implies shorter lags associated with technologies that are more
productivity enhancing. The macro-level adoption lag focuses on aggregate productivity gains

                                                 59
from technology adoption, which is likely driven disproportionately by more productive
technologies. In contrast, the micro-level adoption lag weighs technologies equally, and is thus
likely to be longer. We discuss this disparity in a model with endogenous technology adoption, in
which (a) the most productivity-enhancing technologies are adopted first, and (b) production units
who have the largest productivity gains from adopting new technologies are the first to adopt. We
illustrate that reasonable parameters can generate the observed differences between the micro- and
macro-based estimates of technology adoption lags.

The model suggests that the macro-based estimate by AAEN can be consistent with the micro-
based estimate by Comin and Hobijn (2010). However, when it comes to explaining the TFP gap,
the macro estimate is more appropriate because it works directly on the TFP. AAEN’s result
therefore is relevant to argue that technology adoption lags at the TFP level are short—about 8
years. AAEN’s result implies that other factors such as institutions remain the sticking points for
lack of convergence between LAC and the U.S.’s income.

The paper is organized as follows: section 3.2 revisits in details the micro and macro-based
evidence. Section 3.3 lays out a model to reconcile the two estimates. Section 3.4 is a numerical
illustration of the model. Section 3.5 concludes.

   3. 2.       Micro- and macro-based technology adoption lags in Latin America

In this section, we discuss the details of the micro and macro-based evidence for the technology
adoption lags in Latin America. In particular, we analyze the CHAT dataset constructed by Comin
and Hobjin (2009) for the micro-based evidence, and go into details the results obtained by AAEN
for the macro-based evidence.

   3. 2. 1.    Micro-based Evidence from the CHAT dataset

Comin and Hobijn (2010) estimate the diffusion of 15 technologies in 166 countries over the last
two centuries to show that in general, countries take a long time to adopt new technologies: on
average, countries have adopted technologies 45 years after their invention. However there is a
substantial variation across technologies. Recent technologies are adopted faster than old ones.
Figure 3.1 is borrowed from Comin and Hobijn (2010) to illustrate this fact.

We replicate Comin and Hobijn (2010)’s adoption lags for the U.S. and Latin America. Table 3.1
shows the average adoption lags -- the length of time between the invention and the eventual
adoption of the technologies-- for the U.S., Latin America. On average, the U.S. takes about 19.8
years to fully adopt a new technology, while Latin America takes about 40 years. This means that
Latin America is about 21 years behind the U.S. in adopting new technologies.

For older technologies, Latin America lags quite far behind the U.S. in adoption. For example, for
Cars and Electricity, Latin America is 23 and 31 years behind the U.S. respectively. However, for
more recent technologies, such as personal computers (PCs) or internet, the adoption lag gaps are
much smaller. Latin America is 7.8 and 4.3 years behind the U.S. for the two technologies,
respectively.

How do adoption lags vary between Latin American countries? Table A3.2 in the appendix shows
the adoption lags for individual Latin American countries and for individual technologies. Within
each technology, the adoption lags do vary across countries. It is expected that there is a negative
association between adoption lags and countries’ levels of development. The association can go
both ways. Richer countries might have less obstacles and higher incentives that encourage
technology adoptions, hence shorter adoption lags for them. On the other hand, faster technology
adoptions enable the countries to grow faster and reach a higher level of development. We pick
the most two arguably influential technologies-- electricity and personal computers-- to check if
there are significant relationships between the level of development and adoption lags. Indeed, this
is the case (see Figure 3.2).

   3. 2. 2.    Macro-based Evidence from AAEN

AAEN develop a methodology to estimate the adoption lags between a technology frontier and
subsequent technology adopters, based on aggregate macro data such as TFP and output. An
advantage of this approach is that it can be agnostic about which technologies are important. Unlike
the approach based on micro data that has to necessarily assume a mapping between the prevalence
of specific technologies and aggregate productivity, the macro approach does not to make a stance
about which technology should be the focus. They find that Latin America’s technology adoption
is about 8 years behind the U.S.

The identifying assumption is that any shock to productivity growth in the frontier country (the
US) that affects the adopting countries (LAC) with a lag is a technology shock. The technological
component is then used to study the effects of a technology shock on TFP growth in LAC, both in
terms of timing and in terms of magnitude. In other words, while non-technology shocks (e.g.,
demand shocks) may be contemporaneously correlated across countries, technology shocks are
likely to have a lagged effect on TFP growth in the adopting countries.

In particular, the framework used in AAEN (2014) is as follows. Denote Ai,t as a country’s TFP at
time t. Ai,t consists of a technology component Xi,t and a non-technology component Zi.t:




The non-technology component, Zi.t is a catch-all phrase that includes all aspects of the economy
that affect measured TFP, excluding technology. For example, Zi,t includes misallocation,
competition, as well as policies that may distort the efficient use of factors. In log forms, TFP is
written as follows:



There is one country that is identified as the frontier, and the rest of the countries are identified as
adopters. We will denote the frontier economy us and the adopting countries lac. Technology
growth in the frontier represents the growth of the frontier technology. In adopting countries, a
technological innovation may affect TFP growth with some lag, reflecting the possibility of
learning and adoption frictions. Thus, current technology growth in adopting countries is a function
of current and lagged values of the technological progress in the frontier (e.g., growth in LAC
today may reflect technological innovation in the US several years ago, as the technology is
adopted with some delay). They assume that this function takes the following linear form:




Note that the sum            has the interpretation of the long-run adoption rate: an innovation in
the technological frontier today will have a contemporaneous effect of λ0, an effect of λ1 in the


                                                  63
next period, and so on. For further details about the estimation, please refer to AAEN (2014). Here
we will show the results only.

The left panel of Figure 3.3 represents the estimated marginal adoption rates (λj), and the right
panel represents the estimated cumulative adoption rates (        ). The estimation suggests that
the bulk of technology adoption happens at an 8 year lag. The point estimate suggests that
technological innovations in the frontier have a somewhat smaller effect on productivity in LAC:
the point estimate of the infinite sum                   is about 0.8, suggesting that a 1 percent
improvement in technology in the US increases long-run productivity in LAC by only 0.8 percent.
However, it is important to note that the 90 percent confidence interval cannot reject full adoption
in the long run (and in fact, after 8 years). In this case, technological innovations in the US have
the same effect on TFP in LAC, with an 8 year lag.

They also conduct the analysis by (a) including each country in LAC as a separate adopting
country, and (b) estimating the marginal adoption rates by industry. These extensions allow for the
sequence of marginal adoption rates to differ across countries and across industries. However,
while there is some variation in the results, they broadly confirm the findings on the aggregate
level.

   intervals

The results are presented in Figure 3.4. The results are highly consistent with those obtained with
the LAC aggregate. For most countries in LAC (12 out of 19), the point estimates suggest full
adoption of technologies after 8 years at most. While there is some variations across countries, the
variation is not statistically significant in the sense that full adoption after 8 years is within the 90
percent confidence interval for all countries in our sample.

At the industry level, they proxy measured productivity growth with growth in value added per
worker by industry, using the value added in constant prices from the Groningen Growth and
Development Centre 10-sector database for LAC countries and the US. Note that for LAC
countries, only 9 sectors are available. Data is available from 1950- 2005. They estimate for each
industry separately, using a LAC weighted average in which weights are given by real value added
in each industry. The results are presented in Figure 3.5. Broadly, the results at the aggregate level
are consistent with the industry-level results, in the sense that full adoption within 12 years (as
well as 0.8 long-run adoption) fall within the confidence intervals of each of the industry-level
results.




                                                        65
However, there is some interesting variation across industries, both in the point estimates and in
the confidence intervals. For example, manufacturing - a sector which is widely viewed as a "fast"
adopter - delivers point estimates suggesting full adoption after 8 years, with a relatively tight
confidence interval. Mining, a sector with significant foreign presence, seems to exhibit faster
adoption, with the bulk of adoption occurring at a 1 year lag (however, it should be noted that the
magnitude of long-run adoption is rather imprecisely estimated, though statistically significant).
On the other hand, agriculture sees longer adoption lags.

The differences between the micro evidence and macro evidence are quite clear. The micro
evidence suggests an average of 21 years lags between LAC and the U.S. in terms of technology
adoption, while the macro evidence is quite consistent at 8 years. There is a strong variation across
LAC countries from the micro evidence, but it is not as clear from the macro evidence. On the
other hand, both macro evidence and micro evidence point to some adoption heterogeneities across
sectors and technologies.

   3. 3.       Model

In this section we present a model to reconcile the two findings. We consider a simplified model
in which capital is the only input of production. The economy is endowed with a unit measure of
production units, each with a single unit of capital; for simplicity, we abstract away from capital
accumulation.

Production units are heterogeneous with respect to the extent that they can benefit from
technology. Denoting the stock of technology in production unit x by Tx, the output of production
unit x is given by:




Note that, by assumption, kx=1 for all x. Technology and capital are strongly complementary; thus,
the amount of technology demanded by the firm is bounded by the amount of its capital. In this
formulation, production units with higher levels of x are those who benefit more from technology.

Technology adoption is costly. For simplicity, it will be useful to think of this cost as a “user fee”
(that may include, for example, royalties for the inventor of the technology). The cost of adopting
a unit of technology is p. The firm's profits are therefore given by:




The production unit's optimization problem is:




The solution to the production unit's problem is trivial: if p>x, it is optimal to choose Tx=0. If p<
x, it is optimal to choose Tx=1.

The distribution of production units is given by a pdf f(x), with support in [0,∞) (in other words, it
is assumed that all production units weakly benefit from technology).

Note that the distribution f(x) is a joint characteristic of production units and the technology. It
captures the extent to which a specific technology improves productivity in a specific firm. Thus,
different technologies will typically be associated with different distributions of x.

Dynamics. Time evolves continuously and is indexed t. There are two countries: a “frontier”
country (f) and an adopting country (a). At t=0, there is are two technological innovations, indexed
1 and 2, associated with distributions f1 and f2 respectively. It will be useful to assume that
technology 1 is more effective than technology 2, in the sense that the distribution f1 stochastically
dominates the distribution f2. In other words, the productivity gains from adopting technology 1
are greater, on average, than the productivity gains from adopting technology 2. We will assume
for simplicity that the adoption costs p are the same across technologies.


                                                 67
In the frontier country, it is costless to adopt technologies, and pf,t=0 for all t; thus all production
units adopt the technology instantaneously. In the adopting country, the price of adoption, p, falls
over time according to:




For some λ>0. In the frontier country, the price of adoption is always 0; thus all production units
in the frontier country immediately adopt the technology. To abstract away from strategic delays
in adoption (due to the anticipation of a falling price), it is convenient to assume that the adoption
cost p must be paid in each period that the technology is used.

Equilibrium. At any time t, all production units with x> pt purchase the technology. Aggregate
output is therefore given by:




Micro and macro adoption lags. Of course, in this framework, technologies are never fully
adopted in finite time, since there are always some production units (with x close to 0) for which
adoption is too costly. It is therefore useful to define adoption lags with respect to almost-full
adoption rather than full adoption. Specifically, we will consider some small ε>0 and define
adoption lags as follows. The technology-specific micro-level adoption lag, lmicro, is defined as the
time elapsed until the difference between the technology stock in the adopting country and the
technology stock in the frontier country (which is always 1) is less than ε. The technology-specific
micro adoption lag is then:




Let l1micro and l2macro be the technology-specific micro-adoption lags associated with technologies
1 and 2, respectively. The (aggregate) micro-level adoption lag, Lmicro, is then defined as the simple
average of the technology-specific micro adoption lags:




Note that, in this framework, aggregate output is the same as aggregate productivity, since capital
is the only input of production and is in fixed supply. Thus, the macro-level adoption lag is defined
as the elapsed time necessary for the output difference between the adopting country and the
frontier country to be less than ε. Formally, define      as:




                                                  68
The macro adoption lag is the time elapsed until a production unit with           finds it optimal to
adopt the technology:




Note that the micro-level adoption lag and the macro-level adoption lag may be very different,
depending on the distribution of firms. Specifically, the macro lag is typically shorter than the
micro lag, for two reasons:

   1. Technologies are adopted first in production units in which they are relatively more
      effective. Thus, the productivity gains from the first technology adoptions are relatively
      larger relative to the productivity gains from later adoptions. The macro-level adoption lag
      accounts for this, by weighting technology adoptions by their respective productivity gains.
      The micro-level adoption lag, in contrast, assigns equal weights to all adoptions - thus, it
      is likely to be relatively longer than the macro-level lag.

   2. More effective technologies are likely to be adopted faster. Technologies that improve
      productivity by more are likely to be adopted faster, as production units are more willing
      to pay the adoption costs. This implies shorter lags associated with technologies that are
      more productivity enhancing. The macro-level adoption lag focuses on aggregate
      productivity gains from technology adoption, which is likely driven disproportionately by
      more productive technologies. In contrast, the micro-level adoption lag weighs
      technologies equally, and is thus likely to be longer.

This framework illustrates that, when technology adoption is costly and the decision to adopt
technology is related to its effectiveness, macro-level adoption lags will tend to be shorter than
micro-level adoption lags. The next section offers a simple numerical illustration of this principle,
with parameters chosen to match key features of micro- and macro-level adoption lags in LAC.

   3. 4.       A numerical illustration

This section proposes a simple numerical illustration of the model that admits to the following
features which are roughly consistent with the patterns of technology adoption in LAC:

   1. A 20 year (aggregate) micro-level adoption lag
   2. Some technologies adopted within approximately 10 years (e.g., Internet) and some
      technologies adopted within approximately 30 years (e.g., electricity)
   3. An 8 year macro-level adoption lag
   4. No adoption within the first 8 years, and almost-full adoption after 8 years

Consider an economy with two technologies, 1 and 2, and the following distributions of technology
effectiveness. There are two types of production units. A measure δi of production units have a
value of upper bar xi, and the remaining measure 1-δi have a value of xi<bar(xi).



                                                 69
The adoption patterns do not uniquely pin down δi and xi. In what follows, we present two
examples: one in which the difference between micro- and macro-adoption lags is driven entirely
by differences in technology effectiveness across technologies, and one in which the difference is
driven entirely by differences in technology effectiveness across production units.

Example 1: differences across technologies. As a first example, consider an environment in
which there is no heterogeneity across production units. For technology i to be adopted after ti
years, it must be the case that:



Thus, to match the micro adoption lags, we need to match:




Note that the micro-level adoption lag is the average of 10 and 30, which is 20. For the macro level
adoption lag to be 10, t must be the case that the productivity gains from technology 2 are
negligible:




Choosing ε=0.001, the above holds, for example, for x1=0.5x2:




Solving for λ:




Substituting in yields x1= 0.7 and x2=0.35.

We have thus constructed an example in which heterogeneity across technologies in terms of the
productivity gains that they generate resulted in a difference between micro and macro adoption
lags that is consistent with the experience of LAC.

Example 2: differences across production units. In this second example, we focus on the role
of heterogeneity across production units in generating a difference between the micro- and macro
technology adoption lag. For this purpose, we abstract away from differences across technologies
and simplify by assuming a single technology that has a micro adoption lag of Lmicro=20 and a
macro adoption lag of Lmacro=10.

                                                70
To construct this example, note that the following conditions must hold:




The first equation states that the micro-adoption lag is given by the time elapsed until all production
units adopt the technology. The second equation states that the macro-adoption lag is given by the
time elapsed until the first δ production units adopt the technology; thus, the macro-adoption lag
is driven by the most productive uses of the technology, while the micro-adoption lag is driven by
the least productive use of the technology. The third and fourth equations state that the adoption
lags of the first δ adopters and the last 1- δ adopters should be 10 and 20 years, respectively,
consistent with the pre-specified micro- and macro-level adoption lags.

Note that, given ε=0.001, these equations have four unknowns: δ, λ, and x. Thus, since the first
two equations are inequality constraints, there may be infinite solutions. We will focus on one
possible solution. We will assume that the first inequality constraint holds with equality, and thus
δ =1-ε=0.999. Further, we will assume that x=0.5 , and verify that the second constraint holds:



Note that the inequality on the right hand side holds, because 0.999+0.0005<1 (in fact, it is easy
to see that this inequality would hold for any x<bar(x)). Thus, we can proceed in solving for λ by
imposing:




Yielding λ= 0.07,    = 0.5 and x= 0.25.

These examples illustrate that the observed differences between micro- and macro-level adoption
lags can be generated with reasonable heterogeneity across technologies or production units in
technology effectiveness, and that it is actually quite easy to reconcile the two estimates. However,
absent further data on the prices of technology adoption (that pins down λ) or the distribution of
technology effectiveness (that governs f), the parameters of the model are not uniquely pinned
down, and therefore the quantitative relevance of the model remains an open question.

   3. 5.       Conclusion

This paper proposes that endogenous technology adoption may account for the difference between
micro-level adoption lags - defined as the cross country differences in technology prevalence rates

                                                  71
- and macro-level adoption lags, defined as the productivity gap attributed to differences in
technology. When technology adoption is endogenous, the most effective technologies are adopted
first, and by their most effective users. Thus differences in technology prevalence rates tend to
overstate the differences in total factor productivity.

We illustrate numerically that, in a model with endogenous technology adoption, it is easy to
generate the observed disparity between micro-level adoption lags estimated by Comin and Hobijn
(2010), Comin and Mestieri (2014) and macro-level technology adoption lags estimated by AAEN.
This suggests that the two estimations are not inconsistent with one another; however, assessing
the consistency of the two estimates requires a better understanding of (a) the rate at which
technology adoption costs diminish over time and (b) the distribution of technology effectiveness
across production units. We hope to pursue this question further in future work.

    4. Structural change in Latin America: Does the allocation of resources
       across sectors, products, and technologies explain the region’s slow
       productivity growth?
        Marc Schiffbauer, Hania Sahnoun, and Jorge Thompson Araujo

The objective of this study is to assess the role of structural change in explaining the persistent
productivity gap between countries in Latin America and high income countries. Recent
contributions by Pages (2010) and McMillian and Rodrik (2011) find that labor flows between
sectors reduced aggregate labor productivity growth in several Latin American countries between
1990 and 2005. Against this background, this paper documents in detail the evolution of
employment, productivity, and technologies across sectors in Latin American and several
benchmark countries between 1960 and 2005 and uses newly available data to analyze the
robustness of the findings.

Theories of structural change show that the reallocation of activity across sectors accompanying
generalized balanced growth can originate from income effects generated by non-homothetic
preferences for different consumption goods (Pasinetti 1981, Kongsamut et al., 2001), changes in
relative prices due to technological progress that differs across sectors (Baumol, 1967; Ngai and
Pissarides, 2007), or changes in relative prices due to differences in capital intensities or elasticities
of substitution in production across sectors (Herrendorf et al., 2013a). In the following, we take
the source of structural change as given and analyze to which extent the sectoral reallocation
associated with structural change affected aggregate labor productivity growth in Latin America.
We note that structural change does not affect aggregate labor productivity growth in a neoclassical
closed economy framework assuming for instance perfect competition in output and factor
markets. In this framework, wages and labor flows between sectors fully adjust (e.g., after a sector
specific technology shock) equating marginal labor productivities across sectors.

In the presence of market failures, distortions, and rigidities (e.g., due to product or labor market
regulations) wages and labor flows do not fully adjust driving a wedge between marginal
productivities across sectors. While the impact of these distortions is difficult to measure, it is
likely that they are more severe in developing countries. For instance, Herrendorf and Valentinyi
(2012) find large sectoral TFP differences relative to the U.S. in agriculture, manufacturing, and
services. Moreover, the sectoral TFP gaps relative to the U.S. are larger in agriculture and services
than in manufacturing; the latter is consistent with Rodrik (2013) who finds unconditional
convergence in labor productivity in manufacturing despite the absence of aggregate convergence.
These findings imply that aggregate labor productivity is affected by the sectoral composition of
the economy (Duarte and Restuccia, 2010; Herrendorf et al., 2013b).

Echevarria (1997) and Duarte and Restuccia (2010) show that sectoral reallocation associated with
structural change can explain most of the cross-country differences in aggregate productivity
growth if countries are at different stages of the process of structural change. In particular, Duarte
and Restuccia (2010) reveal that during the process of structural change, the reallocation of labor
from agriculture to manufacturing leads to a catch up of aggregate productivity relative to the U.S.,
and the reallocation from manufacturing to services leads to a falling behind. Their results are
based on a three sector model whereby they do not distinguish between the large potential

                                                   75
differences in productivity and tradability across different service sub-sectors. In the following,
we also account for differences in labor productivity levels across different service sectors using
the Groningen ten-sector database.

Our findings show that the contribution of sectoral reallocation associated with structural change
to aggregate labor productivity growth in Latin America was relatively small and even negative in
some countries. In contrast, for some countries, within sector labor productivity growth was as
high as in East Asian countries. We also find substantial heterogeneity in both effects across Latin
American countries. The results suggest that it is important to account for differences in labor
flows and productivity across different service sub-sectors. For instance, we find that the
employment-intensive retail & wholesale trade sector expanded in all Latin American countries.
However, the performance of the sector, i.e. its relative level of productivity in the economy,
differed widely across countries. As a result, the reallocation of labor tended to increase aggregate
productivity growth in countries with a good sector performance (relative to other sector in the
economy) and tended to reduce growth in countries with relatively low levels of retail & wholesale
trade productivity.

Moreover, we find that employment shares in manufacturing declined in most Latin American
countries. This trend potentially slows down the region’s speed of convergence as it
counterweights the aggregate impact of unconditional convergence of labor productivity in
manufacturing with the rest of the world (Duarte and Restuccia, 2010; Rodrik, 2013). This finding
warrants a more detailed analysis of the evolution of manufacturing production structures across
Latin America countries. Against this background, we use the product space approach to compare
the patterns of specialization within manufacturing in Latin America and the Caribbean with other
regions of the world, especially East Asia. Despite limitations in the analysis72, it remains a
relevant analytical approach to capture differences in the evolution of manufacturing across
regions over the past 30 years. We find a lack of formation of production clusters among related
manufacturing products or industries relative to other regions. Finally, we analyze if
manufacturing firms in Latin American countries tend to be specialized in resource intensive,
idiosyncratic production technologies that are unrelated to processes or technologies applied in
large employment or technology intensive manufacturing clusters. Therefore, we apply the
recently developed “knowledge applicability” measure (Cai and Li, 2013) which captures the
scope for technology spillovers embodied in the technological specialization of firms in a given
country. In contrast to East Asian economies, we find that manufacturing firms in Latin America
tend to be specialized in idiosyncratic instead of general purpose technologies limiting the scope
for the adoption of foreign technologies and integration into global value chains.

     4. 1.       Labor Productivity and Structural Change in Latin America

Are there large productivity differences across sectors within Latin American countries?

Productivity growth in Latin America differed significantly between sectors of the economy.
Figure 4.1 (left) shows that productivity growth in service sectors was lagging behind agriculture
and manufacturing. Since 1970 labor productivity in agriculture, public utilities, and mining grew

72
  Trade data is only a proxy for the productive structure of an economy, and in some cases can substantially deviate
from actual sectoral contributions to GDP.

                                                        76
faster than in other sectors of the economy. After the period of import substitution policies and the
debt crisis, labor productivity in 1990-2005 grew in the manufacturing sector by about two percent
annually. However, regional labor productivity in services stagnated during the same period and
even declined in several countries. Figure 4.1 (right) illustrates that among the large sectors in
terms of employment,73 the highest labor productivity growth was observed in agriculture,
manufacturing, and transportation. However, labor moved from agriculture and manufacturing to
the services sectors with the lowest productivity growth such as retail & wholesale trade,
government services, and finance, real estate & business services.

The distribution of productivity growth across sectors does not appear to reflect a process of
convergence in productivity levels between sectors. Among others, McMillian and Rodrik
(2011) or Herrendorf and Valentinyi (2012) find stark differences in productivity levels across
sectors in developing countries while productivity levels across sectors in high income countries
are typically minor reflecting the outcome of past structural change. That is, the latter has been
interpreted to signify an equilibrium balanced growth path in high income countries whereby initial
productivity differences across sectors have been marginalized over time as labor moved to the
sectors with the highest marginal productivity equalizing productivity levels.74 Thus, market forces
in developing countries should re-allocate resources to the sectors with the highest marginal
productivity. Instead, the distribution of productivity growth across sectors in Figure 4.1 suggests
that the forces of labor reallocations across sectors are imperfect in the region implying the
prevalence of market failures and distortions: retail trade, construction, and government services,
which are typically relatively low productivity sectors in developing countries, had the lowest
productivity growth rates since 1970 but increased their employment shares significantly in most

73
   That is, excluding mining and utilities sectors which also suffer from methodological issues related to their capital
intensity. See footnote on page 5 for more detailed notes on methodology.
74
   Structural change can be regarded as a convergence concept towards a long term equilibrium with comparable
marginal productivity levels across sectors.


                                                          77
countries. This is counterbalanced, however, by strong productivity growth and declining labor
shares in agriculture which is often the sector with the lowest labor productivity level. In line with
Pages (2010), Herrendorf and Valentinyi (2012) and others, the evidence indicates that there exist
substantial differences in labor productivity levels and growth across sectors within Latin
American countries.75

The increase in the employment shares of lower productivity sectors can potentially explain
Latin America’s low aggregate productivity growth. Structural change is defined as the
reallocation of input factors between sectors with different productivity.76 In practice, the analysis
is reduced to the re-allocation of labor since time series data of capital stocks at the more detailed
sector level are typically not available for developing countries.77 Given the relatively large
differences in productivity levels across sectors within countries in the region, the increase in
employment shares of lower productivity sectors can help explain low aggregate productivity
growth and hence the lack of income convergence despite the successful technological catch-up
of individual firms or industries in Latin America.78 Therefore, we aim to extent the work of
McMillian and Rodrik (2011) documenting in detail the evolution of employment and productivity
across sectors in nine Latin American and several benchmark countries between 1960 and 2005.
In particular, we decompose labor productivity into a within component measuring changes in
sector level productivity and a structural change component measuring changes arising from a re-
allocation of labor between sectors as follows:

                          ∆       ∑        ,    ∆        ∑        ,   ∆                    (1)

where ∆ is the change in aggregate labor productivity between t and t-k,           is the employment
share in sector i at time t and 	is the productivity level in sector i at time t. The first term is the
“within” component and the second term is the “structural change” component.



75
   It is possible that these differences in labor productivity growth are mostly entirely stemming from differences in
capital-labor ratios across sectors implying that total factors productivity is similar across sectors. However,
Herrendorf and Valentinyi (2012) show that this is not the case for broader sector definitions. For services sub-sectors,
we cannot directly test this hypothesis given the absence of sectoral time series capital stock data (see paragraph on
data limitations below). Nevertheless, we argue that it is unlikely that differences in capital intensities alone can
explain the large differences in labor productivity levels and growth across services sub-sectors within Latin American
countries.
76
   The definition of structural change is consistent with Duarte and Restuccia (2010), McMillian and Rodrik (2011)
and others. Alternatively Hausman and Klinger (2006) use exports as a proxy for production to analyze structural
change within the manufacturing sector only.
77
   At the aggregate level, previous analysis was typically limited to measure the reallocation of labor across three
broad sectors only: agriculture, manufacturing, and services. The recent availability of new data sets such as the
Groningen 10 sector database and the UNIDO sector data provide more detailed international time series sector data
for value added and employment that ensure a certain degree of consistent in cross-country sector definitions making
it possibly to refine the previous approaches.
78
   We emphasize that aggregate GDP growth does of course not only depend on aggregate labor productivity growth
but also on changes in the aggregate labor input and demographics. For example, if a redundant worker with zero
productivity is laid off in agriculture and drops out of the labor force labor productivity in agriculture increases, the
contribution of the labor input to GDP growth declines while structural change and aggregate GDP growth remain the
same.


                                                          78
Data limitations in the analysis require a number of assumptions. Previous studies using the
same data sources have been criticized for several empirical shortcomings. First, aggregate
productivity must not always lead to higher aggregate welfare (at least in a static setting abstracting
from dynamic productivity or technology spillovers a la Aghion and Howitt, 1992, or Romer,
1990). For example, productivity may be higher in sectors with monopoly power. A reallocation
of labor to these sectors would contribute positively to structural change but would not necessarily
enhance welfare. Moreover, differences in the coverage of the informal sector (in terms of GDP
and employment) across countries can bias the results. Most importantly, however, previous
studies such as Pages (2010) and McMillian and Rodrik (2011) measure differences in the average
instead of the marginal rates of labor productivity across sectors; under perfect competition in
input and output markets, however, labor should move to the sector with the highest marginal
productivity (i.e., wage) equalizing marginal rates across sectors over time. In fact, under a Cobb-
Douglas production function specification, the marginal productivity of labor is the average
productivity multiplied by the share of labor in GDP. Thus, large differences in labor shares, i.e.
in capital intensities across sectors, drive a wedge between marginal and average labor productivity
levels. For instance, among the sectors above, public utilities and mining are likely to have higher
capital intensities potentially overstating their measured marginal productivities when
approximated with averages. McMillian and Rodrik (2011) argue, however, that in the case of the
other sectors, which employ most labor, it is not clear that there is a significant bias.79 Thus, we
assume in the following that large gaps in average productivity across sectors within a country are
positively correlated with the underlying unobservable gaps in marginal productivities across
sectors.80 Moreover, we provide a robustness test by approximating the marginal productivity of
labor with the estimated labor share of income in the Appendix. Using World Bank I2D2 data, we
calculate the income share of labor using wage data for Peru and Chile.81 We find that gaps in
marginal productivities measured by average wages across sectors are smaller than gaps measured
by value added per worker, but sectoral differences remain significant.82

Do changes in the allocation of labor across sectors explain the region’s laggard aggregate
productivity growth?

Aggregate productivity growth in Latin American countries between 1960 and 2005 was well
below that of East Asian peers during the same period. Figure 4.2 illustrates that average annual
aggregate productivity growth ranged between 2.5 and 4.5 percent in Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia, and India. In contrast, average annual productivity growth was about 1.8 percent
between 1960 and 2005 in Brazil and Chile and around 1 percent for all other Latin American
countries, apart from Venezuela where it was negative. The only East Asian country with available
data and similar productivity growth around 1 percent are the Philippines.

   McMillian and Rodrik (2011) refer, for instance, to Mundlak et al (2008) who show that it is not clear that the labor
share in agriculture is significantly lower than in manufacturing once the share of land is taken into account.

   See Hsieh and Olken (2014) for a detailed discussion under which conditions the average and the marginal products
of capital and labor move together.

   These two countries have the most reliable wage data in the I2D2 in the region. To eliminate biases arising from
unobserved heterogeneity, the data is narrowed down to a sub-set of workers. The marginal labor productivities are
calculated for single males aged 30-34 years with elementary education. The wage data is adjusted for the rural-urban
price differential.

   McMillian and Rodrik (2012) come to similar conclusions using a comparable approach for Mexico.

Within sector productivity growth in Argentina and Chile between 1960 and 2005 was
comparable or higher than in East Asian countries but the labor shares of higher
productivity sectors declined in both countries reducing aggregate productivity growth.
Within sector productivity growth in Argentina was as high as in India or Indonesia; however, the
relative decline in employment in higher productivity sectors reduced aggregate productivity
growth in Argentina from 1.6 to 1 percent annually while increasing labor shares in these sectors
raised aggregate productivity growth in India and Indonesia to 2.6 and 3.3, respectively. Likewise,
within sector growth in Chile was even 0.5 percent higher than in Thailand but the declining labor
shares in higher productivity sectors reduced annual aggregate growth to 1.8 percent Chile while
increasing labor shares in these sectors raised it to 4 percent in Thailand between 1960 and 2005,
respectively. Thus, while structural change accounted for -61 and -28 percent of aggregate
productivity growth in Argentina and Chile, it accounted for 55 and 50 percent in Indonesia and
Thailand, respectively. Overall, a decline in the labor share of higher productivity sectors
contributed negatively to aggregate productivity growth in five out of nine Latin American
countries. In contrast, increasing labor shares in these sectors contributed positively to aggregate
productivity growth (between 26 and 64 percent) in Brazil, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Peru; the
within sector component, however, was relatively weak (around 1 percent) in these four Latin
American countries.

The changes in aggregate productivity growth between 1990 and 2005 mirror these long term
trends. Between 1990 and 2005, aggregate productivity growth stagnated in most Latin American
countries apart from Peru, Chile, and to some extent Argentina where it was comparable to East
Asian countries except from China. Aggregate productivity in China grew by 8.8 percent annually
from 1990-2005 outperforming the second highest growth country (India) by 4.6 percent annually.
Aggregate productivity also grew strongly in Peru and Chile, at comparable rates to Thailand,
Turkey, and Indonesia during that period.

The labor shares of higher productivity sectors declined in seven out of nine Latin American
countries from 1990-2005 but slightly increased in Mexico and Costa Rica. Within sector
growth was about 4 percent in Chile, Peru, and Bolivia, second only to China. However, declining
labor shares in higher productivity sectors reduced aggregate productivity by 0.4, 0.9, and 3
percent in Peru, Chile, and Bolivia, respectively, while the relative increase in employment in these
sectors has raised aggregate productivity growth in the East Asian peer countries. Overall, the
structural change component was strongest in Thailand, Turkey, Indonesia, India, and China where
it contributed between 1 and 2 percent to aggregate annual productivity growth.

Overall, these findings show that reallocations of labor across sectors were pivotal in many
Latin American countries to explain their inferior aggregate productivity growth
performance during the past 50 years relative to East Asian peers. This trend was even more
pronounced in the more recent sub-period between 1990 and 2005. What are the major trends in
sector employment shares causing this slow structural change in Latin American countries? To
answer this question, we analyze the changes in employment shares by sector in Latin American
countries between 1990 and 2005 in more detail in Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5.

In most Latin American economies, labor shares of manufacturing and agriculture declined
between 1990 and 2005 while labor moved to various services sectors. Where these services
                                                  81
sectors were more productive, labor reallocation associated with structural change made a positive
contribution to overall productivity growth (Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5). For example, in Costa
Rica, labor reallocation increased aggregate productivity growth, showing movement of labor from
agriculture to transport & telecommunication, finance, real estate & business services, as well as
wholesale & retail. Notably, wholesale & retail trade in Costa Rica has a relatively high average
labor productivity which contrasts with all other Latin American countries in the sample apart from
Mexico. Apart from this overall finding, five additional observations are salient.

First, the productivity level of the wholesale & retail trade sector is pivotal to explain the
contribution of structural change to aggregate productivity growth among Latin American
countries. Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 demonstrate that a significant share of the labor force is
working in wholesale & retail trade; the sector’s employment shares yet increased in all Latin
America countries (apart from Peru) between 1990 and 2005. The sector had relatively high
productivity levels in Mexico and Costa Rica contributing to aggregate productivity growth in
these countries. In contrast, productivity levels of wholesale & retail trade were low in all other
Latin American countries reducing aggregate growth; notably, the sector’s relative productivity
level was the lowest among all sectors in Brazil, Chile, and Columbia. The latter suggests that in
many Latin American countries redundant labor from other sectors often ends up working in
unproductive small scale activities (e.g., street vendors) in the retail trade sector which typically
hosts a large share of informal labor. In contrast, the relatively high productivity levels in Mexico
and Costa Rica might indicate a higher degree of formalization in the sector possibly due to the
past entry of a large number foreign (U.S.) wholesale and retail trade franchises in both countries.

The finding implies that case studies analyzing differences in the performance of specific
service sectors across different Latin American countries can help understand the
underlying causes of cross-country differences in aggregate productivity growth. For
instance, the World Bank database on service trade restrictions provides comparable information
across 103 countries for five key service sectors (Borchert, Gootiiz, and Mattoo, 2012). The
indicators focus on policies and regulations discriminating against the entry of foreign service
providers. The data show significant variations in services trade restrictions across Latin American
countries.

Second, the share of labor working in manufacturing sectors declined in all Latin American
countries (apart from Bolivia). The manufacturing sector is among the most productive sectors
in all countries. In Argentina and Peru, it was the sector with the strongest labor share decline
(stronger than agriculture). This trend slowed down aggregate productivity growth. In particular,
aggregate productivity growth would have been higher if a larger share of new labor market
entrants or redundant labor from agriculture and the government sector would have been absorbed
by manufacturing instead of the lower productivity (partially informal) retailed & wholesale trade
sector. The decline in the size of the manufacturing sector was particularly notable in Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela. Our findings are consistent with Duarte and Restuccia (2010).

Third, the employment share in the relatively low productivity agriculture sector typically
declined contributing positively to aggregate productivity growth. The contribution was
especially high in Brazil, Costa Rica, Columbia, and Mexico due to the strong decline of the



                                                 82
relatively high initial employment shares of agriculture in these countries. The only Latin
American country in the sample where the labor share in agriculture increased is Peru.

Fourth, increases in the public sector employment share between 1990 and 2005 slowed down
aggregate productivity growth in Argentina and to some degree also in Brazil. The
government service sector is the largest employer in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. For
instance, in Argentina and Brazil labor moved primarily from agriculture and manufacturing to
lower productivity wholesale & retail trade as well as government services.

Fifth, increases in the labor shares of finance, real estate, & business services sectors
contributed positively to aggregate productivity growth in Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, and
Mexico. These relatively high productivity sectors employ only a relatively small share of labor
in some Latin American countries; e.g., Bolivia, Peru, or Venezuela. In contrast, they are a
relatively large employer as well as fast-expanding in Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, and Mexico.
The measured productivity levels of the sector also vary noticeable across countries; while it is
above average in most countries, productivity is particularly low in Argentina and Peru. The sector
includes finance as well as professional services which often have major restrictions to foreign
entry in Latin America. Borchert, Gootiiz, and Mattoo (2012) show that both sectors have low
restrictions to service trade in Columbia and Costa Rica, labeled as virtually open to foreign entry
in both countries.

The above findings suggest several promising directions to deepen the analysis in order to
help explain slow aggregate productivity growth in Latin American countries. One striking
feature is certainly the decline of the size of manufacturing sectors in almost all countries. Given
that manufacturing productivity appears to be substantially higher relative to most other sectors,
its decline contributed to lower aggregate productivity growth in the region. Moreover, it has been
argued that manufacturing activities, which are usually freely tradable and more internationally
mobile, embody aggregate growth externalities. That is, their exposure to trade and the integration
of global value chains potentially facilitate international knowledge transfers or lead to more
competitive market structures.

        Note: Figures plots logarithm of sectoral value added per worker (relative to the average across all sectors) and the change in the employment share for 9 sectors
        of an economy between 1990 and 2005. The size of the circle reflects the employment share in 2005. On the vertical axis, sectors above zero are relatively more
        productive compared to an average sector in an economy. On the x-axis, sectors to the right from zero have had increases in their employment shares.

Is manufacturing labor productivity in Latin America catching up with high income countries? Is
the convergence rate in the region different from other developing regions?

Recent academic findings suggest that the declining share of labor working in Latin America’s
manufacturing sector might have particular consequences for the region’s (speed of)
convergence. Rodrik (2013) reveals the empirically robust stylized fact of unconditional
convergence in manufacturing labor productivity across countries. That is, manufacturing labor
productivity in poorer countries is catching up (on average) with manufacturing labor productivity
in high income countries independent of developing countries’ policies, qualities of institutions,
education, or other growth determinants. Arguably, his findings are also valid for tradable service
sectors but data limitations limit the scope of the analysis to manufacturing. The author used recently
constructed UN data (INDSTAT) that allow for robust empirical analysis covering a large sample
consisting of 23 manufacturing sub-sectors from most countries in the world over several decades.
The manufacturing labor shares are often very low (5-10 percent) as the data mostly cover formal
employment. Rodrik (2013) also shows that convergence in manufacturing productivity does not
imply aggregate convergence because of the low and often declining manufacturing labor shares in
developing countries. While the article includes a battery of empirical robustness checks across
different time periods and levels of sector aggregation, it does not report testing for potential
differences in the convergence rate in manufacturing labor productivity across specific developing
regions.

Against this background, we test if the finding of unconditional convergence in manufacturing
productivity also holds among Latin American countries and if convergence rates differ across
the region. In other words, we test if there are Latin America specific factors holding back
manufacturing productivity that are fundamentally different from the rest of the world? If it is the
case, the declining size of manufacturing sectors in Latin America is a potential concern for
policymakers. In other words, policymakers should focus on removing product and labor market
constraints (i) preventing manufacturing firms from expanding (potential entrepreneurs from
entering) and/or (ii) holding back employment and labor productivity growth in tradable service
sectors.

Manufacturing productivity growth in Latin America was significantly lower than the
worldwide average; however, there were substantial growth differences across Latin
American countries. Figure 4.6 illustrates the (compound) average annual labor productivity
growth rate across 23 manufacturing sectors for the latest decade with available data (post 1990).
The growth rate is measured net of year-industry specific effects and the sample corresponds to
Rodrik’s baseline post 1990 specification. Accordingly, manufacturing labor productivity growth
(net of year-industry specific effects) amounted to 4.2 percent across all 104 countries with available
data. In contrast, average growth among Latin American countries is only 1.2 percent. The difference
in growth rates is statistically significant (5 percent level as indicated by the “asterisk”). The average
growth rate is even lower among large Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. However, it conceals a substantial degree of heterogeneity among
these countries. Manufacturing productivity growth in Mexico, Costa Rica, Chile, and Argentina
was not statistically significantly different from the worldwide average. In contrast, growth in Brazil,
Venezuela, and Peru was even negative statistically significantly different (at the 1 percent level).

Each bar corresponds to the average annual labor productivity growth rate across 2-digit
manufacturing sectors in the Latin American region for the latest decade with available data (post
1990). The sample corresponds to a baseline specification in Rodrik (2013). The growth rate is
measured net of year-industry specific effects. The “worldwide” bar measures the average annual
growth rate across all countries and 2-digit manufacturing industries over a decade. An “asterisk”
indicates that the growth rate in the region or country was statistically significantly different from
the worldwide manufacturing labor productivity growth rate (i.e., from 4.2 percent). “LAC-large”
corresponds to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. ”LAC” excludes small island
states (less than 200,000 people), Belize, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guyana.

Manufacturing labor productivity in the Latin American region overall is converging
unconditionally (independent of policies, institutions, or educational levels) with the same
convergence rate as the rest of the world. Table 4.1 shows to which extent Latin American
countries catch up in manufacturing productivity with high income countries. It reports the three
main estimation specifications from Rodrik (2013).83 In all cases the dependent variable is the
(compound annual) growth rate of labor productivity for 2-digit manufacturing industries. The
regressors are the log of initial labor productivity and industry-year fixed effects. The baseline
estimation specification consists of a pooled sample that combines the latest ten-year period for each
country maximizing the number of countries covered (118). Since each country enters with around
20 industries, the total number of observations is 2,122. The second specification restricts the sample
to post 1990 10-year periods while the third is a pure cross-section for 1995-2005. The second
column replicates Rodrik’s findings of a convergence rate of 2.9 percent implying that industries
that are a tenth of the way to the technology frontier (roughly the bottom 20 percent of industries in
the sample) experience a convergence boost in their labor productivity growth of 6.7 percentage
points per annum. In columns 5-15 of Table 4.1, we test if the convergence rate was different in
Latin America; i.e., we include a region dummy and its interaction term with log initial labor
productivity in the corresponding estimation specifications. The coefficient of the interaction term
measures if the convergence rate was differed from the convergence rate across all other countries.
Table 4.1 only reports cases in which the convergence rate was statistically significantly different

from the rest of the world (the t-statistic of the interaction term is reported in brackets below). The
results show that the convergence rate in the Latin American region overall was the same as in the
rest of the world.84 The results for the region overall conceal a substantial heterogeneity across
countries.

Manufacturing labor productivity in Brazil, Peru, and Chile did not catch up (unconditionally)
with high productivity countries. The last three columns of Table 4.1 show that the convergence
rate in Brazil, Peru, and Chile was (statistically) significantly lower than in the rest of the world. The
actual convergence rate (-2.9 percent plus the coefficient of the interaction term) was close to zero
and even diverging in Chile (not statistically different from zero though). For all other larger Latin
American countries in the sample apart from Mexico, the speed of convergence was not (statistically)
different from the convergence rate in the rest of the world.

The convergence rate of manufacturing labor productivity in Mexico was significantly higher
than in the rest of the world. The yearly convergence rate for manufacturing productivity in
Mexico amounted to 4.8 percent between 1993 and 2003 (last year with available data) which is
two-third larger than in the rest of the world. The Mexican manufacturing convergence rate is
(statistically) different from the rate in the rest of the world (at a 10 percent level). Thus,
manufacturing firms in Mexico were able to catch up in terms of productivity with high productivity
countries (the U.S.) between 1993 and 2003.

Columns 2-4 replicate the baseline finding of Rodrik (2013). Columns 4-12 show if the convergence
rate in manufacturing labor productivity differed among (groups of) Latin American countries. Each
cell is based on a regression of growth on initial productivity including year-industry dummies
(analog to Rodrik, 2013) and a region dummy as well as the interaction term of the region dummy
with initial productivity.1) The coefficients show the compound convergence coefficient (baseline-
coefficient + coefficient interaction term) while the t-statistics tests if convergence coefficient is
statistically different from the convergence coefficient in the full sample, i.e. across all counties (e.g.,
-0.029). Standard errors are clustered at the country level in all specifications.

Why did unconditional convergence in manufacturing for most Latin American countries not
translate into higher manufacturing productivity growth?

84
  We find a lack of unconditional convergence in manufacturing labor productivity among the large Latin American
countries for the 1995-2000 cross sections (the convergence rate of 0.1 percent corresponds to the convergence
coefficient in the rest of the world -2.4 percent plus the coefficient of the interaction term of -2.3 percent which is not
reported explicitly here). It is probably due to the fact that data for Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, and Costa Rica are
not available for the 1995-2005 cross section.

                                                                        88
Rodrik (2013) shows that unconditional convergence in (formal) manufacturing does not
translate into aggregate convergence due to low (sometimes declining) manufacturing labor
shares. The author derives the following decomposition of aggregate productivity growth into a
manufacturing convergence term and a reallocation term measuring the potentially negative effect
of labor reallocating from the manufacturing sector to less productivity non-manufacturing sectors:
                                             ∗
                 ∆                                                           ∆                      (2)

where aggregate labor productivity                     1          	 	is the weighted average of labor
productivity in these two activities, α is the share of the economy’s labor force employed in
manufacturing, ∆ is the aggregate labor productivity growth rate, is the long-term balanced
growth rate of the economy,              	⁄ 	and           	⁄ are the productivity premium/discounts
for the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors,           2% is the convergence rate estimated for
the full sample from 1995-2005 which is applied to all countries, and ∗ is the productivity frontier
in manufacturing. Rodrik (2013) quantifies equation (2) by combining the INDSTAT manufacturing
data with data for aggregated GDP per worker from the Penn World tables (non-manufacturing
productivity being the difference between the two for each country). Table A4.5 in the appendix
shows the details for the different convergence terms in equation (2) for the Latin American countries
with available data.85 It shows that aggregate productivity convergence was lagging in the region
due to (i) small initial manufacturing labor shares (α), (ii) declining manufacturing labor shares over
time (∆ ), (iii) small productivity differentials relative to the rest of the economy ( ), or (iv)
                                                                                             ∗
smaller productivity gaps relative to the world productivity frontier in manufacturing (             ).
Moreover, we emphasize that tradable service sectors arguably have similar characteristics as
manufacturing but sufficiently detailed cross country data for these services sub-sectors are not
available limiting the scope of the analysis to unconditional convergence in manufacturing.

To which extent do patterns of specialization within manufacturing help explain the declining labor
shares and slower manufacturing productivity convergence in some countries in the region?

     4. 2.        Changing Production Structures in Manufacturing

In the following, we evaluate in detail the patterns of specialization within manufacturing observed
in Latin American countries. These help explain country-specific specialization trends potentially
leading to either declining labor shares or slow productivity growth.

The structural transformation that took place in Latin America’s manufacturing sector is
analyzed in detail through the lens of analyzing the evolution of export specialization patterns.
We use the product space to capture the evolution of Latin America’s manufacturing. Despite some

85
   We note that Peru, Chile, and Brazil are estimated to have benefitted from manufacturing convergence since we
assumed the same convergence rate of 2 percent for all countries. Table 4.1Error! Reference source not found. shows,
however, that this assumption is rejected in the data for these three countries. Accordingly, manufacturing convergence
terms should have amounted to zero instead (         0 cannot be rejected in the data for these three countries). In turn,
Table 4.1Error! Reference source not found. shows that the actual speed of manufacturing convergence is estimated
to have been higher in Mexico.

notable limitations of the product space analysis (Hidalgo et al., 2007)86, it is a relevant analytical
tool to study the dynamics of the manufacturing sector over the past 15-30 years. The “product
space” methodology measures a potential relatedness between production structures among 775 4-
digit SITC products. The analysis is based on export data at the 4-digit product level from the
Comtrade database. The data are pooled for the corresponding three year periods (e.g., 2008-2010)
to minimize the impact of yearly outliers in export values. The product space is a graphical
representation of the relatedness between every pair of the 775 4-digit SITC manufacturing products
whereby distances between two products represent the similarity between their production
structures. Figure 4.7 illustrates the product space for Brazil.

The comparison with the evolution of the production structures in East Asia reveals a lack of
cluster formation among related manufacturing products or industries in Latin America. The
findings are summarized in Figure 4.8. which illustrates the product space among lower middle
income countries (LMIC) of Latin America and East Asia Pacific (EAP) today and 30 years ago. In
particular, the product space reveals the existence of a densely connected industrial core (center) and
several peripheral clusters, e.g., garments (left), textiles, or electronics (lower right). Modern
manufacturing clusters are typically located in the core (e.g., vehicles, machinery, or chemicals) or
the bottom (electronics cluster). Products in which a country has a (revealed) comparative advantage
(in exporting) are depicted as “black squares”. Figure 4.8. shows that LMIC countries in Latin
America succeeded in developing a relatively diversified manufacturing base over the last 30 years.
Nevertheless, peripheral agricultural and natural resource related products still make up the majority
of revealed comparative advantages. Moreover, Figure 4.8. suggests that Latin America did not

86
   The product space analysis depends on a number of limiting assumptions. Trade data is only a proxy for the productive
structure of an economy, and in some cases can substantially deviate from actual sectoral contributions to GDP. In
addition, Lederman and Maloney (2012) highlight that there can be a substantial degree of heterogeneity in technology
content of products even at the 4-digit level.

the development of electronics, machinery, or car parts clusters in East Asia. Figure 4.9 confirms
the lack of cluster formation among related products or manufacturing sub-sectors for the largest
Latin American countries; however, Mexico appears to differ from this pattern. In the following, we
analyze the evolution of manufacturing production clusters in detail for selected Latin American
countries.

The product space for Mexico reveals the formation of automobile as well as machinery and
transport equipment industrial clusters (i.e., car parts). Mexico gained competitiveness in the
machinery and transport equipment industry. As of 2008-10, Mexico has a revealed comparative
advantage in a number of product classes in the core of the product space (Figure 4.10) such as the
machinery and transport equipment industry and the electronics (52 RCAs). Those are mostly
medium technology engineering products (MT3, based on a classification from Lall, see Table 4.2)
and electronics (HT1); in addition, the country displays a significant comparative advantage for
automotive products (MT1) such as passenger motor cars (7810) and motor vehicles for transport
of goods (7821). Many of the products in the core, which Mexico successfully exports, are also
successfully exported by the US (or at least closely related to products with RCA in the US). This
suggests that some of the products with RCA in Mexico in potentially higher technology sectors
such as automobiles and electronics could be merely assembled in Mexico and re-exported to the
US. In fact, the formation of automobile and electronics clusters in Mexico is closely related to FDI
of several U.S. electronics companies as well as major car producers from the U.S. or Germany
producing in Mexico. Nevertheless, Figure 4.10 suggests that Mexico developed a domestic car parts
industry supplying intermediate goods ranging from tires to motor parts to foreign multinationals
(MNEs) operating in the country. That is, once domestic producers manage to satisfy the quality

                                                 92
standards of MNEs in Mexico, they are automatically obtained the accreditation to sell to their
intermediate products to all other production facilities of that MNE around the world. As a
consequence, Mexico gained revealed comparative advantages in exporting machinery and transport
equipment to the rest of the world. Notably, Argentina also developed an export cluster in passenger
motor cars (7810). However, Figure 4.9 illustrates that Argentina did not develop similar production
clusters in related upstream supplying industries so far.87

The dynamic representation of the product space (Figure 4.11) reveals that Mexico already
successfully exported automobiles, electronics, and several machinery and transport
equipment products in 2000/02 while several new export successes emerged in these clusters
until 2008/10. Figure 4.11 shows the dynamic representation of Mexico’s product space over the
last decade. We distinguish between four different categories of products. First, “classics” refer to
products that have RCA in 2000-02 as well as 2008-10 and are represented by a “blue triangle”.
Second, “disappearing” reflect a RCA in 2000-02 but not in 2008-10; red square. Third, “Emerging”
shows RCA in 2008-10 but not 2000-02; green diamond. Finally, “marginals” reflect products where
Mexico has not yet acquired a RCA (0.5<RCA<1) but experienced positive export growth (of 10
percent or higher) since 2000-02; yellow pentagon. Figure 4.11 (left) reveals that Mexico lost export
competitiveness in several products in the garments cluster. At the same time, the country maintained
RCAs in exporting automobiles, electronics, and several machinery and transport equipment
products. Moreover, Figure 4.11 (middle) highlights that additional export successes emerged
among in related products within these product classes (in the core of the product space) since 2000-
02 including complete digital central processing (7523) or internal combustion piston engines
(7132). Although, the long term picture points to a successful structural transformation of Mexico’s

87
   However, Argentina recently gained RCA in exporting radio-broadcast receivers for motor vehicles (7621). Other
recent export successes emerged In Argentina in the densely connected core of the product space include dairy machinery
(7213), agricultural & horticulture machinery (7211), polyamides (5824), chemical products and preparations (5989),
transmission, conveyor/elevator belt (6282), or photographic film (8822).

manufacturing productive capabilities from resource-based products to automobiles and machinery,
the picture relativizes when comparing Mexico’s product space with Thailand (Figure 4.11, right).
That is, Thailand developed twice as many new RCAs than Mexico since 2000/02. In particular,
Thailand managed to successfully expand the number of new products with RCAs in the electronics
cluster while Mexico lost some competitiveness in electronics (as indicated by the red squares).
Overall, however, the strong export growth of manufacturing clusters in the core of the product space
in Mexico is consistent with the findings in section 4.1 which revealed a higher manufacturing
convergence rate than in the rest of the world.

Costa Rica’s economy is fairly diversified with export successes ranging from garments, food,
or base metal products to car parts, chemicals, or electronics. Figure 4.12 illustrates that Costa
Rica has RCAs in several products in the densely connected core of the product space including
medicaments (5417), varnishes and lacquers (5334), tires (6251), internal combustion piston
engines (7131), parts for office machines (7599), or electronic microcircuits (7764). The strong
export growth in the latter two electronic products emerged over the last 20 years and has been
triggered by the substantial investment of a foreign MNE (Intel). Moreover, Figure 4.12 shows Costa
Rica lost some competitiveness in garments as well as two major products located in the core of the
product space (miscellaneous articles of materials, 8939 and other electrical machinery &
equipment, 7788) over the past decade. Figure 4.12 also reveals a large number of marginals; i.e.,
products with strong export growth since 2000 for which Costa Rica is close in achieving a RCA.

The dynamic representation of the product space (Figure 4.13) reveals that Brazil’s export
basket has shifted over time, but not significantly. Figure 4.13 (left) reveals that Brazil lost export
competitiveness in products of various industries located in the core of the product space since 2000-
02 including photographic film (8822), television tubes (7761), radio receivers of cars (7621), cast,
rolled, drawn or blown glass (6644), optical glass (6642), transmission shafts (7493), refractory
bricks (6623), natural or artificial abrasive powder (6632), cut to size paper and paperboard (6424),
or other furniture (8219). On the other hand, Figure 4.13 (right) highlights the following emerging
products in the core of the product space since 2000-02: motor vehicles for transport (7821), road
tractors & semi-trailors (7832), machinery for sorting, screening & separating (7283), larger
aircrafts (7924), or printing & writing par (6412). While declining and emerging product categories
are scattered across various industries, the recent decline of Brazil’s television & photographic as
well as glass manufacturing is evident. In contrast, emerging products in automotive and machinery
suggest that these industry clusters are expanding and gaining international competitiveness.

Peru primarily specialized in agricultural, mining, and some garment products. Figure 4.14
illustrates that Peru has RCA in many agricultural and mining based products including fresh or
chilled vegetables (545), copper or zinc alloys, metallic salts (5232), or manufacturers of asbestos
(6638). The dynamic representation of the product space in Figure 4.15 shows that the export
successes in garments emerged in the 1990s. Overall, however, hardly any new products emerged
over the past ten years.

Except for Chile, natural resource rich countries in Latin America performed worse in terms
of economic growth than other countries that are resource rich in other parts of the world. For
example, the product space of Venezuela reflects the dominance of natural resources, in particular
petroleum and crude oils. Venezuela’s economy is highly concentrated with RCA only in 12
products. While part of the decline in other manufacturing products might stem from a Dutch disease
type of effect, a comparison with Norway, Canada, or New Zealand (Figure 4.16.) suggests that
other forces might have played a more important role. That is, Norway, Canada, and New Zealand
are major exporters of mining products but nevertheless developed a sound manufacturing base.

However, it should be stressed that the product space methodology does not imply that
sustained growth necessarily requires an expanding manufacturing sector. Chile specialized in
products which are typically not in the core of the product space (food processing and mining),
having revealed comparative advantage in many agricultural and mining based products. Chile’s
export basket has barely shifted over the past decade. Moreover, Chile lost comparative advantage
in a few manufactured products while hardly any new products emerged which is consistent with
the decline in the manufacturing labor share as well as the stagnant productivity growth in Chile
identified in Section 4.1. These developments, however, did not preclude strong economic growth
over the last decade, suggesting an example of advancement from low to (higher) middle income
levels without a strong manufacturing base in the core of the product space. This means that there is
not necessarily a “unique” economic structure suitable for growth. In addition, the historical
experience of Canada, Sweden and Finland shows that diversification into non-resource industries
from a strong resource base is possible.88 Similarly, Columbia’s manufacturing sector is

export some chemicals as well as car parts.

Primary and resources- based products are still dominating Latin America’s exports. We use
the classification of Lall (2000), presented in Table 4.2 to classify countries’ exports into primary,
resources-based, low, medium, and high technology products. Table 4.3 (classics category) shows
that exports of primary and resources-based products account for the lion share of manufacturing
exports among Latin American countries. In fact, their importance has been increasing between 2005
and 2009 (see emerging category, Table 4.3). For instance, 60 percent of all products in which Brazil
has a RCA are primary and resource-based products (Table 4.3). The products in which Latin
American countries are about to gain a RCA (i.e., marginal category) is populated by products that
are either primary, resource-based, or low technology except for Costa Rica.

Does the lack of specialization away from primary or resource-based manufacturing products in
many Latin American countries matter?

  PRODY is used as a proxy for the capabilities embedded in a product. However, there are some limitations to using
PRODY since High income countries export natural resources resulting in high PRODY values for certain goods not
necessarily representative of the capabilities required for production.

“How” goods are produced can often matter more for economy-wide productivity than in
which sectors they are produced (Lederman and Maloney, 2012). Identical goods can be produced
at very different levels of sophistication and with very distinct long-term impacts on growth. That
is, within each industry, the sophistication and novelty of the production process and potential for
productivity growth matter.90 For example, while South Korea and Mexico have reached a similar
degree in manufacturing export sophistication, the manufacturing share of value-added in Mexico
was declining until recently, while it has been rising continuously in South Korea.91 Moreover, the
lack of technology absorption capacity in Chile at the turn of last century did not allow its copper
industry to increase productivity to the degree it did in the US, with wide-ranging externalities to the
rest of the economy.92

The following analysis suggests that “what” and “how” countries’ produce might be
correlated. The scope for learning and foreign knowledge and technology spillovers might itself
depend on the specific product or industry. In fact, Cai and Li (2012) show that production
technologies differ in the extent to which they are more or less widely applicable across products or
industries. That is, some knowledge can be more readily adapted to be used in related production
processes while other knowledge is limited in its scope of application. The authors find that U.S.
firms using more applicable technologies are more likely to innovate. Thus, products or industries
embodying more applicable technologies also embody a larger scope for knowledge spillovers.
Primary and resource-based products might in fact embody less scope for knowledge spillovers as
their production processes and embodied technologies are more idiosyncratic and thus less widely
applicable. In the following, we analyze if Latin American countries tend to be specialized in less
widely applicable technologies and production processes using a quantitative measure of the
“knowledge applicability” developed by Cai and Li (2013). The measure is based on patent citation
data and can be aggregated to the country level measuring a country's knowledge composition.

Latin America as a region appears to be less specialized in industries with high knowledge
applicability. Cai and Li (2013) developed for each industry a quantitative measure of knowledge
applicability. The authors use the 2006 patent citation database, provided by U.S. Patent and Trade
Office (USPTO), to trace the direction and intensity of knowledge flows within and across
technological classes which allows constructing indices of knowledge applicability for each
industry. This measure is aggregated to the country level based on using countries’ export structure
to create industry weights. Cai and Li (2013) find that countries with a higher knowledge
applicability index experience higher subsequent economic growth.93 Figure 4.18 summarizes one

   Lederman and Maloney (2012) also highlight that there can be a substantial degree of heterogeneity in technology
content of products even at the 4-digit level. For instance, a country that successfully exports microchips might host
high-tech firms engaging in R&D and product design or low tech firms simply assembling the microchips without adding
much value. Therefore, detailed sector case studies or value chain analysis would be necessary to supplement the
analysis.

   The applicability of a country's knowledge portfolio (revealed through its exports) indeed predicts its subsequent
growth. Cai and Li (2013) find that the coefficients on log (TA) are always positive and highly significant across all
specifications, suggesting that specializing in sectors with large knowledge spillovers brings growth in the future. The
size of the estimated effect is large. The estimated coefficients vary from 1.1 to 4.7, implying that a ten percent increase
in log (TA0), which is approximately what Thailand achieved between 1975 and 1980, on average enhances a country's
subsequent growth by 1/4 percent per year. In addition, all the other initial control variables have the correct signs.

embody highly applicable knowledge experience higher subsequent growth.

Despite substantial heterogeneity across countries, production structures in most countries in
Latin America imply low knowledge applicability. Figure 4.19 represents the time trends for the
knowledge applicability indices (log(TA)) for a sample of 17 countries. It shows that China’s and
Thailand’s export knowledge applicability has been growing steadily, rapidly converging to the
index levels for South Korea and the U.S. over the past decades. In contrast, the exports baskets of
most Latin American countries imply lower knowledge applicability in their embodied technologies.
Thus, they are less specialized in sectors with high knowledge applicability. The exceptions are
Mexico and Costa Rica (due to the strong growth of electronics exports after the entry of Intel in the
mid-1990s). Both countries’ knowledge applicability of their production structures are relatively
high and have been rising since 1990. This finding is consistent with our results in Section 1 showing
that manufacturing labor productivity converged unconditionally in both countries. Moreover,
Section 2 showed that both countries are the least specialized in primary and resource-based goods
in the region. In contrast, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Argentina, Peru, and Columbia, which are all
specialized in primary and resource-based goods, have the lowest knowledge applicability index.
Noteworthy, the knowledge applicability embodied in Chile’s export basket has been rising until
late 1990s and is higher than that of most other Latin American countries.94




Notably, initial investment to GDP ratio, export diversification and openness do not seem to enter in a robustly significant
way, and including institutional quality does not affect much the significance of log initial TA either.

   This result is quite different from the measure of export sophistication developed in Hausman et al. (2007).

            4. 4.         Conclusions and Potential Policy Implications

The findings of this paper suggest that structural change in LAC has often been accompanied
by some degree of resource misallocation or inefficient resource use. Three distinct, but related
phenomena affecting countries in the region deserve particular attention: (i) structural change
accompanied by decreased economy-wide value-added per worker; (ii) manufacturing productivity
growth below the world average; and (iii) the presence of idiosyncratic production structures.

First, in contrast to East Asia, the contribution of structural change to growth in value-added
per worker in Latin America has been small and even negative in some countries. More
specifically, an increase in the employment shares of lower productivity sectors seems to have been
the prevalent pattern across the LAC countries in recent decades. This phenomenon may be one
factor behind the limited income convergence observed with respect to richer countries.95 It should
be borne in mind, however, that in many instances high “within sector” value-added per worker
growth compensates for the adverse structural change effect.

Second, average manufacturing productivity growth in Latin America was significantly lower
than the worldwide average. Therefore, the region seems to have benefited less than others from
the phenomenon of unconditional convergence in manufacturing. Two caveats are in order, however:
(i) there is significant variation across countries in the region; and (ii) some service sub-sectors are
acquiring manufacturing-like characteristics, which may propel them to display unconditional
convergence properties as well. Thus, it is not all about manufacturing, but rather “modern”
economic activities which are subject to the forces of competition and exposed to incentives to
innovate.



95
  Silva and Ferreira (2013) argue that low growth in the tertiary sector explain much of the divergence between LAC
and the US after 1980.

                                                               103
Third, idiosyncratic production structures may be limiting Latin American firms’ ability to
absorb or imitate more productive foreign technologies. That is, the region appears to have
specialized in technologies that are not well connected or “idiosyncratic”. This can be seen through
the analysis of both the product spaces and the knowledge applicability of a country’s technology.
However, there is not a one-to-one relationship between the results of the two methodologies: while
Chile shows a lack of specialization in products within the core of the product space, its degree of
knowledge applicability is among the highest in the region.

Those findings highlight the difficulty in clearly separating the effects of two competing
explanations of low TFP growth in Latin America: resource misallocation versus delays in
technology adoption. At the sector level, structural change may be related to inefficiencies in the
allocation and reallocation of resources in many of Latin Americas’ economies. At a more
disaggregated level (e.g., through the product space and knowledge applicability analyses),
technology adoption patterns emerge as a potentially important explanatory factor. Ultimately, it
might not be possible to completely disentangle misallocation effects from technology adoption
effects since the misallocation of resources may itself be affecting the pace of technological diffusion
in the region.

Whereas manufacturing has some special characteristics, it does not follow that reversing the
decline of manufacturing labor shares should be a development policy goal. To jump from the
empirically observed phenomenon of unconditional convergence in manufacturing to an assertion
that deindustrialization would have to be reversed somehow is a non sequitur. The reason is twofold.
First, reversing the decline in manufacturing is not costless. Not only the potential benefits, but also
the costs, of undertaking this kind of economic reengineering would need to be assessed. Second, as
mentioned above, certain subsectors within the services sector are becoming tradable and as such
are potentially also subject to unconditional convergence.

Perhaps the main implication from the results reported here is that searching for an “optimal
economic structure” is futile and that a more sensible approach would be to look for
productivity growth opportunities across different sectors. In other words, instead of attempting
to unduly protect existing manufacturing activities and preventing it from shedding labor, the key
policy goals should involve (i) lifting productivity levels in lagging sectors that are absorbing labor;
and (ii) upgrading skills across the board so that newly-unemployed workers can find jobs in more
productive sectors that could potentially absorb labor.

   4. 5. 1.    Structural change

GDP per capita growth can be decomposed into the following components as illustrated in Figure
A4.20.: a) change in employment rate, b) change in demographic structure and c) change in labor
productivity.

Labor productivity can be further decomposed into two additional components: changes in sector
level productivity (“within” component) and changes arising from a re-allocation of labor between
sectors (“structural change” component). Following Pages (2010) and McMillian and Rodrik (2011)
this can be written as:

                     ∆       ∑        ,   ∆       ∑             ,   ∆       (A.1)

where ∆ is the change in aggregate labor productivity between t and t-k,           is the employment
share in sector i at time t and 	is the productivity level in sector i at time t. The first term is the
“within” component and the second term the “structural change” component. Alternatively, the
decomposition can be conducted using the Shapley decomposition as follow:

                                 ,   ,                      ,       ,
                 ∆       ∑                ∆       ∑                     ∆      (A.2)

whereby the main difference is that the Shapley decomposition assigns to each factor the average
marginal contribution rather than the contribution of a specific year.

   4. 5. 2.    Marginal productivity of labor

The above analysis of structural change has been based on average productivity. To pass
judgment on whether this change was welfare improving and growth promoting, however, would

                                                      105
require a more in-depth analysis.96 One important step in this direction is to look at marginal
productivity across sectors. Under perfect competition, marginal labor productivity – not average
productivity – should be equalized across sector. Assuming a constant returns production function,
since labor share are not necessarily negatively correlated with average productivity, large gaps in
average productivity may reflect large gaps in marginal labor productivity. There are some caveats
though. For example, high average labor productivity in capital-intensive sectors, such as mining,
may simply reflect that the labor share is low.

The marginal productivity of labor can be calculated by estimating the labor share of income.
Using World Bank I2D2 data, we calculated the income share of labor using wage data for Peru and
Chile, the only two countries with reliable wage data.97 In a perfectly competitive market, wages
equal the marginal product of labor. Labor markets are often not perfectly competitive, for example,
in the presence of unionization or indexed contracts. Moreover, in many developing countries some
workers, such as those in the agricultural sector household employees are only paid partially in
wages. Finally, using wages to calculate labor’s share of income automatically leads to an exclusion
of self-employed. To eliminate biases arising from unobserved heterogeneity, the data is narrowed
down to a sub-set of workers. The marginal labor productivities are calculated for single males aged
30-34 years with elementary education. The wage data is adjusted for the rural-urban price
differential.

Gaps in marginal productivities measured by average wages across sectors are smaller than
gaps measured by value added per worker, but sectoral differences remain significant. In Chile
in 1990, the gap between the highest productivity sector (public utilities) and the lowest productivity
sector (agriculture) was twelve, while the difference in raw wages between the minimum
(agriculture) and maximum (public utilities and finance) wage was three. The difference becomes
even smaller when controlling for individual characteristics, shrinking to 1.8. This gap has remained
almost constant in Chile between 1990 and 2003. That is, in 2003, an individual with the same
characteristics and education would have earned nearly 1.7 half times more if she would have moved
from community services (the lowest wage sector) to mining (the highest wages sector). In Peru in
1999, the gap between the highest productivity sector (public utilities) and the lowest productivity
sector (agriculture) was 23, while the difference in wages after controlling for individual
characteristics between the minimum (community services) and maximum (mining) wage was 2.8.
In 2005, the difference in wages after controlling for individual characteristics between the minimum
(agriculture) and maximum (mining) sector increased slightly to 2.9.




96
   Not all structural change is good. For example, productivity may be higher in sectors with monopoly power. A
reallocation to these sectors would contribute positively to structural change but would not necessarily promote growth
or enhance welfare (for a more detailed discussion, see Maloney 2012).

     5. 1.        Introduction

Since 2003, Latin America has experienced a period of economic resurgence, with strong output
growth and generally favorable macroeconomic conditions (Sosa et al. (2013)). Growth in the
LAC region reached an average of 4.2 percent per year from 2003 to 2012; after a slow down in
2013 (2.75 percent) and 2014 (projected at 2.25 percent), growth is expected to pick up again in
2015 (3 percent, IMF (2014)). These outcomes stand in contrast the cronic low rates of economic
growth registered in most Latin American countries in the last fifty years in particular, whereby
the ratio of average income per capita in Latin America and US decreased from one fourth in 1960
to one sixth in the early 2000s (IADB (2010)).The analysis of the roots of such underperformance
highlighted the role of low productivity growth in the region, despite not negligible rates of
investment in physical and human capital in the region. However, the positive aggregate
performance in recent year was found to be disproportionately due factor accumulation rather than
increases in factor productivity (Sosa et al. (2013)), which marked a clear distinction between Latin
America and emerging Asia. As a consequence, there is general consensus that faster productivity
growth in the region needs to be achieved in order for output growth to be sustainable in the future.

Adopting a micro-economic lens, this paper explores the reasons why LAC countries have been
lagging behind in their rate of productivity growth. Recent economic literature has linked low
aggregate productivity growth to either the performance of firms or to that of markets. Specifically
(Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Bartelsman et al. (2013a), for instance) have highlighted two distinct
channels driving cross-country differences in productivity: the capacity of markets to allocate
resources efficiently among firms, and the evolution of firm productivity itself. In other words,
differences in growth rates of aggregate productivity can been pinned down to changes in the
average firm level productivity, and changes in the relative importance of firms in their sector or
market. In presence of distortion to the efficient allocation of resources across firms and to the
process of entry and exit from the market, more productive firms may fail to grow and be limited
in their share, thus reducing aggregate productivity. This paper investigates both channels of
aggregate productivity growth using firm level data from the manufacturing sector in four Latin
American countries (i.e. Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Uruguay) and United States in the last
decade.102 We find that the allocation of employment in productive firms has improved in the
aggregate manufacturing sector during the 2000’s period, but that this aggregate picture hides
notable heterogeneity across industries and even more firm-level heterogeneity. This heterogeneity
is evident from Figure 5.1, where the distribution of the growth rate of labor productivity at the
firm level is more widespread than at the industry level.103

    At the firm level, we graph the ratio between the plant’s growth rate in a year, over the median growth rate of all
plants in the same four-digit sector. At the industry level we graph the ratio between the median growth rate in the
four-digit sector over the median growth rate in the economy.

In our analysis we decompose productivity growth and confirm the predominance of within-firm
productivity in determining overall aggregate productivity. For this reason, we further investigate
the process of productivity growth at the plant level, by analyzing the determinants of productivity
converge. More importantly, we distinguish between convergence with domestic frontier versus
convergence with “global” frontier.104 In a second stage, we explore what factors influence the
speed of convergence at the plant level. Our results suggest both in Colombia and Mexico, as well
as in US, evidence of productivity convergence, but this is only the case for convergence with
domestic frontier.105 We also find that the degree of “integration” of the plant with the global
economy does not influence speed of convergence for Colombia and Mexico, but we find it does
increase the speed of convergence with local frontier for US companies. Additionally, we find that
for all countries analyzed the most important determinant of productivity convergence at the firm
level is innovation effort measured as the firm-level expenditure shares in innovation and
investment in capital equipment. We also find that faster growth in the domestic frontier is also
translating in higher productivity growth at the plant level, which suggests the existence of
productivity spillovers. However, these spillovers appear to be weaker for those firms that are far
away from the frontier which is consistent with the idea that firms lacking absorptive capabilities
are less able to take advantage of potential knowledge spillovers.

Our paper is divided into four main sections aside from introduction and conclusion. In the first
section we present the most important economic literature which inspired the current paper. In the
second section, we present the data at hand, the first descriptive evidence of the catch up in firm
labor productivity, and the results of the productivity decomposition. This is followed by the
discussion of our estimation strategy (section 3) and of the results of the econometric analysis
(section 4). A data appendix completes the study.

   5. 2.       Literature

Aggregate productivity growth is normally estimated as the part of GDP growth which cannot be
explained by the growth in the inputs of production (employment, physical and human capital).
This unexplained component measures the country’s efficiency in using inputs to produce one unit
of output. Recent analyses, on the other hand, have investigated aggregate productivity as the result
of firm level processes, where firms are assumed to be heterogeneous in their productivity even
within narrowly defined sectors (Syverson (2004), Bartelsman et al. (2004, 2009), Foster et al.
(2008)). This heterogeneity in firm level productivity can reflect misallocation of resources across
firms: as low productivity firms have lower survival than high productivity ones, aggregate
(industry) productivity can improve by reallocating resources among incumbents with different
productivity levels, or between incumbents and firms entering or exiting the market (see, for a
recent survey of this literature, Restuccia and Rogerson (2013)). Moreover, cross country
differences in output per capita can be at least partially explained by the extent of such
misallocation (Banerjee and Duflo (2005), Restuccia and Rogerson (2008), Hsieh and Klenow
(2009)).

The availability of micro level data now permits to investigate the extent of such differences in the
link between misallocation and productivity at the cross country level (Bartelsman et al. (2004,
2013b)). In this paper we do so for various Latin American countries (i.e. Mexico, Colombia, Chile
and Uruguay) and compare it with US, exploiting the industry level productivity decomposition
proposed by Olley and Pakes (1996) (henceforth, OP). This decomposition divides aggregate
productivity into an unweighted average of firm-level productivity in the sector, and a covariance
term picturing the joint distribution of firm’s productivity and market share. The extent of resource
misallocation would is inferred by the covariance term, larger positive value indicate that more
productive firms use higher industry inputs shares. Increases in the covariance term would
therefore imply improvements in the allocation productive inputs (i.e. workers) across firms
(within the industry).

However, this decomposition does not distinguish between reallocation between incumbent and
reallocation due to churning (i.e. entry and exit of firms). By neglecting that entrants and exiters
can have substantially different productivity than incumbents, the OP decomposition therefore
understates the importance of creative destruction in the market. The literature has proposed
several measures to overcome this limitation, which usually break down productivity growth in
four components: the growth in productivity of the incumbents, the changes in market shares of
the incumbents, the contribution of entrants, and that of exiters (Baily et al. (1992), Griliches and
Regev (1995), Foster et al. (2001)). In our analysis, we rely on the dynamic decomposition
proposed by Melitz and Polanec (2012). The authors propose a clear extension of the OP static
decomposition which takes into account entry and exit. What is more, they show that previous
dynamic decompositions suffer from biases by construction, and therefore fail to appropriately
account for the contribution of entry and exit in aggregate productivity. Although the sign of such
bias is theoretically ambiguos, the authors show that previous decompositions underestimate the
role of survivors and overestimate that of entrants in the aggregate productivity of fast growing
economies.

The second part of this paper extends our analysis of the process of creative destruction by
investigating the determinants of firm-level productivity catch-up. Earlier literature on
productivity convergence has traditionally focused on countries or regions as units of observations
(Sala-i Martin (1996)), and their capability to bridge the gap with the highest productivity growth
among all other units, or the global technological frontier. Our study takes a more micro-level
approach instead, and evaluate the process of productivity convergence towards both national and
international frontier. This is the strategy followed by Girma and Kneller (2005) to study the
convergence process of the UK service sector, as well as by Alvarez and Crespi (2007) for the
Chilean manufacturing sector and Iacovone and Crespi (2010) for Mexico. Contrary to Griffith et
al. (2003) or Alvarez and Crespi (2007), however, we shall not define the catch up process only
with respect to the national frontier, but with the international frontier as well (Griffith et al. (2004),
Bartelsman et al. (2008a), Iacovone and Crespi (2010)). It seems rather implausible, especially for
fast developing countries in the 2000s, to define the technological frontier as the national one.
Although it may be true that many firms in these countries cannot compete with their best
international peers, it is very likely that a number of them is exposed to the international market
either through trade or foreign direct investment. For these firms, in light of the firm level
differences in degree of internationalization, the process of convergence to the frontier may be
substantially different across firms. What is more, in presence of differences in the evolution of
national and global technological frontier, the within country convergence to the national frontier
may be actually capturing biased by the absence of the convergence term towards international
frontier, which may be especially problematic for firms integrated with the global economy. That
is why we explore the extent to which exposure to the international market determine the speed of
convergence. Furthermore, similarly to Iacovone and Crespi (2010), we also investigate how the
catch up of firms with the best practice in their industry is affected by the degree of innovation,
technological investment and investment in human capital of the firm. We focus our analysis on
Latin American countries, thus building upon the contributions of Pages et al. (2009) and IADB
(2010) among others, which previously explored several aspects of productivity evolution in the
region.

      5. 3.       Descriptive Statistics

      5. 3. 1.    Data characteristics

This study focuses on the analysis of productivity growth and convergence in Colombia, Mexico
and the US.106 For Mexico, we rely on an unbalanced establishment level panel dataset which
tracks manufacturing plants known as the Annual Industrial Survey (EIA) for the years 2003 to
2011. The survey is collected annually by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics (INEGI), it
excludes firms with less than 15 employees, and aims at covering at least 85 percent of output in
the whole manufacturing sector.107 For Colombia the plant level information is obtained from the
Manufacturing Survey (EAM) collected by the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de
Estadistica (DANE), and it covers the universe of manufacturing firms with at least 10 employees
or at least 136.4 million Colombian pesos in revenues from sales, for the years 2000 to 2011.108
Plants are selected into the sample on the year of census (2003) for Mexico, or on a yearly basis

106
    A revised version of the paper will also include data for Chile, Uruguay.
107
    These statistics are for the year 2005. In year 2009, the survey covered 90 percent of manufacturing sales in Mexico.
108
    This is the threshold for the year 2012 and it changes yearly on the basis of the producer price index.

for Colombia, then followed over time. For Mexico, while this allows to construct a plant-level
panel, it also implies that the sample allows for limited entry in non-census years for Mexico
(usually when new firms are especially relevant in size). In Colombia, the DANE revised the
sample on the basis of other sources of information in 2008. Exit is, on the other hand, consistently
reported in both cases. The resulting sample (after cleaning) for Mexico contains 5782 plants in
2003 and 4499 in 2011; for Colombia, the sample covers 6925 plants in 2000 and 8988 in 2011.109
Plants are distributed in 231 four-digit industries according to the classification Scian (2002 and
2007) for Mexico, in 142 four-digit Isic 3.1 sectors for Colombia, and in 473 six-digit Naics
industries for the US.110

The surveys give access to information on all inputs of production and sources of revenues, by
breaking them down according to their international vs. domestic origin or destination. The main
outcome variable of interest is labor productivity or value added per worker, where value added is
computed as revenues from sales minus the cost of intermediate inputs and electricity. Information
on capital stock at book value and investment are also reported in the manufacturing surveys,
which allows to construct a measure of investment in technology (or net investment in capital
equipment which is not buildings). The Mexican one also includes data on expenditure in certain
forms of external innovation (i.e. patents, consultancy services, advisory services, etc.). We do not
have information on R&D expenditure for Mexico, but we do have it for Colombia by merging
the EAM with the Innovation Survey,111 and for the US merging the Business Research and
Development and Innovation Survey.112 All variables are deflated using the most disaggregated
deflator at our disposal, then transformed into US Dollars.113

Table 5.1 reports basic statistics for our sample for Mexico and Colombia, pooling over all years.
It highlights significant differences in the type of surveyed establishments. While the Mexican
sample covers relatively large plants, with 220 employees and 30.5 million USD in revenues per
year on average, plants in the Colombian dataset are significantly smaller on average (70
employees and 5 million USD). The within-country heterogeneity in productivity is also high, with
low productivity firms (bottom decile) producing 5 thousand USD per employee in Mexico (3.6
thousand USD for Colombia) versus almost 400 thousand USD in high productivity firms at the
top decile (163 thousand USD for Colombia). Differences in plants’ labor productivity are
unsurprisingly correlated to exposure to international trade and innovation. Only a fraction of
establishments engages in exporting (36 percent of plants export on average each year in our
Mexican sample, and 23 percent in the Colombian one), and for those that exports only 11 percent

    Mexican data are reported at the six-digit Scian level, Colombian one at the four digit level. In order to be able to
compare Colombian, Mexican and US data in the descriptive statistics, we constructed a conversion table between
Scian/Naics 2002 and Isic3.1 classification. This is discussed more in details in the appendix.
111
    This survey covers the years 2003-2010 and reports firm level information. In consideration of the fact that just 8
percent of observations are multiplant firms, we do not believe that inputing firm level expenditure at the plant level
is severely biasing our results.
112
    The innovation surveys in both Colombia and US collect information at the firm level, while our main accounting
data refers to establishments as observational units. In light of the relative scarcity of multi-plant firms in Colombia
(contrary to the US), we performed all our econometric analysis again on a sample of single-plant firms (tables are
not reported). The inference does not change with respect to the complete sample.

of revenues are due to exports on average for Mexico and 6 percent for Colombia. 39 percent of
plants import on average in a given year in Mexico and 19 percent in Colombia, but the expenditure
on imported intermediate inputs is a much lower fraction of revenues from sales, as this import
ratio is on average 7 percent in Mexico and 3 percent percent in Colombia. Furthermore,
engagement in innovation is even more limited, with expenditure on consulting services and
patents reaching 4 percent of revenues in Mexico, and essentially zero for Colombian plants on
average.114

In Tables 5.2 to 5.4 we propose similar statistics but for the sample of plants which engage in
twoway trade (Table 5.2), external innovation (Table 5.3), and investment in machinery and at
least one type of innovation (internal or external) (Table 5.4). Previous literature has already
established that trade and innovation are strongly correlated with productivity, a fact we will
exploit in our econometric analysis below. Our sample confirms this stylized fact that plants
engaged in international trade (in particular here, plants which both import and export goods) are
bigger than average in terms of sales, capital stock and employment on average, and they are more
productive. Furthermore, they spend in external innovation more than the average plant in Mexico
(expenditure reaches 7 percent of revenues on average), and this is driven by the intensity of
investment at the top of the distribution (the intensity of investments among last decile is 6 times
higher than the overall Mexico average, while a difference can be observed only at the top

114
   Note that the fall in the number of observations for the innovation variables is due to the fact that information on
innovation is altogether absent for some years in the sample (2000 to 2002, and 2011).

percentile of the distribution in Colombia). Two-way traders are also investing more often than
plants in the entire population in both countries of interest, although they do not invest more on
average, at least in machinery. Colombian firms seem to be investing a greater portion of their
revenues from sales than Mexican ones, both in the complete sample and in the sample of two-
way traders.

Similar characteristics are displayed by plants which do some external innovation (through
purchasing patents or consulting services), with even more pronounced differences with respect to
the average plant in the entire population (Table 5.3). The same can be said if the plant both invests
in new machinery and innovates, with the exception of labor productivity in Mexico: the
distribution of value added per employee in the latter type of plants is slightly to the left than that
of innovators.115 This is not the case for Colombia, where the average plant investing in new
equipment and in at least one of the two innovation activities is twice as productive than the
average plant in the entire sample, and the entire distribution is shifted to the right.

      5. 3. 2.     Distance from the frontier

Our analysis relies on the possibility of identifying a technological frontier serving as a benchmark
for the firm productivity. We compute the national frontier as the mean of the top quartile of the
distribution of value added per employee in the four digit industry and year. The global frontier is
similarly computed on the basis of the survey of U.S. manufacturing plants collected by the U.S.
Census Bureau.116 Figures 5.2 and 5.3 show the ratio between the global and local frontier at (two


115
   We define innovators those plants engaged in purchase of patents or consulting services.
116
   Choosing the mean of the top quartile is coherent with Bartelsman et al. (2008b). Alternatively, computing the
frontier based on the top decile would have reduced the number of available sector-year pairs for which a value for
the global (US) frontier could be issued, in light of the confidentiality constraints imposed by data distribution.


                                                        119
digit) sector level.117 Unsurprisingly, the US frontier is above the Mexican and Colombian ones in
all sectors, with the Colombian frontier lagging further behind than the Mexican one. On the other
hand, the distance between the two frontiers does not seem to have changed in a relevant way in
the considered time span, with the exception of the crisis years in Mexico in particular, where the
most productive firms (as an average of those at or above the top quartile) lost ground118 with
respect to their US peers.119 In Colombia, the distance between global and local frontier displays
a distinct inverted-U shape in most sectors. More importantly, in both countries substantial cross-
industry heterogeneity is also evident in the level of the distance, with sectors where the global
frontier is a higher multiple of the national one than others (for Mexico: leather, medical
equipment, wood; for Colombia: chemicals, communication equipment, medical equipment).120




117
    Sectors are divided in two graphs to enhance readability. Part (1) includes sectors which roughly correspond to
ISIC3.1 codes 15 to 28, part (2) the other manufacturing ones.
118
    While a general pattern, this does not apply to all sectors, as in the case of communication and electrical equipment
for Mexico.
119
    In principle, this increase in the distance could be due to both an increase in the value of the global frontier, or a
decrease in the domestic frontier. The value of the global frontier decreased on average across all sectors between
2007 and 2008, but it increased again starting from 2008. For Mexico and Colombia the decrease in domestic frontier
takes place between 2008 and 2009, i.e. one year later.
120
    There are no graphs for the US here as the global and local frontiers coincide by definition.

Despite the fact that both Mexican and Colombian frontier are away from the global one, in both
countries we still have a small number of plants that are highly productive at the “global” level.
Specifically, Figure 5.4 reports the number of plants which are more productive than the global
frontier (black bars), in each year. The grey bars show instead the number of plants which are
above the global frontier, as a percentage of the total number of plants in the same year. The latter
figure never exceeds 1 percent, and it has clearly been affected by the global economic crisis of
2008-2009. The relatively high percentage in 2008 in Mexico reflects the decrease in value of the
global frontier caused by the decrease in output in the US.121 If the number (and percentage) of
plants above the global frontier has reached the pre-crisis level in Colombia but not in Mexico,
these numbers are still considerably lower in Colombia than in Mexico.

121
   This result does not necessarily contradict what shown in the previous figure, as it may still be that more firms
exceed the international frontier despite a general decrease in the relative value of the local frontier with respect to the
global one.


                                                           123
As before, aggregate numbers display substantial industry heterogeneity. Figure 5.5 shows that the
percentage of plants which are more productive than the global frontier is substantially different
across two digit industries in a given year.122 Each bar represents the number of plants with higher
productivity than the frontier as a percentage of the total number of plants in the same two-digit
industry. It is clear that a number of sectors do not have any plant which performs better than the
frontier, while others have up to 2 and 5 percent such plants respectively in Mexico and Colombia.

Another way of showing the relative standing of Mexican and Colombian firms with respect to the
frontier is calculating the distance between the frontier and the median plant’s productivity.123
Figures 5.6 and 5.7 display this ratio for the five biggest and smallest sectors in the economy (in
terms of their gross deflated value added), as well as aggregating over all industries (first panel in
both part (a) and (b)). In all cases, the left vertical axis measures the distance with respect to the
global frontier, the right axis the distance with respect to the domestic frontier. Although both
distances often seem to move together, the magnitude of the distance is clearly different, with the
distance with respect to the global frontier always exceeding the distance with the domestic one
by a multiple of three to four times.

At the aggregate level, this picture suggests a small decrease in the distance from the global frontier
for Mexico and a relatively more noticeable one for Colombia, especially after 2003. The patterns
of convergence with respect to the domestic frontier instead are less clear. Overall, in the Mexico
the convergence process seems to have been negatively affected by the Great Recession, as shown
by the sudden increase in distance from frontier during the crisis years. Distances, however, clearly
differ across industries in both countries, ranging for Mexico from 2 to 5 for the local frontier, and
from 5 to 20 for the global one; in Colombia, the average distance of the median plant from the
global frontier can be more sizeable, reaching 60 in chemicals or communication equipment.
Similarly, patterns of convergence through time differ between sectors. In some sectors there is
clear evidence of divergence relative to both the local and global frontier (e.g. motor vehicles in
Mexico, communication equipment in Colombia), in others of convergence with respect to both
(e.g. non-metallic minerals in Mexico, fabricated metal in Colombia), and in others still of
divergence towards only one of the two frontiers (e.g. chemicals in Mexico, medical equipment in
Colombia). Figure 5.8 plots the distance (with respect to the local frontier only) for US firms: at
the aggregate, the distance from the frontier was lower in 2011 than in 1995, but the downward
trend seem to have reversed ever since 2004. On the other hand, the distance has been increasing
throughout the sample for four out of five of the biggest sectors in the economy, and mostly
decreasing for as many among the smallest sectors.




122
   The last year of the sample was chosen arbitrarily, but the same can be shown for other years in the sample.
123
   Recall that both domestic and global frontiers are calculated per each four-digit industry and year. The two-digit
graphs in this section are obtained as weighted averages of the ratio of frontier and median productivity in the four
digit Mexican sector, where the weights are the employment shares of the four digit sector in the two digit sector in
the same year. For the aggregate graph the weight is the employment share of each four digit sector in total
manufacturing in each year.

    5. 3. 3.      Productivity Decomposition

In this section we explore another aspect of industry heterogeneity, i.e. the extent by which
allocation of market shares towards more productive firms can explain the pattern of aggregate
productivity. To this purpose, we can redefine the aggregate labor productivity of industry j at
time t ,  jt , as the weighted average of firm-level labor productivity where the weights are
calculated as the share firm employment in total industry employment.124 Aggregate industry
                                                                               1
productivity can then be decomposed into unweighted mean productivity,  jt =
                                                                              n jt
                                                                                   ijt , and a
term capturing the covariance between firm productivity and firm size                         (s  ijt    s jt )(ijt  jt ) .

With s ijt  0 representing the weight (i.e. importance) of firm i in industry                   j , and s jt = 1 , one
                                                                                                                    n jt
can write:
                                jt =  jt  (sijt  s jt )(ijt  jt )               (1)

This productivity decomposition was first proposed by Olley and Pakes (1996)125 and has the
advantage of being easily interpretable. Aggregate productivity will grow because average
productivity grows (“within firm component”) or because market reallocation increases the size
(i.e. weight) of more productive firms. In fact, the higher the covariance between productivity and
size is, the higher is market efficiency, because a bigger share of the industry employment is
attributed to the most productive firms. Given a fixed number of firms with heterogeneous
productivity, shifting employment away from low productivity to high productivity firms increases
both aggregate productivity and the covariance between firm efficiency and size.

Figure 5.9 plots the trend in aggregate productivity (value added per employee) for the Mexican,
Colombian and US manufacturing sector (left vertical axis) as well as the relative size of the
covariance term as a percentage of aggregate productivity (right hand vertical axis).126 With the
exception of the dip caused by the Great Recession, Mexican manufacturing sector experienced
(on aggregate) a substantial growth in labor productivity in the period considered (from 55
thousand USD per employee in 2003 to 88 thousand USD in 2011, approximately). The same can
be said for the US, which displays almost double the value added per employee than Mexico, and
which suffered a smaller decrease in labor productivity during the crisis years. Colombian
aggregate productivity also increased from 35 thousand to 50 thousand USD per employee

124
    An important part of the literature computes this decomposition using output instead of employment weights. It is
mostly the case, however, that output weights are used when productivity is estimated as total factor productivity
(TFP) (Bartelsman et al. (2009), Bartelsman et al. (2013b)). As we are focusing our analysis on labor productivity
only, we prefer using employment weights. In our context the weights measure the extent to which the labor input is
allocated across firms
125
    Note that the subscript for the country is omitted to simplify the notation.
126
    Notice that this is the aggregate productivity in the overall manufacturing, i.e. the weighted average of the aggregate
2-digit sectoral productivity  jt across sectors, where the weights are constructed as the share of sector employment
in total manufacturing employment. Consistently, the covariance term is also measured as the weighted average of the
2-digit sector covariances.

                                                           128
between 2000 and 2011. In Mexico, this was also associated to an increase in the covariance term
between employment and productivity, thus signalling a general improvement in the allocation of
employment shares across plants in the manufacturing sector. The same cannot be said in
Colombia, where the last few years have seen a deterioration of the allocative efficiency of the
markets. No clear pattern is identifiable for the US. It is important to notice, on the other hand, that
the covariance term is generally relatively small in Mexico (at most 22 percent in the aggregate)
and even smaller in the US (at most 8 percent of aggregate productivity), so that productivity
growth in the country seems to be driven mainly by improvements in the within firm component.
The covariance term in Colombia, on the contrary, always represented at least 30 percent of
aggregate productivity throughout the sample.

Very similar conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the economy-wide decomposition
which we report in figure 5.10 and which takes the industry level as a point of observation. In these
graphs we explore whether aggregate productivity (the same as in the previous decomposition
graphs) is mostly determined by the (unweighted) average productivity growth of sectors, or by an
improvement in the allocation of employment across sectors.127 We find that the contribution of
cross-sector reallocation to aggregate productivity in Mexico is even lower than in the within-
industry case which we reported in 5.9, reaching at most 5 percent of aggregate productivity in
Mexico. For Colombia and the US, this covariance is negative in most years, suggesting that
employment moved from more productive manufacturing sectors to less productive ones.128
127
      In formal terms, the covariance is here a function of the difference between the aggregate productivity at industry
level  jt and its average across industries       t     on the one side, and the difference between the employment share of
                                                  n jt                                                         1
the industry in total manufacturing s jt =               and the cross-industry average of such shares s t =     ( s jt ) . Hence
                                                  nt                                                           J
covariance    =  j ( jt  t )(s jt  s t ) .
128
    Negative values for the covariance term imply that more productive firms are downsizing (or doing so faster than
less productive firms). When this is associated with aggregate productivity growth, such growth is achieved by the


                                                                 130
On the other hand, Figure 5.9 hides significant heterogeneity across sectors once again, as far as
both aggregate industry productivity and the extent of within-sector misallocation are concerned.
In Figure 5.11 to 5.13 we focus on the within-sector reallocation process, and report the graphs for
a few sectors as a way of examples, while grouping them with respect to the trend in their
covariance term. Aggregate industry productivity is upward sloping in almost all sectors, but it
obviously differs in levels.129 Despite an overall positive trend, covariances can still significantly
decrease in selected sectors, or even turn negative (e.g. apparel and chemicals in Mexico, apparel
or leather in Colombia, Food or Rubber in the US). With the exception of very few sectors (e.g.
motor vehicles), the covariance term remains relatively small with respect to within-firm
productivity in all Mexican sectors. In Colombia, almost all sectors experienced a decrease in the
covariance term except for the production of coke and oil, and of transportation equipment (hence
the omission of the graph with increasing covariance sectors). In the US, only one sector (other
transportation equipment) shows a clear upward trend in the covariance term (figure not reported).

We look for confirmation of these descriptive evidence by adopting an alternative decomposition
for productivity growth rather than for productivity levels as this allows us to take into account the
role of entry and exit. Equation 1 keeps the number of firms constant and analyzes productivity in
levels. When not controlling for entry and exit, however, it would be possible to observe changes
in the covariance term which do not appropriately reflect changes in the allocative efficiency of
the economy. Consider, for instance, the exit of a low productivity firm, whose employees are
hired by a high productivity firm: aggregate productivity would increase, while the covariance
term would decrease. In the dynamic form of decomposition, on the other hand, changes in
aggregate productivity can be decomposed in a term capturing the performance of incumbent
firms, that of firms entering and exiting the market, and of the consequent changes in market shares
of each firm in the sector. Accordingly, aggregate productivity shifts can be broken down into four
components: (i) changes in the average productivity of the incumbents which stay in the market in
all years (or “survivors”); (ii) changes in market shares among these survivors; (iii) the
contribution of entrants in the second period; and (iv) the contribution of exiting firms. As we
mentioned earlier in the literature section, we follow Melitz and Polanec (2012) and extend the
Olley and Pakes (1996)decomposition, so that:

       jt =  pjt  Covpt  (sijt )(Ejt  Pjt )  (sijt1 )(Pjt1   Xjt1 )      (2)

                                                    133
where subscript p refers to survivors, e to entrants in t and x to exiters in t  1 . The first and
second terms on the right hand side measure the contribution of survivors to aggregate (sectoral)
productivity, which is decomposed according to Olley and Pakes (1996) into a change in average
productivity of the survivors between t and t  1 , and a term for the change in covariance between
market share and productivity for the same category of firms and timeline. The contribution of
entrants (respectively, exiters) is a function of the share of the firm’s output in total entrants’
(respectively, exiters’) output in the industry,                s
                                                              iE ijt
                                                                        and      s
                                                                               iX ijt1
                                                                                         ,   and of the difference
between aggregate productivity of the entrants (respectively, exiters) and that of survivors:
( Ejt   Pjt ) and (  Pjt 1   Xjt 1 ) .130

Figure 5.14 reports the dynamic decomposition of the overall manufacturing sector in Mexico,
Colombia and the US, by year. Each component of the decomposition is made scale-independent
and expressed in terms of aggregate productivity growth, following the appendix in Melitz and
Polanec (2012). Once again we find that the within-firm productivity component (the change in
productivity of the incumbents or survivors) is more important than all other components. For
Mexico and the US, it is also positive in all years except the crisis years. For Colombia, on the
other hand, the pattern is much less clear. The contribution of the survivors’ covariance term is
relatively small and can change in sign in both Latin American countries, but it’s consistently
positive (albeit small) in the US. The positive sign in the crisis year, especially in Mexico, hints at
a pro-competitive effect of the crisis on incumbents. While we refrain from interpreting the results
for entrants in light of the data limitation, we note that the contribution of exiters to aggregate
productivity growth is usually small and volatile for both Mexico and Colombia, with the
exception, once again, of the crisis years for Mexico, where their component is negative. This
suggests that the crisis has negatively especially affected high productivity plants as well, so that
the aggregate productivity of exiters is higher than the survivors’ one. Exit in the US, on the other
hand, is consistently productivity-enhancing throughout the sample period, while entrants decrease
productivity growth as their productivity is lower than the of average incumbent.

   In order to properly compute changes in productivity between t  1 and t the fact that a firm enters in t  1 or
that a firm exits in t is irrelevant, as both cases will be captured by the terms referring to survivor firms.

   5. 4.        Econometric Estimation

The importance of the within-firm component of aggregate productivity growth motivates the
second part of our analysis, where we investigate the process of convergence of firm level
productivity to the technological frontier, where the latter is defined both at national and global
level, as described before. With this micro-level approach, we stress the heterogeneity of
productivity growth between firms in the same industry. This is consistent with a model where
firms have different capacity to absorb knowledge, as well as in their strategic decisions about
integrating with global economy or investing in knowledge acquisition, and therefore differ in their
speed of convergence towards the technological frontier. Let us therefore define the production
function at the firm (plant) level in a standard way, as:

                                   Yijt = Aijt F ( Lijt , K ijt )    (3)




                                                               135
where F(.) is the plant’s production function transforming labor and capital inputs ( L and K ) into
output ( Y ), and Aijt is an index capturing technical efficiency or, equivalently, the plant’s stock
of knowledge capital131. Following Griffith et al. (2003, 2004),we therefore consider a very general
specification of knowledge spillover linking the stock of knowledge in (non-frontier) firm i in
sector j at time t with the frontier. This reads:

                                         Aijt =  ( A jt 1 ; A jt
                                                                NF
                                                                   ; A GF
                                                                       jt ; X ijt 1 )
                                                                                                                          (4)

The plant’s productivity this year ( Aijt ) is a function of the same outcome last year ( A jt 1 ), the
domestic technological frontier ( A jt
                                    NF
                                       ) and the global one ( A GF
                                                                jt
                                                                   ), and a set of plant characteristics
the previous year ( X ijt 1 ), the most important of which is innovation effort. The productivity gap
between plant i and the frontier is the measure of potential technological transfer. Assuming a
Cobb Douglas functional form and constant returns to scale for production and knowledge
formation, log-linearizing and taking first differences, we can derive our estimation equation:

therefore 1 and  2 , which estimate the response of convergence to the plant’s distance from the

Following previous studies (Griffith et al. (2003), Iacovone and Crespi (2010)), we assess whether
catch up changes in magnitude and sign (through  3 and  4 ) when firms invest in innovation,
engage in international trade, invest in human capital or in new capital equipment, activities which
are captured by Z ijt 1 . Technological upgrade (either in the form of innovation or investment in
capital equipment) can indeed increase the speed of convergence to the frontier (Griffith et al.
(2004)). It also seems likely that firms which are exposed to international competition and have
access to international technology are more likely to converge faster to the frontier than firms
which are not. Finally, firms which employ more skilled workforce are also likely to manage the
process of technological upgrade more successfully. All regressors in our specifications are indeed
lagged once in respect of the functional assumptions stated in 3. This also helps in reducing the
possibility of endogeneity (reverse causality) between labor productivity and the main regressors
of interest.

We estimate equation 6 both using OLS and fixed effect. The latter specification has the advantage
of providing estimates of the main coefficients of interest which are net of plant-specific time
invariant unobservable characterstics. Furthermore, reporting both OLS and FE specifications is
especially important in our context, where the existence of a lagged dependent variable on the right
hand side can result in inconsistent estimates for both OLS and FE estimators. Indeed, the distance
term (which enters alone and in interaction with other plant-level covariates) is a (reverse) function
of the plant’s productivity in the previous year. For OLS, this form of endogeneity biases the
coefficient downwards, according to Bond (2002). The fixed effect estimator, on the contrary, is
upward biased, as the technology gap and the error term are positively correlated. In the lack of an
appropriate instrumental variable specification taking care of the lagged dependent variable
endogeneity, we report both OLS and FE estimates, highlighting that the “true” coefficient should
lie between the OLS (lower bound) and the FE (upper bound) estimates.

Equation 5 and 6 are estimated separately for each country which is covered in this study, as we
cannot stack information from the various countries in one single dataset.132

      5. 5.      Estimation Results

Table 5.5 to 5.7 report the results of estimating equation 5 with both OLS and FE, respectively,
for Mexico, Colombia and the US.133 For the first two specifications (columns 1 to 4) in Mexico
and Colombia, we show that including only one distance term (distance from the local or global
frontier respectively) would lead to biased estimates for the convergence parameter. In fact, plants
would appear to converge both towards the domestic and the global frontier.134 When introducing
both distances, on the other hand (columns 5 and onwards) the coefficient on the firm distance
from the global frontier becomes either insignificant or negative, thus suggesting lack of
convergence with respect to the global frontier. On the contrary, the coefficient of the domestic

132
    This is due to confidentiality reasons and rules governing access to data for each one of the countries analyzed.
133
    The reported number of observations and firms is approximated to comply with restrictions in data distribution at
the US Census.
134
    A comparison of the speed of convergence between global and local frontiers is invalidated by the fact that the
“true” coefficient lies between the OLS and FE ones, and we cannot assess whether endogeneity biases the coefficient
on the distance from the local frontier differently than that on the distance from the global frontier.

distance is always positive and significant, even in more complex specifications where we include
our most important controls (lagged firm size and capital-labor ratio): Mexican and Colombian
plants appear to convergence towards the domestic most productive firms, but not towards the
absolute (international) best practices. Catch up with the (local and only) frontier is found for US
firms as well.135




135
   In order to enhance the comparability between Mexican and Colombian results on the one side, and US results on
the other, we ran our estimation with a single frontier for Mexico and Colombia as well. Results are reported in
Appendix 2, and commented further below.

Columns 7 to 13 in Tables 5.5 and 5.6, as well as columns 3 to 8 in Table 5.7 are estimated
including the change in industry (local or global) frontier between t and t  1 , as in equation
5 and 6. The estimates of these technological shifters should be interpreted as the spillovers
from the frontier itself and the plant’s productivity: the general level of productivity in the
domestic or international market can only influence the productivity of the firm if there are
technological spillovers. From Tables 5.5 to 5.7 it is evident that spillovers from the domestic
frontier are positive and strong, contrary to spillovers from the global frontier; for Colombia,
a faster change in the global frontier has a negative impact on productivity growth at the plant
level. In another specification, we also introduce an interaction term between the distance from
the frontier and the spillover term and the results confirm the absence of any significant effect
as far as spillovers from the global frontier are concerned, but not from the domestic frontier:
when further away from the domestic frontier, the spillover effect on productivity growth is
significantly lower.136 This results is consistent with the concept of absorptive capabilities and
the idea that firms that are further away from the tecnology frontier may be unable to benefit
from spillovers.137 We conclude the analysis of Tables 5.5 to 5.7 by highlighting that more
capital intensive plants seem to enjoy higher productivity growth in all countries, while there
is a positive premium due to size (relative to small firms) in Mexico only.

A key objective of our analysis is to identify whether certain firm characteristics alter the speed
of convergence. In particular, we will focus on the degree to which firms invest in knowledge
and technological upgrade, and the extent to which these are integrated with the global
economy. We do so by including an interaction term between the plant’s distance from the
frontier and these covariates of interest, as in equation 6.

Tables 5.8 to 5.10 highlight that innovation effort and investment in new equipment influence
plants’ productivity convergence. In fact, plants’ productivity convergence in Mexico is
increased by greater investments in machinery (specification 1 and 3) and in expenses to
purchase external knowledge (specification 3). On the other hand, convergence towards global
frontier is not influenced by investment in innovation. For Colombia, the speed of convergence
to the domestic frontier is positively affected by innovation only (specifications 2 to 5), and
not by purchases of capital equipment (specifications 1, 4 and 5). Internal innovation efforts
are more effective in increasing the speed of productivity convergence toward the domestic
frontier than purchase of external innovation (specifications 4 and 5). As far as the US are
concerned, we find a positive (but not very robust) role of investment in stimulating
productivity catch up; innovation, on the other hand, even reduces the speed of convergence
when far away from the frontiere. When at the frontier, though (zero distance), internal
innovation positively contributes to productivity growth.

In Table 5.11 we report only the estimates for the interaction terms, across multiple
specifications, when only one interaction variable is introduced in each specification.138 In both
Mexico and Colombia, paying workers more (on average) while holding all other plant’s
feature constant (and in particular capital intensity and distance from the frontier) significantly
decrease the speed of catch-up toward the local frontier. In Colombia, the same applies for
convergence to the global frontier. The differences in cost of skilled vs. unskilled employees
impact productivity growth positively in the US and negatively in Colombia.139 These signs
are confirmed when only including interactions with the local frontier (see Appendix 2, table
A5.22). In a context where supply of skills is especially limited such as in Colombia this ratio
is capturing this scarcity and the fact that firms have to pay a high premium to hire skilled
workers which increases their costs. In the US instead, where the skill supply constraints is
much less binding, this ratio is likely to capture the decision of the firm to invest in a more
skilled workforce.140 Trade, on the other hand, does not influence the speed of convergence
towards the global frontier in either Colombia nor Mexico. On the opposite, it decreases the
speed of convergence to the local frontier in Colombia, while it increases it in the US (even if
the two estimated models are different).141 This difference in the results could be determined
by the different pattern of trade between US on the one side, and Colombia and Mexico on the
other.142 The nexus trade-productivity has been at the center of a large literature and our results
are consistent with more recent work suggesting that where a firm exports and how it is
engaged in international trade it matters for its effect on productivity (De Loecker (2007), Bai
et al. (2013), Bastos and Silva (2010)). These results are robust to alternative measures of
integration and separating imports from exports.




138
    For example, the first two columns (the interaction terms for external innovation) report the same results as in
specification 2 of the previous tables.
139
    This metrics is computed as the ratio of costs of all skilled employees in the plant over the costs of all unskilled
employees.
140
    Ideally we would like to control for local availability of skilled workers to confirm our interpretation but these
data are not available.
141
    Our measure for trade is the ratio of revenues generated by international trade over total revenues from sales,
where trade is either import or export.
142
    Differences may of course derive also from the differences in the estimated models. However, while looking
at Table A5.22 in Appendix 2, where we only include interactions with the local frontier for Mexico and Colombia
as well, we find different significance and sign with respect to the US.

Finally, in Tables 5.12 and 5.13, we include trade and innovation interaction terms in the same
specification (specifications 1), and all interactions together (specifications 2 and 3). In this
horse-race between trade and innovation we find that trade does not seem to affect the speed
of productivity convergence with neither global nor domestic frontier in either Mexico nor
Colombia, but it does so in the US once again. Further, greater expenditure in innovation
(relative to sales) increases the speed of catch up toward the domestic frontier in both countries,
whether measured as purchase of external knowledge (Mexico) or R&D (Colombia).143 These
results confirm that plant productivity convergence to the domestic frontier is slowed down by
higher average wages in all three countries of analysis, and by the higher wage gap between
skilled and unskilled workers in Colombia while not in the US.

Finally, as a robustness check, to control for the possibility that our results are driven by
reversion to the mean,144 we re-estimate equations 5 and 6 using four-year changes (refer to
Appendix 1 for the relevant tables). The sign on the main coefficients of interest remains the
same, with the exception of the speed of convergence toward the global frontier, which turns
insignificant for Mexico as well.145 Once again the only firm-level characteristic which still
has a positive impact on plant-level productivity convergence is innovation effort (external
innovation for Mexico, internal innovation for Colombia). The negative impact of higher
wages is robust to this specification, too. Results for the US, on the other hand, are somewhat
less consistent with respect the specifications looking at year-on-year changes: investment
seems to be the only significant determinant of catch up in this scenario.




143
    In view of the strong correlation between R&D and external innovation, it is possible that the coefficient on
external innovation in Mexico is capturing the effect of internal innovation as well, which is absent in the Mexican
specifications. As R&D expenditure information is unavailable in the Mexican data, we cannot improve on these
results.
144
    After receiving a productivity shock, a plant may move back to its long term productivity pattern (mean
reversion). Exploiting year-on-year changes may increase the probability that our coefficients attribute the effect
of mean reversion to convergence.
145
    Notice that the estimates for some covariates were omitted from the Colombian table (but not from the
estimation) for layout purposes.

As a further robustness check, we estimate baseline and simple interaction specifications with
System GMM correcting for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in the errors, and for small
sample biases (Windmeijer correction).146 The results of these specifications are contained in
Table A5.20 in Appendix 1. All models except for 4 b use the same number of lags as
instruments for the endogeneous variables, where the growth in the frontier and the level
variable for the interaction variable (e.g. trade) are considered predetermined, while the
distances and the cross products between distances and the interaction variable are considered
endogeneous. Specification 4 b is included to improve on the failure of specification 4 a to
pass the Hansen test of joint validity of the instruments. The existence of catch up to the local
frontier is confirmed. Investment in capital goods positively affects it even when expenditure
in external innovation is also taken into consideration. Innovation, on the other hand, is no
longer significantly impacting convergence to the local frontier when included together with
investment, contrary to what we found when not taking into account the existence of
endogeneity in the regressors. Trade and wages do not seem to be affecting convergence at all.

To conclude, we also re-estimate equation 6 where Z jt is measured at industry level (rather
than plant level). In particular, we are interested in assessing whether higher levels of allocative
efficiency at the industry level does affect the plant’s speed of convergence toward the
technology frontier. We find no evidence in this direction (ref. Tables 5.14 to 5.16): the
coefficient on the covariance interaction term is never significant for both OLS and FE in any
of the countries. On the other hand, higher levels of productivity dispersion in the industry (as
captured by the coefficient of variation) significantly reduce the speed of catching up toward
the local frontier in all countries, while they do so towards the global frontier in Colombia only
(and not in Mexico). When at the frontier, higher productivity dispersion, on the other hand,
implies higher productivity growth for Colombia and Mexico, but not (unambiguously) for the
US.

   5. 6.        Conclusions

Understanding the driver of productivity growth is a first order question in Latin America as
growth in the last decade as been mostly driven by favorable external conditions which may
not continue forever. Historically productivity growth in Latin America has been sluggish and
the region has not been able to keep the pace of productivity growth in its northern neighbor,
the United States.

For the first time we have performed a comparative analysis of productivity convergence at
the firm-level for various Latin American countries and the US. Our analysis has focused on
the decade of the 2000s and has been organized around two main questions.

First, we evaluated the extent to which aggregate productivity growth (in the manufacturing
sector) is driven by growth in the productivity at the firm-level or by reallocation of
employment shares across firms. Our results are very clear and show that if we want to
understand productivity growth during the 2000s we need to focus on firm-level productivity
growth as this contributed the most to overall productivity growth. Reallocation between firms,



                                             154
within sectors, is a weak force of productivity growth. Even further, reallocation between
sectors is an even weaker source of growth.

Second, building on the previous result, we zoomed in on the determinants of productivity
catch-up at the firm level to evaluate the extent to which firms convergence with the
“technology frontier”, and even more to analyze the “drivers” of productivity catch up.
Uniquely, for the various Latin American countries in this study, we are able to assess not only
convergence towards the “domestic frontier”, measured as the average productivity of most
productive firms in the sector (at 4 digits ISIC), but also convergence towards the “global
frontier”, measured the average productivity of most productive US firms in the sector (at 4
digits ISIC). Our results suggest that while firms do convergence towards the domestic frontier
and there are spillovers arising from the growth of the domestic frontier, unfortunately no
convergence happens with respect to the global frontier. Finally, from a policy perspective an
especially crucial result is that what seems to be increasing the speed of convergence with the
domestic frontier is investment to expand the innovation and technological capabilities of
firms, no effect comes from integration with trade for Latin American countries while on the
opposite trade appears beneficial for US companies to accelerate their convergence with the
domestic frontier.

From our analysis the picture that emerges for Mexico and Colombia is that of a situation
where very few firms exist that are at the “global frontier” and catch up is limited to converging
towards the local frontier. In a context where the local frontier is not converging with the global
frontier this is an especially worrying situation for the Latin America manufacturing firms.

In conclusion, given the importance of innovation and technological capabilities for
productivity catch up at the firm level, our results point towards an agenda of research and
policy to understand how to develop technological capabilities to speed up the convergence
with the frontier both in Mexico and Colombia. At the same time, these results raise the
question of why reallocation appears to be so limited in explaining overall productivity growth.

We have access to two plant-level panel datasets, one for Colombia (Encuesta Anual
Manufacturera - EAM) and one for Mexico (Encuesta Industrial Anual - EIA), thanks to the
respective national institutes of statistics (DANE and INEGI). These datasets contain accounting
information on plants in the manufacturing sector for the years 2000-2011 for Colombia, and 2003-
2011 for Mexico. We also match the plant-level information of the EAM with the annual survey
on innovation activities of Colombian manufacturing firms (Encuesta de Desarrollo e Innovación
Tecnológica en la Industria Manufacturera - EDIT) for the years 2003-2010. Finally, we have
access to the US Annual Manufacturing Survey at the US Census, for the years 1995-2011. In this
appendix we supplement the information on eligibility and coverage of the manufacturing surveys
we provided in paragraph 2.1.

Data Cleaning

In order to proceed with our analysis, we needed our main variable of interest to be non-missing
in all plants. That is why we dropped all observations without information for value added per
employee, as well as industry classification (which is needed to issue descriptive statistics and to
merge the values of the global frontier). We made sure that our data are reliable by eliminating
observations in which employment was reported to be negative. We treated the presence of
extreme values in the resulting sample by truncating the distribution of value added and growth in
value added at the 1 and 99 percent.

What is more, we made sure that the sample used to issue tables of descriptive statistics and
productivity decompositions was the same as the one of the baseline regressions in Tables 5.5 and
5.6. Since these regressions take value added per employee in logarithm, we also excluded
observations with negative or zero value added. In a further effort to limit the extent of
misreporting, we also dropped observations with positive value added but zero employment; as a
consequence, we excluded the possibility of sole proprietorship, which we deemed more unlikely
in manufacturing.

A final constraint in the Colombian and Mexican data was imposed after merging the values for
the global frontier. Evidently, there were four-digit sectors for which a value of the global frontier
was available, but which were not existing in the countries of operation (in a given year or
throughout the sample): the values of the global frontier in these sectors were discarded without
loss of information for Colombian or Mexican data. Viceversa, there were also cases (3 percent of
the cleaned sample) in which the four-digit industry code was available in the main datasets of
interest, but not in the global frontier data. It mostly happened in sectors-year pairs for which a
value of the frontier could not be issued, in compliance to the US Census Bureau data protection
rules.

Industry Classification and Conversion

We relied on industry information contained in the EAM for Colombia, in the EIA for Mexico,
and in the AMS for the US. Each of these surveys follows a different industry classification: the
EAM classifies plants according to a four-digit ISIC3 classification specifically adapted to the



                                                 163
Colombian context; the EIA uses a six-digit classification inspired by the US NAICS2002 and
2007 classification (SCIAN 2002, 2007); we elaborate US data based on the six-digit NAICS2002
classification. Using three different industry classifications would have hindered the cross-country
comparison of descriptive statistics and productivity decompositions. What is more, we needed
the US-based information to calculate Mexican and Colombian plant-level distances from the
global frontier, where the value of the frontier was computed from a statistical moment of the firm
productivity distribution at the industry level. As the Naics2002-Isic3 (or 3.1) conversion implies
numerous many-to-many correspondences, we created a new industry classification for
manufacturing, which could include all national classifications, on the basis of existing Naics2002-
Naics2007,       Naics-Scian,      Isic3(Colombia)-Isic3.1(International),       and      Naics2002-
Isic3.1(International) conversion tables.

We obtain a single classification inspired (but not coinciding) to the international Isic3.1
classification, which contains 104 four-digit classes and which we call NewInd hereafter. One
Isic3.1 four-digit class (out of 122) and 7 six-digit Naics2002 classes (out of 473) have no
correspondence in the new classification. All statistics in the paper requiring an industry
declination (including the computation of the global frontier) are issued according to NewInd.

In constructing NewInd, we first converted the national classifications into either Naics2002 or
Isic3.1. This proved to be a relatively straight-forward task, due to the existence of one-to-one
conversions for almost all industries in each country. A one-to-many correspondence between a
four-digit Isic3.1 and a six-digit Naics2002 code also resulted in the use of the Isic3.1 code (this
happened for 281 out of 473 Naics manufacturing classes). In taking into consideration the many-
to-many correspondences between Naics2002 and Isic3.1, on the other hand, we followed these
priciples:

   1. When one of the multiple Isic3.1 codes corresponding to a single Naics2002 code was not
classified as manufacturing in the Isic3.1 classification, we dropped this Isic3.1 code altogether.
This happened for 8 six-digit Naics codes.
   2. When the Naics2002 classification is specific enough, we searched for the corresponding
products in the Isic3.1. A description table for the Isic3.1 code can be found here:
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/doc02/isic.pdf.
   3. When in doubt about the attribution of a certain six-digit Naics code to an Isic code, we also
took into consideration the meaning of the five- and four-digit Naics code.
   4. When the “predominant meaning” of a Naics code was clear once aggregating two or more
of the proposed four-digit Isic codes in the Naics-Isic conversion table, we merged the different
Isic codes. We limited the number of cases in which this happened, as it reduced the number of
final available industry codes in NewInd. In most cases, the merged Isic codes refer to the same
two- or three-digit Isic class.
   5. We dropped 7 Naics six-digit codes, whose meaning could not be linked to any single Isic
or combination of Isic codes.

Deflation

All financial information in the different manufacturing surveys is reported in nominal terms. We
therefore deflate these values with an appropriate deflator in base 2005. We then convert them to



                                                164
thousand US dollars using the appropriate (yearly) exchange rate from the World Bank. As the
values of the global frontier were computed in thousand USD, we converted them into the national
currencies before merging them and calculating the plant-frontier distance.

So as to deflate domestic sales and export sales, we use six-digit producer index prices for
Mexico,147 and a manufacturing-level producer price index for Colombia. 148 As far as domesticly
sourced material inputs are concerned, we use the appropriate four-digit PPI (based on the CMAE
classification) for Mexico, and a manufacturing-wide deflator for Colombia. Imported materials
in both Colombia and Mexico are deflated using the manufacturing-wide US price of exports of
non-agricutural supplies and intermediate goods (available on the US Census webpage) once
adjusted by the USD/country currency exchange rate. Expenditure for electricity was deflated
using the producer price index for the electricity sector in both countries. Finally, we used the
consumer price index to deflate both labor costs and expenditure for innovation.

The deflation of most capital investment is based for both countries on three-digit price indexes
for investment from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gove/mfp/mprtech.pdf),
which we adjust by the exchange rate between USD and the country currency. The BLS provides
prices deflators for different types of investment: all capital goods, equipment, structures, land,
intellectual property products, inventories. We exploit the first three prices for, respectively, all
investments, invesmtment in machinery, and investment in buildings. As far as ICT capital
investment is concerned, we use the price of gross output for the “information-communications-
technology-producting industries” elaborated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis149 and adjusted
by the exchange rate. We deflated investment in transportation equipment by the country-specific
producer price index for the transportation sector.

Variable Construction

Our main outcome variable relies on the existence of value added at the plant level. As this is not
directly reported in the dataset, we constructed it as the sum between (deflated) revenues from
sales, minus the (deflated) cost of raw (either domestic or imported) materials and the (deflated)
cost of electricity. If any component of this sum is missing, the result is also missing.

The EAM and EIA report the plant’s capital stock at book value. However, this is not the actual
use value of the capital for the plant, but rather the result of the depreciated value at which such
capital was purchased. A better measure of the value of capital would be its replacement value,
but we do not have access to it. This is why we assume that the book value in the first year of the
sample (i.e. in 1995 for the US, 2000 for Colombia, and 2003 for Mexico) corresponds to the
capital replacement value. We then construct the value of capital for the following years using the
Perpetuary Inventory Method (PIM) according to the following equality:

                                          K ijt = K ijt 1 (1   jt 1 )  I ijt 1

147
    These are published on the INEGI website.
148
    At the moment of writing, a more disaggregated PPI time series is available from 2006 onwards only.
149
    This is a synthetic sector covering hardware and software producing industries including computer and electronic
production, software publishing, telecommunication, data processing, internet publishing, web portals, computer
system design and related services.


                                                            165
for t [1997,2011       ] for the US, t [2001,2011  ] for Colombia and t [2004,2011    ] for Mexico.
I ijt 1 stays for investment, or the purchase of new capital goods (which is reported in the datasets),
and K ijt is the result of the calculation of capital stocks in the year.  jt is the depreciation rate of
capital. Both EAM and EIA contain information on depreciation rates by type of capital. So as to
limit the impact of possible misreporting, in the PIM we use the median of the two-digit sector
depreciation rate from the data, where values above 100 percent and below 0 percent of capital
stock were winsorized. Once we obtained a time series for the capital stock of each type of capital
(buildings, equipment, ICT, transportation), we aggregated them into two variables, one for total
capital and another for total capital except buildings and structures.

A final note is allocated to the creation of the innovation variables. We have information on
expenditure for research and development (new and improved processes or products, which we
call internal innovation) only for Colombia and the US. In Mexico, the external innovation variable
covers the expenditure for the exploitation of the rights connected to a copyright, patent, brand or
know-how. In Colombia, the external innovation variable is obtained as the sum of: expenditure
for the purchase of R&D which was carried out by others, expenditure for patents and copyright,
fees for technical assistance and consulting on technological know-how.

Entry and Exit

We define a plant appearing for the first time in the unclean sample an entrant. However, as we
mentioned in paragraph 2.1, the Mexican EIA does not take into account entry in a systematic
way: updates to the sample are carried out in presence of sizeable plants entering the market, or in
case the number and coverage of plants in a sector drop below the mandatory minimum of the
year. We therefore observe very limited entry in years other than the first year of the sample (2003).
Accounting for entry in the Colombian survey is also problematic, as the methodology to update
the sample changed in 2008. Until 2007, the EAM was updated on the basis of mini-surveys which
were conducted by the DANE’s regional offices; starting from 2008, the central DANE cross
referenced its sample with other sources of information (Superintendence of Companies,
Chambers of Commerce, Free Export Zones, the exporter’s database). A plant is identified as exiter
in the last year of operation in the dataset before cleaning.

         America

          Ha Nguyen and Patricio A. Jaramillo

      6. 1.       Introduction

Firms’ innovation and technology adoption are widely considered as the key driver to economic
growth. Google and Apple are prime examples in the developed world, where their innovation and
new products not only contribute to the economy, but also fundamentally change the way we work,
entertain and communicate. Many developing countries, via different means such as foreign direct
investment, also try to encourage firms to adopt new technologies and management practices.

Yet many firms do not innovate or adopt new technology. In seeking explanations for that, the
conventional focuses have been on the obstacles to firms. For example, firms might not have the
ability to innovate: they might not have the know-how or access to new technologies150. Even if
they do, they might not have access to finance for the research or the adoption. Girma et al (2008)
shows that private and collectively owned firms without foreign capital participation and those
with poor access to domestic bank loans innovate less than other firms do.

In this paper, we do not follow the conventional path to examine the obstacles to firms’ innovation,
but rather, turn our focus to firms’ incentives to innovate. This angle, although more neglected,
should deserve more attention in our view. We argue that in many developing countries, firms
might not have the incentive to innovate because the reward to innovation is small. For instance,
in an environment where property rights are not well protected, a firm’s new product can be easily
copied151. This will significantly reduce the return to innovation. Lin et al (2010) use the 2003
World Bank Enterprise Survey of over 2400 firms in 18 Chinese cities to show that firms’
perception about property rights protection is positively and significantly related to corporate R&D
activity. Another example is that in a monopolized sector, the incumbent might not need to
innovate: their products, good or bad, are the only ones available in the market.

To make our point, we will proceed in two steps. In the first step, we estimate the return to firms’
innovation across many developing countries. We measure the quantitative return in terms of sales,
and sales per worker. We find that the return is low, which implies that the incentive to innovate
is small. In the second step, we compare the return to innovation across countries with different

eliminate all barriers to foreign know-how.

institutional quality. We find that in countries with lower institutional quality (in particular, rule
of law, regulatory quality and property right protection), the return to firms’ innovation is lower.

Estimating the return to firms’ product innovation is not entirely new. Previous studies have tried
to measure the sale and employment return to product innovation, but mostly are limited in a single
country. Earlier studies focus on the manufacturing sector in developed countries, such as Van
Reene (1997) for the UK, Greenan and Guellec (2001) for France, Hall et al. (2008) for Italy,
Guadalupe et al (2012) for Spain. Recent studies start to quantify the return in developing
countries, Benavente and Lauterbach (2008) for Chile, Aboal et al. (2011) for Uruguay, and Crespi
and Tacsir (2012) for four Latin American countries.

The main contribution of this paper is at the second step, where we are the first to show the return
to innovation positively correlates with countries institutional quality. In other words, in countries
with lower levels of institution, the return to product innovation is lower. This is an interesting
result because this implies that an important element for the lack of innovation in developing
countries is the incentive to innovate. Related to our findings, Goni and Maloney (2014) find that
at the country level, the rates of return from R&D expenditures follow an inverted U: they rise
with distance to the frontier and then fall thereafter, potentially turning negative for the poorest
countries.

The comparison across countries is made possible thanks to the World Bank‘s Enterprise Surveys
(ES). The Enterprise Survey is a firm-level survey of a stratified representative sample of firms. It
covers a large set of countries. This survey has been conducted since 2002 and typically answered
by business owners and top managers. The surveys cover a broad range of business environment
topics including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, and performance
measures152. ES is stratified using random sampling where the strata are firm size, business sector,
and geographic region within a country. Firm size levels are 5-19 (small), 20-99 (medium), and
100+ employees (large-sized firms).

In our paper, we focus on product innovation. A firm is understood to innovate if it introduced a
new product or service or upgraded an existing product or service. In our data, only firms in Latin
America (LAC) and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regions are surveyed about their
product innovation. We estimate the percentage change in sales per worker within a firm if it has
introduced or upgraded the products or services in the 3 years prior to the survey. The idea is that
if a firm innovates, its sales and sales per worker should increase. Ideally one should look at firms’
profit as the best measure of the return. Unfortunately that is not possible in our study because data
on reported profit are much more infrequent than data on sales, and because we are concerned
about firms’ profit underreporting problem.

Overall, we found that after a firm innovates, its sale per worker increases by 18 percent, although
the significance is only at the 10 percent level. Focusing on Latin America, we found that the
returns to innovation in terms of sales and sales per worker for Latin American firms are not
statistically different to zero. This implies that within a country, the return to innovation in Latin
America is very small. Obviously, without the appropriate instrument to capture the exogenous

component of product innovation, the results suffer from biases. We will go back to discuss the
sources of biases and how we deal with them in more details in the Section 3. We will argue that
if the biases are not systematically correlated with countries’ institutions, the cross country
comparison of the institutions’ impacts -our ultimate interest- is valid.

We found that the return to innovation is higher in countries with better institutions. Overall, if a
country is ranked 1 percentile higher in the world’s rule of law and regulatory quality rankings,
the sale return to innovation is about 1.7-1.9 percent higher and the sale per worker return is about
0.85-0.95 percent higher. This implies that in countries with better rule of law and regulatory
quality, the incentives to innovate for firms is greater. We also zoom in an important component
to the return to innovation: property right protection and patent right protection. We found that in
countries with good property right protection, the return to innovation is higher. We found that
countries with good property and patent right protection, the return to innovation is also higher,
with about the same magnitude. If we restrict to Latin America only, the relationship between the
return to innovation and a country’s institution is even larger. However, due to the small sample
problem, we should take the results with caution. We will go back to these points in greater details.

   6. 2.       Data and Variables

The data is the World Bank Enterprise Survey- a rich firm-level survey database that provides
information about firms’ characteristics such as ownership, size, sector, region in which it is
located, annual sales, capacity utilization, employment, competition etc. In order to analyze the
change within a firm, we specifically select firms that appear in at least 2 surveys (i.e. panel data).
In our sample, 6,191 firms appear in two surveys and 256 firms appear in three. There are 44
countries with 6,447 unique firms. The detailed list of countries and firms are in Table A6.8 in the
Appendix. Note that the innovation module in the survey only exists in LAC and ECA. At the end,
only LAC and ECA countries remain. The data span from 2002 to 2010.

The innovation module in Latin America is quite different to that in Eastern Europe and Central
Asia. In Latin America (LAC) we use the following question to get data for innovation:

During the last three years, did the establishment introduce onto the market any new or
significantly improved products? (Yes/No/Don’t Know)

We define a firm innovates when it answers Yes to this question.

In Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA), we use the following two questions in the survey to
get data for innovation:
Q1: In the last three years, has this establishment introduced new products or services (Yes/No/
Don’t answer)
Q2: In the last three years, has this establishment upgraded an existing product line or service
(Yes/No/Don’t answer).

We define that a firm innovates when it answer Yes to either of the questions. By doing so, we can
harmonize the innovation variable between LAC and ECA and hence can increase the sample size.




                                                 172
The downside of this is that in ECA, we will mix the return of an upgraded product and that of a
completely new product153.

Out of 3,798 observations that answer, 1,855 firms answer Yes to either of the innovation
questions. Figure 6.1 summarizes the profile of innovating firms by size and by regions. Large
firms are more likely to innovate than small firms. Europe and Central Asia firms are more likely
to innovate than Latin American firms.

               Source: Own elaboration based on The World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys.

We use the following two proxies for firms’ performance: real sales, and real sales per worker.
They are admittedly not ideal measures. The ideal measure should be firms’ profit. We do not use
firms’ profit because the data on profit are much spottier,154 and because firms’ profit might be
under-reported in many developing countries.

Sales can go up or down with a new product. A new product may cannibalize the business and the
profits made from producing the old products when the new products replace and drive out the old
products from the market. On the other hand, the new product on the market can also compliment
the old product. In any case, a successful introduction of a new or upgraded product should increase
sales. Between the two measures of sales, in our view, sales per worker is a more precise measure
of return to innovation than total sales. A sharper increase in sales per worker implies higher return.

Note that a firm can answer Yes to these questions even the firm just slightly modifies its product,
or adopts the new product from overseas. It could also simply copy it from another domestic firm.
153
    See Akcigit and Kerr (2010) for a discussion about the innovation implications of completely new products and
improve products.
154
    In the data set, a third of firms do not report labor costs, and 60 percent of firms do not report costs on
intermediate input and raw material. The vast majority of firms do not report costs on fuel, electricity and water.

As long as the product is new or improved to that firm, the firm can answer Yes to the questions.
In that sense, the understanding of “Innovation” is broader than one usually would think, but the
implication to the return to innovation is unchanged: in an environment where a firm can freely
copy a product and claim it as a new innovating product, the return to its “innovation” is not likely
high. The return is not high for those that originally come up with the product and nor for those
that copy it.

Choosing control variables are not straight-forward, we need to find factors that potentially affect
firm sales. Besides the change of manager, we found two variables in the questionnaire: whether
a firm becomes an exporter between the two waves of survey, and whether the number of a firm’s
competitor’s increases or decreases. We expect that becoming an exporter will boost firms’ sales
and employment, and an increase of competitors will reduce sales and employment. We also
include firm size, industry, and country*time fixed effects. The detailed rational and data sources
of these variables are discussed in the next section.

We use Rule of Law and Regulatory quality to proxy for institutional quality. Rule of law reflects
perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and
in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well
as the likelihood of crime and violence. Regulatory quality reflects perceptions of the ability of the
government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote
private sector development. The data are from the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). It is
a research dataset summarizing the views on the quality of governance provided by a large number
of enterprises, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries
(Kaufmann, Kraay and Mastruzzi, 2010). We use the property right index by the Heritage
Foundation155 to proxy for the property right protection. Property rights assess the extent to which
private economic activity is facilitated by an effective legal system and rule-based governance
structure in which property and contract rights are reliably respected and enforced. For the patent
right protection, we use the patent right index from Park (2008).

       6. 3. 1.     Model setup

The baseline weighted regression is the following:

                         ∆                                    ∙

where ∆         ln         ln	         is the dependent variable, and    are sales, employment and
sales per worker of firm i in country j at time t respectively.       equals 1 if firm i in country j
innovates between time t and time t-1. The interactive dummy ∙ captures the macroeconomic
conditions for country j at time t. The dummy fs captures the sector fixed effects.     are different
firm-level control variables.

The extended regression (to interact with various institution variables) is the following:

155
      http://www.heritage.org/index/property-rights


                                                      174
          ∆                                    ∙	                         ∙

where       is the institutional variable for country j. Note that institutional variables here are time-
invariant. Since the surveys are typically very close together, the institutional quality rarely
changes.          ∙	      is the interaction between a country’s institutional variables and a firm’s
innovation. We ultimately are interested in .

Note that since the data are collected by the stratified random sampling method, all the regressions
are weighted accordingly to restore representativeness. In addition, we cluster the standard errors
at the country level to capture potential correlations between the error terms, and allow for
heteroscedasticity (i.e. having robust standard errors).

Dependent variables:
   ‐ Log of real sales (i.e. sales divided by the price level)
   ‐ Log of real sales per full-time employee

Explanatory variables:
   ‐ Innovation: whether a firm introduced products or services or upgraded its product or
      services in the last 3 years. This is problematic for our regression if the two rounds of
      survey are less than 3 years apart. For this reason, we only keep countries that have surveys
      more than 3 years apart.
   ‐ Changing manager: if a firm changed its manager between the two waves of the survey.
      This is to capture potential other restructuring activities besides innovation. There is no
      direct way to know if a firm changes its manager. We indirectly guess by using the
      manager’s experience (as the firms are asked about the manager’s experience). We identify
      if a firm changed it managers by comparing the change in the experience of the managers
      and the years between the two surveys. If the change in experience years is different to the
      change in years, we conclude that the firm changes its manager. For example, at the first
      round of the survey in 2005, the firm’s manager had 10 year experience; at the second
      round of survey in 2009, the firm’s manager has 20 year experience. Since ∆yearEXPERIENCE
      is great than ∆yearSURVEY , we conclude that the firm must have changed its manager
      between the two rounds of the survey. We acknowledge that there is a possibility that the
      manager might not remember exactly his or her years of experience. As a robustness check
      we allow for that possibility by loosening the restriction: only when yearEXPERIENCE is
      greater than yearSURVEY+1 or smaller than yearSURVEY-1 we can conclude the firm changes
      its manager. The variable is quite robust: if we follow the original criteria, we find that
      3,495 out of 6,447 (54.2 percent) firms change their managers; if we follow the less
      restrictive criteria, we find that 2,616 (40.5 percent) firms change their managers. In the
      regression we use the original criteria.
   ‐ Becoming an exporter: this dummy variable equals 1 if a firm becomes an exporter
      between the two waves of the survey, it equals 0 otherwise.
   ‐ Increasing number of competitors: this dummy variable equals 1 if the number of a firm’s
      competitor’s increases between the two waves of the survey, it equals 0 otherwise.
   ‐ Firm size: small (0-20 full-time employees), medium (21-100 employees) and large (more
      than 100 employees).

   ‐   Rule of law: percentile rank of the country. We calculate the ranking from the entire
       population of countries provided by the Governance Indicators. The rank is 100 for the
       highest ranked countries, and 1 for the lowest ranked. The detailed ranking of countries for
       Rule of Law and other institutional variables are shown at Table A6.9 in the Appendix.
   ‐   Regulatory quality: percentile rank of the country. We calculate the ranking from the entire
       population of countries provided by the Governance Indicators). The rank is 100 for the
       highest ranked countries, and 1 for the lowest ranked.
   ‐   Property right: percentile rank of the country. We calculate the ranking from the entire
       population of countries provided by the Heritage Foundation. The rank is 100 for the
       highest ranked countries, and 1 for the lowest ranked.
   ‐   Patent protection: percentile rank of the country (by our own calculation from the entire
       population of countries). The rank is 100 for the highest ranked countries, and 1 for the
       lowest ranked. The data is a proxy for how well a patent is protected in a country. The data
       are from Park (2008). It is the sum of five separate scores for: coverage (inventions that
       are patentable); membership in international treaties; duration of protection; enforcement
       mechanism; and restrictions (Park, 2008).
   ‐   Sector fixed effects: 2-digit ISIC revision 3. This is to capture industry specific
       characteristics that may affect the return to innovation. For example, one might argue that
       a new product in electronics is likely to have better sales than a new line of shoes.
   ‐   Country*time fixed effect: to capture a country’s macroeconomic effect.

   6. 3. 2.    Discussion about potential estimation biases

It is difficult to isolate and capture exogenous sources of innovation. There are several issues when
it comes to measuring the impact of innovation. First is a concern that inherently good firms in
general will do better than bad firms in sales, and at the same time more likely to innovate. In other
words, the correlation between innovation and firms’ performance might be driven by unobserved
characteristics of the firms. We address that issue with the use of panel data: we only consider the
change of sales within the same firm, not across firms. By looking for the change within a firm,
we effectively control for firms’ time-invariant characteristics.

The second issue is the issue of omitted variable. We will not be able to capture any unobserved
change in firms’ characteristics between the two waves of the survey. For example, a firm might
go through a restructuring and at the same time introduce a new product. The observed change in
sales and employment could then be the results of both innovation and the restructuring. In our
regression, we try our best to capture unobserved changes by controlling for the change of the top
manager. Specifically, we include a dummy which equals 1 if the firm changes the manager
between the two waves of the survey. Many changes in a firm’s structure, management style or
marketing strategies come from a new manager (see Bloom and Van Reenen, 2010).

Another concern is the issue of reverse causality between the change in sales and innovation.
Specifically, one could argue that perhaps changes in sales also affect innovation. For example,
when a firm witnesses declines in sales and market share, it might want to introduce a new product
or service to halt the declines. In this case, the correlation between innovation and the change in
sales would tend to be negative (i.e. a negative change in sales leads to a positive change in
innovation). The OLS results then would underestimate the true impacts of innovation on sale and



                                                 176
employment. The reverse causality is more severe if the innovation process is quick, for example,
when the sale declines, the decision to innovate and the introduction of a new product all take
place in the same period. The reverse causality is less severe if the innovation process takes time.
If there is a “time-to-build” period between when the innovation decision is made and a new
product is introduced, the introduction of a new or improved product is likely too late for, and
hence uncorrelated with the sale declines.

None of the variables available in the survey can serve as a good instrument variable for
innovation. An ideal instrument should capture firms’ perception about intellectual right
protection. Unfortunately the variable is not available. The best two candidates for the instrument
that we can find are (1) firms’ concern about competition practice of the informal sector and (2)
the amount of R&D a firm invested in the previous wave of survey. They are still flawed because
they still violate the exclusion restriction. Regarding (1), although a large part of the concern about
informal sector has to do with intellectual property right infringement, the concern can also be
about the labor or tax practices, which can affect the firm’s non-innovation investment activities.
Regarding (2), it is not a good instrument if the decision to do R&D also correlates with other non-
innovation activities of the firm.

Having discussed all the drawbacks of the estimation, it is important to note that we are not
interested in the precision of the return per se. We are instead interested in the comparison of the
return across countries. To the extent that the biases are not systematically correlated with
countries’ institutional characteristics, the comparison across countries is valid.

               Source: Authors’ calculations

Table 6.1 presents the overall results when we pool all countries in ECA and LAC together, for a
total of 1879 unique firms. Overall, only sales per worker are marginally significant at 10 percent
level: an innovating firm sees its sales per worker increase by 18.3 percent. Since there are biases,
it is safer to consider this as an association, not causation. The dummy variables “More
Competitors” and “Firm Size” are significant and have expected signs. Firms that have more
competitors between the two surveys see weaker growth in sales than those that have fewer
competitors. In addition, small and medium firms see significantly weaker growth in sales than
large firms do. This is counter-intuitive if one would think firms should converge to an optimal
size. Our conjecture is that in developing countries, many obstacles (such as connection to
politicians) prevent small firms’ growth as fast as larger ones. The dummy “New Top Manager”
is significant and negative. This could reflect adjustment costs to the restructuring associated with
the new managers.156 Focusing on Latin America, table 6.2 shows that the returns to innovation in
terms of sales and sales per worker for Latin American firms are not statistically different to zero.

156
      Alternatively, reverse causality might be at play: firms with declining performance hire new managers.


                                                          178
This implies that within a country, the return to innovation in Latin America is very small. We also
interact “Innovation” with the “LAC” dummy, but the interacting coefficient is not significant,
implying that the return to innovation in LAC is not significantly different to that in ECA (results
not shown).

An important exercise is to examine the return to innovation for monopolist. It is usually argued
that monopolist have little incentives to innovate: their product, good or bad, is the only one
available in the market and they have already captured the market anyway. For example, if a bad
flight service is the only option available for travelers, an improved flight service will not generate
much return to an airline monopolist because they will not bring in many new passengers. Table
6.3 shows the return to innovation to Monopolists compared to non-monopolists. We define
monopolist as those that have zero competitor. We show that the conventional wisdom is correct:
after a monopolist innovates, its percentage of sales per worker increase is 90 percent (i.e. exp (-
2.27)) lower than the percentage increase of non-monopolist. We expect the result to be stronger
if we consider “upgraded products” alone, as we think that an improved product does not likely
improve monopolist’s profits, whereas a completely new product might.

   6. 4. 2.    The Return to Innovation with institution

In this section we focus on the question if the return to innovation is higher in countries with better
institution quality. The argument is that in a better institutional environment, where the property
right is protected, the courts are reliable, and regulatory uncertainty is small etc., firms’ investment
in bringing new products and services to the market will yield a good return. On the contrary, in
an environment where a new product can easily be copied at little enforceable punishment or the
government’s policy is highly volatile, the return to innovation will likely be small. We proxy for
institutional quality by Rule of Law and Regulatory Quality. Rule of law reflects ``perceptions of
the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular
the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the
likelihood of crime and violence’’. Regulatory quality reflects ``perceptions of the ability of the
government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote
private sector development’’. These two variables are highly correlated, and commonly used to
capture institutional quality.

We show that in general, in a country with better rule of law, the return to innovation is higher.
Table 6.4 shows that if a country is placed 1 percentile higher in the world’s rule of law ranking
(i.e. better rule of law), the sale return to a new and improved product is 1.91 percent higher, and
the sale per worker return -our focus- is 0.97 percent higher. Similarly, if a country is placed 1
percentile higher in the world’s regulatory quality, the sales return to innovation is 1.77 percent
higher, and the sale per worker return is 0.86 percent higher (Table 6.5).

The coefficients for “Innovation” variable become either negative or insignificant. The first rows
in Tables 6.4 and 6.5 shows that the sales per worker return to innovation for the lowest ranked
country is essentially zero.

Focusing in LAC, the impacts of rule of law and of regulatory quality are both more significant
and of a larger magnitude compared to the pooled sample (Tables 6.4b and 6.5b). If a LAC country
is placed 1 percentile lower in the world’s rule of law ranking, the sale return to innovation is 12.7
percent lower and the sale per worker return is 11.4 percent lower (Table 6.4b). If a LAC country
is placed 1 percentile lower in the world’s rule of law ranking, the sale return to innovation is 3.9
percent lower, whereas the sale per worker return is 5.98 percent lower. The results imply a more
detrimental impact of “bad’’ rule of law and regulatory quality on firms’ incentive to innovate in
LAC. However, the results should be taken with caution given the small number of countries
covered in Latin America.157




157
  For sales and sales per workers, there are 5 countries in the sample: Honduras, Brazil, Nicaragua, Guatemala and
Ecuador. For employment there are 6 countries: these 5 and Venezuela.

       6. 4. 3.     Return Innovation with property right protection

Since rule of law and regulatory quality is still too general to have specific policy
recommendations, this section zooms in one particular component of institution that we think are
most obvious in affecting the return to innovation. It is property right protection. For our analysis,
we use the property right index by the Heritage Foundation158 to proxy for the property right
protection. Property rights assess the extent to which private economic activity is facilitated by an
effective legal system and rule-based governance structure in which property and contract rights
are reliably respected and enforced.

The property rights here include both intellectual property rights (IPR) and more general property
right. While IPRs laws and enforcements provide necessary protection to the fruits of R&D (patent,
copyrights, trademarks, etc.), broader property rights protection and contract enforcements protect
investments that are complementary to R&D expenditures, especially during the post-R&D stage,
and hence help realize the commercial values of R&D. In a country where property right is not
well protected, a new product or service when deemed profitable will be easily copied, thus the
return to the innovating firm is reduced. On the other hand, if property right is well protected, the
firm can extract good return from its new products or services.

Table 6.6 and 6.6b present the overall results across countries and those for Latin America. Overall,
if a country is placed 1 percentile higher in the ranking, the sales per worker return to innovation
for an innovating firm will be 0.91 percent higher and the sale return is 1.53 percent higher.
Overall, the magnitude of the impact here is similar to that from the regulatory quality and rule of
law regressions. Across Latin American countries, we do not see a significant impact of Property
Right Protection on the sales return to innovation. However, we do see Property Right Protection
have a positive and significant impact on the sales per worker return to innovation. In Latin
America, if a country is place 1 percentile higher in the ranking, we expect the sales per worker

the world sample. However, it is only significant at 10 percent level.

   6. 4. 4.    Return Innovation with patent protection

In this section we squarely focus on the most arguably relevant factor that affects innovation:
patent protection. The index is provided in Park (2008). It is “the unweighted sum of five separate
scores for: coverage (inventions that are patentable); membership in international treaties;
duration of protection; enforcement mechanisms; and restrictions (for example, compulsory
licensing in the event that a patented invention is not sufficiently exploited)” (Park, 2008).




                                                     187
         Table 6.7. Returns of Innovation with Index of patent rights – All countries




         Source: Authors’ calculations

Table 6.7 shows the relationship between the return to innovation and patent rights ranking (where
1 is for the lowest ranked country, and 100 is for the highest ranked). We can see that the sale
return for innovating firms is significantly smaller for countries with lower patent right protection:
if a country is 1 rank lower, the sale return is 3.49 percent lower. The magnitude is relatively large,
compared to findings for other institutional variables. However, the return in terms of sale per
worker is not significantly correlated with the patent right ranking, although the sign is correct. It
is possible that measurement errors inflate the standard errors, making the coefficient insignificant.
It is also possible that patent right protection indeed has a smaller impact on the return than other
components of property right protection. For example, if firms in developing countries do not
habitually file for patent protection, the index would be irrelevant. We also repeat the exercise for
LAC countries, however, probably due to the small size; the results are not significant with a wrong
sign and therefore not shown here.

   6. 5.       Conclusion

Why firms do not innovate or adopt new technologies remains an important and interesting
question. In this paper we do not go to the usual routes of examining the obstacles to firms’
innovation, but focus on firms’ incentives to innovate. We do that by estimating the return to
innovation across countries, and comparing the return in countries with different levels of
institutional quality, the return of innovation (in terms of sales per worker) for firms is lower. This
means that in poorer countries, a large part of the lack of innovation is due to firms’ unwillingness
to innovate: bad institutional environment discourages firms to invest in researching new products.

The magnitude of the estimated gain is large. If a country can improve by 10 ranks in the world
percentile ranking, the return to innovation in terms of sales per worker for firms in that country
could be 8 percent to 10 percent higher. This finding calls for policies that go beyond addressing
obstacles to firms’ ability to innovate. They have to also place a strong focus on institutional factors
(such as property right protection) in order to address firms’ incentive problem.

                                                                Until recently, inequality was not seen as having major
                                                            implications for macroeconomic developments. This belief

      7. 1.       Introduction

A main motivation for asking about the factors that prevent LAC from converging towards high
income levels is the assumed positive effect that income has on well-being. For example, the
positive effect of growth on poverty reduction is well-documented in the literature (e.g. Dollar and
Kraay, 2002; Ravallion, 2012; Dollar et al., 2013) and also depicted in Figure 7.1: on average,
developing countries that saw higher aggregate growth saw higher reductions in the poverty gap.

While poverty in itself may severely reduce welfare, this paper re-addresses the issue of poverty
being an impediment to growth, arguing that it is especially the interaction of initial poverty with
economic volatility (and associated uncertainty) that prevents countries from converging. This
builds on the findings of Crespo-Cuaresma, Klasen, and Wacker (henceforth CCKW, 2013) that
macroeconomic volatility prevents “poverty convergence,” i.e. that poor countries see faster

progress in poverty reduction (see also Ravallion, 2012). While CCKW (2013) already pointed out
that the underlying channel for this finding is the effect of the volatility-poverty interaction on
income convergence, this paper extends on our contribution in several ways. First, it gives a more
elaborate theoretical motivation for the effect that poverty and volatility have on growth. Building
on the derived intuition, it secondly looks at poverty gaps instead of poverty headcount ratios.161
Third, the dataset used in this paper differs from Ravallion (2012) and CCKW (2013) by using
conventional macro data. And finally, the paper interprets the findings from a LAC perspective,
showing that conditional on their income level, LAC has historically suffered from over-
proportionally high poverty gaps which might help explain why the region failed to converge
towards high income levels over the long run.

With this contribution, the paper also bridges two stands in the literature that have previously
coexisted peacefully without much interaction. Besides from Ravallion’s (2012) contribution, a
growing number of studies have emphasized the role of poverty and inequality for growth (e.g.
Lopez and Servén, 2009; Berg et al., 2014; Berg et al., 2012). On the other hand, the importance
of volatility for growth has been emphasized by the seminal paper of Ramey and Ramey (1995),
and was confirmed by various contributions since (Hnatkovska and Loayza, 2005; Kose et al.,
2006; Aghion et al., 2010; Berument et al., 2011 and 2012). However, the exact channel of
volatility impacting growth remains opaque162 and, similarly, there are various potential effects of
poverty on growth (for a critical review see also Kraay and McKenzie, 2014). In the words of
Ravallion (2012: 521): “[t]he policy implications of (…) poverty reduction depend on why
countries starting out with a higher incidence of poverty tend to face worse growth prospects”
(emphasis added). By bringing together these two strands of the literature, this paper highlights
that volatility and poverty may mutually re-enforce each other in hampering growth.

      7. 2.        Poverty and volatility as a limitation to the advantages of backwardness

      7. 2. 1.     The argument for convergence

The most basic neoclassical growth model (Solow, 1956; Swan, 1956) assumes a Cobb-Douglas
production function of output Y:

                                                                           	

which implies decreasing returns to capital K:


161
    Note that for the class of poverty measures p = [(Y-r)/r]α, the poverty headcount index is defined as α=0, while for
the poverty gap α=1. The latter is hence “closer” to a distributionally sensitive (convex) poverty measure of the so-
called Atkinson-class (α>1) for which volatility will lead to an increase in expected poverty under less stringent
assumptions that for the headcount index (see Ravallion, 1988).
162
    Ramey and Ramey (1995: 1148) attribute the negative effect of volatility on growth to uncertainty-induced planning
errors in firms or, similarly, to the cost of shifting production factors across sectors, i.e. to an interaction of rigidities
and uncertainty that imposes an ex post inefficiency. This is similar to the motivation given in this paper which argues
that the uncertainty costs are higher for the poor. Kose et al. (2006: 199) conclude from their results about
heterogeneity of the growth effects of volatility that there is need for “further research … to provide a better
understanding of the roles played by various shocks in driving the relationship between volatility and growth.”



                                                            195
Assuming that countries share common features (such as the production function, technology and
population growth), the model identifies a steady state level of capital per effective unit of labor,
k*. Poorer countries with a lower capital stock will thus increase their capital stock to reach the
steady state163 and the model thus predicts that growth is related to the distance to the steady state
level of income:

                                          	ln	
                                                       ln      ∗    ln
                                             	

i.e. poorer countries should grow at higher rates than richer countries, the underlying rationale
being that poor countries have a higher marginal return to capital. Empirically, it is well known
that this unconditional convergence does not hold—or only for a very limited set of countries—
but requires controlling for several factors (‘conditional convergence’).

      7. 2. 2.   Poor economics? Risk aversion of the poor in an uncertain environment: field
          evidence

Contrary to the intuition of decreasing returns to capital, we often observe in practice that those
having the highest marginal return to investment, mostly the poor, do not undertake those highly
profitable investments. For example, Bliss and Stern (1982: ch. 8) find that farmers in the north
Indian state of Uttar Pradesh under-investment in highly productive fertilizers. While this might
look like a poor economic decision, they explain this behavior by the fact that using less fertilizer
contains investment losses in bad times. The authors’ calculations suggest that the foregone
expected profits are most plausibly explained by high levels of risk and risk aversion. Since then,
various studies have found similar under-investment of poor households that would be expected
to have the highest marginal returns on their investment (see Morduch, 1995, for an overview and
the later contributions by Moser and Barrett, 2006; Yesuf and Bluffstone, 2009; Dercon and
Christiaensen, 2011).

      7. 2. 3.    A simple intuition

To understand the problem more formally, assume households generate utility u from income Y,
with the standard assumptions

                                        	 ⁄      0                        (1a)	
                                         	 ⁄         0                    (1b)

Suppose there is a moderate poverty line r at some level of income (e.g. at the 2 USD line) and
some absolute poverty line that is equal to the subsistence minimum s (e.g. the 1.25 USD line).

           ∗
163
              	 1          ∗                         ∗ , i.e. the more negative [k(t)-k*], the higher the growth of k(t)
over time (because of the negative prefix).



                                                         196
For the sake of the argument presented here, assume that the utility of falling below the subsistence
minimum s is minus infinity, u(Y<s) = -∞, but more generally any utility function that is
sufficiently concave will suffice for the argument to hold.164

At time period t=1, a poor household with s<Y<r faces the decision whether or not to make an
investment (e.g. in fertilizer or education, or switching the sector of activity, e.g. by moving into
the city) that might potentially allow the household to escape poverty. If there is no uncertainty
about the state of the economy in the future (i.e. t=2), the payoffs of the investment are well known
and the household will make the investment if it improves its lifetime income, which might
potentially allow it to escape poverty. Otherwise, the household will not make the investment. This
situation is depicted in the left panel of Figure 7.2..165

according to the outcome of a Bernoulli trial (e.g. good vs. bad state of the economy, rain vs. no
rain, political stability vs. instability). If the uncertainty becomes large enough for the “low”
outcome to fall below the subsistence minimum s, the expected utility of the investment will
become E(Yt=2) = P(X=h) xh + P(X=l) (-∞), which in no case justifies the investment. This discrete
case is intuitive but it is not hard to picture that a similar effect occurs in the continuous case with
a sufficiently concave utility function of consumption due to the asymmetry of marginal utility
around the expected value.166


164
    The literature sometimes considers the opposite case where the utility of income is bounded below, e.g. because of
the existence of some social safety net (public or private). See e.g. Banerjee (2000). I will discuss some implications
of this assumption below.
165
    Note that this simple intuition does not take into account that the household might be constrained to make the
investment because the loss in consumption in period 1 might bring it below the subsistence minimum: c1=(Y-a)<s.
In my understanding, this is the view Ravallion (2012) provides for poverty not converging.
166
    Morduch (1994) formalizes a similar rationale in a two-period model where a poor agricultural household has to
choose the share of safe (but on average less profitable) activity under a borrowing constraint. Due to the latter, less
risk is taken and expected profits are sacrificed for greater self-protection against bad shocks for which financial
market protection is unavailable.


                                                         197
For another, numerical example, consider a household with the isoelastic utility function

                                               	              ,                   (2)

maximizing consumption over two periods. The household can either stay in its business/sector in
which case there will be no change in income: Y = Y1 = Y2. Or the household can invest a certain
(discrete and predefined) amount a>0 in period 1 which increases its income in period 2 by
a+[1/(aY)]. This reflects diminishing marginal returns to investment (or, income), which gives
rise to convergence in the neoclassical growth model. The discrete and predefined size of a is
motivated by assuming a lump-sum type of cost when switching business/sector. Suppose,
however, that under this second option, the household faces a risk q* to its income, which is given
by:

                                           ∗               															    	
                                                           				         	 1

This uncertainty reflects that the relative desirability of a sector (or business) can repeatedly rise
and fall (which induces hysteresis effects; see Dixit and Rob, 1994). Disregarding subjective
intertemporal discounting or possibilities to transfer income across periods (i.e. there is neither
insurance or lending, nor store of value - so individuals cannot achieve insurance indirectly by
consumption smoothing over time), the household’s utilities under these two options are then given
by:

                                	   :			                                                2

                                                   	   :			

                                                       1                                    1
                                                                          1

Let us parameterize this example by assuming a=0.5, q=0.3, P=0.5, and a risk aversion η =1, in
which case the utility function becomes the limiting case u(c) = ln(c), so u<0 for c<1. I.e. c=1 can
be interpreted as a poverty line below which utility is negative (e.g. because of starvation [absolute]
or because of social exclusion [relative]). The difference in utilities of these two options with
respect to different incomes under the given parameters is depicted in Figure 7.3., with a positive
difference indicating that option 2 would be the optimal household choice.




                                                              198

One can see that even though the expected two-period consumption under option 2,

                                                     ∗
                                                               2     			   2 				∀ ,       0,              (3)

would be higher than under option 1 (by a magnitude decreasing in Y as long as Y>0), it requires
a certain income level for option 2 to provide a higher utility and become optimal. The intuition
for this result is the aversion of the household of falling below a certain consumption level
(“poverty line”) which weighs stronger than the potential benefits of an investment which would
otherwise deliver the highest payoffs for poor households (which is also reflected by the utility
difference in Figure 7.3. falling again after reaching a peak at a certain income Y and approaching
0 as Y  ∞ in the term 1/[aY] in equation 3). It is finally relevant to note that not only the
uncertainty about consumption in period 2 detains the household from investing but that with
uncertainty (q) rising, the optimum of option 2 requires a higher income level.

      7. 2. 4.   What does this imply for convergence?

If the above considerations were largely appropriate to describe actual income and convergence
dynamics, one can derive some econometric hypotheses about income growth and convergence.

First and foremost, poverty will have a hampering effect on growth and convergence. More
precisely, we would expect the poverty gap to exercise this effect, as it is a measure for how far
the poor are away from the poverty line on average and thus, how close they are to the subsistence
minimum s.167 As they approach this subsistence minimum, they will no longer be able to reduce
consumption and invest, i.e. they will no longer be able to benefit from the “advantages of
backwardness” that are assumed to lead to overall convergence.



167
   Note that this differs from the results of Ravallion (2012) and CCKW (2013) who use the poverty headcount ratio
instead of the poverty gap.


                                                         199
Secondly, this effect is expected to be re-enforced through volatility. For a given level of income
with s<Y<r , the higher volatility, the deeper will the future level of income under a “bad state” of
the economy (X=l) fall below the subsistence minimum (or, below c2=1) and the less likely or
meaningful it is for the poor to invest, although the marginal returns on their investment are
expected to be high.

Finally, one should note that this reasoning implies a different aggregate production function
because poverty and its interaction with volatility influences aggregate investment, which in turn
defines the capital stock K that enters the aggregate production function Y. In other words, if
poverty (and its interaction with volatility) is a serious impediment to convergence, one would
expect that we see convergence conditional on poverty (and volatility), i.e. after controlling for the
latter.

    7. 2. 5.     Pro poor economics: The example of China

Undoubtedly, China has been one of the most impressive cases of convergence in income and
poverty rates over the last decades. Its PPP GDP per capita rose from merely 2 percent of the US
level in 1980 to 17 percent in 2010. Over the same three decades its moderate poverty headcount
ratio (at 2 PPP USD per day) fell from 98 percent of the population to 27 percent. Among other
factors, the literature has pointed out the role of macroeconomic stabilization and pro-poor
redistribute policies for achieving this tremendous progress.

While the high initial poverty rate168 might seem to run against the above argument that poverty
impedes convergence, Ravallion (2009) and Drèze and Sen (1995) have pointed out that initial
inequality was low, especially when looking at access to basic health and education and that the
pre-reform regime has thus left “advantageous initial conditions” for growth and poverty
reduction” (Ravallion, 2009: 22). While the government has provided few direct redistributive
interventions, it has still ensured a broad access to basic necessities and services, thus providing
“equity of opportunity” and reducing the likelihood of households to fall below a critical threshold
of income/consumption (s).

Furthermore, the government provided a relatively predictable outlook about the economic
conditions in the near term future, which reduced uncertainty and volatility about the future payoffs
of household investments.169 This was achieved by both, components of central planning and a
macroeconomic policy that was mostly successful in stabilizing market fluctuations which was
beneficial for poverty reduction (see Ravallion, 2009).

From a sectoral perspective, poverty-reduction was mainly driven by the agriculture sector
(Ravallion, 2009) but for income convergence to continue, it is also relevant to stress that China
managed to absorb an increasing share of labor in more productive manufacturing activities. While
the Chinese growth strategy and its focus on investment and exports caused a major rise in

168
    One should also remember to look at poverty conditional on the income level. China’s poverty rate was not
remarkably higher than the one of Bangladesh (90 percent in 1984) or Nepal (94 percent in 1985), countries with a
similar income level at that time.
169
    In fact, Chamon et al. (2010) show that rising income variance can help explain a rise in precautionary savings
observed in China after 2000, especially for younger households with lower buffer stocks of savings.


                                                       200
inequality (Lee, Syed, and Wang, 2013), it was nevertheless able to generate beneficial income
opportunities for the poor and provided them access to opportunities which were supportive to
promote the dynamic change that was necessary to sustain growth over an extended period of time.

   7. 3.           Empirical investigation

   7. 3. 1.        Econometric Model

The main model underlying this investigation is a standard neoclassical convergence specification,
given by
                       ∆	ln	           	 	ln	 ,           ,           (4)

where      denotes GDP in country i and period t and     is a standard disturbance term assumed to
fulfill the usual assumptions of the error term in linear regression models. If        is negative,
countries converge in GDP levels, i.e. countries starting out with a lower initial GDP grow faster
in subsequent periods, as discussed above.

Starting from there, one can add several control variables to the model, which are summarized in
a matrix X:

                        ∆	ln	              	 	ln	   ,           ,              (5)

where includes interactions among variables and can in principle be measured at various points
in time.

It should be noted that the interpretation of such interaction models might not be straightforward.
For example, in the model

           ∆	ln	            	 	ln	     ,                                         ,       (6)

the marginal effect of          on ∆	ln	   is given by

                                ∆	 	
                                                        ,                (7)

i.e. it depends on the level of , and the statistical significance of the influence has to be evaluated
over the relevant range of .

In line with the studies of Ravallion (2012) and CCKW (2013) we focus on OLS estimation of the
outlined equations, well aware of the fact that this might induce severe endogeneity biases but
hoping to thereby provide a first approximation to the effect of poverty and volatility on income
convergence.




                                                        201
   7. 3. 2.    Data

While the studies of Ravallion (2012) and CCKW (2013) use data from household surveys and
focus on the poverty headcount ratio (as a percentage of the population), this paper instead uses
more aggregated macro data and looks at the poverty gap for reasons mentioned above. More
specifically, GDP data is taken from PWT 7.1 as PPP converted GDP per capita at constant 2005
prices (PWT series rgdpl). Similar to CCKW (2013) the standard deviation over the last 5 years is
calculated for each year. Aggregate data for the poverty gap at 2 PPP USD a day are retrieved from
the World Bank WDI. It is worth noticing that this data is not available for every country in every
year and only available for developing countries, so there are no industrialized economies in the
sample.

For each country where data is available, I take the earliest and last observation that has a poverty
data point. The resulting timespan ranges from 3 years (Czech Republic and Montenegro) to 32
years (India) and starts as early [late] as 1978 [2005] (India [Monenegro]) and ends as late [early]
as 2010 [1992] (34 different countries [Trinidad and Tobago]). Annual real PPP GDP p.c. growth
rates are calculated over these periods.

At this stage, no further control variables are added. This may certainly induce some omitted
variable bias. For example, poverty might be correlated with poor institutions that are not able (or
willing) to progressively redistribute resources. On the other hand, lack of institutional capacity
might also have growth reducing effects on its own. By not controlling for institutional quality,
poverty might pick up parts of the latter effect. However, there are qualified reasons to not control
for other standard variables. First, the exact linkages and causalities between these variables and
poverty are unclear. For example, is poverty high because institutional quality is low? Or do
institutions not improve because the poor are systematically excluded from political participation?
Similarly, are people poor because of low education? Or is it the case that poor people cannot
invest in human capital because of a poverty trap as suggested above? By not controlling for other
variables, the full impact of initial poverty will be captured, even though it might operate through
various channels and capture effects of variables correlated with poverty. But the main aim of this
investigation is not to exactly quantify the impact of poverty on growth in an unbiased manner. It
rather suggests that poverty has an impact on the aggregate production function of output and
hence asks if controlling for poverty is sufficient to obtain (conditional) convergence.

   7. 3. 3.    Results

Column (1) of Table 7.1 displays the estimation results of the unconditional convergence equation
(4). As one can see, there are no signs of unconditional convergence among the 102 developing
countries included, and this approach virtually explains nothing of the variation in growth rates
among them (as indicated by the R-squared). When adding the initial poverty gap to the equation
(column 2), the picture changes as that the explanatory power of the model increases (R-squared
6.7 percent), conditional convergence is present (and significant at the 10 percent level), and initial
poverty exercises a statistically highly significant negative impact on subsequent growth. This
suggests that poverty impedes growth, as already pointed out by previous studies. But it
furthermore suggests that when controlling for this fact, countries would actually converge in
income levels.

When volatility is added to the convergence equation instead of poverty (column 3), we see a
negative effect of volatility—in line with the previous literature—that is not statistically significant
though and the overall model does not fit the data as well as when including poverty instead. When
adding both variables and allowing them to interact (column 4), it is poverty that exercises a
statistically significant impact that is aggravated by volatility (although the interaction is not
statistically different from 0). To better understand the effect implied by the estimated model,
Figure 7.4 evaluates the impact of poverty on growth at different levels of volatility (following the
rationale discussed for equations 6 and 7). As one can see, the effect of poverty becomes severely
more negative, the higher volatility is, as suggested by the considerations above. Furthermore,
column 4 highlights that once one controls for the effects of poverty, volatility, and their
interaction, convergence in income levels is taking place.

Finally, I allow this convergence parameter to depend on the poverty gap by interacting the two
relevant variables (column 5). The evaluation of the effect is depicted in Figure 7.5. It shows that
the smaller the poverty gap is, the faster does a country converge in terms of the income level.
Once the poverty gap increases, it becomes less likely for a country to converge. This is in line
with the above consideration that poverty eats up the “advantages of backwardness,” as poor
people will find it hard to invest in assets even though they should provide a high marginal return.

Despite remaining fairly frugal, this empirical investigation highlights that it is sufficient to control
for the poverty gap to observe statistically significant (conditional) convergence in income levels
in a broad sample of 102 developing countries. The size of the poverty gap directly influences the
convergence speed and the negative effect of poverty on growth increases with macroeconomic

volatility, in line with the findings of CCKW (2013). The negative effect of poverty on
convergence may be driven through various channels related to poverty. For example, in the
dataset above it is also sufficient to control for (log) initial primary school completion rates and/or
life expectancy to obtain significant convergence. However, even with both these variables,
inclusion of the log initial poverty gap still accelerates convergence (from a parameter of -0.015**
to -0.018***).

   7. 4. 1.    Lacking convergence in the past

What do these results imply for LAC and its convergence path?

The region is known for historically high levels of inequality and, relatedly, for a considerable
poverty incidence considering the overall income level. This latter point is depicted in Figure 7.6.
It shows (the logarithm of) the poverty gap on the vertical and (the logarithm of) GDP p.c. on the
horizontal axis, outlining a clear negative relationship, as expected. Given this relationship,
however, Latin American and Caribbean countries (depicted in full black) have larger poverty gaps
than one would expect considering their income level. This is also confirmed parametrically in
column (6) of Table 7.1 showing (with a LAC dummy variable), that LAC’s poverty gap is
significantly higher than in the rest of the developing world after controlling for the level of GDP
p.c. This means that LAC is over-proportionally burdened with poverty given their income level,
potentially preventing the region to benefit from “advantages of backwardness” relative to high-
income countries.

Previous research has further pointed out the nature of volatilities in LAC and its macroeconomic
linkages (e.g. Gavin, Hausmann, Perotti, and Talvi, 1996; Gavin and Hausmann, 1998) as well as
its feedback loop on poverty (IDB, 1995; CCKW, 2013).

Under these circumstances, a relatively large proportion of (poor) households might have been
detained from investing into assets (such as education) that would have a potentially high return
and would be in demand for a productivity-enhancing dynamic structural change in the sense of
the contributions of Schiffbauer, Sahnoun, and Araujo and Brown, Crespi, Iacovone and Marcolin
in this volume. The issue might be of special relevance for the Caribbean that experienced a
considerable slowdown in growth rates in the last decades against the background of particularly
high poverty levels and historically high exposure to volatility and shocks.

   7. 4. 2.                 LAC looking ahead

Over the last decade LAC has seen a considerable decline in poverty mostly due to positive growth
effects (see Dollar et al., 2013 and World Bank, 2014) and as CCKW (2013) show, LAC has in
fact seen poverty convergence. This raises the hope that the potential drag of poverty on income
convergence will be somewhat attenuated in the future. However, this will also depend on whether
poverty reduction is mainly temporary, e.g. driven by the boom in the commodity and related
sectors that have a high demand for unskilled labor, potentially benefitting poor households (see
de la Torre, Messina, and Pienknagura, 2012), or has truly enlarged socio-economic opportunities
of the poor, which would potentially allow them to move up the ladder towards higher-productivity
activities over time. A recent World Bank (2014) study highlights that equality of access to basic
childhood goods and services has improved in recent years while serious issues remain concerning
the quality of those goods and services, particularly in education and housing infrastructure.
Concerning volatility, the region has managed to stabilize output and inflation, and to support
overall stability (see World Bank, forthcoming).

With a growing middle class in the region and extended basic social security nets amid fiscal
windfall revenues, a paradox pointed out by Banerjee (2000: 137) might arise, however. Because


                                                               206
the safety net prevents effective income to fall below a certain threshold, the risk of investing for
the poor is considerably reduced while the risk of investing shifts towards the middle class. This
is depicted in Figure 7.7 which shows the payoff/utility V of a risky and a safe investment strategy
for different levels of endowment (ω). For a certain (“middle-class”) endowment level ω1 < ω<
ω2, the safe strategy (of not investing) leads to a higher payoff than investing. If such investment
traps actually exist, the observed mobility of the poor towards the middle class in the region will
not necessarily translate into increased investment in productive assets in the future—a “middle
income trap” arises. However, this paradox is a very specific case and it is questionable if it
captures households’ investment behavior in the region appropriately. By and large, the observed
developments with respect to poverty reduction and macroeconomic stabilization should give rise
to a somewhat more optimistic growth outlook for the region going forward, besides from the
intrinsic benefits of reducing poverty.

   7. 5.       Conclusion

This chapter has argued that poverty could deplete the “advantages of backwardness” that underlie
neoclassical models of income convergence, i.e. the advantage that the marginal return to
investment is higher in relatively poor countries. Especially in an environment where volatility
and thus uncertainty is high, the poor might be distracted from investing because in a potentially
“bad state” of the economy in the future (e.g. droughts, crisis, civil unrest or war), their disposable
income might fall below a minimum level of consumption.

The hypotheses deriving from this reasoning are a negative impact of the poverty gap on growth
that increases with the level of volatility and, accordingly, a convergence process that is slowed
down by high initial poverty. These hypotheses are confirmed in a simplistic econometric
estimation covering 102 developing countries. The empirical exercise further shows that
unconditional convergence does not hold but controlling for initial poverty is sufficient to observe
statistically significant (conditional) convergence.

This might be interpreted as a growth reducing effect of poverty on the aggregate production
function. For example, economic misallocations (along firms or sectors) might take place because
adjustment costs (i.e. rigidities) towards the most productive allocations are too high for the poor
under credit constraints, particularly because uncertainty (i.e. volatility) might give rise to an ex
post inefficiency that cannot be insured against (cf. Ramey and Ramey, 1991; Dixit and Rob, 1994;
Bertola, 1995). Such a constraint would partially explain why efficiency concerns of mainly
microeconomic nature or sectoral competitiveness considerations which both ranked high on the
policy agenda of the LAC region in the 1990s, only painted an incomplete picture of the
macroeconomic constraints of the region as it largely ignored equity and volatility considerations
(cf. Birdsall, de la Torre, and Valencia Caicedo, 2010). Given the particularly high poverty levels
in LAC, this ‘incomplete agenda’ might have overlooked a serious factor holding back income
growth and convergence of the region.

Certainly, the present exercise is only a first approximation concerning the effect of poverty traps
for income convergence in the presence of uncertainty and volatility. More elaborate estimation
results are needed as much as different approaches to understand in more detail the exact channels
that prevent countries with large poverty gaps from converging towards higher income levels.
