         Key Water and Sanitation SeCtor CHallengeS
         XXachieving   full cost recovery. Many of hungary’s water utilities have carried out eu and
            government-sponsored investments in the last few years. As a result of the financing agreement,
            the depreciation of these investments must be covered by tariffs. But the future maintenance
            costs of these recent development projects still have to be included in the price of the services.
            Moreover, since water and sewerage tariffs were frozen in 2012 and were decreased by law in
            2013, revenues collected by utilities are decreasing.
         XXPreventing   the degradation of assets in the longterm. While assets of most water utilities have
            been properly maintaining their assets for the last two decades, few companies have made an effort
            to create sufficient reserves for their future replacement. As a result, the infrastructure is aging and
            its average condition is slowly declining. Due to the 2013 tariff cut, utilities have accumulated even
            lower reserves than before, and maintenance has become problematic for many operators.
         XXPreparing    for the risks caused by climate change. Most water utility managers are aware of the
            types of risks caused by climate change (such as new patterns of precipitation, stress on sewers,
            changing patterns of water consumption, and change in water resources used for drinking water),
            but the everyday challenges of maintaining a high level of operation under worsening financial
            conditions make it difficult to focus on the long term, and there has been almost no preparation to
            address the identified risks of climate change.

Economy. Hungary is an upper-middle-income country with substantial regional differences. GDP per capita is
higher in Central Hungary, which includes Budapest, where this indicator is slightly above the EU average. In Western
Hungary, the GDP per capita falls between 75% and 100% of the EU average, while for the rest of the country (South,
North, and Eastern Hungary), this value is between 50% and 75% of the EU average. Various other indicators (e.g.,
unemployment levels, investments, access to highways, life expectancy) show a similar disparity. Hungary has been
an EU Member State since May 2004 (GVI 2013).

Governance. The guiding principle of recent regulatory reforms has been centralization; i.e., increasing the role of
the central government and reducing the responsibilities and resources of municipalities. Hungary is a unicameral
parliamentary republic and the government directs and oversees the operation of the state administration. Hungary’s
public administrative regional units are comprised of the capital city and 19 counties. Budapest is composed of 23
districts. There are 3,152 cities and municipalities in Hungary (Gov. HU 2015). Each county and district in Budapest
is self-governed. The government is responsible for most water utility governance, but the municipalities and central
government are responsible for water and sanitation service provision.

Water resources. Water resources in Hungary show regional and seasonal limitations, which may escalate
with climate change. Hungary has sufficient water resources, but there are significant differences in regional
distribution. The total renewable freshwater quantity is 10,425 m3/capita/year (FAO Aquastat 2015), and the overall
quality is good, but two-thirds of the recent subsurface consumption is supplied from water bodies in weak or
uncertain status. In response to climate change, a national climate strategy (NÉS) was adopted in 2008, and in 2013,
a separate national water strategy was created that emphasizes the protection of water resources. These documents
primarily address the necessary measures needed to cope with the consequences of parallel increases in drought
and flood frequency on the economy and the environment. Urban heat waves are a specified vulnerability for Hungary
that could have a direct connection to water utilities. Better management of precipitation and the creation of storage
facilities to meet nondrinking water needs are envisaged to reduce this vulnerability. Flood protection actions target
the reinforcement of dykes and the creation of flood water storage reservoirs to lower peak flood levels. The use of
subsurface resources cushions the sector from the most direct effects of climate change.

Water supply sources. Bank-filtered and subsurface resources are the key source of water supply. The direct
use of surface water for domestic/public purposes is minor (5%), whereas bank-filtered resources (indirect service
provided from surface water) represent 40.5%. The domestic/public consumption of subsurface resources amounts
to 54.5% of the overall water resources used (KvVM 2010). The bank-filtered resources are generally of good quality
and quantity. however, they are dependent on river morphology developments. The use of subsurface water resources
is concentrated, and there are local resource constraints with respect to the volume of extraction. Shallow subsurface
sources are often polluted, especially from agricultural sources.

Almost all municipal utilities serve several towns and villages,
some of them covering over 100 settlements. The assets of these
companies and of the service provider utility company are owned

Policy-making and sector institutions. Since 2012, the Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority
(HEA) has been the key institution that regulates and oversees the water sector. The 2011 sector reform in its Act
CCIX on Water Utility Supply established a central regulator, replacing a primarily municipally regulated system. There
is also a clear line ministry and no overlapping between mandates of the institutions involved in the sector. At the
national level, the key stakeholders are (Figure 2):

XXThe     Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority (HEA), which is responsible for economic regulation,
     licensing, and monitoring of the water and sanitation sector.

XXThe    Ministry of National Development, which is responsible for approving the tariffs proposed by HEA.

XXThe     General Directorate of Water Management, which is part of the Ministry of the Interior, which is the line ministry
     for the water sector. Its regional bodies are responsible for management of the state-owned infrastructure against
     water damage, and for water management.

XXThe    National Public Health and Medical Officer Service, which is responsible for monitoring drinking-water quality,
     through its county-level bodies.

XXThe      National Inspectorate for Environment, Nature and Water, which is part of the Ministry of Agriculture and which
     is in charge of monitoring effluent discharges and the environmental status of water bodies. It also issues water
     extraction and wastewater discharge licenses.

Capacity and training. There is no formal training institute for the water utility sector. The water utility association
(MAVIZ) organizes occasional training sessions, workshops, and conferences. Staff are usually highly qualified,
especially in large water utilities, and staff turnover is generally not a problem.

Economic regulation. The central regulator, HEA, is in charge of developing tariff proposals for approval by
the Minister of National Development. Based on the tariff-setting regulation (a government decree) currently
under development, water utilities will submit detailed information to the water utility regulator, which will make a
tariff proposal to the Minister of National Development, which will set the tariff. A new tariff methodology is under
development. Two-part tariffs are prescribed by law, and up to 50% of cross-financing between commercial and
household customers is allowed. Until the above-mentioned decree is passed, tariffs were frozen at current levels in
2012 and further decreased by law in 2013. They will probably be set according to the new regulation in 2016.

Service coverage. Hungarian utilities provide almost full access to drinking water services, and there is a declining
gap between water and sewer connections. Ninety-seven percent of the population is connected to drinking water
networks (Authors’ elaboration). The connection rate to the sewer system increased from 46% in 1990 to 74% in 2012
(Figure 3), with urban connection rates of 85% and rural rates of 47% (KSH 2015). Almost three-quarters of collected
wastewater is treated at least at the secondary level (KSH 2015).

Service infrastructure. the water network is mature, while some upgrading is still needed for sanitation
infrastructure. The drinking water network is complete, while wastewater network coverage stands at 74% (KSh
2015), and still growing, although at a slower pace during the last few years. Sewers on average are younger
than water mains. The condition of drinking water treatment plants ranges from average to good, but in some
municipalities additional treatment (especially arsenic removal) is needed, for which investment projects are
underway. The sewage from all medium and large towns is treated to at least secondary level. Wastewater
management of many small (below 2,000 p.e.) settlements still needs to be addressed.

Customer satisfaction. Most customers are satisfied with water services and water quality. While there are no
nationwide domestic surveys on this topic, customers are primarily satisfied with service levels and drinking water
quality. Seventy-seven percent of Hungarian citizens responding to the international Gallup survey responded that
they were satisfied with the quality of drinking water, placing Hungary in the top countries surveyed (Gallup 2013).

Overall efficiency. The overall efficiency of the sector is good, with significant variations across utilities. For most
performance indicators, the water sector in Hungary displays above average performance in a regional comparison.
Nevertheless, behind these average figures, there are notable variations of efficiency among utilities. Nonrevenue
water reached 24% in 2012, or 6.1 m3/km/day (KSH 2015). This level shows good technical operational performance
of services compared to other countries in the Danube region. However, nonrevenue water varies from 10% to 45%
among Hungarian water utilities (KSH 2015). The collection ratio is estimated at 94%, which indicates that utilities
are able to collect invoices from customers, thus generating revenues (KvVM 2010). Moreover, the average number of
staff per 1,000 connections is low at 3.5 (Expert estimate). This is among the best practice observed in the countries
of the Danube region, but it varies from 2 to 10 across the sector.

Recent trends. At present, there are no clear trends in efficiency changes. After major improvements during the
1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, the performance of water utilities in Hungary levelled off for the last 5 to 10
years. Nonrevenue water expressed in percent remained stable between 2001 and 2012, while nonrevenue water
expressed in m3/km/day decreased by 9% over the same period (KSH 2015). The collection ratio also remained stable
over the last 10 years, and no significant improvement has been noticed. The metering level has steadily increased
since 2001 to nearly 100% today (Expert estimate), while water consumption per capita decreased by 6%, from
100 l/capita/day in 2001 to 94 l/capita/day in 2012 (KSH 2015). The number of staff per 1,000 connections has
steadily and slowly decreased over the last decade (Figure 4), allowing a reduction in the operating costs of utilities.
Small utilities are generally of lower efficiency than larger ones. After the ongoing mergers of the water utility reform
process, the average efficiency figures are expected to further improve.

investment needs. investment needs are mostly met with available funds. The funds needed for new investments
to meet EU obligations are more or less available from EU and government sources. Funds for reconstruction and
rehabilitation of existing assets are declining, and their level is no longer sufficient. According to the National Water
Basin Management Plan, about €1.7 billion should be invested from 2014 to 2027, with 30% going toward water

investments. Most investments are related to fulfilling EU directives obligations. Total investments planned in the
water sector for 2007–2013 amounted to €2.7 billion, more than 90% of which was financed by EU funds. In 2014,
less than half of this planned investment allocation had been spent, which represented an overall effort of €1.35 billion

Tariffs. After a substantial increase in real terms during the 1990s and 2000s, water and wastewater tariff
evolution followed inflation for the last 7 years. Between 2001 and 2008, water and wastewater tariffs doubled, on
average (Figure 8). But between 2008 and 2014, they remained stable following the inflation evolution. Water tariffs
paid by commercial entities are higher than household tariffs, since the act on water utility services allows cross-
subsidies between users, with the possibility of commercial tariffs being 150% higher than household tariffs.

Affordability. The affordability of water and sanitation is an issue for the low-income population, including
marginalized minorities. In 2012, the share of the potential cost of water in the average household budget was close
to 3% (Authors’ elaboration). In the bottom 40%, this share amounted to 4.2%, even though their average consumption
was only 70% of the average household (Authors’ elaboration). In the poorest 10 subregions (the administrative level
below counties), this value reaches 10% (KvVM 2010). Low-income minorities are in a very disadvantaged position,
often lacking direct access to piped drinking water.




Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
To evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment was
done, taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and
financing of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each
indicator, best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest to
those best performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology
to assess sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube
Water Program. The outcomes of this assessment for Hungary’s water sector are displayed in Figure 9, which also
shows average and best practices in the Danube region. The Hungarian sector sustainability score is 74, which is far
above the Danube average sustainability of 64, and is among the best practices in the region. The assessment shows
that, on average, the country performs well in terms of continuity of access to piped water and flush toilet, collection
ratio, nonrevenue water and staffing level. The main deficiencies of Hungary’s water sector identified through the
sector sustainability assessment are the operating cost ratio, affordability, and investments (Figure 9)..

  must be covered by tariffs (that is, the part of the tariffs not subject to the tariff freeze and cut), but the costs
  necessary for maintenance or the additional cost of operation can no longer be added to the tariff base. Thus, a
  growing inventory of assets needs to be maintained, with shrinking resources for maintenance. Moreover, since
  water and sewerage tariffs were frozen in 2012, and decreased by law in 2013, revenues collected by utilities are
  decreasing.

XXPreventing  the degradation of assets in the longterm. While assets of most water utilities have been properly
  maintained during the last two decades, few companies made efforts to create sufficient reserves for their future
  replacement. As a result, the infrastructure is aging and its average condition is slowly declining. The quality of
  service continues to be good, so the threat of asset decline is not immediate. Due to the 2013 tariff cut, utilities
  have accumulated even lower reserves than before, and maintenance has become problematic for many operators.
  Without external support from government grants for investments or an increase in tariff revenues, the trend of
  asset decline does not seem reversible.

XXPreparing  for the risks caused by climate change. Most water utility managers are aware of the types of risks
  caused by climate change (such as new patterns of precipitation, stress on sewerage, changing patterns of water
  consumption, and change in water resources used for drinking water), but the everyday challenges of maintaining
  a high level of operation under worsening financial conditions make it difficult to focus on the long term. While the
  companies have strategic plans, climate change is rarely addressed in them, and risk management systems are
  usually not in place within the utilities.
