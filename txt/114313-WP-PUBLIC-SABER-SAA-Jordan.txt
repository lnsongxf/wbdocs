SCHOOL AUTONOMY AND ACCOUNTABILITY                                                                              2015

   1. Autonomy in Planning and Management of the School Budget
      The Ministry of Education (MoE) supplies the majority of the operational budget for schools
      and manages some items directly. A portion of the school operational budget is prepared at
      the school level by the principal using a form from the central MoE. The regional Directorate
      of Education approves the operating budget form submitted by the principals. Schools have
      the authority to raise additional funds from other sources. Principals are not required to
      consult parents or community members in the preparation or execution of the school budget.

   2. Autonomy in Personnel Management
      The initial recruitment and appointment of teaching and non-teaching staff is conducted at
      the central level, while their deployment is managed at both the central and regional levels by
      the MoE and the regional Directorates of Education. Decisions about the selection and
      evaluation of school principals are managed by the Directorates of Education.

   3. Participation of the School Council in School Governance
      The Parent-Teacher Council has no role in planning the school budget; however, the
      Educational Council that represents school clusters has a voice in adopting budget items. Both
      councils have no legal right or voice on teaching and non-teaching staff management and
      learning inputs. Members are elected and are involved in school projects where appropriate.

   4. Assessment of School and Student Performance
      There is no school assessment in Jordan to evaluate overall school performance. Student
      knowledge is evaluated using standardized student assessments. Annual national
      examinations take place in multiple grades. Results of the national examination are evaluated
      centrally and disseminated to regional directorates. Schools use exam results to make
      pedagogical adjustments when necessary.

   5. Accountability to Stakeholders
      Guidelines exist for the use of student assessment results and for analyzing student
      performance, but they are not used by parents to demand accountability. No official
      mandates are in place to simplify and explain results of assessments, nor to hold schools and
      the education system accountable for their performance to parents, communities, and the
      public. Regulations exist for complying with rules of financial accountability, but none for
      oversight of school operations.

As components of a managerial system, SBM activities
may behave as mediating variables: they produce an
enabling environment for teachers and students,
allowing for pedagogical variables, school inputs, and
personal effort to work as intended.

can be a substantial barrier to success. The managerial

is recommended that the MoE establish a policy for
packaging and disseminating information about student
assessments for school-level stakeholders. Some
countries have introduced school report cards or school
self-evaluations for this purpose. Often the country’s
education management information system pulls
relevant data to inform parts of the school report cards.

In addition, it is recommended that the MoE create a
policy that mandates comparative analysis of student
results annually. Results should be made easily

distribute summary results to parents. Although
comparative analysis of student results for different
types of schools, across regions, and for previous years
at the national and regional levels are carried out, the
summary analyses are not required to be distributed to
parents or the public. It is further recommended that the
MoE create a mandate for simplifying and explaining
results of student assessments to the public. Establishing
a policy to ensure that school-level results of student
assessment be administered to the public has been
shown to strengthen accountability links between
schools and communities (Winkler and Herstein 2005).

Last, in the Kingdom of Jordan no formally established
regulations are in place for ensuring accountability in
school operations. Some measures commonly used to
ensure accountability in school operations, include:
complying with the rules of school operations, reporting
to those with oversight authority; and linking rewards
and sanctions to operating performance. In Jordan
schools have records about school operations that they
are required to keep for reporting, but no requirements
exist for complying with rules of school operations. One
first step to ensuring accountability is to formally require
a policy or guidelines provided to schools to report on
their operations.

                The Systems Approach for Better Education Results
                (SABER) initiative collects data on the policies and
                institutions of education systems around the world and
                benchmarks them against practices associated with student
                learning. SABER aims to give all parties with a stake in
                educational results—from students, administrators, teachers,
                and parents to policymakers and business people—an
                accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the
                policies of their country’s education system are oriented
                toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

                This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of
                School Autonomy and Accountability.
