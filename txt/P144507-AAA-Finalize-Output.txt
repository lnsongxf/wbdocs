Provider Creditworthiness
Index Report
November 2015
Foreword
                                     The Constitution of Kenya ensures the provision of safe water in adequate quantities
                                     and access to sanitation as human right for the citizens. To achieve this goal, substantial
                                     investment in water supply and sanitation services infrastructure is required both for
                                     rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, as well as for expanding water supply and sewer
                                     connections to unserved areas. Given the competing demands from different sectors of
                                     the economy, it is increasingly difficult for the available public sector resources, to match
                                     investments required in the sector to meet the needs for growing population.

                                     Partnership with the private sector is critical in plugging the finance gap for infrastructure
                                     development. Water Services Providers (WSPs), operating above full cost coverage
                                     and under an effective regulatory environment, provide an opportunity for private sector
                                     financing. This is also enhanced by the bankability of the subsector.

                                   In 2011, to further help facilitate commercial lending into the water sector of Kenya, the
                      Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB), in collaboration with the Water and Sanitation Program
                      of the World Bank, facilitated shadow credit ratings of 43 Water Services Providers in Kenya. The
                      results of this exercise were published in the report “Financing Urban Water Services in Kenya: Utility
                      Shadow Credit Ratings”. The report identified 13 creditworthy WSPs. The publication of the Utility
                      Shadow Credit Ratings report was a large step towards accessing commercial financing for the
                      water services subsector in Kenya. The report spurred interest in commercial lending to the sector
                      among WSPs, commercial lenders and development partners. However, in spite of the advantages,
                      the report could not easily be annually updated because of complexity around data collection and
                      analysis and cost required for the annual update.

                      To resolve this problem and provide a timely and cost effective credit assessment tool, the WSP
                      Creditworthiness Index was created. The Creditworthiness Index provides a simplified snap-shot of
                      the financial and operational performance of WSPs in lieu of performing full shadow credit ratings
                      analysis, which is more thorough but time consuming and expensive. The Creditworthiness Index
                      is automated and calculated from data collected by WASREB. Going forward, the Creditworthiness
                      Index will be incorporated into the annual Impact Reporting.

                      The trade off of this automation is that qualitative analysis normally performed in detailed shadow
                      credit rating is omitted. However, there is a significant correlation between the Creditworthiness
                      Index scores and the recently performed shadow ratings.

                      The Creditworthiness Index provides a useful starting point for screening the creditworthiness of the
                      WSPs by the commercial lenders and becomes a management tool for the WSPs. It will also provide
                      the public with insights about the capacity of the WSP to provide sustainable provision of water
                      services and the basis for demanding a high degree of financial accountability.

                      This report, together with the Impact Report, provides a snapshot of the financial and operational
                      performance of the WSPs across the sector and insights into the sector wide trends. Together with
                      the commercial lending toolkits that have been developed, the report provides both the public and
                      private sector with an insight of the sub-sector and the opportunities available.

                      I wish to acknowledge the various parties who made this exercise a success. I thank the World Bank
                      for its partnership with the WASREB in the exercise, the WSPs for their cooperation in providing
                      information, WASREB’s staff for quality control and coordination of the exercise, and all the teams
                      involved in the drafting and editing of this report.

Executive Summary
1.1	Rationale
The Kenya water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector has been on a long path                 In lieu of a full shadow credit
of facilitating commercial lending to Water Service Providers (WSPs). A key                rating, the Creditworthiness
component of this effort is the evolution of rating the credit risk of WSPs for local      Index provides a simplified

analysis to help lenders assess the creditworthiness of WSPs, yet have a system            performance of WSPs.
that is simple and affordable enough to replicate on an annual basis.

To solve this trade-off, the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB)
and the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank have created a                      The Creditworthiness Index
Creditworthiness Index for the WSPs in Kenya. In lieu of performing a full                 is automated and calculated

shot of the financial and operational performance of WSPs. In contrast to
shadow credit ratings, which have been done on WSPs in Kenya and are
based on intensive analysis of separate WSPs, the Creditworthiness Index is
automated and calculated from data self-reported by WSPs into the existing
WASREB database, the Water Regulation Information System (WARIS).1

The trade-off of this automation is that none of the typical qualitative analysis
included in a rating assessment is captured in the Creditworthiness Index
(e.g. management capacity assessments, company structure, government

                                                                                                    World Bank/WASREB        1
                                      support, etc.). However, when compared to recent shadow ratings results of
                                      the ten most-likely-to-borrow WSPs in Kenya, the pilot Creditworthiness Index
                                      was shown to be reasonably correlated with the shadow rating results.

                                      While not a rating, the Creditworthiness Index provides lenders with an initial
                                      overview credit screening of WSPs. It is a useful tool for lenders in determining
                                      which WSPs merit further credit review for potential loans. The Creditworthiness
                                      Index, in conjunction with WASREB’s Impact Report, is designed to provide
                                      lenders a snap-shot of the financial and operational performance of WSPs
                                      across the sector and insights into sector-wide trends and their key drivers.
                                      Therefore, the Creditworthiness Index is designed to be the first stage of a
                                      lender’s credit analysis and due diligence.

                                      The Creditworthiness Index also provides WSPs with a benchmark to measure
                                      their overall creditworthiness as well as their individual financial performance
                                      against their peers. The examination of the financial and operational indicators,
                                      in comparison to the market, will assist WSPs to gauge performance and
                                      institute measures to improve business efficiency and creditworthiness.

                                      Lastly, the Creditworthiness Index provides information to the regulator to
                                      identify financial management weaknesses in specific WSPs as well as identify
                                      systemic problems in the sector. Going forward, the Creditworthiness Index
                                      results report, as seen in chapter 5, will be included in the regulator’s annual
                                      Impact Report.




                                      1.2	Background

financing.                            Government of Kenya has set a policy to attract private sector financing to
                                      bridge the financing gap.

                                      Private sector financiers, however, will only invest in the sector if the
                                      Government creates an enabling environment where the risk and reward is
                                      appropriately balanced for lending and the institutions seeking commercial
                                      finances are creditworthy.

                                      In 2011, in order to help facilitate commercial lending to the sector, WASREB,
                                      in collaboration with the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank,
                                      facilitated shadow credit ratings of 43 WSPs. The results of this shadow

credit rating review were published in a report entitled “Financing Urban Water
Services in Kenya: Utility Shadow Credit Ratings”. The shadow ratings report
identified 13 creditworthy WSPs.

The 2011 report successfully spurred initial interest in commercial lending of
WSPs, lenders and donors. However, the report was not readily or continuously
used by commercial lenders or WSPs and was not sustainable to produce on
an annual basis. .




1.3	 Creditworthiness Index
Creditworthiness is not static. Ratings of the WSPs can and will change over time         The Creditworthiness Index
and must be updated annually with the issuance of new audited financial statements.       is purely based on hard data
For this reason, WASREB and the World Bank created a Creditworthiness Index               submitted by the utilities
as a suitable and affordable alternative to the shadow rating report. An automated        and excludes qualitative
index is easier and cheaper to administer and provides an indicative assessment           interpretations ordinarily found in
of credit risk in lieu of a full shadow rating report.                                    a credit rating report.

The Creditworthiness Index is calculated solely from operational and financial
indicators based on data that is submitted annually to WASREB by the WSPs.
To allow for automation of the creditworthiness analysis, the Creditworthiness
Index excludes any qualitative interpretations ordinarily found in a rating report.
This automated reporting and calculation will allow WASREB to incorporate the
Creditworthiness Index into the annual Impact report.

It is worth emphasising that the Creditworthiness Index is only an indication
of potential creditworthiness. Commercial lending entities should carry out
their own credit analysis for lending decisions. Qualitative parameters are not
incorporated in the Creditworthiness Index. In particular, the index does not
consider the following parameters:
      	 management capacity, orientation, experience and qualification;
      	 human resources attitude orientation and performance;
      	 stakeholder support and relations;
      	 governance issues;
      	 legislative and regulatory framework; and
      	 strength of the economic base.




1.4	 The Purpose of the Index
The purpose of the Creditworthiness Index is to combine annual financial and
operational data into a snapshot metric to estimate a WSP’s creditworthiness. For
ease of reference and familiarity of scale, the well-known lettered rating symbols
are retained. In general, it is assumed that the Creditworthiness Index scores would
translate into the respective domestic credit rating. However, qualitative factors (not
included in the index) can greatly affect a borrower’s credit rating.

                                                                                                   World Bank/WASREB    3

                                     The methodology used in the Creditworthiness Index is much simpler than the
                                     shadow rating approach used in the 2011 report. The data collection is not

     Index programme                 are provided by WSPs directly into WASREB’s data management system, WARIS,
                                     and are not as extensive as the data collected in 2011. These data are then fed
                                     into the Creditworthiness Index programme to calculate the index. This process
                                     allows for automation of the index going forward.
  3. The Creditworthiness
     Index is computed
                                     Going forward, after the initial report, the index will be included in the regulator’s
                                     annual sector Impact report, providing both an annual indication of the WSPs’
                                     operational efficiency and creditworthiness for a given year.

     incorporated into the
     regulator's annual
     Impact report                   1.6	 Summary of Findings
                                     The Creditworthiness Index analysis indicates thirteen WSPs can be
                                     considered creditworthy. Fourteen of the WSPs were classified as currently
                                     not yet creditworthy but have the potential of being creditworthy with a small
                                     level of improvement. Twelve WSPs still require considerable improvement to
                                     be considered creditworthy while two were awarded a “no rating” due to lack
                                     of data to compute a reliable score and/or due to low scores (below 30).

Comparative Utility Creditworthiness
Assessment Report                             Sector in Africa

                                       The concept of undertaking shadow credit ratings of WSPs originated with
                                       Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank through its Mobilising
                                       Market Finance for Water Utilities in Africa program. The main purpose of
                                       this program was to facilitate private sector financing of water supply and
                                       sanitation service provision.

                                       The first step in this evolving methodology towards determining and reporting
                                       the creditworthiness of water utilities was the development of a credit
                                       assessment questionnaire. The questionnaire was initially envisioned to be
                                       a self-administered. However, a lack of objectivity in the responses of utility
                                       management led to overly positive evaluations of credit risk. To resolve this, the
                                       questionnaire was converted into a shadow credit rating/benchmarking model.

                                       To obtain a correlation between the predictions of the shadow rating model and
                                       what a formal rating would yield, seven African utilities were subjected to both a
                                       shadow rating review and a full formal rating. The formal ratings were performed
                                       by Global Credit Rating Company (GCR) and reported in African Water Utilities

                                       credit assessment reports for seven African water utilities.3 The shadow rating
                                       results proved consistently correlated with the formal ratings.

  6   Creditworthiness Index Report
The shadow rating model consisted of a questionnaire with 161 questions divided   Utility Shadow Rating Report
into external and internal factors covering:
     	 The Latest financial information (not necessarily from the audited
       statements as often these were not available at the time);
     	 Face to face interviews mostly with senior management; and
     	 81 multiple choice questions completed by the interviewer based on
       responses provided by the executive management of WSPs.

Each section of questions was weighted as outlined in Table 1 below.
The shadow rating approach had several shortcomings:
    	 The model is not suitable for self-assessment as sophisticated
      interpretative intelligence is required;
    	 Formal and shadow ratings employ both quantitative and qualitative
      assessments in evaluating past and predicting future performances.
      A computerised evaluation model can therefore only give an indicative
      shadow rating;
    	 The model lacks flexibility to adjust to circumstances that may be
      particular to a specific WSP;
    	 The quality of financial information should be strengthenedThe model
      was not synchronised with the WASREB Impact report resulting in
      duplication of data collection; and
    	 All questions regarding national government support elicited
      similar responses across WSPs hence did not provide any form of
      differentiation.

                                    Despite the shortcomings of the 2011 shadow rating approach listed above,
                                    the report was a useful tool in eliciting initial interest in commercial financing
                                    for the sector from the government, WSPs, WASREB, donors and commercial
                                    lenders. However, credit ratings are calculated using annual financial
                                    statements, so the 2011 report quickly became out of date and obsolete.
                                    There was a need for a source of regular and up-to-date information on the
                                    creditworthiness of the WSPs for the various stakeholders.

                                    Due to the shortcomings of the shadow rating approach, mainly the high cost
                                    and inability to replicate, WASREB and World Bank’s Water and Sanitation
                                    Program have designed an automated Creditworthiness Index system that
                                    can be easily compiled by WASREB and incorporated in the annual Impact
                                    Report. This report covers this index.

                                           Traditionally most of the financing for investments in the WSS sector has been
                                           sourced from government budgetary resources and development partners (as
                                           shown in Figure 4). Given the government’s limited budgetary resources, funding
                                           from donor sources currently provides more than half of the sector funding.
                                           With development partners shifting focus away from the WSS sector and limited
                                           government budgetary support, there are limited financial resources available to
                                           meet the increasing demand for WSS services.

                                           In 2002, the Kenyan government launched an ambitious program of reforms for the
                                           WSS sector, passing enabling legislation with clear roles and responsibilities of the
                                           key water institutions, increasing public spending to the sector, and pursuing other
                                           governance improvements such as the separation of water resources management
                                           from water supply services delivery. Previously service provision had been the
                                           responsibility of the Ministry in charge of Water, the National Water Conservation
                                           and Pipeline Corporation (NWCPC) as well as of a few local utilities established since
                                           1996. After the passage of the Water Act of 2002, service provision was gradually
                                           decentralized to 117 WSPs.

The 2002 reforms are acknowledged to be one of most advanced and
comprehensive institutional designs and intervention packages for the water
sector in Africa. The reforms are seen by most of the stakeholders as a key
step to improving water supply and sanitation in the country. Since their
implementation, the sector has been experienced significant progress.



3.2.2	Devolution in the Water Sector

On the 27th of August 2010, Kenya adopted a new constitution. The
Constitution established 47 counties, each with its own government, and
devolved service provision. Among other functions, the delivery of water and
sanitation services was devolved to the County Government level. This has
wide-ranging implications for the water sector.

Firstly, the Constitution recognizes access to safe and sufficient water and
reasonable standards of sanitation as a basic human right. Secondly, the
constitutional provisions firmly distribute the functions between the two levels of
government with the national government being tasked with the management
and protection of water resources while the County Governments are tasked
with the provision of water and sanitation services and the implementation of
the national government policies on natural resource including soil and water
conservation. The specific roles for the Counties in the WSS are listed below.

Roles of County Governments in the Water Sector
  a)	 Ensuring access to water and sanitation according to constitutional rights.

                                            catchment activities at county level.
                                        c)	 Protecting the interests of underserved consumers by enactment of
                                            regulations ensuring progressive achievement of the right to water
                                        d)	 Providing financial management through fiscal and investment
                                            planning. This is done through development of 5-year plans
                                            incorporating an investment and financing plan for the provision of
                                            water services.

                                     Under devolution, there arose a need for legislative alignment of the Water Act
                                     of 2002 to the new constitution. This has led to the creation of the Water Bill
                                     of 2014. The Bill is expected to advance the 2002 reforms with emphasis on
                                     the devolution of water services and sanitation.

                                     However, the Bill has not been enacted, as of the date of this publication,
                                     and there are areas that require clarity, including the asset ownership and
                                     the role and the responsibilities for the WSBs (who under the Act of 2002 are
                                     responsible for the sector investments).

                                     Constitutionally, County Governments cannot borrow without a full National
                                     Treasury guarantee. It is expressly prohibited to service loans from public
                                     money, making it impossible for County Governments to even guarantee the
                                     obligations of WSPs. Therefore, financial assistance for the sector must be
                                     drawn from development budgets of the respective counties.



                                     3.3	 Rationale for WSPs to Source Funds
                                     During the constitutional transition period, it important that investment in the
                                     sector continues in order to avoid an increasing investment backlog in that
                                     may add to future challenges.

                                     Since 2002, WSPs have been dependent on the WSBs for funding of WSS
                                     infrastructure investments. However, with limited budgets coupled with
                                     pressure to improve services, WSPs have had to look for alternative financing
                                     sources for investments in system improvements and expansion.




12   Creditworthiness Index Report
The more financially sound WSPs have looked to raise commercial financing,
supported by their income streams, to fund system expansion. The
Creditworthiness Index is designed to help facilitate this borrowing.
Commercial lending institutions in Kenya are unfamiliar with the water sector
and WSPs’ ability to generate surplus cash flows and service loans. Therefore,
a Creditworthiness Index will play a key role in facilitating lending to the sector
by closing the information gap between financial institutions and WSPs.

Introduction to the
Creditworthiness Index


4.1	 Introduction to Credit Ratings
A credit rating is a formal opinion by an independent, specialized agency
(the credit rating agency) on the long term ability, capacity, and willingness
of a borrower to repay debt on a timely basis. The process of assessment is
part science and part art in the sense that both historical data and qualitative
analysis are used to predict trends into the future.

4.1.1	International Versus Domestic Ratings

Ratings reflect an entity’s probability of defaulting on an obligation against
benchmark investments that are regarded as “risk-free”. Risk-free borrowers
(generally considered risk-free however very low levels of risk exist) represent
the highest quality credit and are awarded an AAA (‘triple A’) rating.

A lower credit rating indicates a higher probability that an entity will default
on its debt payment. Figure 5 indicates the actual default rates versus credit
ratings of global corporate borrowers. Many entities (sovereigns, corporates,
utilities and municipalities) are rated. Moreover, specific debt instruments
issued by these entities can also be rated. The ratings of an entity and one of
its specific issues may differ due to the seniority and underlying security that
underpins an instrument.

                                               On a global scale, sovereign ratings use the most robust economies, where defaults
                                               are regarded as highly improbable, as benchmarks. Ratings of sovereigns are
                                               based on a number of macro-economic considerations such as export surpluses,
                                               foreign reserves, and the general strength of the economy. Examples of AAA rated
                                               economies are Singapore, Germany, and New Zealand. Most emerging market
                                               economies, due to their higher risks, have lower credit ratings. Kenya, for example,
                                               has an international rating of B+.

                                               Domestic ratings use a ‘within-country’ approach by benchmarking other institutions
                                               to the government of the country. On a domestic rating scale, the government receives
                                               an AAA rating for borrowing in its local currency, even though its international rating
                                               may be far below AAA. In this assessment, the Kenyan government has a domestic
                                               rating of AAA on Kenya shilling denominated debt while the international rating is
                                               B+. In the domestic ratings context, the sovereign is largely regarded as risk-free
                                               as it can effectively print money to make a debt service payment. This implies that
                                               domestically, no entity can have a higher rating than the sovereign benchmark.
                                               Domestic ratings are normally indicated by a country suffix, such as BB+.ke for an
                                               organization or debt instrument rated in the Republic of Kenya.

                                               4.1.2	The Benefits of Credit Ratings

                                               There are a number of benefits of having a formal credit rating. A formal credit rating:
                                                   	 Provides an independent and objective evaluation of a WSP’s
                                                     creditworthiness to banks, financial institutions, and other lenders.
                                                   	 Has proven to be an accurate predictor of the risk of default.
                                                   	 Allows a potential lender or investor to compare different WSPs or
                                                     institutions with each other and assess their relative creditworthiness.
                                                   	 Assists investors in pricing risk correctly, helping financial institutions decide
                                                     whether to lend to the entity and calculate the cost (interest rate spread) for
                                                     the borrower.
                                                   	 Can improve the negotiating position of the WSP with its lenders, especially
                                                     with regard to financing costs.

    	 Allows the rated entity to identify and focus on areas that reduce its
      creditworthiness and launch actions to address these issues.



4.2	 Why a Creditworthiness Index
Formal credit ratings can be relatively expensive (estimated around USD 15,000
from a regional agency and USD 40,000-60,000 from a global agency) as they
depend on in-depth assessment and in-person due diligence and interviews.
This cost is incurred annually by the borrower and is often not a realistic option
for WSPs trying to finance smaller scale infrastructure development.

This challenge gave rise to the concept of shadow ratings which are a less
rigorous assessment and not publicly available. However, shadow ratings,
while slightly cheaper, are still expensive relative to the average transactions
in the Kenya water sector. The Creditworthiness Index offers a much simpler
and affordable, though notably less sophisticated indication of a utility’s credit
strength.

4.2.1	Purpose of the Creditworthiness Index

The purpose of the Creditworthiness Index is to summarise the financial data
of WSPs into a quick reference metric that can be easily integrated with the
operational data reported in the sector Impact report. With the inclusion of the
Creditworthiness Index, the Impact report will provide an annual snapshot of the
performance of all WSPs’ operational and financial performance.

                                            yet-to-be passed Water Bill of 2014. Failure to uphold this principle
                                            poses a risk to the continued commercial viability of a WSP.

                                          	 Constitutional Evolution: Following the promulgation of the new
                                            Constitution of Kenya in 2010, the responsibility of WSS services
                                            provision shifted to the County Governments. The current governing
                                            Act (Water Act of 2002) does not incorporate the devolved county
                                            structure and a new Water Bill 2014 aligning the Act to the Constitution
                                            is yet to be passed. This has created a lack of clarity with respect the

                                            can face pressure from political representatives to keep tariffs at
                                            unsustainably low levels or fund non-viable projects. Management of

18   Creditworthiness Index Report
    	 Impact of Increased Coverage: As WSPs increase coverage, they
      often start providing services to less commercially viable areas, leading
      to lower levels of system utilisation (sometimes not even covering the
      costs).

    	 Willingness to Pay: Willingness to pay is not currently a big problem
      in Kenya. However, the introduction of higher tariffs in order to adjust
      to cost reflective levels coupled with extending coverage to poorer low
      consumption areas may put pressure on the consumers’ ability and
      willingness to pay.

    	 Legal and Regulatory Institutional Environment: Currently, WSPs
      can legally borrow provided they receive appropriate approvals from
      their Boards of Directors, their respective WSBs and provided that
      loan repayment is not met through public money. Currently tariffs are
      not included in the definition of public money; however, the legal status
      of these funds in the new Water Act is not known. Various roles are
      expected to be further defined once the 2014 Water Bill is enacted.

Guidance manuals covering the roles and obligations involved in commercial
financing of Kenya WSPs are available for lenders, utilities and County
governments. These manuals can be downloaded from the regulator’s website
(http://wasreb.go.ke/publications).

The Creditworthiness Index methodology used to calculate the individual

rating approach as the data collection is not as extensive. The Creditworthiness         data from WSPs
Index relies solely on data from the financial statements and operating
statistics as reported by the WSPs in WASREBs reporting database, WARIS.

                                                    WSPs in WASREB’s WARIS database. Table 3 below lists the indicators and
                                                    weightings used in the index calculation.

                                                    In consultation with local lenders, ranges of norms were established for each
                                                    indicator, with scores of 0-4 allocated to each norm in order to align the rating
                                                    with the Kenya business credit risk universe. The Creditworthiness Index result
                                                    is therefore an aggregation of the weighted scoring with a maximum score
                                                    of 100. A score of 85-100 would depict a highest credit quality in the Kenya
                                                    business market. Table 4 provides a summary of the ranges and the indicative

 22     Creditworthiness Index Report
Table 10 in Annex D describes the alterations made from the WaterCAT
methodologies to create the Creditworthiness Index. As the WaterCAT
methodology relied heavily on qualitative analysis (management interviews,
government support, staff capacity assessment, etc.), some indicators were
introduced to the Creditworthiness Index to act as a proxy for qualitative
analysis.

Indicators, weightings and score ranges were retained from WaterCAT where
applicable and available. Other indicators, weightings and score ranges were
based on WaterCAT methodologies but also took into account input from
local lenders’ credit views and global standards. Many of the weightings of
the indicators had to be increased from WaterCAT in order to replace the
weighting of qualitative indicators not applicable in the Creditworthiness Index.

The rationale for allocating weights is that all indicators, although individually
important, have varying importance when it comes to the overall credit
assessment. See Table 3 above and Annexure A for respective weights.
In addition to the weighting, there are performance ranges with different
scoring points for each indicator. These were applied by awarding a score for
different performance levels. The range of norms and points associated with
the different performances are indicated in Annexure A.

The rating rewarded for different scores, largely based on the previous ratings
work in Kenya, are shown in the table below. The definitions associated with
the different credit categories are as indicated in Table 4.

                                     The data required for the computation of the indicators used to compute the index
                                     is extracted from WARIS.

                                     Whenever possible, the financial data inputs are based on financial statements audited
                                     by the Office of the Auditor General of Kenya. However, due to timing issues, the data
                                     utilized in populating the Creditworthiness Index is often sourced from management
                                     accounts that have been submitted to, but not yet audited by, the Auditor General
                                     for auditing. The data is validated by WASREB. Any inconsistencies are flagged by
                                     WASREB for the WSPs to review and remedy. Once audited reports are provided by
                                     the Officer of Auditor General, WSPs are required to update their records in WARIS
                                     for any changes arising. In line with the regulator’s Impact Report data verification
                                     procedure, WASREB will carry out annual in-depth verification on a sample of WSPs
                                     to ensure the data provided is up to standard. Therefore, any errors in data entry
                                     occurring in a particular year will be rectified before the annual data is reported as
                                     historical data in the following year’s report.


24   Creditworthiness Index Report
4.2.4	Important Note on First Year Methodology Fix

The Creditworthiness Index was designed as a long term tool to measure objectively
financial capacity of WSPs and award scores based on various indicators. The ability
of a WSP to generate cash for debt service is one of the most critical indicators for
creditworthiness.

Unfortunately for the current year (2013-14), as this was the first year of data
collection in WARIS, it was not possible to obtain accurate data on cash generated
from operations as well as the amounts of cash used for debt service for many
of the WSPs. To resolve this problem in the initial year (the year covered in this
report), EBITDA was used as proxy for cash generated from operations, and levels
of debt service were estimated for WSPs with debt based on amounts of loans in
their books. This is a one-off measure. In the coming reporting cycles, cash flow
information, including the data that was not collected in 2013-14, will be submitted
to WASREB by the WSPs.

In addition, most WSPs have nil or insignificant loans, mostly asset finance loans
for vehicles where these existed. Only Nyeri, Eldoret and Kiamumbi have reported
significant debt. Therefore, in this index, only three WSPs had debt service
incorporated in their creditworthiness scores. All other WSPs did not have debt
service indicators incorporated into their rating.

Some WSPs have potential debt service obligations to their WSBs; however,
these debts are not reported in the financial statements and are not included in
the calculation of the Creditworthiness Index score for this year. However, during
their credit analysis review, commercial lenders should investigate whether WSPs
are servicing loans on infrastructure secured by their WSBs and not reported in the
WSP annual financial statements.

Going forward, cash flow information will be submitted into WARIS and the index
will revert to using the Debt/CFADS and DSCR indicators. Moreover, as more WSPs
access commercial financing, the debt indicators will become more significant in the
industry and more useful.

                                                weaknesses. One WSP received a ‘no rating’ due to a lack of sufficient data

*As indicated in section 5.1 above, WSPs that have scored within the range of 40-50 can be viewed as potentially creditworthy due to
their ability to score within the high creditworthiness range if they were to undertake reforms to improve their operational and financial
indicators

                                             There were 13 WSPs that were regarded as being creditworthy in the 2011

                                             parameters are being measured. In particular, the Creditworthiness Index has
                                             eliminated the more qualitative based parameters. Nevertheless, it is expected
               0	5	10	15                     that Creditworthiness Index scores should relatively translate into similar
                   Number of WSPs            shadow credit ratings as other financial and operational measures considered
                                             in both review similar WSPs’ efficiencies.

                                             Twelve WSPs have a higher index score than the 2011 rating, thirteen have
                                             lower scores, eight have obtained the similar ratings and seven new WSPs
                                             have been included in the current index report. One of the new WSP was
                                             not rated due to insufficient data. The elimination from the index of some
                                             of the more judgemental and discretionary indicators, as well as change in
                                             performance since 2011, is largely responsible for the movement.

                                             Table 6 below gives a comparison between the 2011 shadow ratings and
                                             a hypothetical estimated equivalent rating from the current Creditworthiness
                                             Index.

                                                   Rating Analysis of 10 WSPs
                                              As part of the Kenya Urban Water Utility Commercial Financing Project,
                                              shadow credit ratings were conducted on the ten WSPs most likely to seek
                                              and receive commercial financing. Despite currently pursuing a loan, the
                                              Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC) was not selected to receive a
                                              shadow rating, due to the company’s size and complexity. However, NWSC is
                                              covered in the Creditworthiness Index.

                                              For the shadow rating evaluation, the WSPs offices and key installations such
                                              as water and sewerage treatment plants were visited in early 2015. Each
                                              WSP also provided their 5 year historical financial statements, operational and
                                              human resource data for analysis. The rating analysis was complimented by
                                              face-to-face interviews with senior management using the same methodology
                                              employed in the 2011 shadow credit rating exercise.

                                              The table below gives a comparison between the results of the shadow credit
                                              ratings and the Creditworthiness Index. The results are largely consistent

                                              is largely responsible for any differences in ratings.

32      Creditworthiness Index Report
5.4	 Analysis of Key Indicators
This section analyses how WSPs performed in key Creditworthiness
Index indicators as well as assesses historical trends of indicators.
The analysis is useful in helping WSPs benchmark their performance
against the average WSPs within their category. As indicators
determine the creditworthiness score, WSPs can use the individual
indicator scores to assess their performance relative to sector
averages and identify shortcomings to address to improve their
financial management and creditworthiness.

Note, the historical trends graphs and analysis starting in section 5.4.2
are broken into to high creditworthiness and low creditworthiness
groups of WSPs as well as pre-2011 and post-2011. The pre-
2011 data is based on the 2011 Shadow Credit Report data which
factored in qualitative indicators which are not included in the post-
2011 Creditworthiness Index data. In addition, a few of the WSPs
have moved from creditworthy to low-creditworthy, and vice versa,
under the different methodologies.

5.4.1	Overview of Indicator Table

Table 8 shows a breakdown of how the WSPs have performed in
each of the individual indicators. Note: the values in the table are
not the ratio values but are calculated scores ranging from zero
to the Maximum Score listed in the top row. Annexure E provides
more explanation on these ranges and values.

“No Score” (NS) score was allocated where there was no data
provided. NS scores were prevalent on indicators involving debt and
debt service, as the majority of WSPs have no borrowings. Therefore,
the ratings for WSPs without debt cannot, and are not, scored out of
the maximum 100. Indicators with ‘NS’ scores are deducted from the
total score of 100. The aggregate score is then calculated from the
pro rata adjusted total score to allow for comparison of WSPs.

Note: Debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/ Debt Service Payments, marked
with an asterisk, have been used on a one-off basis for this year’s
data as proxy indicators for Debt/ Cash available for debt service
(CFADS) and Debt Service Cover Ratio (DSCR) due lack of sufficient
cash flow information. Going forward, the index will discard their use
and revert to Debt/CFADS and DSCR. See section 4.2.4 Important
Note on First Year Methodology Fix for more explanation.

There has been deterioration in this ratio from 2010, when the average
for low creditworthiness WSPs was roughly 101% with the current
level at about 88%. This indicates no major changes in the ability of
WSPs to build reserves, undertake capital works from own resources
or service debt.

This ratio has remained fairly stable for high creditworthiness WSPs
with 115% recorded in 2011 compared to the current of 118%. This
indicates that the potential for better rated WSPs to service debt has
remained strong.

5.4.4	Debtor Days

The debtor days measures the revenue not paid but owed to the                                Figure 13: Average Number of Debtor
WSPs by debtors (accounts receivable) and indicates how quickly                              Days by Credit Index
cash is being collected from billings. The longer it takes a WSP to
collect accounts receivable, the greater the number of debtor days,
and the less funds come into the firm.                                                                 <30                                 557

                                                                                                 31 to 40                     75
Debtor days are a critical indicator of the cash flow position of a WSP.
A WSP may be solvent in terms of having more assets than liabilities                             41 to 50              142
but not in terms of its cash position if billings are not readily converted
into cash. Debtor days therefore have substantial impact on the                                  51 to 60                  196
liquidity of the WSP.                                                                            61 to 70            103

The average debtor days in 2011 assessment were 220 days. There                                  71 to 80       41
has been an improvement across the board with the average debtor                                             0	 100	 200	300	400	500	600
days at 188 days. The reduction in debtor days is encouraging. The                                                           Debtor Days
average debtor days are however still far from the industry accepted
norm of 45 to 60 days. WSPs with better index have lower debtor days.




                                                                                                                       World Bank/WASREB    37
                                                WSPs should seek to address outstanding debtors and institute
                                                provisioning for bad debts to improve their debtor days score. The
                                                Creditworthiness Index measures and gives higher scores for WSPs that
                                                have set bad debt provisioning policies.

                                                Furthermore, through the ‘reduction in the debtor days’ indicator, the
                                                Creditworthiness Index acknowledges and rewards improvements in
                                                collections and cleaning up of the debtors’ book. This emphasis is due
                                                to the high debtor days, mostly resulting from legacy debt inherited and
                                                mostly un-recoverable, affecting numerous WSPs. Efficient utilities would
                                                reduce this through collecting or writing off bad debt.

 51 to 60                              98       standard of 85% collection efficiency set by WASREB. It is worth noting
                                                that better rated WSPs have higher collection efficiencies. Figure 15

                                                shows a historical trend of collection efficiency that indicates a steady
 71 to 85                                 98    improvement across both high creditworthiness and low creditworthiness
            80	 85	 90	 95	100	105              WSPs. This could be attributable to an improvement in revenue collection
                      %                         systems and WSPs more aggressively pursuing debtors.

Conclusions
An actual assessment of credit risk can only be achieved through proper credit
rating analysis. However, the Creditworthiness Index provides the market with
an affordable and sustainable overview credit screening of WSP universe. It is
a useful initial tool for lenders in determining which WSPs a potential borrowers
and merit further credit review.

The Creditworthiness Index, in conjunction with the Impact report, provides
lenders with a snap-shot of both the financial and operational performance of
WSPs across the sector as well as insights into sector-wide trends and their
key drivers.

The Creditworthiness Index suggests that thirteen WSPs can be considered
as creditworthy in the domestic market, with a reasonable expectation of
being able to service debt. However further credit assessment must be done
by lenders and the size of loans may be limited due to the thin margins of
operating cost covers in most WSPs.

The Creditworthiness Index provides WSPs a benchmark to measure overall
creditworthiness as well as individual financial indicator performance against
their peers. Further examination of the financial and operational indicators, in
comparison to its peers, will assist WSPs to gauge performance and institute
measures to improve business efficiency and creditworthiness.

The Creditworthiness Index provides the regulator information to identify
financial management weaknesses in specific WSPs as well identify systemic
problems in the historical trends in the sector.

                                     Now that the index is established and incorporated in the annual sector
                                     reporting of the regulator, further analysis will be needed to verify the use
                                     and benefit by the three categories of stakeholders—utilities, lenders and
                                     governments/regulator. Once verified successful in Kenya, the benefits of the
                                     Creditworthiness Index should be replicable in other markets.

                                                    to create the Creditworthiness Index. As the WaterCAT methodology relied
                                                    heavily on qualitative analysis (management interviews, government support,
                                                    staff capacity assessment, etc.), some indicators were introduced to the
                                                    Creditworthiness Index to act as a proxy for qualitative analysis. Indicators,
                                                    weightings and score ranges were retained from WaterCAT where applicable
                                                    and available. Other indicators, weightings and score ranges were based on
                                                    WaterCAT methodologies but also took into account input from local lenders’
                                                    credit views and global standards. Many of the weightings of the indicators had
                                                    to be increased from WaterCAT in order to replace the weighting of qualitative

64    Creditworthiness Index Report
7.5	 Annexure E: Creditworthiness
     Index Model Statistical Analysis
A regression analysis was performed to measure the interdependency
between the indicator variables (see Annexure E) that create the overall
Creditworthiness Index Score. The analysis segregated the variables to
ensure they are independent of one another by dividing the test variables
into two categories:

the dependent variables: the ‘financial and credit management’ variables,
which are largely based on data from utility financial statements, and the
independent variables: the non-financial internal and external factors
used as predictors. The independent variables selected were Poverty
Rate, , Water Coverage, NRW, Staff per 1000 Connections, Revenue
Diversification and Average Tariff Differential.

The results of the statistical analysis on the model are shown in the table
below:

                                     The regression results show that 95.76% (R Square) of the variations in the
                                     financial scores are explained by the variations in the non-financial indicators
                                     selected. The model therefore provides a good fit with only a small variation
                                     (less than 4.3%) in financial scores that can be attributed to other factors
                                     other than the seven factors listed above. This is consistent with the F test,
                                     where critical F is estimated at 2.22, significantly less than the value for F
                                     shown in the ANOVA table above at 128. The significant F value is almost nil
                                     (2.1265E-20), consistent with good model fit.

                                     It is however important to look at the significance of the individual variable
                                     parameters effecting the financial score and hence the Creditworthiness
                                     Index. This can be deduced from the p values from the table above. At 95%
                                     confidence level, the model shows that the most significant factors are NRW
                                     (with a p value of 0.0001), tariff, number of staff and poverty rate in that order.

                                     Water coverage and revenue diversification (with p values close to 5%) are
                                     less significant and only explain about 1% of the variation (after a separate
                                     regression). This could be explained by the fact that none of the WSPs get
                                     significant revenues from other sources other than WSS charges. In addition,
                                     the WSS coverage, which is expressed by the percentage of the population
                                     served, appears to have low impact as WSP financial performance is affected
                                     more by water produced and sold irrespective of the population with access
                                     to WSS services.

                                     The statistical significance of poverty rate is largely attributable to better
                                     tariffs realisation likely occurring where the poverty index is low. The
                                     regression analysis therefore suggests that WSPs wishing to increase their
                                     Creditworthiness Index score would have best results if they sought to:

                                     1. reduce non-revenue water (NRW)
                                     2. increase tariffs
                                     3. reduce number of staff and staff costs
