I. Objectives

This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Nicaragua perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Nicaragua regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Nicaragua;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Nicaragua;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Nicaragua; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Nicaragua.

       Use data to help inform the Nicaragua country team’s strategy.




II. Methodology
In May thru July 2012, 328 stakeholders of the World Bank in Nicaragua were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President, Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 240
stakeholders participated in the country survey (73%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned it accordingly, or
completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Nicaragua, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s
future role in Nicaragua, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Nicaragua:

A. General Issues facing Nicaragua: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Nicaragua is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Nicaragua.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Nicaragua, Bank staff preparedness, the
   extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, their
   agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the
   Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Nicaragua, with which groups the Bank should
   work more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Nicaragua, the extent to
   which the Bank meets Nicaragua’s need for knowledge services, financial instruments, and
   mobilizing additional financial resources for development, and the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across thirty-six development areas, such as economic growth.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, and
   the Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Nicaragua: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Nicaragua’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Nicaragua. Respondents
   were also asked to rate their familiarity with the work of the IFC, the effectiveness of the
   different parts of the World Bank Group to collaborate and coordinate efforts, and how
   significant a role the IFC should play in Nicaragua.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy .
   Respondents were also asked their level of agreement that they know how to find information
   from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Nicaragua, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of a Minister were
        combined with those from the office of the President, consultants working on Bank-
        supported projects were combined with respondents from PMUs, respondents from CBOs
        were combined with those from NGOs, respondents from the financial sector/private
        banks were combined with those from the private sector, and the few respondents from
        private foundations were included in the “Other” category.

Geographic Location

       The vast majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Managua. Because
        of the small number of respondents from Pacifico, Atlantico, and Central Nicaragua,
        these locations were combined into an “Other Areas” category for all further analyses.
       Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        the Appendix (see page 85). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Survey. These
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. In the Nicaragua Country Survey
Report, geographic differences that are significant will be reported in the text only as related to
the indicator questions. Otherwise, these distinctions for all other questions can be found in the
Appendix (page 85).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness across most of these thirty-six areas of development. For the most part,
        employees of ministries, consultants on Bank projects/PMUs, and respondents from the
        office of the President/Minister tended to have the highest ratings for the Bank’s
        effectiveness in these areas whereas respondents from academia/research institutes and
        NGOs/CBOs tended to have significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness.
        Those areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:
                 Anti-corruption;
                 Information and communications technology;
                 Transport;
                 Law and justice;
                 Urban development;
                 Environmental sustainability;
                 Private sector regulatory framework;
                 Basic infrastructure;
                 Poverty reduction;
                 Gender;
                 Domestic private sector development;
                 Water and sanitation;
                 Economic growth;
                 Disaster management;
                 Higher education;
                 Public financial management;
                 Labor markets/job creation/employment;
                 Equality of opportunity;
                 Health;
                 Rural development;
                 Food security;
                 Basic education;
                 Governance;
                 Agricultural development;
                 Crime and violence; and
                 Natural resource management.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Nicaragua, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings o f its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Nicaragua. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at food security;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at labor markets/job creation/employment; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Nicaragua, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development.

Knowledge: Meeting Nicaragua’s Knowledge Needs (Indicator Question)

       Across all respondents, ratings that the World Bank meets Nicaragua’s needs for
        knowledge services received a mean rating of 6.3.
             Employees of ministries, consultants on Bank projects/PMUs, and respondents
              from multilateral agencies gave the highest ratings for the World Bank meeting
              Nicaragua’s needs for knowledge services whereas respondents from
              NGOs/CBOs, local government, and the office of a Parliamentarian gave

Knowledge: Effectiveness

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in ratings of the World Bank’s
        knowledge and research effectiveness at all but one of these aspects. For the most part,
        consultants on Bank projects/PMUs and respondents from the office of the
        President/Minister had the highest ratings for the effectiveness of the Bank’s knowledge
        and research across these areas whereas respondents from academia/research institutes
        tended to have significantly lower ratings. Those areas with significant stakeholder group
        differences were:
             Raising your awareness of the particular topic;
             Stimulating public debate/dialogue;
             Helping to build public consensus around reforms;
             Contributing to good policy making; and
             Providing support for program implementation.

The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner

       There were significant stakeholder group differences across many of these aspects of the
        Bank being an effective development partner in Nicaragua. For the most part,
        consultants on Bank projects/PMUs tended to have the highest ratings for these aspects
        whereas respondents from academia/research institutes and NGOs/CBOs tended to have
        significantly lower ratings. Those aspects of the Bank being an effective development
        partner with significant stakeholder group differences were:

             Flexibility (in terms of the instit ution’s products and services);
             Flexibility (in terms of changing country circumstances);
             Being inclusive;

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Nicaragua or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in Nicaragua, greater insight into how the Bank’s work
is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Nicaragua. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Nicaragua. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the
survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer
a question, please leave it blank.
