     QUALITY OF EDUCATION ON THE RISE
     IN AFGHANISTAN

The Second Education Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP II) is a follow-on program to the
Education Quality Improvement Program, which seeks to increase equitable access to quality basic
education, especially for girls. Program interventions are primarily targeted toward general
education, teacher training, and education management. EQUIP II is implemented by the Ministry
of Education and supported by a $408 million grant from ARTF.




 CHALLENGE


IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION is a critical ingredient for human capital development, poverty
alleviation, and economic growth in Afghanistan. While major achievements have been made since 2002, enrolling more than
7 million children in school, the challenges remain daunting. A massive skills deficit cuts across all institutions in Afghanistan,
from principals to teachers and from managers to skilled labor needed for the bulk of the reconstruction work and its
maintenance. Increasing conflict in the country undermines further education access, quality, and institutional capacity.

 APPROACH



THE SECOND EDUCATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (EQUIP II) is a follow-on program to
the Education Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP I), which is fully aligned with the Afghanistan National Education
Strategic Plan and supports the institutional development of program staff of the Ministry of Education (MoE).


EQUIP II seeks to: (i) increase access to schooling from grades 1-12 and Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs); (ii) strengthen
the management capacity of communities to better manage teaching-learning activities through School Management Shuras
(parent-teacher associations) and social mobilization; (iii) promote institutionalized district-based teacher and principal
training activities nationwide; and (iv) prioritize education for girls in TTCs through a household scholarship scheme and
the provision of high school teachers in underserved schools. The program also provides Gender Grants to TTCs to
establish a conducive learning environment, particularly for female students.

Enthusiasm for learning

To meet the demand for places, a 12-classroom building was built recently with an Infrastructure
Development Grant of $102,717 from EQUIP. In addition, EQUIP provided the school a Quality
Enhancement Grant (QEG) of some $15,000 for purchasing school supplies, equipment for the
library, laboratory, and computer laboratory, and a solar energy system to generate electricity.


Faraidon Hotak, the sole male teacher, who teaches physics
and is in charge of the school’s laboratory says: “Since we
painted the walls of the school and established the
laboratory, library, and computer lab, all with assistance
from EQUIP, students now learn their lessons with more
enthusiasm. The quality of teaching has also improved.”


Students like Sina, 12, an eighth-grader, have had their
enthusiasm for studying ignited thanks to the improved
methods of learning and teaching: “I used to have difficulties
in learning chemistry so I did not like it. But ever since we
have our chemistry lessons in the laboratory, I want to
become a chemist in the future.”
