Welcome & How to Use This ESMS
Toolkit and Case Studies
                             Environmental and social responsibility is becoming more and
                             more important in today’s global economy. There are thousands
                             of environmental and social codes and standards in the world
                             today. The codes and standards define the rules and the
                             objectives. But the challenge is in the implementation. An
                             environmental and social management system helps companies
                             to integrate the rules and objectives into core business
                             operations, through a set of clearly defined, repeatable
                             processes.

                             In the following pages, we provide tools to build or enhance your
                             environmental and social management system (ESMS). Section I is
                             the Toolkit — sample documents, blank forms, flowcharts,
                             checklists and templates. There are tools for each of the nine
                             elements in your ESMS. Section II is the Case Studies — examples
                             of how two different companies used the tools and developed
                             and implemented an ESMS appropriate to the size and nature of
                             their business.

                             As you go through the Toolkit and Case Studies, you may want to
                             refer back to the companion publication, the ESMS
                             Implementation Handbook, which gives more background on
                             each of the nine ESMS elements.

                             It is important to remember that simply creating a book of
                             policies and procedures is not the end — just the beginning. They
                             need to be implemented and turned into consistent processes.

                                       Quick Reference for Using the ESMS Toolkit and Case Studies

                                 Section I - Toolkit         This section provides tools, including forms,
                                                             templates, checklists and other useful
                                                             documents, to help you develop and implement
                                                             an ESMS.

                                 Section II - Case Studies   This section presents the stories of two
                                                             companies in the chicken and livestock
                                                             production industry that implemented an ESMS.
                                                             These cases illustrate how the two companies
                                                             used the tools presented in Section I – Toolkit.

 Policies
 Introduction

                              Policies are the foundation of your Environmental and Social
                              Management System (ESMS). They are the rules that you expect
                              your people to follow and the public statement you make about
                              what your company believes in and how you strive to conduct
                              your business.

                              The process of adopting environmental and social policies
                              provides a company with an opportunity to think about and
                              discuss what is important. Ultimately, it also enables you to gain
                              the commitment and support of senior management as they
                              approve and communicate the policies.

Sample CEO Letter announcing the ESMS - Internal
To all employees of our company:
Our vision for our company is to become one of the most respected and admired animal rearing companies
in our area. We aspire to conduct ourselves in an ethical and responsible manner. Corporate social
responsibility, which spans environmental, human rights, labor and social issues, is a growing concern to
investors, consumers and to all of us as people.
To integrate corporate social responsibility into our day-to-day business activities, we are developing and
implementing an environmental and social management system (ESMS). A management system involves
trained, committed employees routinely following procedures and continually improving.
I ask for your full cooperation in this important initiative. We believe that corporate social responsibility
must be a foundation of our long-term growth and profitability. Not only is it an integral part of our overall
business strategy, but it is also the right thing to do. It is the right thing for our customers, our suppliers, our
shareholders, our communities and for you, as a core part of this company.
As we strive to successfully implement our ESMS, we will train and involve you throughout the process.
[Person’s name and title] is in charge of this corporate social responsibility initiative. Each of you has a direct
line of communication with [person] for any suggestions or concerns. I thank you for your efforts and your
continued dedication to our success.

Identification of Risks and Impacts
Introduction

                             Identifying your risks can seem like a daunting task, but don’t be
                             overwhelmed. Scale your program as appropriate for the size and
                             complexity of your company. But remember, small companies
                             can have the same risks and potentially severe environmental and
                             social impacts as large companies.

                             Think of your risk identification and assessment as a value-added
                             activity, an opportunity to gather information that will help to
                             effectively improve your operations. Risk identification and
                             assessment is an ongoing process; situations change over time, so
                             it should be repeated at regular intervals.

                             When identifying your risks, be mindful of the different risks that
                             may be faced by women and men. Also, consider the risks to
                             people outside your company – your external stakeholders.

                             We present four tools related to this element:

                                     •    Risk Identification Worksheet

         2. Identification of Risks and Impacts

Process Mapping Tool
Instructions:
A process map or flowchart visually describes the flow of activities of a process, from beginning to end.
Below is a template for developing a process map for your operations.
Please refer to the process map developed for the sample case study ABC (ABC Chicken Company) in Section
II of this Toolkit to see how this can be developed and followed through.
While developing the process map, you need to identify all activities/processes/departments and the inputs
(feed materials, water, heat, medicines/antibiotic) and outputs (waste, air emissions) from each of these
activities.
Process maps are particularly useful in identifying environmental risks, occupational health and safety
hazards and areas for process improvement. They are also helpful to identify whether you can improve the
work flow, which can benefit the workers and improve the operational efficiency.
After you write down your process map, look at each activity and think of:
     •    the occupational health and safety hazards;
     •    the environmental, social and community risks; and
     •    the opportunities for waste reduction and resource conservation (water, energy
          and raw material/animal feed).
It is very important that people at all levels in your company participate in the identification of risks,
opportunities and possible solutions. Supervisors and workers are a valuable resource in helping you learn
about the way things actually work on the farm. If you can’t have all the necessary people in a room, you can
ask supervisors to consult with the workers in their area and provide information about the activities they
oversee.
After you have identified the risks and opportunities for each step, you can think of the possible solutions.
These can range from simple operational improvements to modifying or installing new equipment; from
revising your work procedures for risk control to improving the use of personal protective equipment by
your workers. This will form the basis of the action plans you will prepare (see Chapter 3. Management
Programs – Toolkit).

Physical Mapping Tool
Instruction
Prepare a map of the layout of your animal farm. The map should include all activities, processes and
operations, as well as buildings and equipment, including the utilities, waste handling and treatment
facilities. You can use this map again later when you develop your emergency preparedness plan. Once you
have the physical map, do a walk-through to observe existing or potential problems.
Whenever you encounter a problem, write it down and mark it on the map (see example for sample case
study of XYZ Livestock Company in Section II of this Toolkit). The walk-through should be conducted during
working hours with a team that includes supervisors and workers, since they often know what the problems
are and have ideas about necessary improvements.

                                               HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO LOOK FOR:

     OHS
     •    Where and how are people most likely to become injured (e.g. injury from animals, falls, cuts,
          burns, strains, exposure to hazardous substances and toxic gases)? Identify trip, slip and fall
          hazards - wet floors, obstructions, etc. Identify electrical hazards – wet floors, power washers,
          etc.
     •    Identify potential hazards related to confined spaces (e.g. silos, manure tanks, etc.) or work at
          height (e.g. water tanks), etc.
     •    Are all animal enclosures unobstructed and equipped with “man gate”?
     •    Are all alleyways clear and unobstructed and have no distraction for animals?
     •    Are exit doors unobstructed, unchained and well-marked? Are they equipped with panic bars to
          allow escape from within but deny access from outdoors?
     •    Are any passages blocked due to the facility layout or improperly stored materials?
     •    Is the farm laid out efficiently to reduce worker strain and workspace clutter?
     •    Are work spaces/animal sheds designed to maintain good working space and to avoid
          overcrowding of animals?
     •    What are the operations and activities where workers could be exposed to animal blood, urine
          or feces?
     •    Where could explosions, fires or the accidental release of hazardous materials occur? Is there
          adequate and appropriate response equipment close to those areas?
     •    Are chemicals labeled and stored with compatible materials, where combustion or cross-
          contamination cannot occur? What is the likelihood and consequence of an accidental spillage?
     •    Are there existing or potential leakages from rusted pipes, gaskets and drums?
     •    Where are workers exposed to odors, loud noises, excessive dust or extreme high and low
          temperatures? Do workers have appropriate personal protective equipment? Are they using it
          correctly?
     •    What are the areas/operations with significant dust (feed particles, animal or rodent fecal dust,
          pollen, bacteria, moulds, shed skin cells, etc.)?
     Resource Efficiency
     •    Where are there high levels of water consumption or discharge? Identify all water outlets,
          hoses, etc. and flag those without spring closures. Basins, sinks and tubs should only be filled to
          needed levels.
     •    Where is most of the waste produced and what is done with it?
     •    Are waste treatment facilities adequate and operating efficiently?
     •    Are fodder, hay rolls and other animal feed stored appropriately to prevent wastage, spillage
          and contamination?
     •    Are animal feed materials/medicines being used most efficiently? Where are materials being

          wasted?
     Pollution
     •    Are the drainage systems/manure collection systems adequate to prevent leakage, overflow and
          contamination of the surrounding environment?
     •    Are manure pits and surrounding areas ventilated, cleaned and maintained to protect from
          leakage and accidental overflow?
     •    What are the current practices that may lead to contamination of air, water or solid materials?
     •    What are the activities and operations that may affect local communities?
     •    What are the likely impacts that may result in conflict with local communities?
     •    In general, are there places or work processes where it is clear there are bad habits?



After the walk-through, meet with the team and discuss what has been observed. Also, talk about previous
incidents or accidents that have occurred in the plant and what have been the consequences.
The information you collect in the walk-through will form the basis of the action plans you will prepare (see
Chapter 3. Management Programs – Toolkit).

Risk Assessment Form
Instructions
It might not be feasible or practical to address every risk. Where it is necessary to prioritize your actions, try
to avoid or minimize the most potentially severe risks.
Complete this form based on the risks that you identified using the previous tools. Identify the probability of
a certain risk occurring and the severity if it did happen. For example, a major explosion may be unlikely to
occur (low probability), but the damage to your people and facility could be extremely high (high impact).
When prioritizing issues to be addressed, consider opportunities for cost reduction through reduced water
and energy consumption, reduced waste generation and similar considerations.

Action Plan Chart
Instructions
Use the Action Plan Chart to identify the actions you will take concerning the risks and how the actions will be managed. List each risk that you identified and
prioritized in the previous section. Write down the actions that you could take to avoid, minimize or compensate/offset the risk. Assign a responsible party and a
deadline. Identify the resources required and the operational procedures you will need to adopt.

Outline of Procedure
As you implement the Action Plan, it is helpful to define procedures that clearly systematize the actions into
routine, daily processes and practices. Procedures can be text, flowcharts, pictograms – whatever you find to
be the most effective communication tool for your company. Below is an outline of the important
components of a well-defined procedure.

Introduction

                             A well-implemented ESMS is ultimately about trained, committed
                             people. Senior management commitment is critical, but beyond
                             that you need people throughout the company who take
                             responsibility for the ESMS. This does not mean that the ESMS
                             becomes everyone’s full-time job. You should scale the system to
                             meet your company’s size and structure.

                             Remember that there needs to be a progression from awareness
                             to commitment to implementation. Think about this as you plan
                             the relevant training. For each training module, think about
                             whether the goal is to raise awareness, gain commitment or give
                             people the knowledge and skills they need to implement.

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Introduction

                             Even with good systems in place, emergencies can and do
                             happen. The key is to plan in advance — try to prevent as much
                             as you can, and train your employees so they know what to do in
                             case an emergency does happen. Don’t be overwhelmed by the
                             thought of planning for every single possible accident or
                             emergency. Look at your risk assessment and focus on the areas
                             where emergencies are more likely to happen or would cause
                             significant harm. Develop and implement a suitable “emergency
                             preparedness and management plan” for the identified
                             emergency situation.

                             As part of the plan, you need detailed procedures for the steps to
                             prepare and respond to an emergency. Some of the most
                             common emergencies in the animal production industry are fire
                             (in animal sheds/buildings, storage areas, barn); flooding;
                             hurricane; exposure to toxic manure gases including hydrogen
                             sulfide, ammonia, carbon dioxide and methane; and outbreak of
                             epizootic diseases.

          e.         Determine if the fire can be extinguished with the portable equipment in the building. If it
                     can be used, do so. If not, call the fire department, activate an alarm and evacuate the area.
          f.         The person discovering the fire should notify the telephone operator, giving exact location
                     and nature of fire.
          g.         The telephone operator will notify the following in turn:
                i.        engineering control room;
                ii.       Farm/operations manager;
                iii.      Vet/house doctor;
                iv.       Local emergency authority;
                v.        Safety manager/fire safety officer;
                vi.       Livestock holding facilities; and
                vii.      all other heads of departments; and
          h.         The telephone operator will remain on duty as an information and control center unless
                     instructions or condition dictate otherwise.
          i.         The maintenance department or the plumber shall reach the fire hydrant pump room (if
                     safe) for smooth pump operation.
          j.         The emergency controller (operations manager or the shift in-charge) will take
                     appropriate decisions regarding building evacuation, firefighting with the help of internal
                     trained team and/or notifying the city’s fire department.
     4.2. EVACUATION: A quick decision and effective evacuation operation is of outmost importance in
           order to prevent loss of lives. The procedure of evacuation should be handled with expertise
           and without loss of time.
          a.         Evacuation applies both for affected animals and the workers.
          b.         Remember, all animals are unpredictable. Frightened animals are unpredictable and will
                     react instinctively by running or fighting.
          c.         Contact your local emergency management authority and evacuate the animals through
                     pre-established evacuation routes.
          d.         Shelter your animals at safe shelters for farm animals, such as fairgrounds, other farms,
                     racetracks, and exhibition centers.
          e.         Use portable loading ramps and pre-established safe transportation methods for animals.
                     Ensure that you have access to trucks, trailers, and other vehicles suitable for transporting
                     each type of animal, along with experienced handlers and drivers to load or unload
                     animals.
          f.         Employees and visitors should gather near the designated muster point in a safe area that
                     is upwind from smoke or toxic gases and in an area that will not hamper emergency
                     vehicles or services when they arrive.

          g.         A head count must be done to ensure that everyone (employees and visitors) is accounted
                     for.
          h.         Employees are not to re-enter the evacuated building until so advised by the designated
                     officer (operations manager or safety manager).
          i.         If a rescue operation is required for a trapped employee/visitor, it must be performed by
                     trained and competent personnel equipped with suitable PPEs.
          j.         If animals are evacuated to a centralized location for shelter, such as a fairgrounds, and
                     will co-mingle with other animals of unknown health status try to:
                i.          Make sure your animals have sufficient identification (e.g. ear tags or brands) to be
                            able to tell them apart from others.
                ii.         Minimize the contact among animals from different premises.
                iii.        Protect feed and water from contact with wild animals and birds. Verify the health
                            and vaccination status of other animals.
          k.         Make sure that you have adequate and safe fencing or pens to separate and group animals
                     appropriately while evacuating and sheltering animals.
     4.3. MEDICAL AID FOR WORKERS: Get first aid treatment for all minor injuries; first aid is only
           temporary. First aid is the immediate treatment needed before you get a doctor to the victim
           or the victim to a doctor. What you do in the critical moments after an injury occurs could save
           a life. Know the basic first aid procedures. Review them often so you will be prepared if you
           suddenly find yourself in an emergency situation. When someone is injured, it is essential to
           survey the scene and determine if the situation is safe, or if the victim must be moved from a
           dangerous location to a safer place. Call for emergency medical help immediately for all life-
           threatening situations. Send people to guide the emergency team to the victim.
     4.4. FIRST AID FOR FIRE INJURIES AND BURNS

          a.         Move patient to fresh air.
          b.         Move the patient from the heat of fire.
          c.         Do not allow crowding around the patient.
          d.         Remove or cut away clothes from affected parts of the body.
          e.         Open buttons and loosen clothing.
          f.         Pour chilled water on the affected parts.
          g.         Apply any antiseptic cream.
          h.         Get a doctor.
     4.5. ASPHYXIA: If the patient has difficulty breathing or there are symptoms of collapse:
          a.         Give artificial respiration with respirator or mouth-to-mouth respiration.
          b.         Give oxygen.
          c.         Take the patient to the hospital or medical help.

Sample Epizootic Disease Outbreak Response Procedure (for poultry farm)
Title: Epizootic Disease Response Procedure
Procedure number: EM001
Number of pages: 5 pages


1.0 Purpose and Scope:
     1.1. The emergency response procedure will serve as a guideline in the event that a poultry farm
           experiences an emergency such as a reportable disease outbreak (e.g. avian influenza, exotic
           Newcastle disease, fowl typhoid and pullorum disease, etc.). This procedure sets out
           responsibilities and activities in order to respond to emergency resulting from outbreak of
           poultry diseases. It identifies the roles, responsibilities and authorities to effectively facilitate
           the site’s emergency preparedness and response.
     1.2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all activities and processes of at [Name of Company].
2.0 Definitions:
     2.1. EMERGENCY: Situation that poses immediate threat of:
          a.      Outbreak of epizootic diseases
          b.      injuries and damage to health;
          c.      fatalities;
          d.      damage to property; or
          e.      damage to environment.
     2.2. NOTIFIABLE DISEASES: Those diseases which are required by law to be reported to
           government authorities. The collation of information allows the authorities to monitor the
           disease, and provides early warning of possible outbreaks.
     2.3. REPORTABLE DISEASES: Diseases that require action to control or eradicate because they are
           a threat to animal or human health, food safety or the economy.
3.0 Responsibility and Authority: This procedure is the responsibility of the operations manager or
     designate. The operations manager shall report to the president in matters related to emergency
     preparedness, and shall have total authority during emergency situations. The operations manager
     shall have the authority to declare a state of emergency. In the absence of the operations manager,
     these authorities shall revert to the president.
4.0 Work Instructions:
     4.1. POULTRY DISEASES
     4.2. NOTIFIABLE DISEASES: The company shall periodically review and engage with the local
           administration to update its requirements related to notifiable diseases. In the event of a
           notifiable disease, immediate contact should be made with the provincial veterinarian.
     4.3. REPORTABLE DISEASES:
IFC ESMS Toolkit and Case Studies – Animal Production    Version 1.1 September 12, 2014                            46
         5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

          a.      Reportable diseases outlined in the local regulations are important to human or animal
                  health. The poultry farm shall maintain a list of all reportable diseases and provide
                  training to its personnel on identification, reporting and dealing with the outbreak of a
                  reportable disease.
          b.      The poultry farm is required to immediately report the presence of an animal that is
                  contaminated or suspected of being contaminated with one of these diseases. Control or
                  eradication measures will be applied immediately.
          c.      In the event of an outbreak of an epizootic disease, the goal of the poultry farm’s
                  emergency response is to prevent further spread of the disease and protect animal health.
          d.      Actions required if a poultry disease is suspected
     4.4. SUSPICION OF A DISEASE: If there are significant unexplained changes in mortality or
           production, and a poultry disease is suspected, the company shall administer a self-quarantine
           procedure, request the assistance of the company’s poultry veterinarian and/or submit
           appropriate samples to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. To ensure that samples yield the
           best possible results, they must be handled in a way that prevents contamination and
           preserves the viability of the causative organism.
     4.5. SELF-QUARANTINE PROCEDURE
          a.      Collect all flock documentation (production, health and mortality records).
          b.      Call veterinarian with a description of the problem, time of onset and duration (maintain
                  necessary records).
          c.      Submit birds or samples for diagnostic examination by having the veterinarian on-farm for
                  necropsy and sampling collection or by submitting birds/samples to a veterinarian or

          d.      Follow all veterinary advice regarding interim treatment of the flock.
          e.      Keep disease suspicion confidential until diagnostic confirmation is received, with the
                  exception of courtesy calls to processors, feed companies, etc., whom must keep
                  information confidential.
          f.      Contact appropriate local administration authorities.
          g.      Immediately restrict all traffic on farm and implement enhanced biosecurity measures
          h.      Cancel or postpone farm appointments, arrange end-of-day deliveries or pick-ups with
                  mandatory vehicle disinfection, lock gates, service affected barns last and if possible,
                  dedicate one employee to affected barn(s).
          i.      Dispose of dead/culled birds on farm (composting/incineration) and treat as infectious
                  material.
          j.      Review and update on-farm traffic records: visitor log book, previous bird movement.
          k.      If a reportable disease is confirmed, appropriate regulatory authority will be contacted.

          n.         Direct all media inquiries to the designated official at the farm.
     4.6. PROCEDURE FOR DIAGNOSTIC SUBMISSION:
          a.         Step 1: Sample Collection
                i.        Provide all information, visitor logbooks and health records and flock history.
                ii.       Include a complete description of the problem (mortality, production drop, reduced
                          water consumption, etc.), including date/time of onset, duration, extent
                          (percentages) and whether things are getting worse or better over a defined period
                          of time.
                iii.      Offer your suspicions as to what you think the problem might be.
                iv.       Submit a sample from your flock of birds.
                v.        Record submission date & reference number.
                vi.       Blood and tissues samples should be clearly labelled and placed in a closed plastic
                          baggie.
                vii.      Swabs should be appropriate for the testing requested. Example: bacterial culture
                          swabs for Staphylococcus, pooled dry swabs for lab analysis. Please call the testing
                          laboratory if unsure.
                viii.     Dead birds should be dead for less than 24 hours and kept chilled if you are going to

          e.      Eliminate or delay all activities that if undertaken, could act as a vector to spread disease.
                  Avoid direct contact with off-farm poultry or poultry personnel.
          f.      No other farms shall be visited. Do not visit locations of common attendance (coffee
                  shops).
          g.      Make courtesy calls to suppliers, utility companies, and service providers listed on the
                  emergency contact list so they can implement their own biosecurity procedures.
          h.      Delay or reduce all service and other farm visits and take extreme caution when allowing
                  necessary visits.
          i.      Drivers must not enter barn(s) and must reduce foot travel to absolute necessity.

                  and sprayed with a disinfectant. A disinfectant spray must be applied inside the truck cab
                  to areas such as the floor, steering wheel and door handles prior to returning to base or
                  going directly to another poultry farm.
          m.      Family members attending activities away from the farm (work, school) should limit
                  access to the barn and follow strict biosecurity protocols to eliminate risks. They should
                  avoid contact with any other feathered species including pet birds.
          n.      Limit flock management to specific individuals. Designated clothing including footwear
                  should be utilized for each barn. Take special care that no equipment enters or leaves the
                  barn area unless thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Hand disinfecting or vigorous
                  washing with warm water and soap is also recommended prior to leaving the barn.
          o.      Make certain other animals such as dogs and cats do not enter the barn or have contact
                  with dead birds. Consider confining these animals at this time.
          p.      Confinement of mortalities to the farm is recommended until the situation is clear. Dead
                  bird disposal should strictly follow guidelines as outlined by the local regulations. The use
                  of freezers or alternate containment is preferred.
          q.      Ensure you have a supply of consumable items such as extra coveralls, boots, barrier tape,
                  disinfectant, or other similar supplies.
5.0 Emergency Response Team: The purpose of the Emergency Response Team is to deal with FAD
     outbreaks in the company. The team’s responsibilities are to immediately meet when an emergency
     situation is reported and to determine the course of action.

Stakeholder Engagement
Introduction

                             Your company interacts with many different groups of
                             stakeholders. A stakeholder is any person or organization that
                             has an interest in or is affected (or perceives to be affected) by
                             your company. Engaging with stakeholders will help you
                             understand how to avoid or minimize any negative impact and
                             reduce the risks to your business from anti-company sentiments
                             and negative campaigns that could affect your company’s
                             reputation.

                             We present three tools related to this element:

Stakeholder Mapping Tool – Identification and analysis
Instructions
1. Ensure you have a cross-functional/departmental team to start the exercise.

2. List relevant stakeholders for your company (e.g., those directly and indirectly affected by your
   company, those that have an interest in your company operations, those that have an ongoing
   relationship with the company, and those that have the ability to influence your company
   operations). Provide as much detail as possible (i.e. name your main suppliers independently;
   disaggregate communities by identifying local leaders or other relevant actors).

3. Next to each stakeholder group, discuss and list their key concerns, issues, interests.

                       STAKEHOLDER                                          ISSUES/CONCERNS/INTERESTS




4. Place these stakeholders on the stakeholder map according to the degree to which they are impacted
   by your operations and their capacity to influence your company operations.

5. Classify stakeholders according to their current relationship with the company: supportive,
   supportive with conditions, neutral, negative. The purpose of stakeholder engagement is to
   keep supportive stakeholders happy and help address the concerns of less-supportive stakeholders.

     Remember that stakeholders’ relationships with the company may change over time. We
     recommend that you analyze their current position to the company.

6. Identify the groups that represent a high priority for engagement.

7. Define strategies to engage with the prioritized stakeholders. When defining engagement
   strategies, keep in mind current initiatives of the company. Engagement strategies should be
   differentiated, based on where stakeholders are located on the map:
     •    Quadrant 1: Involve them as needed
     •    Quadrant 2: Proactively approach and support them
     •    Quadrant 3: Keep them informed
     •    Quadrant 4: Respond to their concerns
8. Review the stakeholder map at regular intervals and when there are major changes. It is advisable
   to review the stakeholder map with external groups to get their feedback.

Impact Zoning Tool for Identifying Affected Communities
Instructions
The term “affected communities” includes any individuals or communities that are located in proximity to
the company’s facilities and are directly exposed to actual or potential adverse impacts on their
environment, health and livelihood due to company activities.
A quick and practical technique for identifying affected communities is the “impact zoning map” (see box
below). By mapping the sphere of influence of different types of environmental and social impacts, the
company can begin to identify distinct groups by impact area, and can then prioritize the stakeholders for
consultation.
While priority should be given to individuals and groups who are directly and adversely affected, drawing a
line between who is affected and who is not can be challenging. Communities lying just outside of the
designated impact area can perceive impacts or feel they have been arbitrarily excluded from the
engagement process.


                                HOW TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH IMPACT ZONING
              1.    Draw a sketch map (see figure below as an example and case study ABC in Section II for an
                    illustration of how to complete it) of the key operations at the animal farm, both on- and off-
                    site, that may give rise to local environmental and social impacts (e.g. the project site; ancillary
                    infrastructure such as roads, water supply; sources of air, water and land pollution). This may
                    be performed more efficiently by using aerial photographs or satellite images.
              2.    Identify the broad impact zones for each of these components (e.g. the area of land, air and
                    water pollution receptors, etc.).
              3.    After identifying and mapping broad stakeholder groups, overlay those groups with the impact
                    zones.
              4.    Through consultation with relevant stakeholder representatives, verify which groups are
                    potentially affected by which impacts.

Stakeholder Engagement Plan Worksheet
Instructions
After the identification of your most important stakeholders, the next step is to develop a plan for how to
engage with the groups that you listed. Engagement should be stronger and more frequent with those
groups that are most affected and those that have a greater ability to influence your business.
At a minimum, you should always implement an external communication procedure to receive
communications from the public and accordingly adjust your management program. In the presence of
adversely affected stakeholders, you should implement a grievance mechanism and actively engage them in
consultation, regularly disclosing clear and meaningful information and providing communities with
opportunities to express their concerns and suggestions. Finally, you should report back to them on the
actions your company has put in place to address the issues identified during the process of consultation.
The table below provides example of some stakeholders that may be associated with your operations. Once
you have done the stakeholder mapping and identified their concerns, you may start looking at the other
necessary information, such as the engagement method, information to be disclosed or reported back to
your stakeholders, and the key information you would like to obtain.

Introduction
                             Grievance Mechanism

                             The purpose of a grievance mechanism is to establish a way for an
                             individual or group within an affected community to contact you
                             if they have an inquiry, concern or formal complaint. It provides
                             people with an alternative way of communicating with your
                             company as part of your formal stakeholder engagement process.
                             External Communication

                             Even if affected communities per se are not identified, you should
                             always establish and maintain a publicly available and easily
                             accessible channel for the members of the public to contact you
                             (e.g., phone number, website, email address, etc.). External
                             stakeholders can provide valuable information such as:
                             suggestions on product improvement; feedback on customers’
                             interaction with your employees; and comments from regulators,
                             NGOs and individuals regarding your company’s environmental
                             and social performance.

Reporting Back to Affected Communities
Introduction

                             Affected stakeholders will want to know what actions your
                             company has put in place to resolve the issues identified when
                             communicating with them. Keeping them informed of what you
                             are doing is the final critical piece in building and maintaining a
                             good relationship.

                             We present one tool related to this element:

Monitoring and Management Review
Introduction

                             Monitoring and review are critical components of the ESMS
                             because they enable you to check and adjust your system. You
                             need to monitor whether your action plans are being
                             implemented and if procedures are followed, as well as whether
                             your ESMS is addressing the relevant risks and ensuring lasting
                             improvements. The goal of the ESMS is to shift from corrective
                             actions to preventive actions. Monitoring and management
                             review provide you with the necessary information to make that
                             shift.

                             We present two tools for this element:

                                     •    Monitoring Plan

Auditing Guidance
Instructions
Go through all the areas highlighted in the Auditing Guidance – this will help you to get a broad view of all
potential risk areas and elements of the ESMS beyond those that you may have targeted in your initial risk
assessment.

                                                             A. PREPARATION

       Collect audit reports from the animal farm on environmental performance, labor standards performance and
       community stakeholder engagement for the previous two years.

       Collect corrective action plans generated from previous audits and review the status of each action item that was
       agreed upon. Are all closed out? Focus review on open items and the underlying reason(s) for incomplete status, and
       ensure that the audit considers the underlying issues during the upcoming audit. Focus on the underlying limiting
       factors that prevent completion.

       Ascertain the general level of PPE used in the farm; ensure that auditors wear the same PPE as employees are required
       to wear: head, hearing, eye, skin protection, protective boots, clothing, etc.; do not allow any auditor to enter work
       areas without the clothing/gear required for the operations activity and that employees are required to wear.

       Obtain facility layout plans, designating work areas, break areas, activities underway, clean areas, dirty areas, location
       of fire hydrants/extinguishers, fire exits, emergency lighting and protective covers, restrooms, cleaning and cross-
       contamination prevention areas (boot, hand wash and disinfection), principal water outlets and drains and any non-
       potable water outlet (e.g. fire water) clearly marked as non-potable and for emergencies only. Ensure auditing team
       has a working knowledge of the animal farm/operation to be evaluated.

       Research and refer to current local environmental and labor laws and regulations.

       Basic labor code issues: (i) regular weekly work hours, (ii) labor contract provisions, (iii) rest periods, lunch, etc., (iv)
       overtime requirements, limits and exceptions, (v) hour averaging and banking hours, (vi) minimum wage, (vii) social
       system payment liability, (viii) annual leave, (ix) laws to protect disadvantaged workers, (x) severance pay.

       Basic environmental code issues: (i) wastewater, (ii) storm water, (iii) spill prevention and response, (iv)
       construction/demolition/remodeling, (v) hazardous materials, (vi) hazardous waste, (vii) toxic chemical release, (viii) air
       emissions, (ix) solid waste.

       Review regulatory permit(s) conditions and specific requirements along with most recent review and corrective action
       reports.

       Review certification(s) audit reports for nonconformance, mandatory remedial actions, recommendations, etc.
       Summarize status of items (open or closed).

       Review any government inspection reports, third-party audit reports, etc.


       Review the stakeholder engagement plan and records of grievances submitted by external stakeholders. Pay attention
       to: emergency preparedness and response capability to include the community if necessary; use of manure and drift to
       communities; accidental releases of hazardous materials, e.g. discharges of wastewater, manure or other wastes from
       lagoons to areas affecting local communities; exacerbation of flooding; limits of water availability use and physical
       access; reduction in quality of life due to the operations.

       Pay special attention in observation/document review/interviews to issues identified in previous reports.


       Research and understand the national and local context of labor union rights and activity, local environmental groups
       and community activist organizations.

       Schedule sufficient time to conduct the scope of the audit. Announce the availability of confidential meeting schedules
       with employees; schedule, arrange and conduct while protecting employee confidentiality.

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

                                           B. INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT

       Meet with the senior management and department managers before conducting audit activities to review ESMS issues
       and the purpose of the audit.

       Share an agenda for the meeting and itinerary with senior management and department managers.

       With department managers, review the prior audit reports and performance to date in meeting corrective actions.

       Discuss non-retaliation against cooperating workers; inform management that future audits will include reviews of the
       continued employment of workers interviewed.




                                                       C. OPERATIONAL WALK-THROUGH
       Conduct operational walk-through of the farm. Refer to previous relevant physical walk-through assessments of the
       facility; determine if all previous nonconformance/action items are closed out; if not, why not?

       Minimize the number of managers that accompany you on the walk-through. One or two escorts based on
       knowledge/responsibilities are usually sufficient.

       During the walk-through, be aware of your body language and the message this sends to workers; ensure that you are
       equipped with/wearing the same PPE required of employees.

       Take note of all things observed that require attention:
           1. Conditions of animal building/sheds (cleaning, ventilation, overcrowding, etc.);
           2. Data on animal diseases and mortality rate;
           3. Water used indiscriminately for washing/cleaning, water wasting (open taps/water hoses on floor);
           4. Energy wastage;
           5. Evidence of spillages;
           6. Floor status: slippery, wet, etc.;
           7. Dry cleanup and collection of manure and other solid wastes;
           8. Harborage or other unorganized storage of materials;
           9. Wastes and discards;
           10. Workplace availability of data on hazards/chemicals in use (msds/icsc);
           11. Movement of materials: hand trucks, forklifts, etc. Are the passageways and transit routes clearly marked; is
                color-coding used for non-pedestrian movement?;
           12. Processes related to loading and unloading of animals (status of ramps, trained workers)
           13. Obvious hazards for heads, hearing, sight, life and limb: Workplace hazards attenuated; employee
                awareness?;
           14. Availability/status of man gates in the animal buildings;
           15. Animal related injuries (crushed/hit by animals, needlestick injuries, etc.)
           16. PPE used as prescribed, available, replaced at no cost; employee awareness;
           17. Are employees able to explain jobs and responsibilities?; and
           18. Evidence of QA team activity.

       Verify that fire exits exist and open on demand; no means to prevent exit; panic bars in good working order; clear
       egress once exit opened; emergency exits clearly marked; nearest exits clearly marked; hose cabinets equipped with
       hoses, nozzles, etc.; prohibited areas clearly marked; electrical cabinets closed and sealed; lockout tag out procedures
       and tools (tags, locks, warning labels and signs) clearly available near electrical cabinets; first aid cabinets and
       equipment; emergency lighting; emergency preparedness and evacuation plans in place; employees trained; animal
       shelters are identified and maintained; employees are trained in animal evacuation; sufficient feed and medical
       supplies are available for emergency; systems are in place to minimize the possible spread of contagious diseases;
       manure pits and lagoons are secured to prevent overflow and environment contamination.

       Ambient conditions should be verified for adequacy if there is potential for risks such as air quality, noise, etc. Use
       measuring devices to determine air quality, noise level, temperature and adequate lighting. This is a good/easy thing
       to do. For operations or areas with potentially toxic gaseous emissions, there should be LEL (lower explosive limit)
       meters and alarms installed.

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

       Verify work permit systems, and lockout/tag out procedures are implemented.


       Following the facility walk-through, conduct a walk-through of the dormitory facilities, canteens, washrooms, change
       rooms.

       Suggest best practice to supervisors and department managers during the walk-through; ensure that the suggestion is
       filtered by processes/operations practicalities.

       Give sufficient attention to all ESMS elements during the operation/dormitory walk-through. Knowledge of
       procedures, training using the procedures, awareness of complaints management and resolution procedure,
       employment rights, HR policy and provisions, etc.

       Identify all incidences of non-conformance with ESMS issues, both major and minor.


       Pay special attention to areas identified in previous corrective action requests. Focus on open non-conformances from
       previous audits: why? Elucidate the underlying cause and make an effort to diagnose and prescribe preventive,
       ameliorative measures. . The individual who is responsible for the issue is not as important as why it occurred and
       how the company can prevent non-conformances and unplanned events in the future.




                                                       D. INTERVIEWING WORKERS
       Select at least 5 percent of workers. Cap at 100 workers. Conduct individual and group interviews for balanced
       response.

       Select workers who are representative of the workforce population (gender, race, age, religion, functional
       departments, etc.).

       If the farm has contracted or migrant workers, make sure to select from all groups.

       Do not allow supervisors or managers to influence selection of workers for interviews or the interviews.

       Conduct on-site interviews in areas that protect worker confidentiality and where the worker would feel comfortable.
       Make sure supervisors or managers are not in or near the space where the interviews are conducted. Keep them away
       from the selection and interview process.

       Conduct interviews early in the audit to allow for follow-up.

       Make sure to tell the workers that everything they say is confidential and that management has been warned against
       retaliation.

       Be sensitive to cultural and gender issues.


       Plan for an average of fifteen minutes per interview; however, use common sense in terminating interviews that are
       becoming nonproductive and extending interviews with people who are candid or openly addressing critical issues.

       Formulate questions prior to the interviews to make sure you cover all specific areas of the ESMS review through the
       aggregated interviews. Always ask employees how processes may be improved, water use reduced, energy saved,
       waste reduced, etc.

       If you plan to take notes, ask the workers if it is OK and clearly explain reason for taking notes. Try to minimize note
       taking as much as possible during the interview. Finish writing your notes immediately after the interview, so you have
       accurate documentation.

       Have your worker representatives recommend a preferred approach to building rapport with workers.


       Ask workers specifically about follow up on previous corrective action plans. What non-conformances remain open;
       what issues presented through the complaints management and resolution mechanism remain open?

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

       Make sure your questions address the following:
       LABOR ISSUES
              Do workers know about and understand your policies related to labor and working conditions?
              Do workers understand their rights under the law related to freedom of association and collective
                 bargaining?
              Do workers understand how their wages are calculated, for base time, performance and overtime?
              Are workers aware of any dismissal, transfer, demotion or other punitive action against workers due to their
                 exercising their rights under either their contracts or local or national law?
              Ask workers about the status of trade unions, worker committees or other worker groups in the farm and
                 whether there is management interference.
              Ask questions to determine conformance to discrimination and sexual harassment policies.
              Do workers understand the company’s grievance me chanism, and do they feel it is operational and free from
                 retaliation?
       OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES
              Do workers feel safe and protected in their jobs? For example, are they provided with PPE that is appropriate
                 and works? Is their physical environment free of hazards and obstructions? Are they expected to reduce
                 physical hazards or are engineering controls in place? Are job hazards assessments conducted routinely and
                 when the processes or materials change? Have issues submitted through the complaints management and
                 resolution mechanism been addressed?
              Do they feel there is adequate safety equipment, such as extinguishers/hydrants and first aid kits? Are there
                 sufficient safety drills if an emergency, such as a typhoon, flood or wind storm, were to occur and necessitate
                 an evacuation from buildings? Witness the emergency mock drills and make note of shortcomings; ask an
                 employee to pretend he/she has just been injured and explain what to do next.
              Are they instructed and trained on these risks at regular intervals?
              Have any workers been involved in accidents at the facility and, if so, what happened afterwards?

                              E. INTERVIEWING AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS
       The stakeholder mapping exercises and stakeholder consultation meetings should help identify the relevant population
       that is affected by the facility and its activities.

       Select a sample of individuals that represents the views of this affected community such as local villagers and small
       landowners. This group may include members of the public as well as NGOs, campaign groups, trade unions, local
       businesses and government authorities. If possible, target NGOs that are industry-specific. Seek out former employees
       if possible, but filter out disgruntled former employees or those with a personal agenda against the company.

       Gauge awareness of the grievance mechanism. Has it been tested? Does it work? Does the company utilize it in
       practice or is it ignored? Is it taken seriously?

       Be sure to include representatives from indigenous or marginalized groups in these interviews.


       Make sure your questions address the following:
           How have the farm's operations affected the physical environment (air, water, land) near them?
           Has this resulted in either air, land or water contamination?
           Has wildlife been affected by the farm's activities?
           Has the farm's business impacted local livelihoods, access, traditional
               hunting/fishing/breeding/religious/other grounds due to natural habitat conversion?
           Have any health risks or deterioration to well-being been associated with the farm/plantation from exposure
               to pesticides, air emissions or noise pollution? Note any neighbors or employees with sick kids or significant
               abortion rates.
           Have any contagious illnesses been on the rise due to an influx of workers to the farm/plantation such as
               malaria or other local vector-borne diseases? Is the community aware of an increase in the rat/mouse or
               other vermin population?
           Have these affected groups had any clashes with security hired at the farm?
           Have any of these groups consumed goods or products from the farm that have had a deleterious effect on
               their health? Any level of awareness of company's refusal to replace questionable goods?
           Have any of these groups been approached or invited by the company running the farm/plantation to discuss
               their concerns at meetings? Have any of their grievances been addressed or investigated? Has the company
               followed up on questions?

       evidence of changes to all of this when company processes, methods, chemicals, materials, etc. are changed,
       reordered, etc.

       Select files and/or records at random to generate a representative sample of the workforce population and functional
       distribution in the factory. Seek some files to corroborate interviews conducted earlier.

       If the farm employs contract workers, address potential areas of abuse in the document review. Specifically review the
       contract with the workers.

       Identify all significant incidences of non-conformance in preparation for your management meeting.


       ENVIRONMENTAL AND OSH ISSUES:

       Make sure you review the relevant documents for the following areas:
       1. Emergency response and preparedness: Examine the facility's emergency response procedures and accident
       reports, as well as documents indicating that workers have been trained on these issues.
       Ask the employee to show you how to get out, assuming that there is now a fire; follow the employee; ask another to
       tell/show you what happens if he/she was just injured.
       2. Environmental management: Examine any company environmental policies and environmental management
       system policies and reports, including sustainability reports, energy consumption records, guidelines and monitoring,
       resource use and waste generation. Status of previously noted non-conformances.
       3. Insurance: Identify documents that indicate legal permits have been obtained, insurance policies are in place and
       the relevant legal authorities notified of the facility's activities.

       6. Hazardous material: The storage of chemicals and toxicology sheets (MSDS/ICSCs from ILO/WHO/EU/UNEP, etc.
       Avoid total reliance upon manufacturer's statements). Does procurement mandate furnishing such materials?
       7. Health and safety: Check for the existence of logs of accident and fatality rates, health and safety guidelines or
       handbooks for workers and monitoring of these statistics, including the job hazard analyses and engineering
       corrections to eliminate hazards at the source, as opposed to requiring employees to mitigate environmental hazards;
       provision of appropriate PPE that cover actual, defined technical, physical, biological and chemical hazards in the
       workplace; Tool Box safety meetings records.
       8. Work environment: Look for guidelines, reports, logs and "ecomaps" of the facility work environment that monitor
       emissions of dust, odors, sources of noise and vibrations and worker exposure to heat and cold. LEL meters and
       audible and visual alarms are mandatory wherever there may be accumulations of dust or ambient dust.
       9. Sanitary: Review policies, procedures, guidelines and reports (including from relevant government departments), as
       well as training manuals and logs on staff hygiene and food safety management. Ask to use the toilet; be shown where
       and how to access for both men/women; asses the reentry procedures.

ABC Case Study

ABC Chicken Company, Brazil
ABC Chicken Company (ABC) is a medium-sized poultry production farm in southeast Brazil. The company is
family-owned; in addition to family members, it employs 30-40 workers depending upon the season and
output. The current production rate at ABC is over 600,000 chickens per year. Currently, the company is
selling nationally, supplying retail and restaurants, but is aiming to increase its production by 20% by the end
of next year.
There have been instances when large numbers of birds died due to heat, suffocation, and over-crowding.
The birds are packed into the chicken houses so that they barely have space to stand normally, turn around
or stretch their wings. ABC has no recording system that demonstrates compliance with industry regulatory
maximums regarding stocking density. Ventilation is also an issue since extra bird volume can increase the
chicken shed temperature by more than 3% above outside temperatures, especially in the summer. ABC has
been advised in the past to either lower its stocking density or increase ventilation and humidity as needed
to comply with national norms. It has not yet implemented these measures.
The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources recently sent a legal notice to the
company in connection with contamination of a nearby major river. The company’s operators are accused
of generating liquid discharges from various sources including poultry housing and waste storage areas. Also,
various environmental NGOs allege that arsenic contamination in the local water supply is caused by
pollution from the company’s indiscriminate use of Roxarsone® in animal feed. Although this compound is
no longer used in Western countries, it appears that this company is using up existing stocks.
ABC’s management of animal waste from its poultry production operations has developed into a significant
problem since the company has tried to increase its production levels. Poultry litter consists of a mixture of
fecal droppings, antibiotic residues, heavy metals, cysts, larvae, decaying carcasses, and sawdust/rice hulls.
Chicken manure contains 4 times the amount of nitrogen and 24 times the amount of phosphorous typically
encountered in wastes from hog or dairy operations. ABC routinely sells untreated chicken manure and
bedding waste to local farmers who spread it on their land. ABC’s manure and bedding waste is stored in
outside areas such as piles or walled silos without roofs until it is ready for transport to a disposal site or land
application for agricultural use. Leachate from stored chicken house bedding waste and runoff from
agricultural fields where these solid wastes are applied have been flagged as having the potential to
contaminate surface and groundwater with nutrients, ammonia, sediment, pesticides, and pathogens.
To date, ABC has carried out no environmental assessment of the impact of its waste management program.
The company maintains it adherence to substandard practices despite the availability of best practices
information from industry associations and agricultural extension agents. Best practices include improved
manure storage facilities with concrete floors, roof gutters on buildings to collect and divert clean storm
water, covering manure storage areas with an impermeable material such as plastic sheeting, weighting the
covers to prevent wind transport, and locating manure piles away from water bodies, floodplains, wellheads
or sensitive habitats.
Workers have raised concerns about the respiratory hazards posed by working at the farms. Several
external workers that undertake a variety of tasks, such as the placement of litter, populating poultry
houses, handling, inspecting and vaccinating birds, cleaning houses after the growing period, catching and
culling birds, and removing litter and/or manure, have fallen sick. There are complaints of headaches,
nausea, nasal irritation and chest tightness due to the high concentrations of respiratory toxicants in the
sheds. Airborne contaminants from the farm include a mixture of organic and inorganic materials from
bedding material, mites, skin debris, broken feather barbules, insect parts, aerosolized feed, and poultry
excreta, as well as a number of recognized asthmagens such as softwood and grain dust. In some European
countries and in North America, there is strong evidence for treating so called poultry dust as a substance

hazardous to health. Currently, ABC does not undertake any health surveillance to investigate early
symptoms of ill health. The workers’ union is demanding health protection programs and improved working
conditions, including maintaining proper temperature, relative humidity and ventilation in the sheds through
air extraction devices for sheds and at dust generating equipment; and adequate respiratory protection such
as half-face masks equipped with filters designed to capture dust and micro-organisms. A few years ago, the
company experienced an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza affecting its production.
Management is concerned that unresolved biosecurity issues and poor environmental conditions at its
farms pose an immediate risk and the potential for a new outbreak. The company plans to enhance
biosecurity measures to minimize the risk at its farms.
Finally, senior management has called for an urgent meeting after highly critical articles in several
newspapers appeared last week and revealed that one of their customers is recalling ABC’s meat products
due to various food safety complaints including detection of trace amounts of arsenic.
To address these environmental and social issues, as well as the growing concerns and expectations of the
local communities, regulators and consumers, ABC aims to establish a fully functional environmental and
social management system (ESMS) based on international standards by the end of current fiscal year..

ABC FOOD COMPANY Action Plan
     •    Based on its Risk Assessment Form, ABC prioritized the following five key risks:
     •    excess water usage, leading to inaccessibility of potable water by homeowners and communities and brine contamination of coastal area wells;
     •    high volume of wastewater, with biochemical and chemical oxygen demand from organic waste, entering and contaminating surface waters;
     •    high volume of solid organic waste with pathogenic content, affecting ground and surface waters and food safety;
     •    inadequate contracts and protection for migrant workers due to the use of recruitment agency; and
     •    discrimination, disciplinary abuse and harassment due to growing number of disputes between workers, especially migrant workers, and supervisors.
ABC then developed Action Plans to manage these five risks (see below)

ABC FOOD COMPANY Complaint Management and Resolution Procedure
Based on the Risk Identification Worksheet and Risk Assessment Prioritization Form, ABC identified poor
worker health as an issue due to exposure to hazardous/toxic air borne contaminants resulting in respiratory
diseases (see Risk 4). In order to receive and handle worker complaints more effectively on this risk, ABC
created and adopted a Complaint Management Resolution Procedure as part of its Action Plan.


Title: Complaint Management and Resolution (Internal Grievance Procedure)
Procedure number: HR001
Number of pages: 3
1.0 Purpose and Scope:
    1.1. Purpose: Establish a transparent process for workers to express concerns and file complaints,
         including anonymous complaints. Ensure there is no retaliation or discrimination against
         those that express concerns or file complaints. Ensure good worker-manager communications
         to enable workers to raise concerns before they become serious grievances.

          The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that employee complaints are appropriately
          addressed and managed efficiently and effectively in reaching a resolution for all parties
          involved. This procedure provides information to managers and employees regarding the
          processes to be followed when managing employee complaints, focusing on the management
          and resolution of workplace issues at the local level.
     1.2. Scope: Any complaint or dispute that may arise from a worker or worker organization.

           All individual complaints shall be initiated at Step 1 (see below 4.0 Work Instructions) and
           shall, if necessary, proceed step by step to Step 5, when the resolution proposed shall be final
           and binding. Collective complaints and disputes will be handled in the same step-by-step
           approach as that for individual complaints, but shall begin at Step 2 (see below 4.0 Work
           Instructions).

           Issues will inevitably arise from time to time; since disputes are potentially harmful to the
           company, its workers, supervisors and managers at every level, all parties will be expected to
           resolve all but the most complex difficulties without recourse to Step 5 of this procedure.

           The worker organization filing the complaint or representing the worker filing the complaint
           shall have the right to be notified and be present at all steps of the procedure.

         Every effort should be made to settle the issue at each step and until this procedure has been
         completed there shall be no threats of “go-slows,” partial or general stoppages of work or other
         illegal action or lock-out
2.0 Definitions:
    2.1 Grievance: Specific violation or feeling of having been wronged – the reason for filing a
        complaint.
    2.2 Complaint: The formal communication of a grievance to the appropriate parties.
3.0 Responsibilities:
    HR Department
4.0 Work Instructions:
    Step 1:

      4.1. The worker presents the complaint or grievance verbally to the most immediate supervisor,
           who has the authority to make adjustments in the matter, within 14 days. Explanations of
           responses to complaints, even if only to alert workers to a delay in the process, are key to
           ensuring workers understand their complaints are respected and taken seriously.
      4.2. The supervisor records the complaint or grievance and the action taken in the complaints log.
      Step 2:
      4.3. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 1 within three days, or if the worker fears
           making the complaint directly to the most immediate supervisor, then a worker representative
           may present the complaint verbally to the supervisor concerned. The worker may choose to
           remain anonymous.
      Step 3:
      4.4. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 2 within three days following its completion,
           the worker or his or her chosen representative for the case may present the complaint to the
           department head. The complaint shall be in writing and shall state the complainant(s) or
           grievant(s) name(s).
      Step 4:
      4.5. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 3 within five days of the date of submission of
           the written complaint or grievance to the department head, the worker or his or her chosen
           representative for the case may present the complaint or grievance to the head of the Human
           Resources Department.
      4.6. The head of the Human Resources Department or his/her designee shall schedule a meeting to
           be held within fourteen days of the receipt of the complaint or grievance with the worker or his
           or her chosen representative, for the purpose of attempting to resolve the complaint or
           grievance.
      4.7. The worker can bring one or two peers for support during this meeting; those workers will also
           be covered under the non-reprisal clause.
      4.8. The head of the Human Resources Department or his/her designee shall respond in writing
           within seven days of the date of the meeting.
      Step 5:
      4.9. If the complaint or grievance is not resolved at Step 4, and it is clear that resolution within the
           company is impossible, the worker or his or her chosen representative may refer the complaint
           or grievance to the Labor Ministry for resolution.
      Monitoring:
      4.10. The Human Resources Department will conduct a quarterly review of all complaints and
             actions taken. It will review the complaint logs of each supervisor and department head to
             evaluate the effectiveness of the grievance procedure and resolutions.
      4.11. As part of the quarterly review, the Human Resources Department will follow up directly with
             the worker or his or her chosen representative to make sure there has been no retaliation.
      4.12. The Human Resources Department will maintain a central record of all complaints and
             resolutions.

ABC 5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

Based on ABC’s risk assessment, which identified outbreaks of epizootic diseases as a severe impact risk, ABC
developed an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan to identify, prevent and respond to the epizootic
diseases. The plan includes an Epizootic Diseases Response Procedure. The roles and responsibilities of the
different departments and personnel at ABC in the event of an epizootic related poultry emergency are
outlined in the procedure in Section I of this Toolkit.

ABC 6. Stakeholder Engagement

ABC CHICKEN COMPANY Stakeholder Mapping – identification and analysis
An ABC cross-departmental team brainstormed and listed the stakeholders that are affected by or have an
interest in the company’s operations. The team then discussed and listed their key concerns, issues and
interests. To identify those, they looked back at the environmental and social key risks and impacts
previously identified (see Chapter 2. Identification of Risks and Impacts – ABC Case Study) and how these
affect the surrounding communities.
                                      STAKEHOLDER                                             ISSUES/CONCERNS/INTERESTS

Then, ABC mapped the stakeholders on a matrix according to the degree to which they are impacted and
their ability to influence the company operations. Finally, ABC categorized them based on their current
relationship with the company: supportive, supportive with conditions, neutral, opposed. Based on this,
they defined their engagement method with each group.

                                         at churches, schools and civic centers. The system is also documented in the
                                         company procedures manual. A designated community liaison explains this further
                                         when meeting with stakeholders.

ABC 8. Reporting Back to Affected Communities

ABC regularly reports the local village population (affected communities) on the progress of its commitments
to resolve tissues identified when communicating with them through its stakeholder engagement process
and through its grievance mechanism. Reports are presented in the local language and a clear format during
quarterly meetings with the local village.

XYZ Case Study

XYZ Livestock Development Company, Ethiopia
XYZ Livestock Development Company (XYZ) is a privately held cattle farming company in Ethiopia, which has
operated for the last thirty years in the Oromia Region. XYZ is mid-sized company with a cattle population of
approximately 1,500 heads per batch and a processing capacity of four (4) batches per year. The major part
of the business is the cattle fattening operation, which involves purchasing locally sourced cattle between
the ages of 18-24 months and then fattening them over a three month period. Once the cattle have attained
the desired mass, they are sold to abattoirs, butcheries and supermarkets.
The company produces both for the domestic and export market. However, it has not been able to realize its
full potential due to several constraints, such as inadequate nutrition and frequent cattle diseases. As feed
represents the largest annual operating cost, the company has made several attempts in the last few months
to cut spending. Crop residues and rendered feed from local suppliers are currently being used as feed
material, but the company has yet to establish a mechanism for overseeing the quality and source of feed.
During a recent inspection by one of its overseas buyers, the food safety auditors raised a concern that there
could be a risk of the use of Specified Risk Material (SRM) in the low cost feed. Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) was identified as one of the potential risks and the auditors found the company lacked
a system for monitoring the quality and source of the rendered feed. The auditors have recommended that
the company work with its feed suppliers and maintain records sufficient to track the material from its
processing and distribution through its receipt by buyers such as XYZ. This problem has been highlighted in
the export market. Some of the heavily publicized outbreaks of foodborne diseases in the last few years
have raised awareness on the need to ensure food quality and safety. With recent events in Europe on the
discovery of horse and other meat traces in products claimed to be 100% beef, there is an increased demand
for stricter traceability requirements. The company has identified on-farm food safety as one of the key
areas to focus on in the coming months and plans to implement a system to improve its competitiveness of
livestock and meat export, quality of meat, and chain of custody traceability in its value chain.
While quality and safety of meat is an issue in the value chain, so are labor practices. An international NGO
has identified cattle herding in Africa as a major source of child labor that has gone unnoticed by the
international community. According to its latest report, almost 60 percent of girls and boys (aged 5–17
years) in hazardous work are found in agriculture. The livestock sector is one of the fastest growing
segments of the agricultural economy and represents a source of income and food security for 70 percent of
the world´s 880 million rural poor who live on less than USD $1.00 a day. Within rural environments,
livestock rearing has historical, cultural and traditional roots, and the involvement of children is very
common. XYZ is aware that as a cattle rearing center, it sources from nearby nomadic farmers who offer
competitively priced animals because they use the free labor of the whole family. XYZ local employees know
that children as young as 5 or 7 herd cattle, sometimes far from their homes, with no possibility for
schooling, and are vulnerable to the climate, physical and mental isolation, disease, long work hours and
poor sanitation and hygiene. These children are also at risk of being gored, kicked, stamped or bitten by the
herd and wild animals and insects. Some of the children are also known to be victims of trafficking and
vulnerable to forced and bonded labor due to their parents’ indebtedness. When some XYZ employees talk
to the herders, they are given strong signals that the pastoralist communities recognize the importance of
education for their children and would want to send their children to school if the education was relevant to
the pastoral way of life, and especially if schooling could be combined with child work in the herd.
Finally, in the last few months, the company has been criticized for its poor environmental practices in waste
management. Due to limited land availability, animals are crowded into relatively small areas and their
manure and urine are transported into a waste lagoon on the adjoining land. These pits often rupture, leak
or overflow, sending dangerous microbes, nitrate pollution and drug resistant bacteria into water supplies.
Last month, the environmental authorities took water samples downstream of the Akaki River, which is one

IFC ESMS Toolkit and Case Studies – Animal Production   Version 1.1 September 12, 2014                     110
XYZ Case Study

of the major community water sources, and found it to be contaminated with E. coli bacteria attributed to
XYZ’s operations. Uncontrolled algae growth and damage to aquatic life in the river has been linked to
phosphorous and nitrogen releases from the animal waste. The lagoon also emits toxic gases such as
ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and methane, which have long been a cause of concern to the local community
and more widely to local environmentalists because of their “greenhouse effect.” Currently, the company
sprays the manure onto land as fertilizer and some of the villagers have complained that this brings still
more of these harmful substances into the air and water, as well as emitting odors.
In order to improve its competitiveness in the international market, XYZ Company has decided to develop
and implement environmental and social management systems and training programs, based on existing
laws and regulations on labor, product safety, hygiene and best industry practices.

XYZ 1. Policy

XYZ LIVESTOCK COMPANY Policy Statement
XYZ had a long internal debate about adopting policies, especially those relating to labor and environmental
requirements. The company felt it would be very hard to meet these requirements, given the operating
environment. Finally, the CEO decided to proceed with the complete set of policies, because of his goal of
selling internationally. The company established a three-year plan to try and achieve compliance with the
policies and gain some type of international certification or recognition.
In addition to the complete set of environmental and social policies, the company prepared a shorter version
of the organizational goals summarizing the most relevant points, and posted it in various locations:
XYZ - Our products, our environment, our people
     •    Together we produce safe and high-quality livestock, which create value and confidence for our
          customers and consumers.
     •    We are committed to conducting our operations in accordance with the environmental and labor
          laws and regulations that apply to our industry.
     •    We recognize that water is a valuable resource, and we commit to use it more efficiently.
     •    We commit to process organic solid waste, including manure to generate useful byproducts.
     •    We commit to prevent harmful child labor in our operations and work with our suppliers to improve
          labor issues in our supply chain.
     •    We strive for an injury-free workplace, ensuring that no young worker is employed in a hazardous
          job; our workers are not exposed to dangerous situations or hazardous chemicals; and that they use
          appropriate personal protective equipment.
     •    We are all - managers, supervisors and workers – jointly responsible for making our policy a reality.

XYZ LIVESTOCK COMPANY Physical Mapping
A team that included supervisors and workers did a walk-through in the plant during operating hours and
annotated on a sketch map all the problems they observed.
The Physical Map presented here can be used for most of the animal rearing facilities and can be referred to
as well when you do your emergency preparedness plan.

XYZ LIVESTOCK COMPANY Action Plan
Based on its Risk Assessment Form, XYZ prioritized the following four key risks:
     •    Manure and urine collected in waste lagoon leading to contamination of the Akaki river and emissions of toxic and GHG gases
     •    Possibility of child and forced labor in the supply chain
     •    Workers’ injuries from being kicked, gored or stomped by cattle
     •    Use of Specified Risk Material (SRM) in the cattle feed
XYZ developed Action Plans to manage these four (4) risks (see below).

XYZ 5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

XYZ developed a Preparedness and Response Plan to identify, prevent and respond to fire emergencies. The
plan includes a Fire Preparedness and Response Procedure. Farm fires pose a specific kind of threat since
farms tend to be isolated and have limited access to well-equipped urban fire departments or to large
quantities of water. Barns are highly flammable and can quickly burn out of control. No amount of
precaution will entirely eliminate fire hazards, so it is important to be prepared to deal with the fire
emergency at farms.

XYZ 6. Stakeholder Engagement

XYZ LIVESTOCK COMPANY Stakeholder Mapping – Identification and Analysis
An XYZ cross-departmental team brainstormed and listed the stakeholders that are affected by or have an
interest in the company’s operations. The team then discussed and listed their key concerns, issues and
interests. To identify those, they looked back at the environmental and social key risks and impacts
previously identified (see Chapter 2. Identification of Risks and Impacts – XYZ Case Study) and how these
affect the surrounding communities.
To identify nearby villages and groups that may be affected by the company operations, the company also
used a satellite image and drew a sketch with the sources of pollution and the areas that could be affected
(see Impact Zoning Tool for Identifying Affected Communities in Section I of this Toolkit).

Then, XYZ mapped the stakeholders on a matrix according to the degree to which they are impacted and
their ability to influence the company operations. Finally, XYZ categorized them based on their current
relationship with the company: supportive, supportive with conditions, neutral, opposed. Based on this,
they define their engagement method with each group.
