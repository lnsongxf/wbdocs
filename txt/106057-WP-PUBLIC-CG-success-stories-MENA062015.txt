          The purpose of this report is to help demonstrate the business case for good corporate governance in MENA.
          This report shares the experiences of 19 companies that have made governance improvements over the past few
          years, summarizing the changes they made, and the impacts they reported. In this edition, four of the companies
          profiled in the earlier publication have provided updates on their continuing efforts to improve their governance.
          The publication also features the experiences of eight companies that are profiled for the first time.

          Overall, companies reported highly positive impacts as a result of their corporate governance changes. Companies
          made improvements at all levels of the organization, from the board level to the management level. Taken as a
          whole, several common themes emerge. These commonalities are summarized here.

                                                           in Egypt. The company provides integrated transport and other related services, such as warehousing, customs,
                                                           distribution, and packing, across Egypt. Since its inception, it has grown into a leader in the transportation
                                                           sector with nearly 400 employees. It operates from eight branches located strategically near Egypt’s main ports,
                                                           airports, and transportation centers.

                                                           The company is now publicly traded on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX), but the Leheta family still owns
                                                           about one-third of the shares (see chart below). The family is actively involved in the company with Mr. Hussam

                                                           board member and senior executive. The company has enjoyed financial success recently with return on equity
                                                           growing 15 percent in 2008, despite the economic slowdown.
