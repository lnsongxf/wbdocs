1      SUMMARY
The agribusiness incubator in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India is the result of a partnership
between the Indian government and an international crop-research organization that is a
member of CGIAR, a global partnership of organizations seeking a food-secure future. As the
incubator has developed, it has become relatively independent of its founders, the
International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and the Indian
government’s Department of Science and Technology. From supporting small businesses that
can bring new agricultural research and technology to market, ABI has become an incubator
of incubators, and is now helping African incubators follow its model.



2      BACKGROUND
In December 2002, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics
(ICRISAT), a nonprofit organization, joined forces with the Department of Science &
Technology (DST), an Indian government agency, to develop an agribusiness incubator (ABI)
at ICRISAT. The incubator was supported by DST’s National Science and Technology
Entrepreneurship Development Board, which promotes the development and
commercialization of indigenous technologies by providing financial assistance through
public-private partnerships.

ABI’s mission is to facilitate the creation of competitive agribusiness enterprises through
technology development and commercialization. Its launching met a need identified by
ICRISAT’s senior management: to ensure that its research reaches the field. In the late 1990s,
ICRISAT Identified two bottlenecks to its mission:

       1. Public sector R&D was disconnected from broader market developments and
          demands

       2. The research, technology development, technology transfer, and technology use
          sectors had failed to build lasting relationships with each other.

The agribusiness incubator was created with initial funding of about $500,000 from DST with a
staff of three—a manager, secretary and assistant). Funds were spent mainly to acquire lab
equipment. The staff identified technologies that could potentially be commercialized that
were related to crops ICRISAT had found were most beneficial in arid regions. After in-depth
market research ABI expanded beyond ICRISAT-mandated crops. Interventions initially
focused on biotechnologies.

ABI gradually moved away from ICRISAT’s technology to a more client-centered approach. In
order to engage scientists in ABI’s work, management encouraged scientific consulting,
effectively putting scientists in contact with enterprises. ABI’s business model evolved from
fee-based (rental of infrastructure, office, and facilities) to offer feasibility studies and
consulting services.

3      CONTEXT AND CUSTOMERS
Because ICRISAT’s headquarters are in the Indian State of Andhra Pradesh, ABI initially focused
on this region. There is a long tradition of collaboration and partnership between ICRISAT and
Andhra Pradesh. The state has contributed to the facilities housing the incubator and other
agricultural projects. Over time, ABI has expanded beyond Andhra Pradesh into promoting
new incubators and expanding internationally, particularly in Africa. Although most of ABI’s
incubatees and graduates are from Andhra Pradesh, some have a national reach.

ABI began by seeking entrepreneurs who were willing to commercialize its agriculturally
based technologies. ABI offered these entrepreneurs concept validation, business consulting,
technology support, infrastructural and other management facilitation. ABI supported them
from concept to commercialization.

Criteria for ABI to support a company include:


       1. It is a technology–based, agricultural startup.

       2. It can work with an enterprise, industry association, R & D company approach.

       3. It offers innovative concepts and proprietary proposals in agricultural technology.

       4. Its owner has financing and the necessary technical education.

       5. It submits a detailed business plan.

Over time, the definition of customer has also changed. While the primary focus remains on
innovative technology-based enterprises, ABI now also supports seed farmers, Micro, Small
and Medium Enterprises (MSME)s, and other companies that have participated in the Indian
government’s development programs.



4      STRATEGIC VISION, MISSION, AND TARGETS
Vision: agricultural prosperity through innovation, entrepreneurship and partnerships.

Mission: to improve the lives of the poor by creating competitive agri-business enterprises
that develop and commercialize new technologies.

5      INCUBATOR’S DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
ABI’s distinguishing features are:
    a) It is embedded in an international agricultural research center.*
    b) It focuses on technology.
    c) It serves a broad sprectrum of clients (small farmers, MSME, and advanced biotech
        firms).
    d) It is closely tied to India’s policies and institutions.

Its primary strengths include:
     a) Its location at a world-famous research center with a large campus, state-of-the-art
        facilities, laboratories, experimental fields, and a community of national and
        international scientists.
     b) Its location in a very dynamic and entrepreneurial country with policies favorable to
        incubators. India has the largest number of agribusiness incubators in the world.
     c) Access to highly educated and experienced professional human resources.
     d) A proven record of success over the first 10 years of operation.

Its primary weaknesses include:
     a) Limited flexibility in seizing business opportunities because of the constraints of
        operating within a large international research center with objectives broader than
        business.
     b) The need to negotiate among different cultures: researchers versus business
        development managers, high-tech versus low-tech, medium-scale versus small-scale
        enterprises; Indian context versus an international mandate.
     c) A brand dependent on its affiliation with ICRISAT. If the link with ICRISAT were ever
        cut, the incubator’s national and international expansion could be compromised.

Management proposes to augment its existing strengths and overcome its weaknesses by:
  a) Discussing the possibility of making ABI fully independent of ICRISAT while still
     keeping some ties to the nonprofit. In fact, ABI is already largely autonomous
     financially; for example, it pays ICRISAT rent for the use of its facilitities.
  b) Providing incentives to researchers to participate in ABI’s activities.
  c) Exploring expansion to Africa and forming partnership with African organizations to
     start similar activities in the sub-saharan region.



6      NETWORKS AND PARTNERSHIPS
ABI is skilled at forming networks and partnerships with key institutions in India and
internationally. The five most important relationships are with:

1. Technology Development Board (TDB) of the Department of Science and Technology
(DST), which provided seed funds for ABI startups.

2. DST’s National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board
(NSTEDB), an institutional mechanism to promote knowledge-driven and technology-
intensive enterprises. The NSTEDB provided initial financial support to establish ABI.

                                             4	  
	  
3. Technopreneur Promotion Program (TePP), an initiative of the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), which lends money to individual innovators or
firms for converting their novel ideas into working prototypes. ABI is a TePP outreach center.

4. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), under the Department of
Agricultural Research and Education (DARE). ICAR runs the National Agricultural Innovation
Project (NAIP), funded by the World Bank to provide technological support to farmers
through development of new strategies, technologies, and innovative solutions. NAIP has
given ABI responsibility for mentoring ten Business Planning and Development units or
incubators of ICAR and state agricultural universities (SAUs).

5. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises – Development Organization (MSME-DO),
which provides a wide spectrum of services to the sector, nurturing innovative business ideas
that could be commercialized within a year, through onsite incubation at Research Institutes
and SAUs.



7      CO-BUSINESS INCUBATION
ABI also serves agriculture-based entrepreneurs through institutional partnerships, by which it
aims to:
    • Enhance support and services for a large number of entrepreneurs.
    • Compliment technology and business in their respective domans.
    • Provide access to physical, technical, and other facilitites for clients on co-business
         incubation basis.
    • Facilitate inclusive growth through focused implementation of new venture creation
         and technology commercialization.
    • Enhance success of incubatees by networking.
    • Promote cross-border ventures and business development.
    • Provide common branding for better marketability of the programs.

Among its institutional partners are IIAM in Mozambique, AREU in Mauritius, TNAU in
Coimbatore, 10 Indian NARS through NAIP-ICAR, and STEP at Thapar University in Patiala,
India.

Co-business incubation with the Network of Indian Agri-Business Incubators (NIABI) is one of
the most important achievements of ICRISAT. The activity has put ICRISAT at the forefront of
Indian agribusiness incubation development.



8      APPROACH TO INCUBATION
The core services provided by ABI to its clients include:
   • Technology consulting. Transfer of agriculture know-how from ICRISAT’s research
       findings or from other national and international partners. Examples include:
            o HNPV bio-pesticide.
            o Bacillus species bio-pesticide.


                                              5	  
	  
               o Seed production in legume crops.
               o Watershed development.
               o Aflatoxin for food quality control.
               o DUS testing for seed certification.
               o Tissue culture protocol for crops.
               o Genetic transformation for commercial crops.
               o Transformation protocol development of commercial crops.
               o GMO testing in seeds, food, feed.
               o Marker development of traits for seed producers.
       •   Capacity building and training. Entrepreneurship development programs, skill
           upgrading, and business management training.
       •   Business facilitation. Pre-feasibility studies; market research consultancy; networking
           with bankers, venture capitalists, and markets. Facilitates entrepreneurs to participate
           in events and trade shows.
       •   Access to funding. ABI assists by networking with bankers and venture capitalists and
           national development programs.
       •   Infrastructure and facilities.

ABI’s development plan includes service and outreach strategies.

Service strategy. ABI promote ventures directly through its service strategy, in the following
categories: (i) Seed ventures; (ii) Biofuel ventures; (iii) Innovative ventures; (iv) Farm ventures
and (v) Agri-biotech ventures.

Outreach strategy. ABI seeks to partner with organizations globally on business incubation.

ABI carries out initiatives funded by the Indian Government to promote SME and agribusiness
through seed funding of enterprises as well as funding of innovations and business ideas.



9      INSTITUTIONAL SET-UP
ABI is a component of the Agribusiness Innovation Platform (AIP), a public-private partnership
created by ICRISAT. ABI is responsible to the its standing advisory committee (SAC), which
comprises six members, three internal (from ICRISAT management) and three external. The
external members are a business school professor, a venture capitalist, and an agribusiness,
finance, or biotech consultant. The SAC meets thrice yearly or as needed. Decisions are based
on consensus, which means that they can be slow in coming, and that ABI could be stuck in
the approval process. In order to be accepted, new clients must make presentations to the
SAC.

ABI is part of ICRISAT, under the control of the Board of AIP. ABI and AIP are integrated with
ICRISAT’s new strategic plan, which emphasizes inclusive, market-oriented development, a
paradigm shift embraced by ICRISAT’s Board and scientists. ICRISAT believes that the
traditionally poor technology-transfer record of the CGIAR, a global partnership of
organizations seeking a food-secure future, could be improved through initiatives such as ABI.

10 BUSINESS MODEL

In its first five years (2002 to 2006), ABI depended heavily on funds from ICRISAT and
Government of India. From the beginning, however, it tried to adopt a business model that
would make it sustainable over time. Since 2007, ABI has been financially self-sufficient.

Having achieved financial self-sufficiency, ABI’s management is of the view that in order to
further grow, it needs to move to a different business model than in the past.

ABI has followed a franchising/revenue-generation model characterized by considerable
management support for many small to medium enterprises and investments in technology
transfer and marketing. Service or one-time fees have been its main source of revenue.

In the future, ABI would like to adopt a capital-gains model, with most revenue deriving from
highly proprietary technologies. Equity payments and intellectual property rights would be
the main components of the capital gains. Incubatees suited for this model include
mature/large businesses and start-ups with solid entrepreneurs. The capital-gains model
would offer less management support, while ICRISAT would provide more support for new
technology development.

ABI rents most of its facilities from ICRISAT. In turn, ABI’s clients pay rent for use of the facilities.
The rents that ABI’s clients pay are comparable to rental fees in the market, or sometimes are
even higher (according to some of the interviewed incubatees). ABI’s budgets are not
submitted to the AIP’s Board but to ICRISAT’s Standing Advisory Committee (SAC). Recent
budget and service fees are presented in the following tables.

11 STAFFING AND LEADERSHIP

Staff growth has been slow and cautious, from three employees to the current 11. The
manager and deputy manager have a solid business background: Both are MBAs from Tamil
Nadu University with previous business experience.

ABI has enjoyed leadership continuity in three key position: the Chief Operating Officer (COO)
(Previously ABI’s manager), the chief executive officer (CEO) of AIP (previously ABI’s CEO), and
the director-general (DG) of ICRISAT. These three key persons have provided the management,
intellectual leadership, and business strategy for ABI. All are highly visible both within and
outside the organizations. To a large extent they complement each other. ABI’s COO has
strong business experience and orientation; AIP’s CEO is a renowned scientist and experienced
biotech research manager; and ICRISAT’s DG is the overall guiding force of the institute,
responsible for overall strategic direction.

Close ties to Andhra Pradesh and key institutions in India’s government have consolidated the
leadership of these officials. A new generation of leaders to succeed the existing one has not
yet been clearly identified.



12 OUTCOMES AND RESULTS

Since its inception in 2002, ABI has incubated 29 enterprises and has also worked with seed
entrepreneurs, MSMEs, biofuel clients, and more recently with other incubators. Of the 29
incubated enterprises, seven have graduated. Their current average annual sales total
between $1 and $3 million.

In addition to graduating successful enterprises, other achievements of ICRISAT include:

               of groundnut to Aakruthi Agricultural Associates of India (AAI)

       3. Increased profits for farmers worth $13 million.

       4. Enhanced convenience for farmers through new tools and services including
          mobile-based extension services and a cotton harvester. The innovations were
          incubated at ABI under the MSME scheme. Apart from funding assistance, they were
          given mentoring support, office space, business development services, networks, and
          product promotion.

       5. Increased rural employment: 832 new jobs were created.

       6. New approach to CG was promoted for international agricultural research to bridge
          the gap between product research and its use on farms.



13 FUTURE GOALS

ABI has achieved considerable success over the past ten years in bridging the gaps between
product research and farm use. Future challenges for the future are described in the following
paragraphs.

Consolidation of Co-incubator Role. ABI has effectively become an incubator of incubators
in the agribusiness sector of India. The challenge for the future is to ensure that the experience
is successful and can be replicated so that similar incubation experiences provide a dense
network of agribusiness incubators throughout India. The real test is to evaluate the macro
impact of this effort compared to other past efforts pursued to promote agribusiness SME
growth.

Expansion to Africa. Since 2007 ABI has been exploring the opportunity to develop
incubators in Africa. After missions to Mozambique and other countries where ICRISAT is
pursuing research, ABI initiated co-incubation in countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Promotion of Value-Chain Initiatives. ABI has worked successfully with biofuel companies
using the sweet sorghum technologies developed by ICRISAT, as well as seed companies. The
next challenge is to move these separate initiatives a step further and create value-chain
integration that could lead to sectoral effects, similar to what Fundacion Chile and TnsMz
achieved in Chile and Mozambique, respectively.

Expansion within CGIAR. ABI-ICRISAT has taken a very active role in promoting a Global
Agribusiness Initiative (GABI) across the CGIAR system. It is not clear whether the initiative was
successful and the extent to which other consulting group centers have subscribed to the
idea.


14 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. ICRISAT’s commitment to bridging the gap between research and farmers.

2. Close partnerships with key institutions of India’s government.

3. A solid anchor in the form of ICRISAT scientists and pool of technologies developed by
   ICRISAT.

4. Clear orientation towards innovative ideas with sound market prospects.



15 LESSONS LEARNED AND IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRIBUSINESS
       INCUBATORS
Bridging the gap between research and farmers. The immediate implication of ABI’s work is
for other international centers belonging to the CGIAR. ABI has shown a way to bridge the gap
between researchers and farmers in the SAT, offering a model for other CGIAR centers.

Partnership with national development programs. These partnerships enabled the
incubator to be effective and to grow, from initial launch capital provided by Government of
India and ICRISAT to new with DST, DSRI, DBT, and others.

Incubating incubators. The most valuable lesson for replicating ABI’s success is its movement
towards incubating incubators. ABI is the force behind NIABI and is mentoring ten
agribusiness incubators in India.

Moving from a Revenue-Generating to a Capital-Gain Business Model. The management
is thinking of generating revenue from intellectual property and equity sharing in the
incubatees.
