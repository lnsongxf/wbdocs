The Promoting Green Urban Development in African Cities, Urban Environmental Profile for Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania was prepared by a core study team led by Roland White (Global Lead: City Management, Governance
and Financing - Task Team Leader) and included Chyi-Yun Huang (Urban Specialist), Amy Faust (Consultant/Urban
Environmental Management Specialist) and a consultant team from AECOM including John Bachmann, Diane
Dale, Brian Goldberg, Maritza Pechin, and Dr. Jane Turpie (Anchor Environmental). Andre Bald (Program Leader),
Dr. Jeffrey Wielgus Yanovich (Consultant/Environmental and Natural Resource Economist) and Dr. Timm Kroeger
(Senior Environmental Economist, The Nature Conservancy) contributed critical review and guidance. Professor
Alphonce Kyessi (Ardhi University) and Dr. Anesi Mahenge (Ardhi University) provided key insights and secondary
data. Sonia Wheeler, Gloria Sindano and Leah Mukuta offered organizational and administrative support while
Sarah Botta (AECOM) provided graphic design support.

The document was prepared under the overall guidance of Francisco Ferreira (Chief Economist), Sameh Wahba
(Practice Manager), Mukami Kariuki (Practice Manager) and Philippe Dongier (Country Director).
This Urban Environmental Profile benefited immensely from close collaboration with representatives from the
Government of Tanzania, including the Dar es Salaam City Council, Kinondoni Municipal Council, Ilala Municipal
Council, Temeke Municipal Council, Prime Minister’s Office - Regional Administration and Local Government
(PMO-RALG), Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Ministry of Water, National
Environment Management Council, Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) and Dar es
Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation (DAWASCO). The team is also grateful for the inputs provided by
representatives from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Tanzania Cities Network (TACINE),
World Wildlife Fund, Ardhi University, University of Dar es Salaam, Open University of Tanzania and NIPE FAGIO.
The team would like to express its gratitude especially to the Honorable Mayor Didas Massaburi for his guidance
and support.

The study would not have been possible without the generous financial contribution of Korean Green Growth
Partnership.

Dar es Salaam is bounded by the Indian Ocean to
the east and the Coast (Pwani) region to the west
(Figure 1). The city stretches 100km from the Mpiji River
in the north to beyond the Mzinga River in the south,
comprising a total land area of 1,630.7 km2 (about 0.2%
of the entire Tanzania mainland’s area) (ILRI, 2007). It is
the largest city in Tanzania.

Dar es Salaam was established as a port and trading
center in 1862. It grew rapidly from the early 1890s when
the colonial administrative headquarters of German

of the city and local government system was largely

Dar es Salaam’s fastest-growing areas by population are
now those far from the city center (Figure 2). Peripheral
wards have received 42% of the total population increase
between 2002 and 2012. Medium-distance wards, 10-15
km west, south west, and south of the city center, have
experienced 24% of the increase. To the north, rapid
growth is found more than 15 km away from the city
center. Population growth in the southern coastal areas
that are not serviced by any major roads is less than the
other areas (Andreasen, 2013).

The city’s rapid population growth and rural-urban
migration, coupled with inadequate availability of
affordable housing, has resulted in new developments
concentrating on the periphery of the city (Figure 3)
(Kyessi, 2013; Moss and Happold, 2013). A 2011 survey of
roughly 6,000 households settled in Dar es Salaam’s peri-
urban areas (Ricci et al., 2012) shows that the majority
(64%) moved from another municipality in the Dar es
Salaam region to the peri-urban area, while 36% moved
from other regions of Tanzania (rural to peri-urban)
(Macchi et al, 2013). The public sector has not been able
to keep up with the resulting demand for housing or
provide a positive environment for housing development                 Figure 3	 Pattern of Urban Growth

vacant or agricultural land was converted into urban land
uses. More than 75% of these new developments can
be classified as informal settlements, while only roughly
15% were converted into planned residential areas. Only
about 8% of these newly developed areas accommodate
other uses, including industrial or commercial uses,
transport or public services (Hill and Linder, 2010).

  Climate change is projected to affect precipitation
  variability, storm frequency and temperature,
  resulting in sea level rise and storm surges; coastal
  and beach erosion; submergence of some nearby
  islands; intrusion of salt water in fresh water bodies
  (wells and boreholes); and erosion and destruction
  of lifelines (i.e. roads, bridges and coastline). The

  The land and soil cover have been severely degraded
  by the large spatial footprint of informal settlements.
  Between 1982 and 2002, more than 15,500 ha of
  formerly vacant agricultural lands had been converted
  to urban development. Seventy-five percent of
  new development has been classified as informal
  development; 15% converted into planned residential
  development; and 8 -10% developed for commercial and
  industrial, public and other uses (Hill and Linder, 2010).
  Both commercial development and informal settlements
  have resulted in areas of impervious or disturbed
  land area that prevent vegetation growth and inhibit
  infiltration of stormwater (URT, 2014c TSCP) (See photos).

  erosion, deforestation and the impervious footprint of
  development have reduced the quantity and quality of
  water and the ecosystem as a whole. Recent studies
  have shown that several locations along the Msimbazi

  unsuitable for potable water and the soil unsuitable for
  urban agricultural cultivation.

Dar es Salaam’s coastline is approximately 100 km long,
reaching from the Mpiji River in the north to Mpakani
village in the south, and includes sandy beaches; rocks,
cliffs and platforms; coral reefs, mangrove forests,
estuaries, and seagrass-covered lagoons (Hartnoll. 1975;
Kairu and Nyandwi, 2000) (UNEP, 2011).

The coral reefs within Dar es Salaam’s island and bay
areas, established within the broader 26km2 Marine
Protected Areas designation in 1975, were found to have
high diversity in the 1960s and 1970s. However, surveys
in the 1980s and 1990s described general degradation
due to destructive fishing techniques and tourism
(Muhando, n.d.a). Studies in 1999 and 2000 noted that
while live hard coral cover increased in most locations,
the species composition changed (Muhando, n.d.a).

Furthermore, the city’s marine system provides habitat
for endangered species including marine turtles,
hawksbill (Eretmochely imbricata) and green turtle
(Chelonia mydas), sea turtle, dolphins, humpback whales
and whale sharks (URT, 2011 as referenced in URT,
2014d).                                                     Figure 16	 Locations of Reported Beach Erosion (areas of erosion in

the majority located in one stand at the mouth of the
Msimbazi river (Samaki, 2015).

Temeke District has the most extensive coverage of
mangrove forest (see Table 7) with 7 distinct forests
covering more than 2,000 km2. However, mangrove
forests in Dar es Salaam face considerable threats to
forest decline due to exploitation and uncontrolled use

  Most mangrove forests, including Kunduchi, Mbweni and
  Mtoni, were harvested intensely in the 1990s and 2000s,
  resulting in severe fragmentation. The area of mangrove
  forest decreased from 2,516 hectares (Semesi, 1991) to
  2,170 hectares (TCMP, 2001), along with a considerable
  decrease in density, height and canopy cover. In addition,
  Dar es Salaam has been losing coastal beach habitat due
  to coastal storms (City Links, 2014).

  Opportunity exists to restore mangrove forests at
  Kinondoni. A 2008 survey by NEMC revealed some
  recovery of the density of mangrove trees at Kinondoni
  after government and stakeholder conservation
  initiatives (UNEP, 2011).

IV.	 DRIVERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL VULNERABILITY AND
     DEGRADATION
Drivers of environmental degradation are identified
and described in this section. While environmental
degradation in Dar es Salaam is the result of numerous
drivers, the drivers described below have emerged
from discussions with key stakeholders and review of
existing literature as having direct actions which impact
the quality and condition of the environmental assets
described in Section III. The key drivers of degradation in
Dar es Salaam include informal settlement, the extraction
of natural resources, solid waste management, effluent,
the extraction of water, and emissions.


A.	      Informal Settlements
The majority of urban spatial expansion of Dar es
Salaam has occurred without guidance and has
manifested as informal settlements throughout the city.
Approximately 70%-80% of the population now resides
in the dense, unplanned areas that are typically located
in environmentally vulnerable areas such as those prone
to flooding (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013a; Kyessi,
2010). Informal developments are characterized by rapid,
unstructured, unplanned and unserviced growth (Kyessi,

recreational purposes; relocated from designated areas;
or result from other exploitative strategies by developers.
This increase in haphazard patterns of urban growth has
caused economic inefficiency, environmental degradation
and negative impacts to human quality of life. Large
numbers of households live without access to safe
water and quality sanitation and infrastructure; secure
property tenure; or adequate opportunity to participate
in government decision-making processes (ibid).

Dar es Salaam has over 100 unplanned housing areas
covering an area of at least 5,197 hectares (Kyessi,
2010). The settlement pattern includes small planned
areas within the large unplanned urban landscape.
Landowners informally subdivide and sell their land to
small-scale developers. Detached (single story) buildings
have predominated, very low population densities
although existing unplanned areas continue to densify,
and some of the more accessible areas are undergoing
gentrification (Kyessi, 2010).

  flooding, soil erosion, ground water and air pollution,
  public safety issues, high cost of services such as potable
  water, long walking distances to water points, and lack of
  health services, schools, and playgrounds for children.

  The outward expansion of development into peri-urban
  and peripheral areas requires expansion of infrastructure
  services such as drainage, sewage and roads in order
  to service new settlements. However, infrastructure
  development is not keeping pace with settlement,
  resulting in the degradation of environmental assets
  through unplanned actuaries such as road construction,
  which erodes fragile coastal forest edge, contributes
  sediment to rivers and conveys solid wastes and
  untreated effluent.

  Informal settlement has negative impacts on human
  health. Cholera was found to have a high incidence
  of transmission in informal settlement areas due to
  population density which promotes direct transmission                             Figure 20	 Planned and Informal Residential 2012-2022

               from other models like for example transport models, thus, they might up-date road network and travel
               times. As no such model exists for Dar es Salaam, here all other independent variables stay unchanged.

Hospital and dispensary health statistics indicate the
prevalence of water borne disease, vector borne disease
and parasites, infections, and malnutrition in informal
settlements. The high incidence of diarrhea, intestinal
worms and gastroenteritis are indicators of poor
sanitation conditions and contamination of food and soil
with human excrement. Poor personal hygiene is also
evident from the fact that water-washed diseases (e.g.,
infectious skin and eye diseases) are widespread, as are
fecal-oral diseases such as diarrhea and dysentery.

The average annual catch is approximately 7,855,134

Countrywide, the number of fresh and marine fishermen
has more than doubled between 1993 and 2006, placing
further pressure on marine resources (URT, 2007a).(UNEP,

A driver of deforestation has been the increasing use
and preference for using charcoal and household fuel.
From 1991-92, 51% of households used charcoal as the
primary fuel; usage increased to 69% in 2000-2001 and
78% in 2007 (Malimbwi and Zahabu, 2008). Usage levels
in 2009 included 200,000-300,000 bags (avg. 50 kgs) of
charcoal per month (URT, 2009). More recently, in 2012,
94% of households relied on firewood and charcoal as
primary fuel. The increase in charcoal use reflects lower
costs than alternative fuels and is easily available in         Figure 21	 Cholera-prone Areas in Dar es Salaam

  While mangroves in Kinondoni are threatened by salt
  mining activities, the Kinondoni Integrated Coastal
  Area Management Project (KICAMP) has formulated a
  comprehensive plan for the coastal area, resulting in a ban
  on sand excavation in critical areas (World Bank, 2014).

  Mangroves are also harvested for firewood and charcoal-
  making, salt and lime production, building poles, and
  clearing for building sites for urban expansion and
  agriculture, road construction and hotel construction, as
  is evident at Kunduchi, Mbweni and Ununio areas (UNEP,

  The rapid growth of the population and economic
  activities in Dar es Salaam city are driving the demand for
  new buildings and infrastructure construction requiring
  sand, limestone, and clay. Due to the scarcity of sand,
  there has been an expansion of illegal sand mining.
  While mining activities are regulated by the Government,
  including government-designation of mining areas and
  issuance of licenses, enforcement is inadequate (UNEP,
  2011). Data on the extent of mining and quarrying is
  limited, but it is common to see people mining sand
  for sale (Malele, 2009). Sand mining occurs along the
  coast at Kunduchi Beach. Exploitation activities are also
  undertaken along major river valleys, which lead to
  erosion of riverbanks and land degradation. Inland areas
  of rivers along the Msimbazi, Tabata, and Malalakuwa are
  also freely mined.

  Mining at the Kunduchi quarry site for aggregates and
  stone for building construction purposes, Kunduchi
  Stone, and in Kibugumo, Boko-Magereza and Bunju
  ended when the site was closed in 2008. Limestone is
  quarried from Wazo/Kunduchi outcrops for the local
  cement factory (see photos). Clay is extracted from the
  upper Msimbazi River valley for the manufacturing of
  bricks. Salt is mined at the shore of the Indian Ocean for
  domestic consumption.

  Dar es Salaam’s sewerage system (Figure 25 and
  Table 14) is designed to collect sanitary waste through
  about 199 kilometers of sewers serving approximately
  10-14% of the city area (Moss and Happold, 2013). The
  collected sewerage discharges to 8 independent waste
  stabilization ponds that provide primary treatment
  only, allowing the raw sewage solids to settle before
  discharging the remaining liquids to streams and rivers.
  The system also includes 15 pumping stations and a
  sewage sea outfall (Water Utilities and Performance
  Review Report 2012-2013, IWA Water Week).

  However, the system contributes minimally-treated
  sewage directly into Dar es Salaam’s rivers. Analysis of
  water samples from the Vingunguti Waste Stabilization
  Ponds suggests that the ponds are not working to design
  specification and are failing to adequately treat sewage
  disposed at the site (Hepworth and Jones, 2014).                  Figure 25

to treat wastewater and the remaining 0.4% have no
toilet or use bush/field (National Bureau of Statistics,

cannot afford the cost of pit latrines. Also, pit latrine
leachate contaminates surface and ground waters via
leaks and overflows of latrine systems during flooding.

  Water Resources Management
  There has been a policy direction change in the role
  of the MoW towards that of coordination, policy and
  guideline formulation and regulation, instead of a
  service provider. As such, water resources management
  is the responsibility of the National Water Board, Basin
  Water Boards (divided into nine basins in the country),
  Catchment Committees, and Water User Associations
  or Groups. Representatives from district councils and
  local government authorities sit on the Basin Boards and
  Catchment Committees:

     a.	 National Water Board - a financially and
         administratively autonomous organization,
         financed by the Basin Boards; oversees,
         coordinates and facilitates the activities of Basin
         Boards.

     b.	 Basin Boards - financially and administratively
         autonomous, and financed through water user
         charges; water users are represented on the
         Boards.

     c.	 Catchment and Sub-catchment Committees -
         autonomous bodies financed from user charges,
         and will carry out such functions as are delegated
         by the Basin Water Board; they may employ staff
         necessary to carry out these functions, or may be                                  Figure:

Water Supply, Sewerage and Sanitation
Similarly, in the area of water supply, sewerage and
sanitation, MoW is moving away from being a service
provider to being a regulator. Thus, such service provision
is now based on the local government structures but
delegated to “clustered” Water Supply and Sewerage
Authorities (DAWASAA and DAWASCO in this case);
however, sanitation remains the responsibility of local
government authorities (discussed in later sections).

Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority
(EWURA) – an autonomous multi-sectoral regulatory
authority established under the Energy and Water
Utilities Regulatory Authority Act, 2001. It is responsible
for technical and economic regulation of the electricity,
petroleum, natural gas and water sectors in Tanzania.
In the areas of water and sewerage services, EWURA
is responsible for issuing licenses to WSSAs based on
the submission of business plans and for monitoring
and regulating performance of the WSSAs against these
business plans. This includes the approval of tariffs for
water and sewerage services based on the performance
of the WSSAs in delivering services to consumers. As
the business plans of the WSSAs are required to include       Figure 36	 Institutional Framework for Water Supply, Sewerage and

     - The main objective of the NWSDS is to develop a
     coherent, holistic and integrated strategy for the
     Water Sector in order to implement the National
     Water Policy. This will then allow the on-going
     sub-sectoral initiatives and projects to be set within
     the overall strategic and planning framework for
     the Sector. Furthermore, this strategy has been
     developed to support re-alignment of other
     water related key sectoral policies of energy,
     irrigation, industry, mining, and environment. The
     institutional framework underscores separation
     of service delivery and regulation to ensure fair
     play among the various actors and sectors.
The relationship of these two main documents with
other relevant national policies and financial planning

For example in the provision of water supply and
sanitation services, the absence of adequate capacity and
expertise to implement water resources management
activities has led to ineffective water resources
assessment, inefficient water allocation, and inadequate
follow-up on water use and enforcement of water law.
Skilled professionals in these sectors often have limited
incentives and poor remuneration, which leads to them
leaving the sector. The provision of water, sewerage and
sanitation services has also suffered due to bureaucratic
procedures, lack of autonomy, and lack of resources and
facilities.

Water Resources Management

There has been a policy direction change in the role of the MoW - towards that of coordination,
policy and guideline formulation and regulation, instead of a service provider. As such, water
resources management are the responsibilities of the National Water Board, Basin Water Boards
(divided into nine basins in the country), Catchment Committees, and Water User Associations
or Groups. Representatives from district councils and local government authorities sits on the
Basin Boards and Catchment Committees:

Water Supply, Sewerage and Sanitation
Similarly in the area of water supply, sewerage and sanitation, MoW is moving away from being
a service provider, but rather a regulator. Thus, such service provision is now based on the local
government structures but delegated to “clustered” Water Supply and Sewerage Authorities
