1.1 A Growing Interest in Prepaid Water
                                                                  FIGURE 1: MANY RESIDENTS OF AFRICAN CITIES

Too many people across sub-Saharan Africa still lack
access to affordable safe water. In low-income urban areas
with few individual connections, residents source their
water from a mix of public water points and private water
vendors. They often walk far and queue for free water from
unsafe wells or streams, or pay water vendors for the same
water nearer their homes (Figure 1). Buying treated water
from shared standpipes often involves conflict over shared
payments, while yard taps and standpipes stand idle when
the service provider has disconnected the supply because of
nonpayment. The promise of access or improved coverage
is eroded when service points are disconnected and where
intermediaries inflate the price of treated water.

Service providers, meanwhile, face daunting challenges.
One of the most pressing is the difficulty of meeting the
ongoing costs of delivering safe, affordable water to rapidly
growing urban populations. Although a growing number
of people need services, many cannot afford them, and
some do not want to pay. The senior managers of service
providers often fear political fallout if they raise tariffs
to the level required to cover the costs of operations and
reasonable capital maintenance.

In response, a growing number of urban service providers
in Africa have adopted prepaid water systems since the late
1990s. Prepayment holds the promise of remedying low
collection rates and inadequate income to meet service
expectations. There is no risk of arrears or debt, because      meters symbolize the “commodification” of water, and they

       Water service providers render a service—treatment and delivery of potable water—that must be paid for. The
       recipients of that water can be called users, consumers, or customers.

       In this report, they are called customers, not because of a desire to commoditize water or emphasize the need
       for payment, but to emphasize that this is a relationship of reciprocal accountability. Service providers expect
       payment, and in return customers expect good service. Categorizing them purely as users or consumers
       suggests a one-way relationship (the service provider provides, the recipient receives), and one-dimensional (the
       recipient’s only role is to use or consume the product, rather than inform the terms of use or the quality of what
       is offered). The word “customer” is used here to suggest an entitlement to good service and respect from the
       service provider.

   BOX 3: SOUTH AFRICA, PROBABLY THE BIGGEST USER OF PREPAID WATER METERS


   Prepaid meters were first developed in South Africa in the mid-1990s, and are used extensively in low-income
   areas in conjunction with the national policy of free basic water. Nearly all poor households get the first 6 m3 of
   water free each month. Prepaid meters are programmed to treat this allocation as the first block in a rising block
   tariff, with a zero tariff. Capital and operating costs are subsidized heavily by the national government.

   Prepaid water is contentious in South Africa. In mid-2006, a coalition of social justice activists challenged the City
   of Johannesburg and its water utility, in what became known as the Mazibuko court case, over the implementation
   of prepaid water meters in Phiri, Soweto. They argued that they were discriminatory and contradicted the
   constitutional right of access to water. A High Court judge ruled in their favor, but the Constitutional Court
   subsequently overturned this decision, saying the meters were neither unfair nor discriminatory, and that the
   free basic water allocation mitigated hardship for poor households. The Constitutional Court judge drew a clear
   distinction between disconnection following persistent nonpayment, and the temporary cessation of supply that
   happens when a prepaid user runs out of credit.

   The City of Johannesburg continues to use prepaid meters in Soweto and elsewhere and plans to extend their
   use more widely. These meters are used widely in other parts of the country, although many municipalities now
   prefer flow-limiting devices, which supply water up to an agreed threshold, as a more cost-effective and robust
   alternative.

   BOX 4: HOW PREPAID METERING AND CREDIT LOADING WORKS


   Most prepaid water meters use a mechanical water meter, coupled to an electronics module with a credit meter
   and a water control valve. When water flows, pulses are generated by a probe connected to the mechanical
   meter. These pulses are converted into credits that are subtracted from the total credits loaded by the customer.
   The valve closes when credit is exhausted or if there is tampering with the components.

   Many prepayment systems use rotating piston and multijet water meters. The accuracy of both meters can be
   affected by grit, sand, and air; and frequent supply interruptions raise the risk of malfunction. This is a significant
   vulnerability for prepayment metering systems used in many African cities, where there are aging networks,
   discontinuous supply, and low pressure fluctuations.

   Two alternatives that are better suited to networks with supply interruptions are electromagnetic and ultrasonic
   meters. These are highly accurate; resilient to pressure changes, air, and grit; and have no moving parts. At
   current prices—70 percent higher, but falling—they are not a cost-effective option for domestic meters.

   Customers load credit bought from designated vendors using a programmed metal key, a smartcard, or a
   keypad. Dallas keys, or iButtons, are currently the most widely used, and consist of a computer chip mounted
   in a stainless steel container that looks like a large watch battery. Programmed keys and smartcards allow for
   a two-way exchange of data. A credit vendor loads credit onto the customer’s Dallas key using a point-of-sale
   device, and uploads consumption data from the customer’s prepaid meter for analysis later. This data can be
   used to track consumption trends and flag exceptions (unusually high or low consumption) or for follow-up.
   Numerical tokens and keypads are one-way only, and require separate data collection to track consumption.

   A growing number of utilities now acknowledge that regular monthly meter reading is essential to collect
   consumption data to calculate their water balance, reconcile sales, and monitor nonrevenue water (NRW). Some
   now use automatic meter reading (AMR) systems to collect consumption data from individual meters.

   Some utilities now insist that each prepaid device includes a conventional mechanical meter, if necessary, in
   addition to an electronic meter. If the prepaid unit fails for any reason, the mechanical meter can still be read and

     hardship for those without money to buy more credit. This
     critical issue is considered in more depth below.

     In surveys and focus groups, those who like prepayment
     said they felt more in control of their consumption and
     were no longer anxious about receiving bills they could not
     pay. Many see prepayment as offering a more transparent
     and trusted way of being charged for water than erratic bills
     and estimates.

     The gender impacts of prepaid systems seem fairly indirect,
     and more attributable to improved water supply than
     specifically to prepaid meters. In many focus groups it
     was evident that important concerns of women have been
     addressed because improved and more continuous water
     supply benefited household hygiene and streamlined budget
     management because people know what they consume and
     spend (Figure 8). It has also benefited women and children
     in making the fetching of water more flexible due to the
     longer hours of supply, and all have benefitted from access
     to safer water. One area of perhaps greater specificity has
     been where women have taken up opportunities as credit                            when credit is exhausted than those who fetch and carry

   BOX 5: NAKURU, KENYA: CHEAPER WATER FOR TENANTS, WHENEVER THEY WANT IT


   In Nakuru, northwest of Nairobi, 95 prepaid standpipes have been installed in high-density housing compounds.
   There is generally one tap serving a compound of 25 to 40 households; and in compounds without prepaid
   meters, the landlord controls access closely to limit the risk of a high utility bill. It is not unusual to find the single
   tap in a compound locked except for a few hours a day, three or four days a week. Even then, many compound
   taps are disconnected because the landlord has not paid the bill, although tenants generally pay rent of about
   1,300 KSH a month (US$15.00), which includes about 300 KSH for water. Tenants’ main alternative is to buy from
   a water vendor, at a cost of 6 to 10 Kenyan shillings per 20 liter jerrycan (US$0.067 to US$0.11). The nearest
   water kiosks are some distance away and although they sell water relatively cheaply for 2 KSH per jerrycan, the
   water is only available when the kiosk operator is working.

   Some tenants and landlords were resistant when Nakuru Water first proposed installing prepaid meters in 2012.
   Some tenants objected to having to pay for water, not realizing that they were already paying their landlord for little,
   if any, water. Some landlords were concerned they would lose their income stream from selling water. Once the
   prepaid standpipes were installed, compound residents had access 24/7 for just 1.2 KSH (US$0.01) per jerrycan.
   Tenants had a far better service for a fraction of the price they had paid previously, and landlords found they could
   rent their rooms more readily, often for a better price, with minimal conflict over water and no risk of disconnection.




   Since prepaid stand posts were introduced, tenants living in Nakuru housing compounds have gained access to far
   cheaper water, at any time of day.

        BOX 6: WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA: LESS CONFLICT, FAIRER PAYMENT WITH PREPAID STANDPIPES


        In Windhoek, Namibia, prepaid standpipes have
        reduced conflict around shared payment and
        disconnection. The cost of safeguarding adequate
        water in this semi-desert terrain is high, and water
        tariffs average close to US$2.00 per m3 for domestic
        users. In informal settlements where residents share a
        conventional connection or standpipe, the onus is on
        users to agree how to collect payment to cover their
        shared water bill. If the full bill is not paid, the water
        may be disconnected, and so the poor frequently
        subsidize the nonpaying poor. This often leads to
        conflict, particularly where those living close to the
        standpipe are perceived to be using more water than
        those who must fetch and carry from further away.

        With prepaid standpipes, this source of conflict
                                                                                       Drawing water from a prepaid standpipe, Okuryangava,

        disconnection if others do not pay. They pay US$0.04
        per jerrycan, which works out at about half of what it
        costs those who share a bill. The City Council faces
        strong demand from residents for more prepaid
        meters in informal settlements.

     a prepayment system enables people with no prospect
     of having a connection of their own to have their own
     independent account and relationship with the service
     provider as full customers. One immediate benefit for
     standpipe users is that they are responsible only for paying
     for their own consumption, and are not impacted by added
     costs or disconnection if others do not pay.

     Advance payment means the water supply stops when
     the credit is finished. An obvious disadvantage of prepaid
     meters is that the water supply stops when the credit
     runs out. Surprisingly few interviewees raised this as a
     concern, perhaps because they are accustomed to paying
     for water before they use it and have well-established
     coping mechanisms for when they cannot buy water. They
     said they generally shared water with a neighbor or used
     someone else’s token until they had cash and could repay
     what they had used, or they fetched water from a well. The
     critical importance of mitigating affordability constraints is
     discussed further below.                                                             Many children are enthusiastic users of prepaid meters

   BOX 7: URBAN LEGENDS ABOUT PREPAID WATER METERS


   Only the poor have prepaid water meters.
   Zambia’s President uses a prepaid water meter, one of four installed at the State House in Lusaka. Water
   utilities in Zambia, Uganda, and Malawi have introduced prepaid water meters for institutional customers
   (government buildings and police and army barracks), who are often their biggest debtors. Prepaid water
   systems have been installed in high-income housing estates since 1999 in South Africa and elsewhere. Several
   cities (Lusaka, Mogale City, Johannesburg, and others) aim to make prepaid metering the default on all metered
   connections. Conversely, in Mzuzu, Malawi, the utility plans to target all areas except low-income settlements,
   to avoid any possible hardship and because the costs outweigh the benefits.

   Prepaid meters solve cost recovery problems.
   The cost-recovery potential of prepaid meters is not as straightforward as many of their protagonists assume.
   Prepaid meters bring their own set of problems: the high cost of installation; the fact that meters can develop
   faults that deliver free water or can be bypassed or vandalized when monitoring and follow-up action are
   neglected, which opens the way for high NRW losses; technical shortcomings, including inaccurate readings
   when water pressure is variable; and so on. In addition, the opportunity cost of big investments is high, as
   the real working life of prepaid meters is only about 5–7 years, compared to the estimated 15 to 20 years for
   conventional meters.

   People using prepaid meters spend more and consume less.
   Households in Lusaka and Mogale City with prepaid house connections tend to be more conscious of their water
   consumption and use less, and consequently spend less on water. In Kampala, most households using prepaid
   public standpipes say they spend less and use more because water from standpipes is substantially cheaper
   than from third-party sellers. This review found no evidence that prepaid users pay a higher tariff than other utility
   customers. The costs of prepaid metering are spread across the total customer base, just as the costs of credit
   management and bad debt are borne by all customers.

   BOX 8: SOME REASONS SERVICE PROVIDERS GIVE FOR INTRODUCING PREPAYMENT


   Improve revenue
   • Raise payment levels, improve cash flows, and avoid arrears and bad debt: Prepaid meters make payment
     unavoidable (unless customers bypass or tamper with their meters).
   • Maximize collection: Stop staff from colluding with customers to alter their credit records, delete debt,
     understate meter readings, and so on.

   Manage water demand
   • Promote greater water conservation and reduced wastage: Prepayment raises awareness of consumption, and
     incentivizes customers to close taps and repair leaks on their properties.

   Improve equity
   • Sell water more equitably to poor customers using standpipes by cutting out intermediaries and supplying
     water at the same tariff or less than the provider charges customers with their own connections.
   • Extend access beyond the hours that water vendors and tap attendants work.

   Reduce the cost of doing business
   • Reduce billing queries: Estimates, human error, and disputed bills can annoy customers, create extra work for
     utility staff and delay payment.
   • Avoid disconnections, which are unpleasant both for customers and the staff who execute them.
   • Streamline revenue administration: Reduce the number of staff required for meter reading, issuing bills,
     responding to billing queries, following up arrears, and disconnecting supplies; redeploy some of them to
     tracking leaks and following up anomalies revealed through analyzing purchase and consumption data.

   Respond to explicit customer demand
   • Give water users the benefits they currently enjoy with prepaid electricity, such as more control over
     consumption, more credible metering, no questionable bills, no debt or arrears, and various top-up options.
   • Enable customers to pay only for the water they consume, rather than sharing bills and subsidizing
     nonpayment by others.

     those who support prepaid approaches believe that the                              is more demanding than conventional meters and billing,
     financial costs of the systems are in many ways outweighed                         with interdependent electronic, mechanical, and software

   BOX 9: WHY PREPAID WATER LAGS BEHIND PREPAID ELECTRICITY


   Successful implementation of prepaid electricity in many African countries is spurring demand for prepaid water.

   Many customers have experienced the benefits of prepayment for electricity and mobile phones, and now want
   to manage their water purchases in the same way. But prepayment technologies for water lag far behind those for
   electricity. Three main issues explain this.
   • Prepaid water meters face physical stresses that do not apply to electricity. There are more moving parts,
     most subjected to fluctuating pressures and flows, and wear, fatigue, and abrasion increase the likelihood of
     malfunction. Grit, debris, and air affect water metering in ways that are not relevant to electricity. Any moisture
     can cause malfunctioning in the electronic circuitry. Plus, prepaid water meters need their own individual energy
     source, and finite battery life limits what they can do. Dealing with battery failure and battery replacement is a
     central part of managing prepaid meters. All of these issues make prepaid water a less reliable technology than
     prepaid electricity.
   • The electricity sector is much less fragmented than the water sector, and has far greater clout to direct what
     manufacturers supply. For more than two decades, manufacturers of prepaid electricity equipment that want
     to serve particular markets have had to conform to standards and specifications that allow utilities to mix and
     match components, without being locked into a particular proprietary hardware and software system. This has
     driven competition, with price and quality improvements. Conversely, proprietary systems still dominate the
     prepaid water market.
   • Prepaid water is often seen as controversial. Payment for the supply of electricity is accepted more widely than
     payment for water, and access to electricity is not regarded a basic human right. There are no substitutes, such
     as candles or charcoal, for households that run out of water and cannot buy more. Fear of controversy has
     deterred some big manufacturing role players from entering this market.

   Prepaid water systems are now catching up with developments in other sectors. Several suppliers of prepaid
   water systems now offer nonproprietary options, which permit mix-and-match and allow prepaid water and
   electricity utilities to share the same vending infrastructure, with big cost savings and benefits for customers. The
   real breakthrough will be when nonmechanical water meters become more affordable, because this will lessen
   prepaid water meters’ vulnerability to debris in the network.




Adapting to prepayment requires a significant shift in                             prepayment department, which has led the development of
the way service providers organize their operations.                               streamlined operating procedures to speed-up call-outs and

        BOX 10: PREPAYMENT DOES NOT GUARANTEE LOWER NONREVENUE WATER


        Prepayment metering can improve or worsen NRW, depending on how well the system is managed. Volumetric
        tariffs and more accurate metering will reduce NRW, and prepayment cuts out a range of administrative losses
        arising from data capture errors, wrong tariff codes, and incorrect addresses for billing. NRW will increase where
        reduced consumption raises water pressure and the leakage ratio, and where faults, tampering, and bypassing
        provide free water.

   BOX 11: PREPAID METERS DO NOT COPE WELL WITH WATER SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS


   Twenty-four/seven water supply should be considered a minimum requirement when installing prepaid meters,
   because air and grit can get sucked into the network after a supply interruption and cause the prepaid meter to
   malfunction. Grit can jam the valve open (free water) or closed (no water), and air can spin the counters in the
   mechanical meter and exhaust the remaining credit without supplying any water. This vulnerability makes prepaid
   metering an unsuitable choice for cities with regular supply interruptions that may be looking to prepayment to
   improve collection rates.

   Water utilities are learning to focus their prepaid meter installations in areas with 24/7 supply and water pressures
   levels that the meters can tolerate. In areas where service interruptions are likely, the service provider may have
   to pursue other technologies, or budget extra to upgrade the network, street by street. Without this, service
   quality for customers will deteriorate and prepayment metering will be associated with more frequent supply
   interruptions. But service interruptions contribute to low payment rates. “If you don’t sort out your network, you’ll
   never get decent collection rates,” said one technical manager.

        BOX 12: TOO COLD FOR COMFORT: WINTER CHALLENGES FOR PREPAID METERS IN MASERU


        Lesotho is known as the mountain kingdom, and has very cold weather in winter. This raises the maintenance
        load significantly for WASCO staff when the prepaid meters ice up inside and shut down. In the cold months,
        there are up to 60 call-outs a day in subzero temperatures, against a total of about 3 500 prepaid meters. Learning
        from these experiences, WASCO technical staff prepares refurbished meters in advance to swap in and out within
        five minutes to minimize the inconvenience to customers. The utility bears the full cost of all maintenance.

        In 2011, the utility introduced 300 meters of a different type that were designed to cope with subzero
        temperatures. Programming the software on the new meters to meet WASCO’s needs presented challenges that
        could not be resolved. WASCO wanted to be able to track whether customers were buying credit each month, as
        a way of identifying possible tampering or bypasses, but instead the meters cut-off supply entirely if no credit was
        bought within a 30-day period. This inconvenienced customers and created extra work for utility staff. After 18
        months they were all removed, and replaced with more of the frost-sensitive type. Mounting the meter units inside
        a robust plastic container below ground has reduced their vulnerability to low temperatures.

        Although the managing director believes that prepaid meters help improve revenue collection, and that customers
        really want prepaid meters because they feel in control and can manage their consumption in line with what they
        pay upfront, there are also concerns in senior management that prepaid meters remain unreliable and require high
        maintenance, particularly in winter.

  The most common problems were software errors, valve faults, and low battery power. Two thirds of call-outs
  required replacement of parts; of those, 63 percent involved the valve—a seal, a diaphragm, or the entire
  latch valve. Replacement of the parts shown in the graph cost the city just less than US$30,000. Per meter,
  this averages nearly 10 percent per year of the US$550 purchase price of each standpipe device. In addition,
  Windhoek replaces the batteries proactively every 18 months, and more frequently where individual batteries fail
  before this. Each battery costs about US$42. In areas of dense settlement and intensive use, batteries may fail
  after as little as three months.

   BOX 14: REGULAR MONITORING IS ESSENTIAL TO MINIMIZE NONREVENUE WATER


   In 2012, Mogale City municipality commissioned a performance audit of 10,000 prepaid meters—nearly a third
   of the total—after adverse comments by the Auditor General about high NRW figures in its annual financial
   statements. The results were sobering. Eight years after installation, more than 90 percent of the meters were
   found to be faulty. The vast majority was delivering free water, either because the valves were jammed open, or
   because customers had bypassed or tampered with them. These findings prompted a far-reaching change in
   strategy, with a new emphasis on regular monitoring and swift follow-up on exceptions.




   Tampering (left) and bypassing (right) have fallen sharply in Mogale City since the municipality appointed a service
   provider to do regular visual monitoring, meter reading, and exception reporting.

        replacing aging prepaid meters in a 1,026-unit installation at an upmarket housing estate. It quadrupled sales in
        the first month with the new meters, and sales now average more than three times what they were because of
        regular visual monitoring and firm action against those who bypass or tamper with their meters.

        This approach was then scaled up to cover 4,600 units. A new expanded contract will serve 39,000 meters,
        with a drive-by automatic meter reading component. Some visual inspection will be retained to remind
        customers that bypassing and tampering will be noted.

        BOX 16: STANDARD TRANSFER SYSTEM: A GAME CHANGER FOR PREPAID WATER?


        South Africa’s national electricity supplier, Eskom, led the development of prepaid electricity, and was large
        enough to require meter manufacturers to conform to common standards and design protocols. Proprietary
        hardware and software benefits its suppliers by locking customers into exclusive products. Eskom turned this
        around, and from 1993 required the suppliers of prepayment systems to design for compatibility.

        The initial focus was on developing security and encryption capabilities for numerical prepayment credit tokens,
        so that third parties, such as supermarkets, could sell prepaid electricity credit on commission. This would give
        customers the convenience of a wide range of pay points for buying prepaid electricity, and allow the electricity
        service provider to stay focused on its core business. A number of specialist vending management companies
        have subsequently emerged to handle bulk credit sales and cash handling, and to provide support for a large
        number of vendors. Those third-party vendors sell prepaid electricity primarily to increase foot traffic to their own
        businesses, in return for a small commission of about 3 percent.

        This encryption standard was called the Standard Transfer System (STS). The specifications were subsequently
        expanded to define the requirements for interoperability, allowing service providers to mix and match compatible
        components from different suppliers. This had the effect of spurring competition in addition to price and quality
        improvements in prepaid electricity metering.

        In 2007, STS was adopted by the Geneva-based International Electrotechnical Commission as the international
        specification for vending and credit token encryption for prepaid service providers, and now straddles electricity,
        water, and gas. It is used in 84 countries with about 130 suppliers certified as compliant. The latest specification,
        released in May 2014, is contained in IEC 62055-41 and is available on the Internet.

        More and more water service providers are asking for STS compliance,
        and suppliers are under pressure to offer compliant meters. By mid-2014,
        three manufacturers serving the water sector have been certified as STS
        compliant, and this number is expected to rise rapidly. This signals the
        start of a big shake-up in the prepaid water market.

        Key benefits of STS compliance include:
        • Compatibility. The common specification allows service providers to
          mix and match components, and opens the way for greater competition
          around price and quality.
        • A common vending platform. A common platform allows the service
          provider to share the cost of providing vending infrastructure with others
          already in the market. A water service provider will be able to sell prepaid
          water credit from the same places and devices that sell prepaid electricity
          and even mobile phone “air time.” The comparatively high cost of proprietary
          vending devices has been a key constraint on providing more vending sites.

        BOX 17: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER SAFEGUARDS IN MZUZU, MALAWI


        In Mzuzu, Northern Malawi, the Northern Region Water Board (NRWB) is introducing prepaid meters in low- and
        medium-density settlements, and for institutional and some commercial customers. It is not targeting high-
        density settlements or areas served by standpipes, because the costs of installation exceed the likely income and
        because it wants to avoid any possible hardship to low-income families.

        NRWB’s approach was informed by close interaction from 2008 with service providers using prepaid meters in
        Lesotho, Uganda, Zambia, and South Africa. As part of its due diligence, the company seconded three members
        of staff to work in two utilities to learn more about the practical management of prepayment. Among others, its
        application of two lessons from these exchanges seems particularly pertinent. The first lesson concerned the
        importance of not imposing prepayment, but rather engaging with customers through letters, house visits, and
        public meetings, and offering prepayment as a choice. Another lesson was the need for safeguards to minimize
        inconvenience or hardship. Implementation began in early 2013.

        In Mzuzu, prepaying customers can avoid running out of water afterhours or on weekends when credit top-up
        facilities are closed by accessing a programmed reserve. Their prepaid meter stores a certain number of
        purchased units (usually 3 m3) in reserve, where they remain available for use when the regular credit runs out.
        Customers can activate this reserve at any time and access enough water to supply them for a few days while
        they make arrangements to buy more credit.

        If this reserve is exhausted, there is an emergency “fire mode.” If activated, customers can access an emergency
        supply even when there is no remaining credit. This “overdraft” is paid off the next time the customer buys credit.
        NRWB says there have been cases where this emergency credit has been accessed in cases of hardship, and
        where it has waived payment or made special arrangements for the amount to be paid off over time.

        NRWB is open to negotiation in special cases, and has supplied water on credit to both domestic and institutional
        customers, where the customer negotiates payment by an agreed date. This has proved important for some
        institutional customers as it provides an uninterrupted supply for when the available credit is exhausted, before the
        next round of monthly funding by Treasury.

   BOX 18: “FREE-PAY” METERING IN MOGALE CITY, SOUTH AFRICA


   Mogale City provides the first 6 m3 of water monthly to all its domestic customers for free. The free basic
   allocation is allocated automatically on the first day of each month, and prepaid meters in that municipality are
   programmed to treat the first 6 m3 as the first increment of a rising block tariff, with the tariff set at zero. Analysis
   of consumption data from a sample of 4,500 prepaid customers in Mogale City shows that roughly half of those
   living in Kagiso, a low-income township, are able to keep their consumption within the 6 m3 threshold, and pay
   nothing at all for their water. Municipal billing data shows that average consumption of postpaid customers in

   BOX 19: NOTES ON THE FINANCIAL MODEL


   This financial model’s analysis is based on the costs of a generic fictitious service provider. It uses realistic generic
   data on costs, tariffs, and consumption for different categories of customers. Its purpose is to assess the financial
   consequences of using an expensive technology to sell different volumes of water at low water tariffs. It places no
   economic value on the preference that customers expressed for prepaid meters in household surveys and focus
   groups. Nor does it account for the economic cost of local water vendors’ earnings being “exported” to foreign
   manufacturers.

   Using a simple regulatory accounting approach, the model considers capital and operating expenditures, likely
   capital maintenance expenditures and a notional cost of capital. This approach has the same components as
   present value or internal rate of return analysis, but constructs the model in a way that is more comparable to
   consumer and service provider expenditures and accounting patterns. It looks at the costs incurred by consumers
   through different approaches as well as by the service provider, both for household prepaid meters and through
   stand posts.

   The model uses averages. The model is indicative, populated with information that reflects averages of
   information from service providers during the fieldwork stage. The purpose has been to gain insights into likely
   overall costs and financial benefits, rather than assess the impact on a specific service provider based on any
   specific manufacturer’s costs. It allows for an average mix of 6,000 household and 300 stand pipe prepaid
   meters, which offers economies of scale in management, software, and maintenance support. Prepaid systems
   are presumed to deliver 100 percent bill collection efficiency compared to 80 percent for postpaid meters. The
   model allows for cash flow benefits from earlier tariff payments and reduced supply-side leakage, reported when
   consumers monitor flow more carefully.

   It was not possible to determine any indicative costs of reconfiguring service provider billing, banking, and
   accounting procedures to make best use of electronic prepaid billing systems. An overly generous assumption of
   zero cost was used for this.

   The model tests different sensitivities. The sensitivity of the indicative results has been investigated by
   considering “best evidence” assumptions for the stand post service, bracketed by “challenging” or “optimistic”
   assumptions for consumption, meter cost, and meter life. Costs and consumption for individual domestic prepaid
   meter connections were investigated, using a range of consumption levels linked to broad income. Costs and
   volumes typical for large institutional/commercial customers were also modelled. These findings were compared
   with conventional metering approaches, using an assumption of 25 percent NRW and 80 percent bill collection
   efficiencies.

   BOX 20: PREPAYMENT FOR INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS CONSUMING LARGE VOLUMES HELPS MANAGE
   DEMAND AND RISK, AND IS COST-EFFECTIVE


   Large institutional consumers (police and army barracks, prisons, hospitals, schools, and government housing
   estates) are often the biggest payment defaulters, and erratic payments and bad debt affect service provider cash
   flows profoundly. Ministries of Finance routinely allocate funds for water to each ministry, department, or entity,
   but the funds are often diverted to other purposes. The ministry then allocates additional funds to settle some
   portion of the bill, while arrears continue to mount.

   With the backing of their respective finance ministries, from 2013 service providers in Malawi, Uganda, and
   Zambia began introducing prepayment for institutional customers. In Zambia, installation of prepaid meters began
   at the president’s residence.

   Prepayment provides institutional customers with a strong incentive to manage consumption better and fix leaks,
   and offers the service provider smoother cash flows without the risk of bad debt. The combination of high-volume
   consumption, low transaction costs relative to purchases, and tariffs that are more likely to be cost-reflective,
   yields attractive revenue flows. Improved income through prepayment for large volume customers can help
   fund service improvements and subsidies in low-income areas, including, potentially, subsidies for low-income
   households using prepaid technologies.

   Implementation has raised a number of unanticipated challenges. In Lusaka, for example, low water pressure
   initially compromised the performance of some prepaid meters, but once those leaks were repaired,
   consumption at some sites fell by two thirds; this, in turn, increased network pressure and resulted in a higher
   network leakage ratio.

   Long-term neglect of maintenance at many sites has given rise to extensive internal leaks, such that even large
   purchases of prepaid credit can be exhausted within days. This problem is particularly evident at army and
   police barracks, college residences, and apartment blocks, and flags unresolved questions about where exactly
   responsibility lies for the cost of repairs.

   Prepayment for schools and prisons is particularly controversial if it jeopardizes the continuity of water supply. At
   issue is that those who suffer the consequences of cut-offs are seldom those responsible for payment. Service
   providers in Lusaka and Mzuzu now make provision for special short-term credit advances for large prepaid
   customers, including schools, to safeguard continuity of supply.

        BOX 21: WHY ARE SERVICE PROVIDERS PURSUING PREPAYMENT IF RETURNS ARE LIMITED AND COSTS HIGH?


        A combination of hope and optimism, and a cost-benefit assessment that goes beyond finance—rather than
        robust examination of key cost, service, and performance indicators—seems to drive service providers in
        pursuing prepayment. “We believe there are more benefits than disadvantages,” said one utility head. “If we don’t
        take this bold leap, nothing is going to change. With prepaid meters, there is a prospect of getting into an upward
        performance spiral.”

        The costs and benefits are not viewed as purely financial. All service providers analyzed said they had
        underestimated what prepayment would take, and all acknowledge that it is expensive. Most appeared committed
        to making their prepayment systems work, because they believed it was in the best interests of customers,
        directly and indirectly, and because their customers demanded it. When discussing the human rights dimensions
        of prepaid metering, one utility CEO said, “Which is the worse evil—to allow the utility to collapse, or to enable it
        to survive and meet the challenges?”

        Co-funding softens the impact of high costs. Kampala, Windhoek, and Mogale City received significant
        external contributions for capital investment, and Mogale City receives significant operating subsidies from
        national government. This reduces the costs they must recover directly through prepayment.

        Phased implementation means that costs are staggered over time and ease the squeeze. Among the eight
        services providers reviewed here, three phases of engagement with prepaid metering are evident:
        • Start-up. Lusaka, Kampala, and Maputo began small-scale pilots in 2007–2008, and Lusaka and Kampala
          are scaling up. Maputo’s utility is in no rush to follow them, as it has been disappointed in the performance of its
          meters and has other funding priorities.
        • Scale-up. Nairobi and Nakuru are much more recent adopters, and both are keen to scale up prepaid
          standpipes, but not prepaid individual connections.
        • Consolidation. Only three—Windhoek, Mogale City and Maseru‘s WASCO—can be said to be in a
          consolidation phase after a decade of experience. WASCO is ambivalent about continuing with prepayment.
          Instead it is exploring a demand management device that limits flow within a preset cap, and has the option of
          prepayment as an add-on module. Windhoek and Mogale City service providers view prepayment as their best
          available option for providing services that poor households can afford, and for optimizing collection.

        Revenue from prepayment is often a relatively small component of overall income. Apart from Mogale City,
        revenue collected through prepayment is still a small proportion of overall income among the cases studied,
        and the extent of under-recovery from low-volume customers might not be apparent. Conversely, prepayment
        for institutional customers was introduced in 2013 in Lusaka and Mzuzu, and in 2014 in Kampala. This takes
        prepayment in a new direction, with conspicuous revenue benefits, provided that the necessary political support
        can be mobilized.

        In Kampala’s case, improved collection from high-volume institutional customers will offset poor cost-recovery
        from prepaid standpipes. National Water’s managers say they know prepaid standpipes are not cost-effective in
        financial terms, but they believe they offer an important vehicle for providing more equitable services to the urban
        poor, and have the means to recover any shortfall elsewhere.

     5.4 Summary
     The core message of the financial analysis is that prepaid
     metering on its own cannot resolve a service provider’s
     financial woes. It may even make things worse, at least in
     the short to medium term. It may help improve revenue
     and also meet customers’ needs for all the reasons discussed
     earlier, but it should not be viewed automatically as a
     cost-effective way to resolve high billing and collection
     inefficiencies except for large volume customers.                                      After watching revenue drop by 50 percent, many

        BOX 22: LESSONS FROM SETTING STANDARDS FOR SOLAR LIGHTING
        There are currently no standards covering the overall performance or reliability of prepaid water meters. Existing
        national and international standards for prepaid meters focus primarily on metrology (the accuracy of metering)
        and STS (the credit transfer protocols that support compatibility across different suppliers of vending and prepaid
        metering components).

        The experience of developing and incentivizing standards for solar lighting components may be relevant for
        prepaid meters. Lighting Africa, a joint initiative of the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC)
        and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has been working since 2007 to improve access
        to affordable solar lighting products for home users in sub-Saharan Africa, by accelerating the development of
        markets for good quality products.

        The Lighting Africa team found that the influx into Africa of poor quality lighting products represented a key
        market threat that risked eroding confidence among consumers. In response, they worked closely with suppliers,
        stakeholder institutions, and sector industries to formulate standards for solar lighting products and provide
        incentives to manufacturers to meet minimum specifications.

        The resulting minimum quality standards served as the foundation for the global International Electro-technical
        Commission (IEC) technical specification. The quality standards set a baseline level of quality, durability, and truth-
        in-advertising to protect consumers. Suppliers wanting to participate in Lighting Global support programs and
        their incentive schemes must comply as a minimum requirement.

        Conformance is evaluated based on results from laboratory testing at an approved third-party test center using
        randomly procured samples. The certificate is valid for two years. Lighting Africa reports that the certification
        process is driving competition. Suppliers now try to maintain their competitive edge by exceeding the minimum
        requirements while keeping prices competitive. The Ethiopian Government was one of the first to use the standard
        to differentiate between different quality products, and it introduced a waiver on import duties for products that
        conformed to the specifications.

        Although dealing with a different innovation, service providers and regulators in the water sector with an interest
        in prepaid water meters could apply some of the lessons from this initiative. They could, for example, consider
        forming a working group to formulate which specifications they want their prepaid meters to conform to, to meet
        minimum quality and performance requirements. As such an initiative grows, it could become a platform for
        knowledge exchange and dialogue with suppliers generally, but also broaden to include other partners, such as
        financiers, strengthening their reach and impact to address the current absence of clear quality standards and
        benchmarks.

     essentially experimental. As Box 23 highlights, there is                          seriously in water sector policies and regulatory frameworks.



        BOX 23: AGENDA FOR FURTHER WORK ON PREPAID SYSTEMS
        The emergence of prepaid options has opened a new set of opportunities (as well as risks) for water service
        providers. In moving forward, service providers may benefit from applied information, guidance, and advice on a
        series of issues.

        Develop standards for prepaid systems and incentivize compliance. The performance reliability issues pose
        one of the greatest challenges to the relevance of prepaid water systems. National standards authorities should
        be core participants in any dialogue and should ensure that standards are appropriate in each local context.
        This could be strengthened at global level with the support of development partners and potential investors, and
        should aim to engage suppliers of prepaid devices.

        As demonstrated in the brief dialogues that informed the development of this study, there is a considerable
        appetite among service providers for knowledge exchange and joint efforts to understand and discuss issues,
        options, and practices.

        Develop indicative frameworks for deciding whether to use prepaid systems. The decision-support tool
        presented in Appendix B is indicative of the kind of questions to ask and the decisions that may be required.
        Answering each question adequately requires considerable analysis, based on credible data, relevant to each
        situation.

        Improve the financial assessment of prepaid options. Cost-benefit assessments prior to the introduction of
        prepaid systems are often inadequately robust even though the high costs of prepaid devices pose one of the
        greatest risks associated with their deployment. Service providers will benefit greatly from more robust cost
        modelling and business planning methods and enhanced skills to undertake assessments.

        Develop more robust economic analyses. Related to the financial assessment is a need for more in-depth
        assessment of the economic costs and benefits of prepaid water. This fell outside the scope of this particular
        study, but as governments and service providers consider their options in the future, an important area for due
        diligence will be stronger economic analysis that assesses prepaid water in a wider societal context.

        Develop tools and capacity support for monitoring and managing the performance of prepaid services.
        All the service providers consulted say that they underestimated what managing a prepayment system entailed.
        There seems to be a need for particular assistance in conceptualizing and deploying performance management
        systems. Generic guides and toolkits have marked limitations; context-specific practical master classes and direct
        technical assistance may prove more useful.
