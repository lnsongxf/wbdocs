Global Call for Evidence-Based Capacity Development
The past decade has witnessed a strong, steady and increasingly unified global call to action
to improve the results of capacity development. Consensus is emerging around key principles of
country-led capacity development and its importance in enhancing development effectiveness at
every level. A series of high-profile, global-level consultations1 have been convened to focus on how
to translate the urgency that countries and organizations feel about capacity development into
concerted, deliberate actions to grow endogenous, country-led capacity of all development
stakeholders. These consultations contributed to the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness
in Busan, November 2011, with a view to further elevating the importance of evidence-based
capacity development.

In Africa, efforts for continent-wide, country-led capacity development are being led by regional
institutions such as the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) and the New Partnership for
Africa’s Development (NEPAD). This shift is also reflected in recent major developments at the
World Bank. Capacity development is a key cross-cutting theme of the World Bank Strategy for
Africa, in which knowledge capture and sharing is a major instrument to support capacity
development and strengthening public sector capacity is a foundation that underpins the whole
strategy. In addition, strengthening institutional capacity is the focus of Program-for-Results, the
World Bank’s newest lending instrument. Furthermore, the World Bank Institute (WBI) has
adopted a catalytic approach to capacity development, which supports government and non-
government actors to bring about change by helping them to connect to global knowledge, mobilize
for collaborative action and access innovative development solutions.

In the spirit of these calls to action on capacity development, WBI and ACBF organized a
structured dialogue among key African government and civil society leaders in April 2012,
as part of the World Bank Spring Meetings.2 African leaders shared their perceptions, wisdom
and insights based on their reading of the pulse of African stakeholder groups and development
actors in regard to capacity development in Africa. The event also involved the attendance of
country delegates at the Spring Meetings. Both panel and audience policymakers and practitioners
took stock of the current juncture of capacity development efforts and policies throughout Africa as
perceived through the experiential lens of civil society and government actors. Some of the thought-
provoking ideas, positions and insights discussed at the event follow.

 Several high-level consultations have been organized around capacity development. The Bogota High Level Event on South-South Cooperation
and Capacity Development (2010) and the Cairo Workshop on Capacity Development (March 2011) being among the most prominent ones that
produced strong consensus among attendees to strategize on global action to keep capacity development in the forefront of the development
agenda.

 The dialogue was held April 19, 2012 at WBI. Panelists were Ms. Bineta Diop, Executive Director of Femmes Africa Solidarite, Ms. Engwase
Mwale, Executive Director, NGO Coordinating Council of Zambia, Mr. John Rwangombwa, Minister of Finance of Rwanda, and Mr. Kerfalla
Yansane, Minister of Finance of Guinea. Dr. Sanjay Pradhan, Vice President of WBI, and Dr. Frannie Leautier, ACBF Executive Secretary, hosted
the event and Dr. Shantayan Devarajan, Chief Economist of the Africa Region of the World Bank moderated. Event attendees in Washington
and globally via the Internet included delegations to the World Bank Spring Meetings, staff from across the Bank Group and external
development professionals.
Dialogue to Assess Africa’s Capacity Development Needs and Experience
Whose capacity? The event was structured to generate a
discussion of Africa’s capacity needs, challenges and
gains along demand and supply lines. State actors are
typically considered to represent the supply side capacity,
and civil society and citizenry the demand side capacity
related to public sector performance in economic
management and service delivery. The capacity needs of
African governments are great in regard to service delivery,
policymaking and maintaining law and order, among other
basic governance tasks. For example, many African                      Mr. Kerfalla Yansane,
governments face a critical shortage in a suite of skills (such        Minister of Finance, Guinea

of these contractual needs most governments rely on buying             with this kind of investment? This

opportunity cost in terms of not growing this type of
expertise endogenously.

Furthermore, African governments face capacity deficits in almost all sectors in regard to technical,
management and policymaking capacity. Some innovative approaches to addressing capacity
deficits include the Rwandan government’s systematic use of a skills audit to assess the nature of
these capacity gaps. In addition, many African governments have liaised with the Diaspora to enlist
highly-skilled people to return to their countries of origin, but the success of these efforts has been
mixed. African governments, like their counterparts around the world, are also increasingly
partnering with non-governmental groups to accomplish tasks that were once considered strictly a
role for the state but are being shared among the government, non-governmental organization
(NGO) and private sectors.

As these demarcations of public and private activity blurs, demand for new types of capacity within
the public sector has emerged. State actors who traditionally represent the supply side of capacity
for service delivery also need capacity, to relate, collaborate and partner with non-state actors who
traditionally represent the demand side of capacity for service delivery to provide a better life for
citizens. Thus, a seamless loop of demand and supply is formed that represents on the one hand the
demarcation of traditional functions of state and non-state actors, but on the emerging periphery,
expands to form areas of collaborative action and call for capacity to undertake such action.

On the demand side are the non-state actors—NGOs, civil society, academia, think tanks and
various types of citizen action groups—who must keep the pressure on the government to
deliver services and provide an enabling environment for citizens to thrive and prosper. Civil
society and non-governmental groups in Africa are proliferating, strengthening and coming of age
as legitimate partners with government and private sector actors in the economy and society at
large. The capacity needs of non-governmental actors include advocacy, organizing, analyzing
government policy and engaging the government to get what the people seek by way of services,
policies, etc. In Senegal, women’s organizations have successfully monitored elections with cell
phones and contributed significantly to restoring stability during turbulent political times.

                                       agencies have failed and provided a range of basic services. In

                                       sectors and some have recently marked anniversaries of more
                                       than 20 years in active public service. Governments, donors
                                       and development partners across Africa now acknowledge,
                                       rely on and partner with CSOs and this trend is expected to
                                       expand for a long time to come. This creates demand among

Emerging Need for Evidence-Based Collaborative
Approaches in Capacity Development
As noted, the traditional supply and demand role
demarcation of state and non-state actors is increasingly
blurred by the changing nature and functions of the
public sector. Two important findings emerge from this and
other dialogues with capacity practitioners globally. First, the
old conceptual axis of demand and supply corresponding
neatly to citizen groups on the demand side and the
government representing the supply side as the provider of           Mr. John Rwangombwa
services is less relevant today as government is no longer the       Minister of Finance and
sole and exclusive supplier of public services anymore. This         Economic Planning, Rwanda

matrix represents the emerging roles of state and non-state actors wherein they seek partnership
and collective action rather than conflict and confrontation to achieve development results.

Panelists noted the emerging roles of NGOs that are increasingly engaged in service delivery—
either through participatory processes and monitoring of state delivery, or direct delivery due to
state failure or in partnership with a state agency. This implies a new and emerging aspect of state
capacity, one in which state actors engage with those that traditionally represented demand as in
civil society and citizenry. The left-hand side represents the range of collaborative behaviors and
actions including coordination and partnership with other agencies and groups, capacity to form
successful coalitions and networks and capacity to build and sustain consensus among disparate
groups and teams. It also points to better assessment by the state of needs of citizens, especially
those groups and communities that have historically been excluded, as well as those who cannot
represent themselves, such as children. The panelists noted that African governments are
transitioning from controlled and sometimes closed societies to more democratic societies, and
thus many governments are learning about their capacity to relate to and manage those that
represent demand in any sector.

Emerging Role for African Knowledge and Capacity Practitioners
                                         Organizations such as ACBF are catering to the capacity
                                         needs of African governments, particularly in terms of
                                         the more traditional technical capacity deficits in regard
                                         to service delivery, policymaking, etc. A key focus of
                                         ACBF’s work has been the development of knowledge
                                         institutions across Africa, supporting the generation, sharing

                                       Increasingly, knowledge and capacity development actors
must address the blurring of state and non-state roles and focus more on how to enable state and
non-state actors to coordinate, collaborate and engage on a range of issues and sectors. This
requires new data sets, new baselines, a different kind of analytics and a vastly different content for
capacity acquisition and implementation. African knowledge actors will also need to gear up to
encourage, incubate and scale up innovation that facilitates the development process. The
discussion highlighted the need for South-South collaboration to better understand and deal with
capacity issues among Sub-Saharan African nations as well as with other developing countries. A
suggestion was made to share knowledge and approaches as well as trading skills among African
countries to fully use and retain the talent in the continent. For example, Rwanda could share its
experience on the skills audit across the continent, and managed transfers of expertise could occur
wherever complementary talent assets can be traded in a mutually beneficial manner.



Collaborative Capacity Needed to Strengthen Fragile Societies
Conflict and fragility severely compound the task of capacity development. Tackling political
and ethnic and social fragility in post-conflict societies taxes the already low core capacity of
governments to meet the basic needs of its people. Managing conflict requires coordination and
collaboration between the government and CSOs and an engaged citizenry. Panelists observed the
growing importance of developing collaborative capacity—the ability to work in teams across

agencies and organizations, the skill in forming effective coalitions and the expertise in leveraging
networks and communities of practice to achieve development goals. For countries that are
relatively stable in terms of the political environment, governments are facing sometimes severe
skill shortages both in terms of building and also retaining capacity in the country.



Capacity Needed to Leverage Citizen Power with Technology
People, ordinary citizens, matter—now more than ever—in African economies to enable
governments and private companies to be accountable to taxpayers and consumers. The
discussion focused on the increasing relevance of individual and collective action of ordinary
citizens as consumers of basic, public, private and commercial goods and services. Most African
countries are seeking to deviate from the old norms of paternalism, factionalism and proxy
participation of its citizenry. Increasingly, African citizens are engaging in the public process at
local, municipal, state and national levels, sometimes as elected representatives but more often as
concerned and engaged citizenry. This type of citizen engagement is at the heart of democratic and
robust, growth-oriented economies.

In the private sector, the drive for improved capacity is linked to the bottom line of higher profits
and not surprisingly is addressed and achieved. However, in the public sector, this core incentive
must be surrogated by engaged citizen action and a consistent demand for accountability. Thus,
partnerships and coalitions—coordinated collective action among citizens and CSOs, NGOs, labor
and research communities—are critical to capacity enhancement in Africa. Information and
communications technology (ICT), in particular the widespread availability of mobile telephony in
Africa, provides the potential means to dramatically expand and support a change in the nature of
citizen engagement. The emergence of empowered citizenry has transformed the capacity equation
in countries globally as citizens are no longer mere recipients of services but active and engaged
development actors. Therefore, the role that state and non-state actors play in engaging citizens
through media, ICT to a large extent determines the development outcome. More state and non-
state actors are seizing the opportunity to leverage citizen power in various public and
governmental processes (budgets, services oversight, project implementation, procurement, among
others) for improved development outcomes.



Frontier of Capacity Development is Ability to Take Collaborative Action
Trade-offs in capacity development as a result of hard choices can sometimes be alleviated
by building collaborative capacity. The panelists referred to some of these draconian choices that
African societies face: building capacity in the public or non-governmental sector, prioritizing
education of girls or boys, investing in long term capacity development or buying expertise to meet
immediate contractual needs, among others. Some of these—such as the need for immediate
capacity to negotiate mineral and oil contracts—have to be met by buying expertise from the
private sector and often from overseas since the cost of waiting for local capacity to develop is too
high. But in some other instances, sharp choices may be reconcilable through collaborative action.
For instance, instead of duplicating skills in government agencies and NGOs, a more strategic
allocation of capacity resources across public and non-governmental sectors can yield optimal
benefits if roles and functions are shared and clarified, and more development actors including
citizens are engaged in the planning, delivery and monitoring of services.

The question to ask is whether government agencies need the comprehensive skills to do
everything, or could skills and knowledge development be invested in both the government and

                                                                                                        6
NGO sectors strategically to encourage and enable collaborative action. Thus, rethinking capacity
development increasingly involves creation of shared roles, commitments and abilities across
government and non-government sectors to repurpose all public service delivery as shared value
creation. This naturally shifts the demarcation of those that demand and those that supply to a
more shared collaborative space in which all actors are both consumers and producers of capacity
based on the unique advantages of each and for the shared benefit of all.
