                                     Executive Summary
    We construct a dataset of violent conflict “remission” episodes (i.e. countries that
    were once in violent conflict and have a prolonged non-violent period) and examine
    the macroeconomic patterns for these countries in the period prior to and following
    the most recent case of violent conflict. We find:

    •   The period preceding violent conflict resembles the onset of an economic crisis,
        particularly with respect to inflation and external developments.
    •   But the pattern of recovery is different from an economic crisis: whereas a policy-
        or shock-induced downturn can be followed by a rapid recovery once financing
        flows are restored, even sustained remission countries see a very rapid
        deceleration in GDP growth, with the post-conflict growth boom often lasting as
        little as one year.
    •   However, although remission growth declines quickly, it declines to a “normal”
        level more typical of non-conflict countries. Growth is not negative, and tends to
        stay above 2 percent a year per capita (the long-run average growth rate for all
        countries estimated by Pritchett and Summers).
    •   The implication is that remission countries are “catching up” to the level GDP
        path of non-conflict countries, but slowly – done through modestly above-average
        growth for a sustained period rather than a long-lasting post-conflict boom.
    •   Inflation declines measurably, as stability of nominal variables is regained.
    •   There is a slight rise in education and health spending as a share of GDP, but
        similar to the growth pattern discussed above, this happens on a slow-moving
        basis rather than rapid change in priorities; spending on military does decline
        more sharply (2-3 percent of GDP), but the associated “peace dividend” is
        spread across various sectors, especially as there are no major revenue gains
        (as a share of GDP).
    •   The terms of trade tend to improve; this is not under the control of the country,
        but associated with a more enabling external environment for recovery.
    •   Investment as a share of GDP rises, but in a very back-loaded fashion – this is
        consistent with the absence of a prolonged post-conflict boom.
    •   Consumption as a share of GDP declines, presumably associated with slow
        reduction in aid dependence and return of domestic productive sectors which is
        associated with more investment and exports.

•   Interest payments as a share of GDP are strikingly stable – indicating a link
    between avoidance of increased debt burden and remission of conflict.
•   Compensation of public employees, stable at around 7 percent of GDP or under.
•   The fiscal balance does not decline – consistent with the findings that revenue
    doesn’t increase, military spending declines, and spending in social sectors
    increases.
This leads to the tentative conclusion that the post-conflict prevention challenge is
not about sustaining a boom, but instead preventing a collapse in growth once the
initial burst of activity is exhausted. What does help generate some “economic”
space that can be used for prevention is reduced military spending, and aid to
underpin consumption in the initial phases and help avoid rapid accumulation of
debt. Keeping the public sector payroll under control is also important. For low
income countries, HIPC debt relief was also an important source of fiscal space in
post-conflict periods (IMF 2015).
The key policy implication is that the prevention approach to economic policy design
for FCV countries calls for (1) design of “slow and steady” policy adjustments
towards sustainability which (2) get a head-start on potential crisis through earlier
interventions than is normally the case, and (3) if acceleration in adjustment is
needed, will require substantial financing to smooth the negative impact.

    Joint WB-UN Report on Prevention of Violent Conflict: Macroeconomic Factors

      I.      Introduction
A premise of this report is that many societies are prone to conflict in the form of various
social and economic tensions which take the form of group-based societal dynamics. The
focus of the report is thus not on conflict per se, but the mechanisms which influence
whether or not conflict escalates to violence. In general, the occurrence of violence
indicates an inability to mediate group-based tensions, and a vast literature exists on the
factors which result in a resort to violence (e.g. WDR 2011). This chapter looks at one
subset of these channels, namely the macroeconomic outcomes and economic policy
environment associated with this potential escalation phase. It is important to emphasize
that there is no presumption about macroeconomic causality of violent conflict in this
approach; rather the focus is on how the macroeconomic environment may enhance our
understanding of conflict risks.
Ultimately our interest is in prevention of violent conflict, or more precisely mitigating the
risk of escalation. The clearest category of countries susceptible to risk of escalation is
countries that once experienced violent conflict and then had a sustained spell without
such conflict (“remission”). This suggests one informative framing of prevention of
violent conflict as prevention of relapse. An empirical approach corresponding to this
framing is to examine the macroeconomic trajectories of violent conflict episodes where
such conflict was followed by a sustained period of remission. Remission here is simply
an empirical event, of violence below a threshold, and it could vary widely in its
character, including as negative peace. This chapter therefore presents, in a non-
technical manner (charts rather regressions), macroeconomic developments for a
particular sample of countries which are potentially informative because of their
remission behavior.

Methodology
In common with many conflict researchers, the investigation starts with the UCDP/PRIO
Armed Conflict Dataset (Gleditsch et al., 2002), hereafter referred to as the dataset, in
which each row, which corresponds to a year, is hereafter referred to as an
observation.2 As such, a missing year in the dataset is referred to as a non-observation.
The objective of this section is to elucidate criteria that can identify the conflict years
from the sequence of observations for the purpose of our study.

We begin by setting out filter criteria for the observations, including only the following
types of conflict in the dataset:

          Internal armed conflict occurring between the government of a state and one or
           more internal opposition group(s) without intervention from other states.

                                                                                             3
                Internationalized internal armed conflict occurring between the government of a
                 state and one or more internal opposition group(s) with intervention from other
                 states (secondary parties) on one or both sides.3
We then sort the observations based in the following hierarchy: Region  Location
Year Conflict ID. That is, we first sort out the regions (i.e. in increasing order of the
unique numerical code assigned to each region). This bundles all observations of a
region together. Within each region, we sort out the location (countries), bundling
together all observations for a single country. Within each location we sorted the year,
and then the conflict ID.
We proceed to construct a conflict dummy variable, D, in which we assign each
remaining observation a 0 to identify it as a non-conflict year or a 1 as a conflict year. To
identify conflict years, we consider the intensity level, for which the dataset offers two
options:
                Option 1: Minor: between 25 and 999 battle-related deaths in a given year.
                Option 2: War: at least 1,000 battle-related deaths in a given year.
Option 2 is of most interest, therefore we assign D=1 to all observations with option 2.
However, (i) not all years of the same conflict might be intense enough to qualify as a
war (i.e. option 1 level of intensity for some observations); or (ii) the conflict might even
briefly experience non-intense years, precluding those years from the dataset altogether
(non-observations). To account for these cases we do the following: in a specific
location (country), for any specific Side B party that has option 2 level of intensity in at
least one observation, we assign D=1
                for all observations for that Side B in that location.
                for the few non-observations within a sequence of observations involving the
                 above-specified Side B party, such that the last observation preceding the non-
                 observations does not indicate an end to the conflict (EpEnd is not 1).4
    Box 1: Special Adjustments
           i.      Ex-Yugoslav republics—Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina                          and     Serbia—are
                   assigned conflict status for years 1991-95.
           ii.     For Iraq, KDP disappears as a Side B in the conflict after 1991 without
                   EpEnd=1. Hence, we stop considering KDP conflicts as relevant to our
                   selectivity methodology after 1991.
       iii.        We assign conflict status to Lebanon for all years from 1975-1990.



3
  We exclude two types of conflict: (i) extra-systemic armed conflict occurring between a state and a non-state
group outside its own territory. These conflicts are by definition territorial, since the government side is fighting to
retain control of a territory outside the state system; and (ii) interstate armed conflict occurring between two or
more states.
4
  In the dataset, each observation is assigned an EpEnd equal to 1 (0) if it is (not) the last year of conflict activity
involving a particular Side B party.

                                                                                                                       4
      iv.   For Myanmar, from 1984, we only consider Side B conflicts CPB, KIO, KNU
            and God’s Army in our methodology since all other Side Bs disappear.
      v.    We assign conflict status to Libya for all years from 2011-2015.


For each country, we define a conflict episode, C, as that which begins in the year
where D=1 first appears and ends in the year that precedes 8 consecutive years where
D=0. Hence, a country can have successive conflict episodes that, for our purposes, are
treated independently. The reason for this is that, when it comes to macroeconomic
drivers of conflict, the literature identifies the first 8 years following the end of a conflict
as the most relevant for whether the country reverts back into conflict or not. So, we
assume that if the 8 years pass without any such reversion, then any subsequent
conflict (D=1) would be macro-economically independent. Hence, for or our purposes, it
matters not whether such a subsequent conflict is linked via other factors (political) to
previous episodes, instead, since we are examining macroeconomic factors, this
subsequent conflict would be treated as an independent episode.
We define a conflict relapse episode as that within a conflict episode, where D=0 for
less than 8 years and more than 3 years (so as to eliminate 1,2 or 3 years of clam with
no macroeconomic implications). Hence, the conflict relapse involves a period of no-
conflict (within a conflict episode) that is not long enough to make the subsequent
breakout of hostilities macro-economically independent from the previous bout.5
To examine the evolution of a certain macroeconomic indicator leading up to C, we
consider the 5 preceding years of each C, which we term the prior period.
To examine the evolution of a certain macroeconomic indicator in the aftermath of C, we
consider the 10 proceeding years of each C, which we term the remission period.
To examine the evolution of a certain macroeconomic indicator leading up to a relapse
episode, we consider the non-conflict years preceding it.
The Prior Period
We present charts plotting each indicator (vertical axis) against a time period countdown
to the crisis (-5, -4, etc., on the horizontal axis). The value of each indicator is the
average across all crises episodes for that specific year. Since not all crises episodes
have a complete data set for all 10 years for all indicators, we plot the following varying
samples:
a. Only 5-year sample: which includes episodes with observations for all 5 prior years
b. Only 4 & 5-year sample: which includes episodes with observations for 4 or more
   prior years
c. Only 3, 4 & 5-year sample: which includes episodes with observations for 3 or more
   prior years
d. Complete set: which includes episodes with observations for 2 or more prior years

 Remission episodes: Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Greece, Moldova, Russia, Georgia, Iran, Lebanon, Tajikistan, China,
Nepal, Cambodia, Laos, Viet Nam, Indonesia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Angola, Zimbabwe,
South Africa, Morocco, Bolivia, Paraguay, Cuba, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.

                                                                                                                    5
The Post Period
We present charts plotting each indicator (vertical axis) against time period of years
after crisis (1,2, to 10, on the horizontal axis), such that the value of each indicator is the
average across all crises episodes for that specific year. Since not all crises episodes
have a complete data set for all 5 years for all indicators, we plot the following varying
samples:
a. Countries with at least first 7 years of data: which includes episodes with
   observations for the first 7 years after the crisis episode.
b. Complete set: which includes episodes with observations for 5 or more post years

Conflict Relapse
We present charts plotting each indicator (vertical axis) against a time period countdown
to the relapse episode (-7, -6, -5, -4, etc., on the horizontal axis). The value of each
indicator is the average across all relapse crises episodes for that specific year. Note,
however, that preceding non-conflict periods differ in length from one relapse episode to
another. Hence, a relapse episode preceded by 5 non-conflict years does not require
indicator values for years -7 and -6, while that preceded by 4 non-conflict years, does
not require indicator values for years -7, -6 and -5. So when averaging out the indicator
across all relapse episodes, there will be an increasing number of values as the
countdown proceeds.
For all charts:
   We remove outlier (conflict and relapse) episodes that significantly distort the
    average.
   We preclude indicators with less than 5 episodes.

II: The Pre-Conflict Period
This section illustrates a striking macroeconomic dynamic that, when set in context with
the more understood and observed vulnerabilities (e.g. institutional and political factors
as discussed in WDR 2011), can increase the likelihood of a country entering into
violent conflict mode. Specifically, a balance of payments shock amid macroeconomic
vulnerabilities can act as a stress factor for violent conflict.
Beginning with real activity (Figures 1-3), not surprisingly, this period shows signs of a
slowdown in real economic indicators, which peaked at t=-3. This possibly reflects
business cycle behavior beginning to exacerbate tensions:
     Growth in real GDP and real GDP per capita peaks in t=-3.
     Gross capital formation also reaches a peak at t=-3.

Moreover, despite slowing economic activity, price inflation (Figure 4) is elevated at

On public finance, business cycle conditions are overlaid with the context of unstable
political and security conditions:
            The tax burden rises across categories (Figures 6-9) to compensate for a decline
             in non-tax revenue (likely due to slowing economic activity), leaving total
             revenues largely unaffected.


                                                                                                                                                                                   7
 Total revenues (Figure 5) are stable for the most part despite slowing growth,
  when in more typical business cycles total revenues might decline in a recession.
  This could indicate “populist” pressure to raise public finances to fund political
  and security related measures, such as:
   Military spending (Figure 10), which is shown to be largely unvarying;
   Wages and salaries (Figure 11), where cuts in t=-3 and -2 (due to possibly
     fiscal pressures) are quickly reversed in t=-1 (possibly in an attempt to buy
     political loyalty);
   Higher interest payments (Figure 12).
 Savings are also sourced from cuts in social spending, as proxied by spending
  on health (Figure 13) and government consumption (Figure 14), both of which
  peak at t=-3, declining thereafter.
 Expanding debt results in a tighter fiscal space (Figures 16-18):
   Fiscal balance, which improve in t=-3 and -4 (likely reflecting brisk GDP
     growth), deteriorate measurably in t=-1 (Figure 15).
   Central government debt, which reach a trough in t=-3 (likely reflecting brisk
     GDP growth), also deteriorate in -2 and -1 (Figure 16).
   External debt surges, especially in t=-2 and -1, (likely to fund rising security
     and political spending) (Figure 17).

Crucially, and with the context of the above-illustrated macroeconomic stresses,
evidence suggests external balance of payments shocks (Figures 18-22):
                 A sharp deterioration in the terms of trade in t=-1;
                 Deterioration in the current account balance, especially in t=-2 and -1;

Summary Hypothesis:
The macroeconomic dynamics preceding a violent conflict episode bear similarities to
those leading to a financial crisis, with added security and political pressures: a turn in
the business cycle toward a slowdown in economic activity within the context of
macroeconomic vulnerabilities and political and security pressures that motivate official
external borrowing and rising public debt, is followed by a balance of payments shock
that quickly draws down available financing buffers and exposes to the country to a

                                                                                                                                                                                                             11
“Minsky Moment” (Eggertsson and Krugman, 2012). The outcomes during this period
resemble those associated with “Macroeconomic Populism” (Dornbusch and Edwards,
1991), in that the external sector and financing provide sharper signals of imminent
problems due to an inconsistent policy mix than real sector variables.

III: Macroeconomic Outcomes During Remission

In the previous section, we saw the buildup of macroeconomic problems prior to conflict
that resembles an economic crisis. After conflict has ended, does the economy
experience a rapid recovery as it might from a balance of payments crisis? Perhaps the
most salient result from this chapter – which is consistent with findings of other studies –
is that there is no sustained post-conflict boom even if countries successfully avoid
relapsing back into conflict. Remission countries are “catching up” to the growth path of
non-conflict countries, but slowly – done through modestly above-average growth for a
sustained period rather than a long-lasting post-conflict boom. Specifically:
    A very rapid decline in GDP growth, with the post-conflict growth boom often
     lasting as little as one year (Figures 23 and 24). However, although growth
     declines quickly, it declines to a “normal” level more typical of non -conflict
     developing countries. As a result, catch-up in levels takes a long time; Mueller et
     al (2017) find that there is a strong negative level effect on output arising from the
     intensity of conflict, which, contrary to perceptions of post-conflict booms, on
     average is not reversed by subsequent more rapid growth.
    Growth is not negative (as it would be during crisis), and tends to stay above 2
     percent a year per capita; this is the long-run average growth rate for all
     countries estimated by Pritchett and Summers (2013). The implication of this
     finding is that catch-up happens through avoidance of collapse – a feature of
     long-run growth emphasized by Broadberry and Wallis (2017) and reflected in
     the 2017 World Development Report (Governance and the Law). Loayza et al
     (2007) also highlight the harmful impact of crisis-induced macroeconomic
     volatility on development outcomes.
    An economy adapted to war is not without drivers of growth such as arms and
     illegal trade, capital inflows due to foreign financing of armed conflict, and
     informal private sector activity which might have been previously suppressed by
     a predatory state. The transition from war to non-war involves substitution of
     drivers to those of a more typical economy and this transition might not occur
     smoothly. This can help explain the sharp fall in growth from t=1 to t=2, after
     which growth recovers somewhat (possibly reflecting non-war drivers kicking in).
    Despite slowing GDP growth, gross capital formation grows gradually reaching
     brisk rates toward the end of the observed time period (Figure 25). Hence,
     investment as a share of GDP rises, but in a very back-loaded fashion – this is
     consistent with the absence of a prolonged post-conflict boom. The diverging
     dynamics between GDP growth and capital formation is due to the fact that, for

                 more gradually, reflecting a gradual shift toward a more complex economy. This
                 delayed capital accumulation means that there is a period where the cost of
                 reverting to violence is relatively low (compared to what it would be when capital
                 deepening occurs) – thus the economy will take some time to escape the
                 violence trap (Cox et al, 2015).

Inflation declines very rapidly (Figure 26), reflecting mainly stability gains in a few
conflict episodes which had seen hyperinflation in the violent phase (e.g. DRC).

While main fiscal aggregates vary little over the observed period, there is significant
shifts between revenues and expenditures subcategories.
    Deepening of revenue-generating capacity (Figures 27-32):
          During conflict periods, the central authority’s loss of revenue collecti on
           capacity and (relatedly) geographical sovereignty renders custom taxes from
           ports and airports a more significant source of revenue due to the relative
           ease of administration involving a limited and strategic geography. In the
           post-conflict period, we see non-customs taxes assuming a larger share at
           the expense of those from customs. This is related to a common dilemma for
           many post-conflict countries: customs are relatively easy to administer
           centrally in fragile situations, but over time the distortions associated with
           excessive reliance on customs necessitate a diversification in revenue
           sources.
    A rearrangement of spending priorities toward social objectives (Figures 33-38):
          There is a slight rise in education and health spending as a share of GDP, but
           similar to the growth pattern discussed above, this happens on a slow-moving
           basis rather than rapid change in priorities.
          Spending on military does decline more sharply (2-3 percent of GDP), but the
           associated “peace dividend” is spread across various sectors, especially as
           there are no major revenue gains (as a share of GDP).
          Compensation of public employees, stable at around 7 percent of GDP or
           under.
          Interest payments as a share of GDP are strikingly stable, indicating a link
           between avoidance of increased debt burden and remission of conflict.
           Identifying causality directionality would be telling: (i) lack of political and
           security tensions can alleviate additional borrowing intended to fund political
           and security measures; or (ii) less borrowing, due to better macro
           management, can lessen the chances of another policy-induced economic
           crisis.
          Government consumption falls as private sector activity grows becoming an
           increasing determinant of overall growth.

           The fiscal balance does not decline (Figures 39) – consistent with the findings
            that revenue doesn’t increase, military spending declines, and spending in social
            sectors increases.
           Central government accumulates debt during the first 5-6 years following the end
            of conflict, likely in order to fund the reconstruction effort and avoid increasing the
            tax burden despite rising expenditure needs (Figure 40).
           External debt declines sharply (Figure 41): this is an important difference with the
            pre-conflict period where external debt is built up. Again causality directionality
            would be telling: (i) lack of political and security tensions can alleviate additional
            external borrowing intended to fund political and security measures; or (ii) less
            external borrowing, due to aid inflows, helps reduce the risk of a balance of
            payments shock.

The terms of trade tend to improve (Figure 42); this is not under the control of the
country, but associated with a more enabling external environment for recovery.
Balance of payments strengthens during the first half of the observed period, only to
deteriorate during the second half, likely associated with the increased investment that
is taken place as confidence in recovery has firmed up (Figures 43-44).

Hypothesis for Remission
Locking in a remission from conflict to sustained peace is a slow process. Certain
dimensions of stability can be restored quickly (notably inflation), but there is no
prolonged growth dividend right after the conflict ends. The challenge is not sustaining a
boom, but instead preventing a collapse in growth once the initial burst of activity is
exhausted. Investment seems to take some time to respond to remission, perhaps
indicating a slow updating process for confidence in the durability of peace. What does
help generate some “economic” space is reduced spending on military, and aid to
underpin consumption in the initial phases and help avoid rapid accumulation of debt.
Keeping the public sector payroll under control is also important.

episodes—those which were able to achieve a few years (>3) of non-conflict, but failed
to sustain it beyond 7. This section reinforces findings from Section II, highlighting the
impact of a balance of payments shock during periods of structural vulnerability.
There is evidence to suggest that real activity is subject to a shock the year prior to the
re-eruption of conflict; a sharp slowdown in real GDP and real GDP per capita growth at
t=-1, resembling shock rather than cyclical behavior (Figures 45-46). This occurs during
a period of macroeconomic vulnerability as indicated by high (double digit) inflation rate
(Figure 47).

Similar to the case of the pre-conflict period, there is evidence to suggest that external
balance of payments shocks might act as a trigger to conflict:
                A sharp deterioration in the terms of trade in t=-1 (Figure 48);
                Deterioration in the current account balance, especially in t=-2 and -1 (Figure 49);
                FDI also falls sharply, especially t=-2 and -1 (Figure 50).
                Exchange rate appreciates suddenly, putting pressure on exports (Figure 51).

Overall, as the country struggles with the immediate post-conflict fragility of political and
security conditions, an external balance of payments shock can aggravate conflict risk.

V: Conclusion

Transitioning from a cessation of violent conflict to sustained peace is associated with a
slow economic process – just as it is a slow institutional transformation process (WDR
2011, Chapter 3). Certain dimensions of stability can be restored quickly (notably
inflation and the exchange rate), but there is no large growth dividend right after conflict
ends. In the terminology of WDR 2017, the challenge is to avoid a shrinking period once
the initial burst of activity is exhausted. Investment seems to take some time to respond
to remission, perhaps indicating a slow updating process for confidence in the durability
of peace. What does help generate some “economic” space is reduced military
spending, and aid to underpin consumption in the initial phases and help avoid rapid
accumulation of debt. Keeping the public sector payroll under control is also important.
Given that these beneficial effects take time to materialize, high aid flows may have to
maintained for a long time, beyond the usual horizon of aid flows into post-conflict
contexts (Hoeffler, 2012).
While careful not to assign an exaggerated causality to the role of macroeconomics in
conflicts, this chapter illustrates a macroeconomic dynamic that, when combined with

                                                                                                                         21
the more understood and observed vulnerabilities (institutional, political, etc.), can
increase the risk of a country entering or re-entering into conflict mode. This dynamic,
which is especially evident in the pre-conflict period, but signs of which are also present
in the years leading to relapse, strikingly resembles pre-financial crises risks.
Specifically, within the context of political and security pressures, macroeconomic
vulnerabilities followed by a balance of payments shock, an environment known to be
fertile grounds for financial crises, can lead to rapid depletion of buffers – plausibly due
to a reluctance to make economic adjustments in the face of external shocks due to pre-
existing social conflict.
As with a financial crisis, the reluctance to adjust in the face of external shocks may
accelerate the onset of the fiscal and financial dimensions of the crisis, or raise its
eventual cost. This suggests a particular focus of prevention on before-the-crisis-
happens interventions in fragile countries, which combine credible policy adjustment
with financing to smooth the social impact of that adjustment. In practice, interventions
tend to be around the time of crisis, forcing more abrupt and concentrated adjustment.
