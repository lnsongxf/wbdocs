CREDIT
Directed Credit. Under some circumstances, directed
credit can be used for policy reasons to prop up an
unsustainable, uncompetitive sector. In other cases,
it may be the only way to demonstrate commercial
potential or a least cost poverty alleviation model.
Suggestion: State if the proposed operation
envisages targeting specific sector(s)/types of
beneficiaries and explain the rationale when
directed credit is involved. Check the results from
recent projects with directed credit activities.

KEEPING SCORE: MONITORING
Disbursement of the credit line is great, but does not

project developmental outcomes.

KEY CHALLENGES AND PRECONDITIONS
For many EMEs further development of the
institutional investor base is the first precondition
to realize the potential of capital markets to bridge
strategic financing needs – although there is no
predetermined cut-off size that such investors
should reach. However, even in EMEs where such
an institutional investor base already exists, their
potential to bridge key financing needs such as those
related to SME financing has not fully materialized.
To a large extent this is due to challenges that affect
key preconditions. These relate to: the availability and
offering of the instruments (supply side); investment
conditions for institutional investors (demand side);      opportunities. This includes underdeveloped credit
and the broader enabling environment.                      bureaus, lack of recognition of movable assets as

INFORMATION SHARING
A critical issue for the future of crowdfunding as
a source of finance is the context for information
sharing. Credit information typically includes basic
identification data (name, address, birthdate) as well
as payment history. Having accurate credit data is
essential for new forms of lending relationships
which consist of far less personal contact between
the investors and investees, as in the case with

 Investment-based Crowdfunding (Financial Return) in blue This model refers to raising capital by
 selling financial instruments related to the company’s assets and/or financial performance. Crowdfunding
 investing (CFI) includes raising debt capital in the form of loans, selling claims to the company’s
 intellectual property and selling investors’ ownership shares. Debt-based crowdfunding is commonly
 referred to as Peer-to-Peer or P2P lending which may involve loans to individual borrowers and/or to
 firms, depending on the platform and market.
 Peer to Peer Lending (P2P): Fundraisers receive a debt instrument that pays a fixed rate of interest and
 returns principal on a specified schedule.
 Equity-Based: Funders receive equity instruments or profit sharing arrangements.
 Donation-based Crowdfunding (No Financial Return) in gray: This model raises non-equity capital
 rather than the sale of securities for creative projects or charity causes. In some cases donations may
 support an early-stage company or product innovation, sometimes in exchange for early access to a
 product or service.
 Donation-Based: This is a philanthropic approach where funders donate without expecting monetary
 compensation.
 Reward-Based: Funders receive a token gift of appreciation or pre-purchase of a service or product.
 This model is evolving into a marketplace of its own, with firms raising considerable sums through
 pre-sales.
