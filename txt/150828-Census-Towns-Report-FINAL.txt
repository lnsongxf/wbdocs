EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      The definition of urbanization in India is unique. Settlements are grouped into three broad
categories: (i) villages, (ii) statutory towns (STs) and (iii) census towns (CTs), the latter two being urban
areas. While STs includes all manner of urban local bodies under the 74th Constitutional Amendment and
are defined variously under state municipal acts, CTs are rural settlements that satisfy three criteria:
population (at least 5,000), density (at least 400 persons per square kilometer) and workforce (at least 75%
of male main workers in non-farm sector) set by the Registrar General of India for defining an urban area.
CTs are thus in-between settlements: they are large dense settlements that are administratively rural
governed by a panchayat under the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, with most of their population engaged
in non-farm activity, i.e., places that are possibly urban in character, which are governed as rural areas.

2.       It is important to study CTs because they currently account for 15% of urban population (which
includes population of CTs) and 36% of small town (below 100,000) population and are sharply increasing
in number. The 2011 census identified 3,894 settlements as CTs while there were only 1,362 such
settlements in the 2001 census. Of the total urban growth of approximately 90 million people, almost a third
is attributed to the new census towns, i.e., change in the character of settlements , due to re-classification
of rural areas into urban areas because of increase in non-farm activity. There is limited literature on census
towns since they are neither studied separately as urban areas or rural areas. With the recent
acknowledgement of their role in urban growth though, the questions around the contestations on their
status (the trade-offs between rural and urban status) their hybrid nature, their nature of urbanization, and
relationship to existing urban settlements is an emergent theme in the literature.

3.      The aim of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the nature of census towns. It
provides a quantitative picture of CTs, relying upon settlement level data from the census to describe their
character and service levels, as well as a detailed qualitative study in five locations in four states of Eastern
India (Satghara in Bihar, Gopalpur in West Bengal, Erein in Odisha and Bishnugarh and Cherra in
Jharkhand). In Bihar, two more sites, a large village (Simri) and a statutory town (Jhanjharpur) were chosen
to enable a comparison with the CT in terms of economic transformation and governance.

4.       The study asks three main research questions, viz. (i) the nature of economic transformation (ii)
spatial transformation and (iii) the governance of CTs and its relationship with levels of service provision.

5.      The nature of economic transformation of the CTs can be grouped into three categories: (i) the
everyday economy, (ii) town-specific activities (which may not exist in all towns) and (iii) new activities,
all of which, with the possible exception of transport, are largely financed through non-formal sources.

6.       The everyday economy, which is organically rooted in servicing the demand from surrounding
settlements, is facilitated by improved connectivity and transport options. This everyday economy is
organized around the local market, i.e., the bazaar economy, but is insufficient to generate surplus capital,
though it is an important and resilient source of employment and of interactions with the surrounding
villages. In some settlements, there are also additional external drivers, such as the Dhamra port project in
Erein and a hospital and college in Bishnugarh. However, in the state of Bihar, there is a visible absence
of such drivers, of industry and a lack of public investment beyond roads.

7.      Town-specific activities are varied and differ between settlements, but they are generally small-
scale and often embedded in traditional caste occupations, e.g., Gopalpur’s yoghurt industry, the small-
scale foundries in Bishnugarh and Cherra or jewellery making in Bihar. Improvements in connectivity and
transport help to increase the market for these products and expand the size of such activities.


                                                                                                               v
8.      Five new activities are common to all sites, the major two being para-transit and construction. In
addition to these two, three other common activities are private education, private healthcare and services
around cellphones, their sales, servicing and value-added services.

9.      Growth in para-transit transport is driven by effective public investment in rural roads, increased
user demand based on travel needs for education and general consumption and relatively easy supply of
finance for vehicles through their manufacturers or banks. In some places like Gopalpur, there are also
locally manufactured vehicles such as battery powered electric rickshaws that operate as shared public
transport. In Bihar, people engaged in this para-transit activity are often migrants returning from large cities,
where they acquired finance and the skills required for driving vehicles.

10.      Data on houses provided by the Census and field work results indicate a rise in the construction
sector, in particular for residential purposes. However, commercial real estate activity is limited, with the
exception of Erein, thanks to its location near the district headquarters and large external factors, such as
the investment in connectivity to Dhamra port.

11.     Spatial transformation or land use change in a CT is not confined within its administrative
boundaries. In all the settlements, expansion occurs outside the CT boundaries, a process also observed in
the case of the ST studied. In part, this spatial spillover is driven by the lack of building regulations and
lower taxes outside the ST, but in the CTs, this is simply the inability of a small settlement area to contain
the growth of economic activity.

12.     The governance of CTs and its relationship with levels of service provision is complicated. The
form of governance (rural vs. urban) in these five settlements is a matter of vigourous local discussion and
proposals for alternative administrative formations (which are developed at different scales) can be traced,
in varying degree, to four axes of contestation.

13.       The first axis of contestation is service provision. Though there are local variations in service
delivery according to the effectiveness of the state governance mechanisms and nationally, controlling for
size, there is little evident difference in service provision between CTs and statutory town (STs), it remains
a major axis of mobilization.

14.       In addition, there are three other axes of contestation, viz.: (i) the role of taxes and public schemes,
(ii) the nature of non-farm activity and related land use changes, and (iii) local socio-political formations.
In particular, the field work highlights the importance of the social grouping and conflicts of the area in
influencing the debate on governance. The grouping overlaps with the economic divide between the bazaar
(that includes some members of the local elites and traders) and basti, which benefits from various social
welfare schemes. The aspirations for urban status appear to be pushed by local elites and resisted by the
poorer groups, as for instance in Erein in Odisha where Dalit, Muslims and tribals are apprehensive about
a shift to urban status. In Bihar, though, since access to welfare schemes is poor, it is not a strong argument
to remain rural. Nevertheless, coalitions contesting the shift from rural to urban status are clearly embedded
in specific local socio-political configurations that are also linked to caste.

15.      Beyond these contestations, the transition to urban governance is also shaped by State legislations
that define criteria to become urban. In West Bengal and Jharkhand, the settlements studied are too small
in population to claim this status. However, in Bihar, the study demonstrates numerous practices on the
ground to put up proposals for urban status, or district headquarters (which is perceived as an instrument to
attract public investment) that are based on realignment and agglomeration of territories that concentrate
non-farm activities. In Odisha, while the boundary of the nearby large town has been expanded, Erein has
been excluded from the expansion.


                                                                                                                vi
16.      Some of these results from the qualitative fieldwork may be specific to poorer states, and in more
developed states, the monetization of land may, inter alia, play a more central role and can trigger a potential
for capital surplus later invested in more productive activities. Even within the four states, some results,
e.g., the importance of migration and the lack of association between statutory status and service provision
may be specific to Bihar, as illustrated by a pair-wise comparison of Simri and Satghara as well as Satghara
and Jhanjharpur. The purpose of this comparison was to illustrate the position of a large village, a CT and
a ST with regard to their governance and their economic structure. Interestingly, our results show that these
three types of settlement cannot be seen as being on a linear continuous process from rural to urban. If
services define a form of urbanity (or urban quality of life), Jhanjharpur is comparable to Simri but much
worse than Satghara, in particular in terms of electricity provision. Even in its employment structure,
Jhanjharpur’s percentage of males employed in non-farm activities is closer to Simri, at below 50 per cent
as compared to 81 per cent in Satghara. In other words, the reason for Jhanjharpur becoming a NP either is
linked to its higher population (30,000 people) or to other governance processes such as the presence of the
block headquarters.

17.      A major policy implication in terms of governance, not just for the four states, but more generally,
is the need to plan at a more aggregated level, like the panchayat (though we also find that land use changes
can occur in adjacent panchayats), tehsil or the district, and not at the level of the settlement. The existing
separation between rural and urban that structures all public interventions is not in sync with the spatial and
economic reality of these settlements. Various options can be envisaged that would be require more or less
intervention, ranging from evolving solutions to activate efficient district planning committees as exists in
today’s administrative organization to more radical solutions such as ending the binary rural/urban created
by the 73rd and the 74th constitutional amendment on decentralization.

18.     In terms of service provision, the study shows that even with the expansion of market and increased
regional transport, the level of basic amenities can remain very low. Since these CTs are sites where
increasing numbers of people live and work, even in states like Bihar with high levels of migration, public
investment to ensure higher levels of service provision such as water and sanitation, solid waste
management and street lights may be needed.

19.     In terms of economic activities, an important implication relates to the need to improve access to
space-neutral services like formal finance and electricity, in addition to transport connectivity, to enhance
the economic potential of CTs.

20.      In conclusion, the study identified two areas of further inquiry: (a) comparative work in more
developed states, such as Haryana, Punjab or Maharashtra to explore other economic dynamics in CTs and
(b) better understanding of the role of migration; how it is influenced by policies in the larger cities, and
the manner in which this feeds back to smaller settlements.

I.          RATIONALE OF THE STUDY

21.      According to the latest Census of 2011, the urbanization level in India has increased from 27.8%
in 2001 to 31.2% in 2011, and for the first time, the absolute increase in urban population exceeded the
increase in rural population. At the outset, it is useful to understand clearly what is defined as urban and
rural by the Registrar General of India. Settlements in India are grouped into three broad categories:(i)
villages, (ii) statutory towns (STs) and (iii) census towns (CTs), the latter two being considered as urban
areas for statistical purposes. Statutory Towns include all manner of urban local bodies1 and are defined
variously under state municipal acts, as summarised in Table I.1. Census Towns are settlements that are
administered as rural areas but satisfy the three criteria: population of at least 5,000, density of at least 400
persons per square kilometer and workforce of at least 75% of male main workers in non-farm sector, set
by the Registrar General of India for defining an urban area.

22.      This definition of urbanization in India is unique internationally. It is the only country to use
population, density and economic character together as criteria. International comparisons of urbanization
levels are therefore fraught with difficulty. The extent of difference due to definitions can be quite large.
Uchida and Nelson (2010) tried to evolve a common definition across countries by applying a common
proximity measure (uniform commuting distance from existing large cities) as a uniform criterion across
countries. By this measure, they estimated that 52% of India’s population live within an hour’s distance of
such cities, compared to 36% in China, based on the census of 2001 and 2000 respectively. 2

23.      In India, the 2011 census highlighted a new feature in its urban transformation. A total of 3,894
settlements were identified as CTs while there were only 1,362 such settlements in the 2001 census. Thus,
a large number of settlements were reclassified from rural to urban, because of the change in their
demographic and workforce characteristics. Importantly, of the total urban growth of approximately 90
million people, about 44% is due to natural population growth in urban areas that existed in 2001, 21% is
due to migration from urban to rural areas and the remaining, i.e., more than a third is because of re-
classification of rural settlements as urban areas due to the change in the character of settlements, i.e.,
mostly new CTs (with a small proportion due to villages being reclassified as urban local bodies). 3 As
such, the ‘morphing’ of places is more important in urban growth in India than the ‘movement’ of people.

24.      Two characteristics of this feature bear emphasis. First, this morphing of places is not a
phenomenon that is happening on the periphery of existing large urban areas. Only about a third of the new
CTs are close to existing class I towns (urban areas of 100,000 or more), the rest being either isolated or
part of a group of smaller rural settlements. Second, understanding this phenomenon is important not only
for understanding urbanization, but also for rural poverty alleviation. A critical element of economic growth
is the rise in non-farm employment and incomes. Himanshu, et. al. (2010) find that rural non-farm

Area in the United States.

diversification is more rapid when neighboring urban centers grow and this association is stronger if the
urban center is a small town as compared to a large city. 4

25.     In order to do this, it is not sufficient to study the statutory small towns. While the share of small
towns (i.e., towns with a population of less than 100,000) in total urban population has actually increased
marginally over 2001-11, the share of CTs has almost doubled from 7.4% to over 14%, and within small
towns, it rose from 19% to 36%. The aim of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the sharp
increase in the number of CTs observed in the 2011 census and growing importance of small urban
settlements.

26.     This is especially interesting also because India has different administrative arrangements for rural
and urban areas, which are based on the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution of India respectively.
Since the CTs continue to be governed by rural administrative arrangements this situation raises an
additional set of questions, in addition to the nature of economic transformation, related to the trade-offs-
between rural and urban status. The report, in particular, shall try and find answers to the following
questions:
        a. How does their governance affect the settlements economically and spatially?
        b. What underpins the economic dynamics of these settlements?
        c. What are the drivers of change in land use and what rrelationships, if any, are there between
            agglomeration of settlements and economic and social and governance processes?

27.      The report is organized into two main parts. The first one provides a reading of the existing
literature on small towns along the three main axis of research: governance, employment and spatial change.
It also provides a detailed rationale for the choice of sites and expands on the methodology chosen. The
second part of the report is constituted of four sections: (i) the first considers the CT as a liminal notion,
enabling to unpack our reading of urbanization; (ii) the second is concerned with the shift towards non-
farm employment, the reality (or not) of sectoral differentiation in CTs and the analysis of the new types of
jobs existing in the towns; (iii) the third is concerned with the existing debates and practices around the
idea that some CTs should become statutory towns; (iv) the fourth looks at the various urban services and
attempts to assess which variations (rural/urban; state) explain differences in services.

28.      This report is a synthesis of a number of reports that have been submitted separately. These include
in particular, the methodological report, which is a part of the inception report at the beginning of the study,
which details the method of selection of these sites, and the individual case studies for the various sites,
namely: Satghara, Simri, and Jhanjharpur in Bihar; Gopalpur in West Bengal, Erein in Odisha and
Bishnugarh-Cherra in Jharkhand. These studies provide more detail about the specificities of governance,
economic activity and spatial transformation of these sites. For the most part, this report focuses on elements
that are common to these sites, while pointing out particular exceptions, if any.

II.      LITERATURE REVIEW AND RATIONALE FOR THE CHOICE OF SITES

This subsection includes a summary of the scarce literature on Census Towns and the methodology of the
study. The review of the literature points to four important dynamics: CTs are places in between rural and
urban and that their classification raises a number of question trade-offs-between rural and urban status;
despite insufficient evidence, CTs seem to suffer from low levels of service and show an economic
transformation towards non-farm, an important trend in India, and CTs are not confined to their
boundaries. All these four elements point to the CTs as a very important site of urbanization that needs to
be studied. The methodology of the research is based on a study conducted in four poorer states. Seven
sites were selected that included CTs that are part of an agglomeration, close to larger towns, as well as
CTs that are stand-alone and those that are part of agglomerations with other CTs or villages. A two track
approach was used, one focused on Bihar, and another on Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal. In Bihar,
the study tried to understand in what respects is a CT different from a village or a statutory town by selecting
through the use of a composite index three types of settlements: (i) a CT of a median size, (ii) a Statutory
Town (ST), and (iii) a large village.

29.     Research on small town dynamics in India is not a new phenomenon. It was an important site of
research by historians, on the relationship between economic development, trade, capital networks and
social change in early and colonial India. Later, in post-colonial India, small towns were seen as an
important site for balancing economic development, enhancing rural urban linkages and avoiding
concentration in large towns. With the focus on metropolitan cities that arose around the 1990s with the
process of reforms, small town research has waned, though recently, there has been more attention,
subsequent to the census findings.

30.      One such research programme with a strong research agenda on small towns is SUBURBIN, which
also includes some of participants in this study. As part of SUBURBIN, there was an in-depth (though not
exhaustive) literature review on small towns 5. From this, it appears that research on small town covers a
range of urban settlements but has not focused precisely on the nature and on the role of CTs that we
consider to be a specific subgroup of urban settlements. Consequently, in order to better devise a research
agenda, the study first attempted to get an understanding of the issues raised in research focused on CTs, to
identify prominent unresearched issues or blind spots.


II.1.    On Governance and Census Towns

31.     The first issue is the governance of CTs, since they are urban in character but continue to be
governed under rural administrative frameworks. Since the Indian governance structure is different for
rural and urban local bodies, what is the effect of this, if any?


II.1.1. Census Towns as a “Places in Between”

32.    Since CTs remain villages in terms of their administrative status: they are governed by a rural
panchayat (governed by the 73rd Amendment to the Constitution of India). Statutory Towns are the only

ones with the administrative apparatus of a town (governed by the 74th Amendment to the Constitution of
India). Therefore, among settlements, CTs is a specific subgroup defined as urban by the Census of India
but under rural governance. The emergence of a large number of CTs during the 2001-2011 decade and
their role in the urban growth has generated some interest as to what these settlements represent 6 and the
reason for their emergence 7. In spite of this particular status, there has been limited research on Census
Towns so far. On the one hand, research on small towns has been centered either on small urban local
bodies, comparing cities of different sizes but without a specific focus on Census Towns per se. On the
other hand, rural studies, both quantitative and qualitative, have not highlighted the specific status of CTs.

33.      The main question raised by the limited research on CTs with regards to governance and its
relationship with the urban is what we refer as to the “politics of classification” 8. This term encapsulates
the idea that in most states urban local bodies are more restricted in their autonomy as compared to rural
ones. In addition to the objective situation, a set of other factors could play a role when States decide to
classify a settlement as rural or urban. Bhagat 9 presents different elements of this cost-benefit analysis in
favor of rural settlements, such as lower levels of taxation, cheaper electricity and the absence of urban bye-
laws and especially access to public schemes, in particular Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), which is supposed to provide guaranteed unskilled employment of 100
days to each rural household and Indira Awas Yojana (IAY), which provides subsidies for house
construction to targeted poor households. As Sivaramakrishnan (2011) summarizes “these places “in
between” will be better off as panchayats since government funding and various other concessions available
to panchayats are more in number and much larger” (p. 50) 10. On the other hand, once a settlement reaches
a certain level of population and density, the need for networked urban services can only be financed
through resources allocated to urban local bodies and there might be a certain need for planning. In other
words, there is a form of cost-benefit analysis at work that can differ from one settlement to another and
that can mobilize different types of actors and of interest. This leads to the question of whether a process
of municipalisation is required to enhance governance.

34.      Field research that has explored these dynamics in specific states or locations reinforces these
hypotheses and opens up new insights. First of all, studying the case of Maharashtra, where a number of
settlements that fulfil the criteria to become urban remain rural, the authors of the Tata Institute of Social
Sciences study on this state argue that the urban is a “contested terrain”11. They consider that the importance
of agriculture and primary sector and the local and economic stakes also shape decisions to become urban.
Denis, Mukhopadhyay and Zérah 12 also refer to a number of field examples where political factors play a
role in the governance boundary between the urban and the rural. They cite the case of Tamil Nadu, where
in June 2004, 566 town panchayats (small urban local bodies) were reclassified as rural panchayats due to
the resistance to urban taxation. These two examples point to the variations between States. For instance
declassification from urban to rural is possible in Kerala and in Tamil Nadu but not in all other states. For
example, in West Bengal and in Kerala, the two states with the highest number of new Census Towns, the
provision available in the 74th amendment to have town panchayat or nagar panchayat for transitional urban

areas does not exist (see Table I.1), which lead some authors to argue for these states to enter this first step
of municipalisation 13. Indeed, since the definition of the urban varies from one state to the other, it requires
probing the politics of classification in diverse sites. Finally, other examples provided in the Denis et al.
paper based on exploratory field work also show that social stakes can also influence the rural vs. urban
classification.

35.       In this context, this study, which is based on field-work in four States of Eastern India, will try to
explore the trade-offs-between rural and urban status and explore further the hypothesis of a politics of
urban/rural classification. By studying different settlements located in four different states, we aim to weigh
the role of the different factors identified such as the type of settlements, the types of schemes and
regulations at the State level, the role that some actors (local or regional) play. A second research question
is, at the level of each locality, to find out the types of debates around the question of governance, and the
types of arguments that are put forward by the different actors.

II.1.2. Census Towns and Basic services

36.      As mentioned above, one potential advantage of being an urban settlement concerns the funding
available with urban local bodies for the development of urban services. The available literature is again
limited on the level of urban services in Census Towns and on the capacity to design, operate and maintain
networked services. There are a number of papers comparing variations in services from metro-cities to
small towns that show a systematic decrease in the level of basic services as one moves down in the size of
towns 14 , with marked inequalities in some specific states, two of them (Bihar and Odisha) of interest to
this research 15. Small towns are therefore described as deprived of funds and as suffering from a weak
governance capacity16. Nevertheless, these papers do not differentiate between CTs and STs. The only
available paper that addresses the question that the administrative status plays in service provision in a
comparative manner is Mukhopadhyay (forthcoming). He uses a unique constructed data set of matched
settlements from two census periods and defines indicators related to access to piped water supply, and
improved sanitation and finds limited differences between STs and CTs both in the levels of service (Fig
II.1) and in their growth over 2001-11 (Table II.1). But, CTs close to larger towns have better improvements
in levels of service.

37.      There is an emerging, but still very limited, literature that focuses on some selected CTs, and it
comes either from field research or from journalistic coverage. 17 These works provide insights into the low
level of services, even in CTs located in the periphery of large metropolitan cities and into some of the
governance issues that impact service delivery. The cases of Molachur (50 km from Chennai) and Chakan
(30 km from Pune) 18 that benefit from the shift of manufacturing into rural areas highlight the problems
raised in rapidly transforming places of the absence of physical and social infrastructure. However, this is
not the case in other types of Census Towns where growth seem to be more related to real estate growth,
such as Neral in Maharashtra 19. This article acknowledged the difficulty that Panchayats face in providing
services to a population that almost doubled in ten years.

38.      The research work of Samanta in the state of West Bengal highlights the existing service gaps in
CTs. In Barjora, 20 water supply is provided only partly through the panchayat but people have to rely on
their own arrangements because supply is insufficient. Most households have their own well in their
courtyard, which raises some quality issues with the increased pollution of the ground water due to polluting
industries. The panchayat tries to find solutions to its insufficient supply by relying on tankers. There are
no covered drains and no solid waste management services due to paucity of funds. She finds very similar
results in Singur 21. What she also highlights in her work is the difference between the village of Barjora and
the other villages in the agglomeration, hinting at the possibility of discrepancies within villages that are
located in the periphery of CTs, as is also the case in Singur. She also places this situation within the specific
situation of West Bengal where the criteria to become urban is strict (a minimum of 30,000 people and
density and employment criteria). This work underlines the difficulty of panchayat to handle service
provision for settlements that have urban features and density levels that would require networked services.
Debroy (2014), in a recent op-ed, also points to the question of fragmentation of authorities 22, in particular
in CTs located in Delhi, raising the question of the place of CTs in larger metropolitan cities.

39.       Based on this limited literature on the intersection of CTs and urban services, research questions
that explore the relationship between governance and access to basic amenities are multifold. Put simply,
with the rise in population and spatial expansion, there is a change of scale in terms of service provision. In
particular, for water and sanitation services, it might be necessary to develop networks and to shift from
on-site sanitation or community or individual water systems. For roads and solid waste management,
expansion of services and better organization might be required. One of our questions is as to whether there
is a difference between census towns, villages and statutory towns both in terms of the level of services and
the manner in which people make demands (or not) on urban services. This will require understanding how
services are provided in different types of settlements as well as the level of differentiation in different parts
of the town studied, or even beyond its boundaries.

II.2.       On Economic Activities and Census Towns

40.      As stated earlier, the literature on CTs is sparse and within that the economy of CTs is sparser still.
Most news report such as those in the Mint referred to above indicate a diversified broad based service
dominated economy, but at relatively low scale 23. In some places like Barjora investigated by Samanta, the
mainstay is mining and small sponge-iron plants, and in others, such as in Garbeta, recently reported by
Sircar, the basis is farm processing (in this instance, cold storage for potatoes). However, in other more
detailed studies of census towns like Banerjee and Roy 24, who study CTs in northern West Bengal, the
overall impression is one of a variety of small scale service activities. In CTs that are close to larger towns,
there is also spillover of economic activity. Punia (op. cit.) finds that periphery of Yamunanagar has cement
and packaging industries, numerous small-scale enterprises in timber business as well as thermal power
plants and educational institutions. In Manakpur, an industrial enterprise cluster of metal and alloys has
developed). In the district of Karnal, many CTs are growing due to real estate. The possible drivers of
change in north along the national highway are real estate builders, demand from agro processing industries
like rice and wheat flourmills and government cooperatives for housing projects.

41.      As one moves up the scale, some interesting trends become visible in small towns. Raman’s work
on Tiruchengode shows a home-grown well drilling industry, along with manufacture and export of
equipment. Kundu and Bhatia find a flourishing mini-steel industry in Gobindgarh and Kaur documents an
established furniture industry in Kartarpur.

42.     Such ‘anchor industries’ are not usually seen in the limited literature on CTs. This is not unexpected
unless the CT is the consequence of a large public or private investment, since its relatively small size
would not initially attract such large industries.


II.3.       On spatial transformation and Census Towns

43.      As stated by Mukhopadhyay 25, Census Towns are morphing places and this is not only the case for
those CTs located at the peripheries (or in the influence zone) of metropolitan cities but also applies to stand
alone CTs or CTs located in not very urbanized districts. Accordingly, the sharp increase in the numbers of
census towns between 2001 and 2011 did not only translate into the expansion or consolidation of
metropolitan areas, but has also led to a significant spatial transformation of rural areas. According to Lall, 26
in the 2001-11 decade, the total urban area grew by about 24,000 sq.km which was roughly equivalent to
the amount of agricultural land whose use shifted to non-agricultural and more than a third of the increase
in urban areas, about 9000 sq.km, was on the account or reclassification of villages into Census towns.
Further, the importance of job creation in the construction sector between 2004 and 2012 (around 65% of
job creation) also point to the increase in built up areas and therefore a considerable process of land use
transformation. Some of the papers mentioned above on West Bengal and Kerala have highlighted the
relationship between regional spatial changes and the emergence of CTs. However, there is limited work
on the explanatory factors of spatial transformation on CTs with the exception of research work on the very
rapid land use transformation in the peripheries of large cities and the administrative of these CTs is not

     The census towns reported on in Mint were mostly close to other larger urban settlements

considered as a specific factor 27. However, most of the work on periphery of large metropolitan cities does
not engage with the question as to whether the administrative status of the peripheral settlement does
influence its transformation process. Among the main questions that are raised are the role of proximity and
connectivity and the role of industries and real estate. In West Bengal, some areas where CTs are
concentrated are related to the shift of economic activities as well as the role of migration. The role of
connectivity and corridors as seen in Bhopal with villages (today fitting the CTs criteria) 28 or in Maldah in
West Bengal does appears in the literature 29.

44.       A second question raised in the literature is the agglomeration process around CTs as seen in Singur
or in Barjora where the population of the agglomeration would make them candidates for statutory urban
settlements. This also implies that there is a spatial change even in CTs that might go beyond its boundaries.
It is to some extent related to the much faster growth rate of built-up area as compared to population growth
rate, a phenomena studied for Haryana by Punia, who finds that in some settlements, the built-up growth is
much higher than the population growth rate 30.

45.       Consequently, within the framework of this research, we aim at asking the following: What is the
change in land use pattern and the factors driving the expansion of settlement? Who are the actors driving
spatial changes? What is the role of (i) the State -- town planning schemes, master plans, public investment,
etc.; (ii) large scale private investment and (iii) household investments, e.g., in housing and land use
transformation, such as small scale industries? Finally, what, if any, are the inter-relationships between
spatial processes and economic and social and governance processes?


II.4.    Methodology design

46.       The study was conducted in four states in seven sites. These states were chosen to better understand
the type of urbanization transition in poorer states with low rate of urbanization and in West Bengal, which
ranks second in 2011 for the increase in the number of CTs. Table II.2 provides an indication of the existing
urbanization process. As one can see, census towns are an extensive contributor to the extent of urbanization
in all the states, except Bihar. In the three other states, the contribution of new CTs to the urban population
is significantly higher than the Indian average. In the case of West Bengal, the increase is as high as 66%
(second only to Kerala). Even in the case of Bihar where the contribution of new CTs to the urban
population growth is lower than in the other States, 52 new CTs have been added in 2011. This raises a set
of questions related both to the urbanization process itself as to the governance of these settlements. In West
Bengal, the considerable increase of new CTs appears as an excellent case study for the reasons behind an
increase of urbanization without official recognition of urban status.

47.      In Odisha and Jharkhand, with lower urbanization, the absolute increase of number of towns raises
another set of questions linked to the type of development in states endowed with rich natural resources. In
Bihar, the share of CTs to is lower than in other states, while at the same time there is a considerable amount
of large villages. From the point of view of an urban/rural definition specific to India, it is a relevant case
study to assess the relevance of the economic activity criteria to define urban and rural.

48.      One of the common perceptions about CTs is that they are in the peri-urban areas of larger towns.
However, this is not supported by data. As shown in Table II.3, based on the Census data and the
methodology devised by Pradhan (op. cit.), Jharkhand and Bihar have a configuration similar to the national
average, i.e., around one third of the new census towns are close to a large city, defined as a class I town in
India with a population of more than 100,000. West Bengal departs from the norm with a higher proportion
of CTs, which are located close to a larger city, especially Kolkata. However, a closer look at the location
of the new CTs and the analysis that has already been conducted in West Bengal indicate a shift in the
spatial distribution of urban settlements in the state.31 We also classify CTs by contiguity of built-up area,
which we call settlement agglomerations (SA).32 The results, as shown in Table II.3, differ slightly between
the two approaches.

49.     As indicated later in the discussion on specific case studies, the study includes CTs that are part of
an agglomeration, close to larger towns, as well as CTs that are stand-alone and those that are part of
agglomerations with other CTs or villages. A two track approach was used, one focused on Bihar, the state
with the lowest level of urbanization but with a disproportionate number of large villages and the second
track focused on three other states in the region, namely Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

50.      Track 1 involved a rapid study of one CT in each of the three states (in Jharkhand, a pair of CTs
that formed a SA was chosen, as seen later). These rapid studies involved a total of 15 days of visits to the
site by one researcher. Track 2 focused on three settlements in Bihar: (i) a CT of a median size in Bihar,(ii)
a Statutory Town (ST), and (iii) a Large village

51.      This enabled the study to situate the CT in the spectrum settlement typology and size, as illustrated
in Table II.4 below. The CT was compared with the statutory town, to study the effect of differences in
governance structure, given similarity in workforce structure. Similarly, the CT was compared with the
large village, to study the effect of differences in workforce structure, given similarity in governance
arrangements. Thus, in Bihar, the study tries to answer: ‘In what respects is a CT different from a village
or a statutory town?’

52.      In addition to proximity to large urban areas, the size of the settlement was criterion for selection.
Figure II.1 presents the distribution of settlement size separately for CTs and statutory towns (STs) for the
selected states. As can be seen, their median sizes vary considerably, given that STs are much older and the
larger settlements are more likely to acquire statutory status. While the distribution of CTs is relatively
similar across the four states, there is visible difference across states with respect to STs. West Bengal has
a distinctive distribution, skewed towards larger towns. Given that the criterion for becoming a statutory
town is more stringent in West Bengal (see Table I.1); this is to be expected.

II.5.    Selected Census Towns in Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand

53.      This section outlines some characteristics of the selected study sites in Odisha, West Bengal and
Jharkhand. The study sites in these three states were selected opportunistically, drawing upon other
concomitant of statutory towns in the field in order to make future comparisons by selecting CTs in the
same districts as the statutory towns being studied. It also situates the study sites with respect to other
settlements, using a composite development index of seventeen variables and population of the settlement.
These seventeen variables are male and female literacy, non-farm workforce, child gender ratio, possession
of at least one asset, household size, share of households with phones, electricity, television, two-wheelers,
access to banking, households using LPG for cooking, houses with burnt brick walls, concrete roofs, flush
latrines and tap water within the house. The following section presents the characteristics for Bihar.

54.      In the case of Odisha, Erein (pop: 7,890), which is about 65km away from Baleshwar Municipality
(pop: 144,373) and 6km away from Bhadrak Municipality (pop: 121,338). Erein is very close to Bhadrak
railway station and is part of a panchayat with a number of other villages. It is also on NH-5, part of the
four-lane national highway Golden Quadrilateral. The new rail line that connects Dhamra port to Bhadrak
passes through lands of Erein and substantial land acquisition has taken place, which is a possible source
of capital. 33 According to the port’s website, it:
         “has acquired a 125 meter wide corridor from Dhamra to Bhadrak which can
         accommodate two rail tracks and a four lane road along with service lines viz. transmission
         line and pipe lines. For Phase-I, DPCL has constructed the 62 km rail connectivity (single
         rail track) from Dhamra to Bhadrak/Ranital Link Cabin on the main Howrah-Chennai
         line... As part of Phase-II, DPCL will construct a four lane freight road along the corridor
         to service its upcoming container and general cargo terminal. Doubling of the rail track is
         also proposed during Phase-II” 34

55.      While urban features like paved roads and street lighting are not present, there is considerable
activity in residential construction, with relatively elaborate buildings becoming increasingly common. A
number of people from outside the settlement are taking up residence in Erein and there is evidence of land
development and renting.

56.      The area has a number of rice mills, which are located outside the municipal boundary. There is
also a FCI procurement godown nearby. These mills provide casual employment for unskilled labour. In
addition, there is also a transport industry, including vehicle repairing, etc. which is understandable, given
its proximity to road and rail networks. In Figure II.2, Erein is plotted with respect to the composite index
of development and population size. As can be seen, Erein is quite ‘average’ for Orissa.




33 The nature of livelihood transformation for those who worked on the land that was acquired was not documented in this
preliminary visit. This was an issue raised in our initial presentation on 13 May 2014.

57.      In Jharkhand, a study of statutory towns, specifically, Hazaribagh (pop: 142,489) is being
undertaken. There are 16 CTs in the district that can be classified in three categories: (i) six, which located
close to Hazaribagh (ii) CTs which stand alone and located further away from Hazaribagh, but often located
on a main road (Charhi: 77 km., Urimari: 53 km, Chauparan: 64 km); (iii) group of CTs that make for a
form of agglomerations that could be studied as one case study.35 From the last group, Cherra (pop: 5,279)
and Bishnugarh (pop: 4,847), which form a settlement agglomeration were selected. Not only are both at
the boundary of classification as an urban area (Bishnugarh actually does not meet the three-fold test of
urbanization, even though it has been declared as a census town36), which will permit investigation into
the nature of classification, their proximity to each other permits a closer look at the regulatory issues
relating to rural administration. While both Bishnugarh and Cherra belong to Bishnugarh Panchayat Samiti,
they are in different Gram panchayats – Bishnugarh is in Bishnugarh Gram panchayat with two other
villages, while Cherra is in Chedra Gram Panchayat, with one other village. We plot these two CTs in a
manner similar to Erein. As seen in Figure II.3, both Bishnugarh and Cherra are ‘average’ in terms of their
development index. It should also be noted that Jharkhand has a number of large CTs, such as Saunda
(81,915), Gumia (48,141) and Kopali (43,256). Most of these are factory towns built around mines and
power stations.




35 These are Gidi, Religara alias Pachhiari, and Dari, three CTs around a coal field 60 km from Hazaribagh; Cherra and Bishnugarh:

separated by a road, 42 km away and Barhi and Konra: 2 CTs 5 km apart.
36 This is because there is a predictive component to the classification of rural and urban areas. To recall, CTs are settlements

satisfying the three urban characteristics of population (at least 5,000), density (at least 400 per sq. km.) and male non-farm
workforce (at least 75 per cent). Since CTs are identified prior to the census operation, information from the last census is used for
such identification. For CTs in 2011, all villages having a population of 4000 or more at the 2001 census are taken up for
examination with the assumption that such settlements are expected to cross 5000 population by the time of the 2011 census. For
such units the density and the male main workforce composition of population are examined to see whether these qualify to be
categorised as CT.

58.      In West Bengal, the selected site is Gopalpur (pop: 7,016) in Dakshin (south) Dinajpur district,
about 40km from Balurghat (pop: 153,279), a statutory town that is being studied; but relatively close (5
km) to the smaller town of Gangarampur (pop: 56,175). There is a ferry crossing across the Purnabaha river
near Gopalpur. Like other states, here too, Gopalpur is plotted against other urban settlements. As seen in
Figure II.3, Gopalpur’s development index is relatively poor, about one standard below the state mean. The
Institutional Strengthening of Gram Panchayats (ISGP) program, supported by the World Bank, is being
implemented in the panchayat.

59.      While only 11% of Bihar's population is officially urban, about another 42% of the population
classified as rural lives in settlements that are large enough and almost always also dense enough (almost
90% (34,657 of 38,599) of Bihar’s villages are above the urban density threshold) to be classified as urban,
but whose share of male workforce employed in the non-farm sector remains below the threshold of 75%.
The share of the population living in large villages in Bihar is twice that of the rest of India, where only
21% live in such villages. Figure II.6 details Bihar’s settlement structure.

60.       The site selection for Bihar was done more systematically given the state’s specific characteristics,
including a low official level of urbanization, and a high proportion of people living in large villages. A
first selection was done at the district level using the following measures of development:
          a. The composite development index developed based on census data for 17 variables, as in other
             states.
            b. A second, additional separate index, utilizing 71 variables in six different groups – Economic,
               Governance, Infrastructure, Social, Finance, Primary — was built using data from the Bihar
               Economic Survey. This involved building weighted (generated using principal components
               analysis) sub-indices for each of the groups and then building a weighted index of the sub-
               indices.
            c. Third, a rank based on the district domestic product
            d. Fourth, the rural poverty headcount ratio for the district 37
            On each of the above four measures, districts were divided into three groups. The intent was to
            focus on districts which were in the middle third, across multiple measures.

61.     In addition, given our strategy, the district also had to have a large village, a Class III statutory
town (between 20,000 and 50,000) and a census town. Fourteen districts met this criterion. Together with
the above criterion, three districts, Madhubani, Samastipur and Paschim Champaran emerged as likely
candidates.

62.      In Samastipur, all the four CTs were in the agglomeration of Samastipur municipality while in
Paschim Champaran; all three Census Towns were in the agglomeration of Bettiah. In Madhubani, there
are two CTs; of which Madhubani (CT) is part of the Madhubani municipality built-up agglomeration. The
other is Satghara. All the three statutory towns, Jhanjharpur, Jainagar and Ghoghardiha, are part of a mixed
SA – a collection of settlements whose built up areas are connected which has both rural and urban
settlements. In the last two towns, the town is smaller than the largest village in the agglomeration. Given
this, the field sites chosen were Satghara (CT) and the statutory town of Jhanjharpur (Nagar Panchayat). A
large village, Simri (pop: 10,846) was the third site. The details of the final sites are in Annex I.

63.     Multiple visits were carried out in the selected sites, with the research teams engaging multiple
interviews with a wide variety of stakeholders and direct documentation in order to understand the processes
of change that were occurring in the CTs and what implication they had for the three questions of economic,
governance and spatial transformation. In addition, secondary data associated with the provision of
amenities, the administrative data on schemes, such as MGNREGS and IAY, spatial spread using Google
maps, the district census handbook, etc. were utilised to arrive at a full picture for each settlement.

III.     CENSUS TOWNS AND THE SIZE OF URBAN INDIA

64.      This section comes back to the larger question of what is the urban and what the real size of urban
India is. The results show that land use change in a CT is not confined within its administrative boundaries
and that CTs do not provide an accurate measure of the size of the built up area. In all the settlements,
expansion occurs outside the CT boundaries, a process also observed in the case of the ST studied. In part,
this spatial spillover is driven by the lack of building regulations and lower taxes outside the ST, but in the
CTs, this is simply the inability of a small settlement area to contain the growth of economic activity. This
has important implications since CTs as the unit of intervention may be unsuitable for planning purposes,
which may be better done at a higher level of aggregation.

III.1.   Probability of Becoming a CT is not Neutral

65.      Census Towns are based on existing revenue village boundaries. Existing revenue villages are of
very different sizes both in terms of their population and their area. The first criterion that can therefore
increase the probability of becoming a CT is the population size of the village. As seen in Table III.1, in all
the states concerned, there are a number of villages, representing up to 21% of the population in Jharkhand,
where more than 75% of male employment is non-farm but that does not fulfill the population criterion. In
other words, one can assume that only villages above a certain population size will be more likely to become
census towns.

66.      However, as Table III.2 below shows, that there is a wide variation in terms of density and size of
our study settlements, which indicates that the original size of the village is not the only criteria that can
influence the CT status. Another important and structural factor is the level of connectivity both in terms
of the location of the settlement in relationship to the larger cities or in terms of the location of the settlement
in relation to the other villages.

67.      The case of Satghara in Bihar illustrates this situation. Its proximity to the railway station and a
cross-roads has led to a concentration of commercial activities within its boundary. Erein in Odisha is
another example of the role that external drivers can play, given its proximity to the railway station and to
the district headquarters of Bhadrak and infrastructure being built to connect Dhamra port. Gopalpur in
West Bengal is connected with the surrounding urban centers by private bus and auto-rickshaws, which run
at a relatively high frequency. In many of the settlements studied, the rise of para-transit vehicles (see
section on economic activities) has reinforced concentration and density in these settlements.

68.      The extent of some facilities such as electricity or phone connectivity is another way to explore
structuring factors that could increase the likelihood of some settlements to become CTs. However, we do
not have sufficient information to back up this hypothesis since the amenities data at settlement level is
only available for 2011.

III.2.   The limits of Census Towns do not reflect necessarily the urbanization process

69.      The literature review has highlighted the examples of Barjora and Singur, both located in West
Bengal where the urbanization lies outside the boundaries of the CTs, giving rise in reality to a much larger
agglomeration. In the case of Singur for instance, the population of the CT was 21,382 people in 2011 but
the built-up area of Singur agglomeration was more than 55,000 people. In Barjora, the population of the
CT is 14,012 while the population of the built-up area is 32,535. In both cases, the population of the CTs
and its surrounding villages is twice the population of the CT, which even in West Bengal (which has a
high threshold for recognition, see Table I.1) would cross the threshold to become an urban local body. Our
field work in multiple sites reinforces the conclusions of Samanta’s work. In Gopalpur, the CT located in
West Bengal, part of the economic activity, in particular the expansion of the market takes place next to the
ferry crossing visible in the left corner of the Map III.1.

70.     This area is however administratively in Bazrapukur village (from a different panchayat) and the
change in economic activity of residents in this location does not add to the non-farm population in
Gopalpur. Within Bazrapukur itself, this change in economic activity is not sufficient to change its status
to a CT. Thus, the transformation engendered by this small market, which forms a local agglomeration with
the market in Gopalpur is not ‘visible’ in the census count on urbanization.

71.       In Satghara, in Bihar, as we will discuss later in the governance section, the proposal to incorporate
a number of villages provides us with an idea of the size of the built-up area. Satghara has a population of
8,060 people but the inclusion of other villages with a total population of 14,500 points to an agglomeration
of more than 22,000 people, more than two and a half times the population of the Census Town. Similarly,
in Jhanjharpur, which is a statutory town, the expansion of the town happens outside the boundary as
indicated in Map III.2. What is referred to as Jhanjharpur are in fact two nearby but separate locations. The
first, Jhanjharpur Nagar Panchayat [NP], is located immediately south of the National Highway 52 and is a
part of Jhanjharpur C.D. Block The second, Jhanjharpur Railway Station [RS], is located mostly to the
south of the Railway Station in South Behat Gram Panchayat. This is a part of the Lakhnaur C.D. Block
and is at a distance of around 3 km from the NP headquarters. The ST is locally known as the “town” and
has the “Old Bazaar”; the RS is referred to as “New Jhanjharpur” or “RS Bazaar”.




                                                                                                              20
 Map III.1. Gopalpur and its surroundings




72.      In these cases, the location of the economic activity is centered on a transport hub, the railway
station in Satghara and Jhanjharpur and the ferry crossing in Gopalpur. The nearest settlement to the
transport hub may not be the administrative village in which it is located, as seen in all three cases. In such
instances, it is natural that there will be dissonance between the spread of economic activity and the relevant
administrative boundary of interest.

73.      The two Census Towns examined in Jharkhand provide insight into another possible configuration.
Both these towns form a contiguous built-up area and were even part of a single panchayat (the Bishnugarh
Gram Panchayat) till the creation in 2010 of a Cherra Gram Panchayat which included the village of Cherra.
Both of them having been declared CTs signify that their increasing urban economy is recognized but the
formation of a small 10,000 people agglomeration is rendered invisible. Further, like in all our other case
studies, connectivity does play a role in the spatial transformation of these settlements. The state highway
cuts across the middle of Cherra and as a consequence, Cherra witnesses significant spatial change and is
much more dynamic than Bishnugarh. Land values are higher and have increased rapidly and extensive
commercial (and partly residential) growth is taking place along the state highway. Consequently, the main
increase in built-up area is taking place in Cherra but also in its adjoining areas, which lie outside the
boundaries of the CT as seen in Map III.3.




                                                                                                            21

74.      In Odisha, Erein is a case of CTs whose growth is driven externally (partly by the Railway station)
mainly by its proximity to Bhadrak, which is the district headquarter and recently by the acquisition of land
for the rail connection to Dhamra port. It is one example in our sample of a peripheral CT, rather than a
stand-alone one. Consequently, its recent status of CT is an improved step to measure the actual
urbanization of Bhadrak. However, a significant part of the non-farm activities growth does occur on the
stretch between Erein and Bhadrak in the Charampa market, located in Charampa village. Recently, four
villages in the tehsil, north of Erein, were included in the Master planning area of the district headquarters,
Bhadrak. However, none of these four villages have a substantial non-farm workforce, nor are many of
them of significant size. What is curious is that the location of some of these villages is further from Bhadrak
than either Charampa or Erein, which have not been incorporated into the master plan.

III.3.      Statutory towns may not fit the Census criteria

75.       While embarking on this project, and as explicated in the methodology, in Bihar, we decided to
have a comparison between a large village, a CT and a ST. As noted earlier, a ST does not need to meet the
census criteria for urbanization and it is interesting and important to note that Jhanjharpur fails to satisfy
the census criteria because of its low level of non-farm employment which is in fact comparable to Simri
village. Further in terms of service quality,), Jhanjharpur is comparable to Simri but much worse than
Satghara, in particular in terms of electricity (see Annex A1). In other words, the reason for Jhanjharpur
becoming a NP either is linked to its higher population (30,000 people) or to other governance processes.
In fact, the other potential ST that could have been studied in the Madhubani district, Ghoghardiha has an
even smaller share of non-farm male worker of 28% and 32% in 2001 and 2011 respectively.

76.      To conclude here, there are a few points to make about how research on CTs enables to deepen
further our understanding of the urbanization transition in India. First, the choice of six settlements spread
over four states demonstrate that CTs provide at first a better reading of the urban transition since it includes
newer dense settlements that have benefitted from their location and higher levels of connectivity. In a
previous work, in which two authors of this report participated, a distinction was made in terms of
administrative status of four types of settlements: (1) invisible, or not recognized as urban; (2) denied, or
classified as a census town; (3) recognized, as a statutory town; and finally (4) contested, where the
settlement is contesting its administrative status 38. The field work conducted in five Census Towns validates
that in each case, there is a form of invisible urbanization occurring outside the boundaries of the CTs. This
result makes evident that the emerging urban transition cannot be bounded or reduced to the new CTs. In
other words, the inclusion of CTs in understanding urbanization tell us more about urbanization on the one
hand but does not tell us enough on the other hand. This recognition inevitably raises the question of the
relevance of the definition of urbanization itself and as to whether a definition solely based on density
and spatial built-up would be more appropriate to fully capture the ongoing transformation.

77.      However, and this is a second point, if urbanization is related to the type of economic activities, as
the Indian definition applies, then the two statutory towns, other than Madhubani, in the district selected do
not fulfill the official criterion. This suggests that in this case, it leads to an overstatement of the existing
level of urbanization. The recent work of Swerts 39, based on the Indiapolis data base that considers the built-
up morphology and does not use any administrative criteria shows that, though it questions the level of
urbanization, it faces limitations in the case of India where there are large and very dense settlements whose

economy remain mainly dominated by rural activities. Her mapping of such settlements shows a very high
proportion of those types of settlements in Bihar.

78.      Finally all the CTs studied in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha, however small in population
size, exhibit a significant share of non-farm employment, an increasing level of connectivity and an
expansion outwards that put them on a trajectory where the shift from rural to urban seems evident. The
case of the district of Madhubani, in Bihar, on the contrary seems to be different. There is evidence, for all
the settlements of increased connectivity, that favor some settlements above others (requiring to think also
urbanization in terms of regional connectivity and therefore territorial governance) but there is also
evidence of a low level of urbanization in terms of economic activity that indicate that there is a disjunction
between densification and urbanization that would need to be probed further. To do so requires turning the
attention to the shift towards non-farm employment (Table III.3) in order to qualify the nature of the
urbanization process.

IV.     THE SHIFT TOWARDS NON FARM EMPLOYMENT

79.      The nature of economic transformation of the CTs can be grouped into three categories: (i) the
everyday economy, (ii) town-specific activities (which may not exist in all towns) and (iii) new activities,
all of which, with the possible exception of transport, are largely financed through non-formal sources. The
everyday economy, which is organically rooted in servicing the demand from surrounding settlements, is
facilitated by improved connectivity and transport options. This everyday economy is organized around
the local market, i.e., the bazaar economy, but is insufficient to generate surplus capital, though it is an
important and resilient source of employment and of interactions with the surrounding villages. In some
settlements, there are also additional external drivers. However, in the state of Bihar, there is a visible
absence of such drivers, of industry and a lack of public investment beyond roads. Five new activities are
common to all sites, the major two being para-transit and construction. In addition to these two, three other
common activities are private education, private healthcare and services around cellphones, their sales,
servicing and value-added services

IV.1.1. ‘Old’ Economic Activity

80.      As noted earlier in the review of the literature, CTs may not be characterized by ‘anchor industries’.
The study also finds that the nature of economic activity in these settlements is fragmented and dispersed,
relying largely on a number of services. However, this does not mean that there is no manufacturing. In
Jhanjharpur, there was an attempt to establish an industrial base. An old complex of mills that included
sugar and paper mills is located within the Jhanjharpur NP area, but has been defunct since within a year
of its inception. The factories have been vandalized and the machines have been stolen. There is a
Jhanjharpur NP Trade Corporation Rice Mill, Machen Processing and Trading Center and a Food Grain
Godown in one compound located immediately north of the Highway Junction. This is a part of the Notified
Area, but is not included within the NP. These units have been constructed around five years ago, but have
been defunct after a year of functioning. There is a small rice mill in Jhanjharpur NP industrial area that
employs fifty persons, but only in the period after the monsoon paddy crop. Most respondents cite lack of
electricity and other infrastructure as a hindrance to the growth of industry. Other reasons include lack of
financing from banks, lack of labour and lack of security.

81.     By contrast, in Bishnugarh, there is a large employment base provided by the manufacture of
foundry industry for brassware, which is retailed in the region. It has also a thriving jewelry industry. In
Satghara, as in other settlements in Bihar, there is the manufacture of storage units, like metal trunks and
cupboards, which are visible in the marketplace. Jewelry is present in the Bihar settlements also, and indeed,
even in Simri village, there are jewelry workers who work on a ‘putting-out’ basis for shops in nearby
markets like Rahika and Madhubani.

82.      Another group of economic activity is agro-based, as in cold storages in Garbeta, referred to in the
literature review. While both the Makhana factory and the rice mill in Jhanjharpur (where a large proportion
of the workforce is still in farming) is defunct, a number of private rice mills are very vibrant in Erein.
Bishnupur is engaged in the production of local alcohol and Gopalpur has a thriving industry manufacturing
curd, which is supplied to the region. By contrast, defunct sugar mills dot the landscape in Madhubani, a
testament to the significant nexus with government policy and possibly the associated lack of reliable
electricity.

83.      In addition to this, there is the more banal, everyday form of non-farm economic activity in terms
of both small manufacturing like the drums and trunks that are omnipresent in Bihar’s bazaars or grocery
stores, hairdressers (beauty salons for women, a sub-set of this category, is also more visible and is often



                                                                                                            25
home-based), tailors, jewelers, etc. However, since there is better communication to a given location, thus
increasing the size of the ‘hinterland’ and more consumption per household, there is a higher level of such
activity that can be supported at a given location, thus making it more possible that a specific location would
cross the 75% threshold of male main workers in non-farm occupations.


IV.1.2. New Economic Activity

84.      While each site has specific features associated with its transformation, it would not be totally out
of place to note that there are some common new elements across these sites. A few of them are highlighted,
as points of departure from older forms of non-farm work.

85.      First, there has been a relatively rapid increase in construction. This is not just of public works
projects associated with MGNREGS, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), the rural roads
scheme, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA), which constructs school rooms and other such schemes, but also
importantly in the everyday improvement in housing and building quality, as more of them acquire brick
walls and concrete roofs. Indeed, in one of our interactions in Madhubani, we were told that it was much
easier now to find the skills for ‘modern construction’, in part seeded by return migrants who worked as
construction workers in the cities, than it was to find skills for more traditional construction using mud and
straw, which may be more cooling and cost-effective. Associated with the increase in construction is the
activity of brick-kilns to supply these areas and not just the cities. These brick-kilns provide another avenue
of employment for unskilled labour who were previously engaged as farm workers.

86.     A second visible activity is based around transport, especially low-capacity vehicles (a formal
capacity of four to seven, but which seat many times more) like three-wheelers, or in some cases, depending
on route capacity, buses and SUVs of various forms. It would be natural to speculate that much of this is
supported both by transport demand from rising incomes and by improvements in road quality at all levels,
major district roads, rural roads, etc. The availability of formal banking finance for vehicle purchase (as
compared to the difficulty of finding finance for other types of activities) and the relatively low entry costs
and sunk costs for this activity make the growth of this activity even easier.

87.      A third sector, is the growth of private education at all levels and price points. These are schools
staffed by local persons with school education, managed by similar people with college degrees. Many of
the larger schools often provide transport services to pick up and drop children (thus generating a transport
demand of their own). There is also demand for add-on education services like coaching even for children
in public schools.

88.     Fourth, there is the economic activity generated by cellphones and the ecosystem that surrounds
them. Not only is there indirect activity, there is also direct activity in terms of sales of phones, repair,
recharge of talk-time, downloads of music and videos, etc. This is a relatively low cost entry business and
success would depend on location of the shop.

89.      Finally, there is health services, with the growth of private health care, some of it based on tele-
medicine as in the Sky health centres in Bihar as well as non-certified health care providers of varying hues.
There are also supportive activities, such as chemist’s shops, diagnostic centres, and pathology sample
collection centres, supported by the relative large share of private out of pocket health expenditures.
IV.1.3. Financing

90.    Since the financial scale of most of these activities is small, they are usually provided by friends
and family or from personal savings, which may depend on remittances and savings as a result of migration.
Formal bank finance is available for transport. Funds are also generated by the sale of agricultural land. In


                                                                                                            26
Erein, it was found that compensation received for land acquisition was invested in small economic
activities. In Gopalpur (and Erein too), there were also co-operative financial institutions who extended
finance.



 Box IV.1 Women and labor participation

 In all the settlements studies, there are women involved in the local governance structure thanks to the
 quota provided in the 73rd and 74th, but their role appeared to be limited.
 In terms of employment, their participation is also limited. Women are involved in agriculture in Satghara
 and in South Behar (Jhanjarpur). In Satghara, the rising involvement of women in agriculture seem to be
 triggered by the departure of men for migration while in Gopalpur women engaged in agriculture mostly
 belong to lower caste group.
 Women jobs in services is limited though one finds teachers in Gopalpur and in Jhanjarpur, where women
 are also employees of the urban local body.
 The only location where women seem to be involved at a large scale is the bidi industry in Gopalpur. An
 estimated 500 to 600 bidi makers are working in Gopalpur, a number that is increasing every year.
 Women, particularly, are joining the industry as they can complete their household chores and make
 bidis during the remaining time. On an average, each woman makes Rs. 4000 to 5000 bidi per week. Of
 late, they are getting paid Rs. 78 for 1000 bidi as their labor charge.
 There are some informal work, at times prompted by the Self Help Groups that exist in Simri and
 Gopalpur. In Gopalpur, women make puffed rice but in Simri, the Self Help Group does not work very
 well. Other casual activities are selling fruits and vegetables in the markets or the involvement in
 traditional caste-based activities. This is the case in Bishnugarh Cherra where women are involved in the
 local wine making industry and in Satghara where 250 to 300 women are engaged in bangle making. In
 Jhanharpur, around 50 women are employed in a rice mill located outside the town boundaries and
 Gopalpur where some women are involved in rice mills and ice cream factories.
 Finally, in Simri, there is mention of the difficulty to open bank accounts that is a hurdle for women since
 they depend on remittances and for widows who are beneficiaries of government schemes. This problem
 is not mentioned in other settlements but would be worth exploring since it does affect women
 livelihoods.

V.       THE MANY STAKES THAT CHARACTERIZE GOVERNANCE

91.      This section examines the manner in which the existing rural/urban dichotomy is debated by local
actors and shaped by the state legislation’s definition on urban settlements. In these five settlements, the
results show that the form of governance of these CTs (rural vs. urban) is discussed locally and their status
is contested. Four common factors shape these debates: (i) the comparative level of service provision, (ii)
the role of taxes and public schemes, (iii) the nature of their non-farm activity and the related land use
changes, and (iv) local socio-political formations. However, the aspirations for urban status is not uniform
and these perceptions about economic trade-offs are influenced by regional configurations, social settings
and local power structures. This section also underlines that, with the relative exception of West Bengal,
the administrative capacity is weak and impacts the potential for local governance.


V.1.     A cost benefit analysis of the urban status seen from below

92.      The literature review had highlighted a number of factors that could either be drivers or factor of
resistance to becoming urban. Many of these aspects are indeed raised by the persons interviewed during
the field work, in particular the sarpanch and ward members.

93.      A first argument against the urban status is the higher level of taxes. This is evident in all the cases
studied. In Erein, the resistance to taxes was unanimous ranging from residents, shop owners and rice mill
owners who feared that a potential merger with Bhadrak Municipal Corporation would entail higher taxes.
The only CT where the discussion on taxes differs is Gopalpur, where members of the panchayat believe
that people are ready to pay for better urban services for which there is a demand. In Gopalpur users have
experienced better service provision, e.g., improved water supply and there may be a belief in government’s
ability to deliver and a stronger administrative capacity (see Table V.1) that is likely to increase confidence
in service delivery. A question that remains is the extent to which the resistance to higher taxes is driven
by the belief that taxes will not lead to improvement in services.

94.     Second, the bigger existing package of schemes for rural areas is not as important a factor as could
have been expected in favor of rural governance. It is mentioned in Erein, Odisha and in the CTs in Bihar
but the perception of trade-off depends on the social composition of the wards. In Erein, the loss of



                                                                                                               28
MGNREGS and IAY is seen as having a potential negative impact of becoming urban in the poor wards
but this is not the case in wealthier wards. In Bihar, the inefficiency of MGNREGS, which has been stopped
in the last six months according to our interviews, neutralizes the weight of public schemes. Rural schemes
do not seem to make much of a difference, at least for the local elite.

95.      A third difference, and an important one, between urban and rural governance is the bringing of
urban bye-laws and planning devices. In our case studies, except in Erein that is located in close proximity
to a municipal corporation where urban planning and urban regulation apply, there is no direct reference to
the trade-off related to urban norms. Conversely, in the statutory town of Jhanjharpur Railway Station, the
spatial expansion is partly driven by the absence of authorization for construction and cheaper land values
in the surrounding villages.

96.       Fourthly, access to better urban services, water, sanitation, solid waste management and drainage
can be a major benefit from an urban status since additional funds are provided for these. However, as seen
from section II.1.2 and Figure II.1, the evidence that there will be actual improvement is limited, at best.
The question of basic amenities is the main discussed topic in the governance debate. In Bishnugarh and
Cherra both the sarpanch believe that urban governance would automatically lead to better services and job
opportunities, almost as a manifestation of faith that some external driver would change the settlement. This
is shared by the residents and the elected members in Gopalpur whose preference is in favour of additional
funds for urban services rather than rural public schemes. The Bihar case provides a more conflicting view
and brings to the fore a facet of the debate that is not visible in the existing literature. The very low level of
services, in Jhanjharpur but in Madhubani as well according to the fieldwork interviews, act as a
justification for many sarpanch and ward members to reject the idea of becoming urban. If the only
advantage of becoming urban is the prospect of better urban amenities that are nowhere to be seen in the
district then this is not an attractive proposition. As the president of the North Behat Panchayat states, “we
do not want to join Jhanjharpur Nagar Panchayat because development is better in Gram Panchayat than
nagar panchayat”. In other words, the trade-offs between remaining rural or becoming urban are not seen
by the actors in a vacuum but are embedded with their understanding of what the urban signifies in their
regional context.

97.      Finally, the field work conducted in the various sites unveils other issues that are only touched upon
very sparsely in the literature. One of these issues is the necessity in many cases of realignment of
jurisdictions. Another is the connection of the debate on the urban status with its social outcomes and related
to social conflicts as well as its impact on the local politics and the local power structure.

98.       In Erein the urbanization process has been marked by displacement due to large public sector
schemes and increased social disparities between the new “middle class” inhabitants (public sector
employees working in the district headquarter of Bhadrak) and its poorest inhabitants concentrated in tribal,
Dalit and Muslim neighbourhoods. Dalit and Muslims’ wards are deprived of electricity which they access
illegally and in these wards the fear of having to pay taxes is combined with a sense of exclusion that would
be furthered with an urban status. In the tribal wards, a similar sense prevails that is accompanied by a
genuine feeling that becoming urban would entail a loss of the rural identity of Erein as compared to the
Bhadrak Municipal Corporation.

99.      In Bihar, the socio-political dimension is central and this is seen in the case studies and also in other
sites that were not included in the final selection of settlements.

100.     A first apparent outcome of becoming urban is the manner in which it can modify the local power
structure by favoring some political leaders above others. This reconfiguration of local political leadership
was mentioned in Panadol (see box below) and in one of the neighboring villages of Satghara where people
fear that the Chairman of a newly constituted NP would be from Satghara itself to the detriment of the local
village leaders. In Erein, the mention of the increased cost of elections in urban local bodies, that local
leaders could not afford, is mentioned to justify this fear.

101.     Another concern is the disruption of local village politics. There is a prevailing sense that a GP
takes care of the interests of a wider group of people and is linked to a specific form of patronage around
allocation of public schemes benefits. The availability of urban funds for improved infrastructure, in
particular small roads, leads to another network of actors that involve small public works contractors.
Beyond this reshaping of political incentive, the urban/rural discussion reveals the division of opinions
along class and caste lines.

102.     In Benipatti, another large village, local politicians better connected to higher levels of government
and local businessmen are in favour of an urban status. The rural/urban question is framed in a local
elite/non local elite framework.


 Box V.1. The socio-political debate around urban governance: narratives from Bihar
 Shift to urban governance and Reshaping of political configurations
 Village of Pandaul, a local inhabitant:
 “The reason many do not want the GP to turn into a town is because the āzadi (freedom) will be taken
 away from the multiple representatives. If 10 mukhiyas are going to be replaced by 1 chairman, who
 wants to relinquish power?”
 Shift of urban governance and its embeddedness in social structures
 Satghara, a retired teacher from Karahiya East GP:
 ‘‘Creation of nagar panchayat will help only Suri, Sonar and Marwari castes. Leaders who live in Bazaar
 are demanding for it as they do not get anything from GP. It is the poor people who benefit from GP like
 MGNREGS, IAY and other schemes. We have CM funds for Mahadalits who just live on the outskirts
 of our village, who will get deprived and majority of them are poor and landless. They do not get anything
 in NP. Let the proposal come up, we will oppose it and why should we pay taxes as we live in a village?’’
 Benipatti, the sarpanch:
 “It is simple: the satisfied rich people are the ones who want an NP because the commercial, landed class
 will most benefit from this. They are the same ones who run the NPs…In the NP there is no government,
 only money.”

103.     Despite the richness of the various conversations around urban aspirations they also have to be
understood within the legal definition that the State refer to for urban status, which require to turn our
attention to the actual practices observed on the ground related to the governance debate.

V.2.    Articulation of urban aspirations or resistance

104.     As can be seen from the Table I.1, a minimum population of 20,000 is required to become a
transitional urban area in Jharkhand; in West Bengal, the smallest urban settlement has to have a population
of 30,000 since there is no specific transitional urban area status. Consequently the new CTs are not close
to this threshold (around 7,000 people in Gopalpur and around 10,000 in total for Bishnugarh and Cherra
together). Beyond discussion, no concrete action has been taken in those sites to push for or resist a shift
towards an urban status.

105.     In Odisha, the threshold to become a transitional urban area is 10,000 above the actual population
of Erein (around 7,800 people) but its proximity to Bhadrak implies that it could be incorporated in the
corporation. According to interviews, some villages have been incorporated already40 and there is a master
plan in preparation 41 with Erein situated just at the limits. Consequently, some fear its potential engulfing
with Bhadrak and some rice mill owners had requested a stay order against incorporation.

106.     In Bihar, the question of procedures and practices is interesting since the threshold to become a
transitional urban area is not very high, around 12,000 a threshold that Jhanjharpur has crossed (around
30,000 people) and so has Ghoghardiha, the other NP in the district. Despite this high population as
compared to Simri or Satghara, nevertheless, both these NP do not have a very high share of male employed
in non-farm employment. The grounds on which the claim can be made to become urban or to change one’s
administrative status seem to be embedded in regional politics. In our case studies, there is no debate in
Simri about urban status. However, we will discuss the cases of Jhanjharpur, even though it already does
have an urban status, Satghara and Benipatti.

107.     In Jhanjharpur, during interviews with the Nagar Panchayat Chairman and local political leaders,
there were multiple references made to a new expansion plan for Jhanjharpur but no details were provided.
A plan to expand and improve the Jhanjharpur NP area was mentioned repeatedly by citizens and political
leaders, with constant references to the Master Plan that would include the Railway Station Market as well
as villages north of the NH junction (see Map V.1). It was reported by the NP authorities that an engineering
firm from Delhi had conducted a survey and it would submit a report to the NP based on which further
decisions would be taken; however, interviews with the firm and the district administration confirmed that
there is no official master plan sanctioned by NP or the district administration but that the MLA of
Jhanjharpur, also a Minister, had personally asked for the company to make a visit to Jhanjharpur. However,
there is also a long-standing rumor that Jhanjharpur will be the headquarters of a new district that will be
carved out from Madhubani. Some respondents in the RS market suggest that it will be better to be included
in a town (colloquially called township) after Jhanjharpur is declared as the district HQ. The reasoning
behind this is that the state administration will be forced to improve infrastructure in a new district HQ.
Becoming a district headquarter is therefore much more attractive than becoming a Nagar Panchayat since
it would necessarily involve public investments. The district administration however denies the existence
of any such plan.




40 On 20th May 2013, the Odisha Gazette notified the inclusion of four villages in the corporation (see

http://odisha.gov.in/govtpress/pdf/2013/1028.pdf).

 Map V.1: Jhanjharpur and Behat




108.     Satghara is another example of the necessary connection between local and regional politics to
further jurisdictional changes. During the year 1979-80, the Satghara Gram Panchayat passed a resolution
requesting the state government to declare Satghara as a Notified area. This plan was accompanied by a
bottom up mapping but since then, restructuring of Satghara and other GP villages was done without public
consultation. It is an exercise done by the district administration prior to the gram panchayat elections based
upon increase in population and administrative criteria and over time, many parts of neighboring GPs were
added or removed.

109.     In this new configuration, the villages or parts of villages that local leaders have suggested for
inclusion in a future Satghara Nagar Panchayat to the government is shown in Map V.2. It is a
recommendation to government based on geographical proximity to Satghara but this is not binding on the
government agencies. The district administration is the final authority in delimitation of GP or NPs.
However political influence does matter in inclusion and exclusion. Recently, in the year 2005, the Gram
Panchayat again passed a resolution which was sent to Panchayat Samiti and from there to Zilla Parishad
samiti, however it is a proposal passed by Satghara GP but not by the other neighboring GPs which are
proposed to be part of it. Based on this, the district magistrate decides to carry a feasibility study at to
whether the town is eligible for Nagar Panchayat or not. Despite the central administrative role played by
the district in this process, such a demand has to be accepted politically. The former MLA from Rajnagar
–Satghara says it was his political friends at the block level who requested him to raise the issue of Nagar
panchayat in the state assembly. He raised the issue verbally in the assembly in 2008 but nothing has
happened. According to him without No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the concerned Gram Panchayats
and the Panchayat Samiti, it cannot be declared Nagar Panchayat unless the Assembly declares otherwise.
There is no consensus by all the neighboring panchayat in fear of losing political clout, among others. The
experience of Satghara tells us is that there has to be a multi-level process of political acceptance for
becoming urban but this can be overruled by fiat either from the assembly or a jurisdictional realignment
by the district administration.


                                                                                                            33
 Map V.2: Proposed Satghara Agglomerate




 Notes: This represents the Satghata agglomeration that could be part of a Nagar Panchayat (see text). The parts in Gray are to
 be included in the NP. This is suggested by various interviews. The parts in Green are contiguous in built-up but no one has
 mentioned them yet (Except Karaiah East next to railway station). The parts in Pink are partially affected GP. The Red
 boundaries are Gram Panchayat boundaries while the thin black lines are the village boundaries. The dots with the numbers are
 the Wards.
 The future Satghara Nagar Panchayat would include Satghara revenue village (pop: 8,060) Mirzapur village (pop: 2,287), part
 of Tola Narkatiya, (about 2,500 people) of Bheria Bishnupur (pop: 4,857), part (Kasiyona , about 3,500 people) which is
 included in Karahiya (pop: 17,649) and part (Chichri Buzurg of Chichir Kanungoe (Ganj-tola, 3000).



110.     Finally, the case of the large village of Benipatti (where preliminary field work was done) provides
another example. A sub-divisional headquarter (since 1990) and a census town, which lies in the north-
west of Madhubani, it has a thriving market that contains many automotive showrooms, private and
government banks, mechanical sales and services, clothing stores that also benefits from its location on the
State Highway that connects it to Darbhanga, Madhubani and Sitamarhi district. For its local elite, the high
level of non-farm employment makes it worthy of being a township and there is a proposal submitted to the
District Magistrate to convert the Behata-Benipatti-Kataiyya agglomeration into a NP. This proposal has
been placed by the MLA but it seems that the three GPs have vetoed the proposal, a fact contradicted by
others who state that an official declaration will be made before state elections. Concretely, in the three
locations there is no a clear identification of leadership of who want a NP, except that the MLA is pushing
for this and is trying to include a number of local supporters.




                                                                                                                             34
111.     The three cases in Bihar, Jhanjharpur, Satghara and Benipatti reveal that the debate on urban status
is not held in a vacuum. On the ground, actions are taken, procedures are initiated to change the status of
settlements and to realign jurisdictions. These processes are intricately connected with the political power
structure and the formation of solid political alliances. It might even be that the push for urban is related to
shifting political constituencies. Thus, the term of “political classification” is entirely apt to describe the
stakes that surround the rural/urban debate. Nevertheless, beyond a political dimension, a central theme that
runs through these debates is the level of basic ‘urban’ amenities, to which we turn next.




                                                                                                             35
VI.     URBAN SERVICES AND CENSUS TOWNS

112.     This section summarizes findings relating to provision of services such as water supply, sanitation,
solid waste management and electricity. From the earlier discussion on urban status, it is not clear whether
the level of services in statutory towns is distinctly and visibly better than census towns. This is also a
finding that is seen in these sites, though with significant variance. Functions that are entrusted to ULBs
like solid waste management are at least staffed to be carried out, though actual delivery may vary. Most
of these settlements, with the exception of West Bengal, are not staffed to provide services. In Bihar, one
observed defunct water supply schemes in all three sites, where expenditure on infrastructure is rendered
infructuous, while in Gopalpur, West Bengal, the water supply schemes are quite functional.


VI.1.   SERVICES

113.     The profiles for each settlements based on census data (Table A.1) as well as the qualitative
interviews carried out in each settlements reveal significant variance in provision and expectation of basic
infrastructure, such as water supply. From Table A1, it is clear that among the three settlements in
Madhubani, Satghara (CT) is most comparable to the sites in the other states. Jhanjharpur (NP) despite
being a statutory town lags behind in most service indicators as compared to the CTs in other states. Indeed,
it is similar and often worse than Simri, a village in the same district. In Bihar, therefore, there does not
seem to be a major benefit from ST status. Erein’s position as being on the periphery of a large town appears
clear from indicators like the use of LPG, the ownership of two-wheelers and cars, and most importantly,
rented houses.


VI.1.1. Water Supply Service

114.      Water supply is the most varied across the settlements studied. All the three settlements in Bihar,
even the large village, Simri, have an overhead tank system, but none of them were functional. Since these
areas have a high water table and hand pumps were accessible for most households, this has not proved to
be a major problem in terms of water access, which brings into question the rationale for the original scheme
in the first place. While expectations from the state appear relatively to be relatively low here, the situation
is quite different in Gopalpur, where there is similar prevalence of hand pumps and a high water table, but
the water supply scheme is quite functional and there is a plan to extend it to more households (see Box 1).

115.   In Bishnugarh-Cherra, the situation is in-between. The Public Health Engineering Department
(PHED) constructed a surface water supply project, viz., “Bishnugarh Gramin Jala Purti Yojana” on the
Jamuniya River to provide pipeline water to the three villages of Cherra, Bishnugarh and Ramua in 1984.
However, supply is unreliable because of lack of proper maintenance. Those who get water from this
household connection have to pay Rs. 62/month. There were two community taps under this project, which
are now completely defunct. To address this situation, another water project is going to be constructed by
PHED on the Jamuniya River for which the budget is Rs. 7.73 crore.

116.    Water supply in Bishnugarh-Cherra is therefore largely through dug-wells and hand pumps.
Presently there are 17 dug wells and 41 hand pumps in Cherra and about 25 to 30 panchayat hand pumps
and 12 dug wells in Bishnugarh. The location of public hand pumps and panchayat dug wells is shown in
Box VI.1 In addition, people use tullu pumps (low horsepower pumps) both for irrigation and drinking
purposes. In the neighbourhood with concentration of scheduled caste population, most people have to rely
on the use of these pumps.



                                                                                                             36
 Box VI.1: Location of Public Hand pumps and Panchayat Dug Wells in Cherra

                                                        The map shows public hand pumps and dug
                                                        wells in Cherra. Dug wells are used for both
                                                        domestic and agricultural purposes. During the
                                                        rainy season, bleaching powder is used for the
                                                        dug wells to keep the water clean. Many
                                                        households have their own dug wells and many
                                                        others have hand pumps Most of the public
                                                        hand pumps are concentrated near schools and
                                                        offices (see map) while in residential areas,
                                                        people rely on their own private hand pumps.
                                                        The location of panchayat dug wells has a
                                                        relationship with political power, as seen in the
                                                        concentrated location on the map.

117.     In Erein, water supply is from a number of public tube wells (the reported number is 146) that are
available in the panchayat. Since the ground water level is quite high, (within five meters), it is not very
expensive to sink hand pumps and many individual hand pumps are also seen. Recently, about a year ago,
a piped water supply project under the Swajaldhara Scheme has been started in the panchayat and 60 percent
of the village expects to get water from the panchayat after implementation of the project,

118.    In Satghara, too, a water tank was built and water pipeline laid up to the market but water is rarely
supplied. However, some part of Karahaiya East GP gets water supply with some 4-5 public taps in the
area. Some people have taken household connections (Rs.10 for month is the nominal tax prescribed by the
PHED but hardly collected). There is no maintenance by the PHED or the Gram Panchayat. Individual
householders have to connect on their own as there is no staff to do so.

119.    In Simri, the situation is worse. A water tank to supply drinking water was built by the Public
Health Department (PHED) but the pipelines broke down soon after installation and have not been repaired
since. The tank is now defunct. A commonly held view, reflected by a shop is that it was built solely to
spend money. In any event, residents obtain water through public and private hand pumps and funds for
construction of hand pumps are available for the gram panchayat from MLA, MP, Chief Minister’s fund
and also the PHED. Residents of the village feel that the iron content is high from groundwater sources, but
as of now there is no proposal to repair the existing tank or build a new one.

120.     Oddly, in Jhanjharpur NP, the ST, the situation is no better. A water tank was constructed about
four years ago, but no pipeline was laid and therefore no water has been supplied. Officials claim that lack
of manpower and miscommunication between departments is to blame. The area around Jhanjharpur
railway station (RS) is dependent on public and private hand-pumps as is the NP area, though the number
of public pumps is lesser in the agrarian wards. Though the hand pumps are installed by the NP, GP or the
PHED, these are not well maintained and respondents complain that if a hand pump breaks down then none
of the authorities are willing to repair it. In some wards, local respondents say they collect money from the
neighborhood in order to pay for the repairs. However, while the respondents complain about the defunct
water tank and pipeline, they seem to be satisfied with the dependence on the hand-pump. There seems to
be no collective movement to either repair the tank infrastructure or install new hand pumps either in the
NP or the RS areas.

In Gopalpur, the Panchayat and the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) of the state
government supplies piped water and community taps through the Swajaldhara Project, using ground
water. Before commencement of Swajaldhara Project, this area was totally dependent on PHED’s hand
pumps. Besides piped water supply, the panchayat also provides hand pumps and deeper Mark-II tube
wells for the community’s use. As the panchayat’s supply coverage is not adequate, many households
have dug their own wells and tub wells. The use of hand pump or motor pumps depends on the financial
condition of the households.
There are two projects under Swajaldhara; one provides water to 350 households and another serves to
250 households. The households having water connections pay Rs. 60/month. There are also 30
roadside community taps under Swajaldhara. These two projects supply water thrice a day to a third of
the total households at the times indicated above.
There is a Beneficiary Committee, which consists of 10 members, and the head of the panchayat is the
president of the committee. This committee collects water taxes from the residents and they maintain
the total water supply system. Recently, in the last 4 -5 years, they have constructed many mark-IIs
(average depth of 250 to 300ft), which supply water round the year efficiently. There are 19 hand pumps
in the Gopalpur mouza, which are mainly concentrated in Gopalpur Madhyapara, Schoolpara and
Dakshinpara.
Though water access was very poor in the past during the dry season, they have overcome this problem
to some extent through installation of mark-II, which is the deepest tube well in the area. The problem
of water becomes acute during November to June (in part due to withdrawal of huge amount of ground
water for Boro rice cultivation) because of very low pressure in water from both the sources - household
tap and hand pump (which become defunct because of falling ground water levels). However, since the
water pressure is poor except in the households located near the pump houses, the Panchayat is not
giving permission to any households for further connections. The State Government has plans to supply
treated surface water through PHED from the river Punarvaba to all households. This project is expected
to considerably improve water supply in Gopalpur.




                                                                                                       38
VI.1.2. Sanitation, Sewerage

121.     None of the settlements studied had a drainage system or any arrangements for septage
management for the households with septic tank systems. Estimates by local politicians and informants
about the extent of coverage of individual toilets vary from the census estimates – in both directions,
overestimating coverage in Bihar and Jharkhand and underestimating coverage in West Bengal. Based on
the census data, it does appear that CTs have higher number of households with in-house latrines and with
septic tanks as compared to their district averages.

122.     Jhanjharpur (NP) had built a few public toilets but these were non-functional at the time of the
study. Both markets were prone to flooding during the monsoons due to overflow from the Kamala river;
but since the construction of a barrage two years ago, this has substantially reduced. The NP authorities say
that septic tank cleaning trucks are hired from Madhubani from time to time. North of the railway station,
the government housing for the railway and for the Kosi project are the only places where the sanitation is
in a better condition. In Satghara CT there is no functioning drainage network, even though it is always
flooded during monsoon. In a few areas, especially in Satghara old bazaar, drains were built several years
ago but are now choked by the garbage. According to the mukhiya, it is not a priority, because there is a
need for better roads and better planning first.


VI.1.3. Solid Waste Management

123.    None of the settlements studied, except one, provide solid waste collection and treatment services.
In these settlements, household garbage is usually dispersed or burnt. In some market places, the local
merchants make arrangements to collect and dispose waste (typically through burning). Special one-off
arrangements are also put in place by these merchants during festivals in order to handle the spike in solid
waste volumes during these times. However, there is no arrangement, indeed, no conception, of safe
disposal practices in these settlements.

124.     The exception is the only urban local body in the study, i.e., Jhanjharpur (NP), where there are 16
employees (one for every ward) retained for the purpose of sweeping and collecting solid waste. However,
even here, there is no arrangement for disposal. It is worth noting that Gopalpur panchayat is able to
organize itself to provide regular water supply, which is a much more complex service to provide but does
not provide solid waste management, while Jhanjharpur, which has relatively low governance effectiveness,
still provides this service, presumably because it has been allocated this responsibility under the 74th
amendment.


VI.1.4. Electricity

125.     Nationally, for services like electricity, there is no difference between census and statutory towns.
Figure VI.1 below shows the distribution of CTs and STs by the coverage of household electrification. As
can be seen, distributionally, there is little to choose between the two. This is unusual since it can be
surmised that statutory towns would get preference in electricity networks, and since CTs are
administratively villages, their electrification should be similar to rural areas. However, this does not appear
to be true. Since, unlike other services discussed here, many urban areas appear to be well served by
electricity, the question arises whether the causality may run the other way. More work would be needed
to understand if electrified villages are more likely to turn into CTs and whether the spread of electrification
lead the formation of CTs.

    is considerable variation between states regarding electricity supply in STs and CTs.

127.     While in West Bengal and Odisha, STs are better than CTs (though in West Bengal, this could be
due to the fact that STs tend to be larger towns), in Jharkhand, CTs do better than STs. Bihar is again an
outlier, where there is no clear pattern. Indeed, among the three sites, the ST, Jhanjharpur NP has levels of
household electricity access much lower than in Satghara CT (see Table A1).


VI.1.5. Education and Health

128.     As seen in the discussion on new economic activities, the state of health and education service
delivery has led to the growth of a vibrant private provision economy even in these smaller settlements.
This is aided by the rise of transport providers and better roads. However, there are public hospitals at two
of our sites, viz. Jhanjharpur NP and Bishugarh-Cherra. This aspect was not investigated in detail during
our fieldwork.




                                                                                                          41
VII.     KEY FINDINGS


VII.1. Economic Transformation

129.     This study is based on fieldwork at multiple locations in four states. These are Satghara, a census
town, Simri, a large village, Jhanjharpur, a statutory town and block headquarter, all in the Madhubani
district of Bihar; Erein, a census town near Bhadrak, a small class I district headquarter in Odisha;
Bishnugarh and Cherra, a paired set of co-located census towns in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand and
Gopalpur, a census town in, Dakshin Dinajpur district of West Bengal. This spread allows us to ask how
location-specific are the processes associated with urbanization and what commonalities, if any, one can
notice in these sites.

130.     A number of new activities are indeed common to many of these sites. These include activities
connected to construction, transport – both passenger and freight, education, health and cellphones. In
addition, better transport infrastructure, for instance, makes it possible for traditional activites like curd-
making, which earlier were limited to the local market to now serve a much larger regional market, making
it possible for more people to be employed in such activities. Large economic activities, like medium
manufacturing appear not to thrive in these areas, in major part, due to the lack of reliable electricity supply,
which would increase the cost considerably, by necessitating self-provision.

131.     However, much of the economic activity of these census towns remains rather “ordinary”
consisting mainly of non-tradable services and commerce. They are the sites that provide a wide variety of
services to a growing rural market which is growing more able to afford them and access them, both
physically in terms of infrastructure and socially, in terms of cultural mores. This banality of urbanization,
its commonplace ubiquity and non-remarkable nature of transformation masks a very important character
of this transformation, which is its resilience and permanence. Since it is not based on any major directed
external agency (except perhaps Erein in our sites), the process is organic and can be expected to continue,
with different degree of vitality at different sites.


VII.2.    Spatial Transformation

132.     The main observation regarding spatial transformation pertains to the pervasive nature of the
transformation underlying the emergence of new Census Towns. Even in the cases of Census Towns located
away from larger urban agglomerations, the increases in population densities and non-farm employment
which are driving the emergence of new Census Towns are playing out not only within but also around the
administrative limits of the Census Towns. And some of this transformation will remain invisible in terms
of statistical measurement of urban areas and population. It is useful to reiterate that the size and area of
villages in India vary enormously, even within a tehsil. However, the unit of determination as to whether a
settlement is a census town or not is the village. So, a naturally small village will never become a census
town even if its economic activities become completely non-farm because it will not meet the size criteria.
Similarly, a group of villages may be sufficient to be a census town as a group, but not individually. In this
manner, some forms of urbanization will remain invisible to the current system of measurement.

133.     More relevant however, is the fact that as the non-farm activity in a village spreads, the actual site
of the activity may be another village. In Gopalpur, one of our sites, for instance, the site of the main bazaar
is near the ferry crossing, which is connected by road to a major district road to the other bazaar site.
However, much of the first bazaar is in a different village, Bazrapukur, which is actually in a different



                                                                                                              42
panchayat. It is possible that much of the urban growth in Gopalpur census town will therefore be not
measured within Gopalpur and that the growth in Bazrapukur may not be sufficient to reclassify this into a
census town. This is one instance where the contiguous built-up methodology may be of use to identify
such clusters. However, keeping such a measure updated and discovering new sites is an issue.

134.    A similar issue is seen in Jhanjharpur, where the growth is outside the town boundaries, which
contain a substantial farm population. A redefinition of Jhanjharpur town to exclude its farming areas and
include its non-farm activity areas may lead to a cleaner urban rural separation. As it stands, the level of
amenities in Jhanjharpur town, which is a block headquarter, is much below that of a census town like
Satghara.


VII.3.    Provision of services

135.     At the start of this study, it was hypothesized that there would be a choice for people between urban
status, associated with a variety of public services like water and sanitation, street lights, etc. and rural
status, which offered a variety of schemes like IAY, MGNREGS, etc. However, as the study progressed, it
became clear that this was not an accurate characterization of the choices involved. In most of the case
studies, there were groups of citizens who were interested in urban status and others who were not and in
some places, like Satghara and Jhanjharpur or Benipatti (not a site but a village in Madhubani district near
our sites), there were extensive efforts that included the generation of maps, etc. to bring about a change in
status. This was associated with occupation, but also caste.

136.     The choice was complicated by the finding that urban status was not strongly associated with better
services in identifiable dimensions. This is true not just in our sites, but also appears to be true for census
towns and statutory towns more generally. More curiously, it may also be so for villages close to census
and statutory towns. It would appear that for smaller statutory towns, the level of public investment in
service provision is not high (see Khan 2014 for an example) and investment in private infrastructure such
as septic tanks may well be higher in census towns, due to higher incomes and no expectation of public
investment. In such a situation, the demand for statutory status often is associated with a demand for the
town to become administrative headquarters, e.g., a block headquarter or, in the case of Jhanjharpur, a
district headquarter.

137.      From the earlier discussion on urban status, it is not clear whether the level of services in statutory
towns is distinctly and visibly better than census towns. This is also a finding that is seen in these sites,
though with significant variance. Functions that are entrusted to ULBs like solid waste management are at
least staffed to be carried out, though actual delivery may vary. Most of these settlements, with the exception
of West Bengal, are not staffed to provide services. In Bihar, one observed defunct water supply schemes
in all three sites, where expenditure on infrastructure is rendered infructuous.

138.     Some of these results from the qualitative fieldwork may be specific to poorer states, and in more
developed states, the monetization of land may, inter alia, play a more central role and can trigger a potential
for capital surplus later invested in more productive activities.


VII.4. Is Bihar different? Pair-wise comparison

139.    The lack of association between status and service provision may be specific to Bihar, as illustrated
by comparison of Simri and Satghara as well as Satghara and Jhanjharpur. The purpose of this comparison
was to illustrate the position of a large village, a census town and a statutory town with regards to their
governance and their economic structure, as in Table II.3. Our results show that these three types of


                                                                                                              43
settlement cannot be seen as being on a linear continuous process from rural to urban. First, in terms of its
employment structure, Jhanjharpur’s percentage of male employed in non-farm activities is closer to Simri,
at below 50 per cent as compared to 81% in Satghara. In this sense it is among the few STs that do not meet
the census criteria. Jhanjharpur is worse than Simri and much worse than Satghara in terms of electricity
access. This is surprising since electricity is publicly provided as compared to septic tanks, which are based
on private individual investments. In terms of overall service provision, the statutory town, Jhanjharpur is
closer to Simri than Satghara, which is far better serviced. If services define a form of urbanity (or urban
quality of life), then the census town is much ahead of the statutory town in this instance. In other words,
the reason for Jhanjharpur becoming a NP either is linked to its higher population (pop: 30,590 people) or
to other governance processes, e.g., the presence of the block headquarters (which is not the case with
Benipatti, for example).

140.     In Simri, people clearly see themselves as part of a rural settlement and most dominating caste still
owns large tracts of land. In addition, its connectivity is very limited as compared to Satghara and
Jhanjharpur, which constrains its expansion as a node for non-farm activities. It is worth speculating as to
whether the intense demand for urban status by parts of the Satghara population is related to this situation
of non-farm work and better services, while Simri, being of similar administrative status and population
size, has no such demand. The caste dynamics of Bihar is also evident in the divide between the bazaar
(market) and basti (settlement). The demand for urban status comes from the bazaar and the castes who are
in the majority in the CT, while the surrounding rural areas have a different caste composition, and are not
as much in favour of urban status.


VII.5. Initial Policy Implications

141.    The study results open up a number of questions for policy implications in terms of governance,
service provision and support for economic growth.

142.    A major policy implication in terms of governance, not just for the four states, but more generally,
is the need to plan at a more aggregated level, like the tehsil or the district, and not at the level of the
settlement. The existing separation between rural and urban that structure all public interventions and
governance structure is not in sync with the spatial and economic reality of these settlements that are
perceived as a territorial unit by most of the residents. Various options can be envisaged that would be
require more or less interventions ranging from evolving solutions to activate efficient district planning
committees as exists in today’s administrative organization to more radical solutions such as ending the
binary rural/urban created by the 73rd and the 74th constitutional amendment on decentralization.

143.      In terms of service provision, the study shows that the level of basic amenities remain very low.
Since these CTs are sites where increasing numbers of people live and work, even in states like Bihar with
high levels of outmigration, public investment to ensure higher levels of service provision such as water
and sanitation needs to be called for. In addition to increasing population densities, and even in the absence
of radical economic transformations, Census Towns appear as emerging centralities in their respective
territories. This is illustrated in these towns by the expansion of markets and increased regional commute
and brings demands for improvement in the provision of services such as solid waste management and
street lighting, which are mostly non-existent in Census Towns.

144.     In terms of economic activities, another important implication relates to the need spatially blind
policies aimed at improve access to services such as formal finance and electricity, with the objective of
enhancing the level of access of basic amenities but also the economic potential of CTs.
