Executive Summary
Background


An estimated 76,200 mutual funds worldwide currently control about $30 trillion1
in assets under management, representing just over 20 percent of total global
assets under management on behalf of investors worldwide.2 Mutual funds
have typically come about as an outcome of developed financial markets, not
a cause of it. Unsurprisingly, therefore, developed markets control roughly over
90 percent of mutual fund assets.3 Yet many developing countries are currently
seeking to foster a domestic mutual fund sector, because mutual funds provide
cost-effective, professionally managed diversification of risk to investors, while
supporting economic growth.

   Box 1.1: History of Investment Funds7

   History of Investment Funds
   The earliest investment fund was a closed-ended fund formed in the Netherlands in 1774. In 1868, such a fund was formed in Britain
   and in 1893 in the United States. The first open-ended mutual fund, which could continuously create and cancel units and thus vary its
   capital, was the Massachusetts Investment Trust created in the United States in 1924.8
   The first British fundâs objective remains true for that of a modern investment fund, specifically âto provide the investor of moderate
   means the same advantage as the large capitalist in diminishing risk by spreading investment.â9 Following the Wall Street crash of 1929,
   legal and regulatory frameworks specific to mutual funds started to be introduced, for example, the U.S. Investment Company Act of
   1940 and the U.K. Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act of 1939.10

   Open-Ended Mutual Fund
   Mutual funds are typically open-ended funds, that is, funds that are obliged to buy back their shares or units from holders on a regular
   (usually read as âdailyâ) basis. These funds can issue and redeem shares or units, allowing investors to invest in or divest from the fund.
   The fund assets are valued at their market price (mark-to-market) on a daily basis, hence allowing the daily calculation of net asset
   value of each share or unit in the fund that is the basis of the price at which investors buy or sell shares or units. This means that
   investors do not have to search for a seller of a share/unit in a mutual fund in the market. Instead the investors can purchase the share/
   unit directly from the fund, usually through the fund management company. Conversely, the holder of a share in a mutual fund does not
   have to look for a buyer but can sell it directly to the mutual fund.
   Open-ended funds are managed either passivelyâthat is, tracked to an indexâor activelyâwhereby the fund management company
   employs a specific strategy to invest assets. To ensure they can meet the potential liquidity demands on the fund, these funds are
   required to invest predominantly in liquid securities such as high-quality bonds, equities, and commercial paper or short-term deposits.11
   Volatile, illiquid, or shallow capital markets are thus not suitable to such funds because they cannot easily buy or sell assets to meet
   demand for sale or redemption.
   Another distinctive feature of open-ended funds is their pure equity capital structure: that is, they may raise money only by sale of
   shares or units and are not permitted to issue debt securities.12 Generally open-ended funds may only borrow up to 10 percent of their
   value, but only for the short term, and not to leverage returns.13
   Together, these features assure an investor into a publicly offered open-ended mutual fund that they are undertaking an unleveraged,
   diversified, and highly liquid investment.
   This âopenâ and see-through structure means that when an investor purchases mutual fund shares, the capital of the fund increases,
   and when an investor redeems shares, the capital of the fund decreases: hence the term âvariable capitalâ also applied to these funds.14

   United States
   With net assets of more than $15 trillion at year end 2013, or almost half of total global mutual fund assets under management, the
   worldâs largest mutual funds industry is located in the United States. Just over 46 percent of all U.S. households owned mutual funds at
   that date, many of them through retirement plans.37

   Europe
   Collectively European funds constituted just under a third of global mutual fund assets ($9.4 trillion) at year end 2013. Two international
   financial centers for funds sold across borders, Ireland and Luxembourg, respectively accounted for $1.4 trillion and $3 trillion of these assets.38
   At year end 2013, France ($1.5 trillion) and the United Kingdom ($1.2 trillion) were the largest domestic mutual fund markets in Europe.
   Financial integration in Europe has also catalyzed the development of a single market for mutual funds. Under the Undertakings for
   Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) directive, mutual funds can be marketed across borders; that is, a fund that
   is formed and approved in one European Economic Area (EEA)39 country under the directive can be marketed in another EEA member
   country, without additional approval.
   At the end of December 2013, the total value of European mutual funds was $9.3 trillion deriving from 34,743 funds, compared with $15
   trillion invested in 7,582 U.S. mutual funds at the same date.40

   Asia-Pacific
   At year end 2013, the Asia-Pacific region controlled $3.4 trillion in mutual fund assets, with approximately half the assets held by mutual
   funds in Australia ($1.6 trillion and 1,415 funds). China ($479 billion and 699 funds) and Japan ($774 billion and 4,922 funds) also have
   sizeable mutual fund sectors.41

  Box 1.3: Captive and Third-Party Distribution Channels

  A âcaptiveâ distribution channel is usually part of the same corporate group as the entity that operates the fund and typically will
  only sell the funds of the in-house fund operator. The most typical example of this is a bank that owns a fund management company
  and sells its mutual funds through bank branches. Another example would be an insurance company that owns a fund management
  company and uses its insurance direct sales force/agents to sell its funds.
  In contrast, a âthird-partyâ distribution channel is independent of the operator of the fund and its affiliates. Third-party distribution
  channels include sales through independent financial advisors,57 private banks,58 wealth management firms, and securities brokers. In
  turn, these advisers may receive fees and commissions from the fundâs operator (or more rarely the fund) for successful sales59 or be
  remunerated by way of fees payable by the client.
  In many countries âfund supermarketsâ provide third-party (usually online) platforms that house information on funds and allow
  different investment managers or fund families to sell their funds to individuals who use that platform. Such platforms may be owned
  by unaffiliated third parties, but they may also be owned by fund management companies; increasingly they provide services in more

  Box 1.4: Fund Charges and Share Classes

  Annual Management Charge
  The annual management charge, usually defined as a percentage of the value of fund assets, is paid by the fund to the fund management
  company or founder. This charge is primarily for selecting and managing the portfolio of the fund.

  Other Annual Costs Paid by Funds
  Although the cost of servicing investors in the fund is sometimes covered by the annual management charge, typically a separate
  administration or registration charge is made to the fund to covers such costs. The fund may also pay other charges separately for
  board remuneration and costs, fund administration, safe keeping of assets (custody), and supervision by a trustee or depositary (these
  may be a stated amount or a percentage of value or a mixture of these). One-off costs such as audit and legal fees are also typically
  paid by the fund. The investment research firm Morningstar finds that annual expenses are the most reliable predictor to a fundâs
  performance; thus investors are best off with funds that have low annual expenses.64

  Entry Charge
  Fund management companies have historically paid sales commissions to those who sell funds on their behalf (distribution channels),
  although this trend is changing in some developed and developing markets. Typically the fund management company pays the distributor
  an introductory commission from the entry charge it receives from investors subscribing to the fund and/or a âtrailâ commission (a
  percentage of the annual management fee that is paid annually for as long as the investor remains in the fund). Usually the fund
  management company negotiates the level of commission payable with the distributor concerned. However, increasingly in developed
  markets regulation requires investors, rather than the fund management company, to agree to any fee or commission payable with the
  distributor.65

  Exit Charges
  Exit and redemption charges are paid by the investor when they leave the fund. These charges help the fund management company
  manage the daily flows out of the fund.

  Share Classes and Charging Structures
  A fund can issue different classes of units or shares, each of which may have a different charging structure. As a general rule, the higher
  the charges of a fund, the more likely higher commissions are being paid to a distributor.
  For instance:
  â¢â¢ Institutional investors: Funds can issue a class of shares to institutional investors with no entry and no exit charge and a lower annual
     management charge (since in this case distributors are not being paid commissions).
  â¢â¢ Retail investors reached through a distributor: Funds can issue a class of shares to retail investors through a distributor, with higher
     entry charge and higher annual charge (used to pay commission to that distributor) but no exit charge.
  â¢â¢ Retail investors reached directly: Funds can issue a class of shares sold directly to the retail investor by the fund management company
     that may have no entry charge, a fairly high annual charge, and an exit charge.

   Legislation, Regulation, and
2.	
   Taxation of Mutual Funds
Introduction


A mutual fund sector will not expand strongly unless people are confident that
mutual funds are worthy of their trust. Thus law and regulation must adequately
protect investors, and a regulator must effectively and fairly enforce this legal
and regulatory framework. A weak legal and regulatory framework or failure to
enforce compliance with an adequate framework can negatively affect the mutual
fund industry. When investors are not confident in the market, they either do not
invest or pull out of mutual funds. In extreme scenarios, a loss of confidence in a
mutual fund can lead to a ârunâ on the fund, similar to a ârunâ on a bank, which
means the operator of the fund has to sell assets to meet redemption requests. If
the operator cannot raise the cash to meet redemption demands, investors may
further lose confidence, causing the ârunâ to accelerate. This could spill over to
investors losing confidence in all mutual funds, giving rise to systemic risk.1

One of the key objectives of regulating publicly offered mutual             Such schemes are commonly seen in both developed and emerging
funds is to maximize the potential for confidence by effectively            markets: They present dangers not only to investors but also to
protecting the interests of the fund investors from conflicts of            legitimate collective schemes that cannot pay similarly unrealistic
interests and asymmetries of information. Mutual fund regimes               levels of return and whose reputation may be damaged when the

between the fund operator and the investor and seek to prevent the          markets include the MMM scheme in Russia in the 1990s, involving
possibility of the fund operator (or its affiliates) stealing or misusing   millions of Russians, which could partly explain the relatively weak
fund assets.                                                                subsequent development of mutual funds in Russia. In Albania,

    Box 2.1: History of Mutual Fund Legislation

    The first mutual funds were created before legislation specific to these vehicles was written. These funds were set up both in the United
    States and the United Kingdom in the 1920s and 1930s, respectively, using existing law governing either companies or trusts.
    However, during and following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, investors into many of these funds suffered major losses because the
    funds took on excessive leverage (borrowing), and because operators of these funds were self-dealing, churning investors (moving
    them from fund to fund to generate commissions for sales persons), and sometimes stealing from the fund outright. These events
    created the impetus to introduce legislation governing mutual funds and protecting their investors. In 1939 the U.K. Prevention of Fraud
    (Investments) Act was passed. Research conducted in the 1930s in the United States revealed rampant fraud among members of the
    investment company industry and was the basis for the U.S. Congressâs considering it necessary to regulate funds. This was the genesis
    of the Investment Company Act of 1940.4
    Similar development patterns may be seen in some emerging markets. Unit trusts were set up in Zimbabwe, for instance, before the
    Collective Investment Schemes Act was passed in 1997. However, given lessons learned from global experiences with mutual funds,
    governments that want to develop mutual fund sectors typically seek to establish legal and regulatory frameworks to enable such funds
    before they start operation.

 Self-Regulatory Organization           â¢	 In some cases, the regulator may delegate to an SRO the power to regulate operators or service
 (SRO)a                                    providers of mutual funds. In this case, the regulator issues the license or permission to undertake the
                                           business. However, the license holder is required to become a member of an SRO (or the SRO) and is subject

 Third-party regulation                 â¢	 Law or regulation may place a duty on a depositary or a trustee to a mutual fund to undertake a
                                           day-to-day supervisory role, which includes being responsible for safekeeping the fund assets (such
                                           entities are also subject to regulatory supervision).
                                        â¢	 Law or regulation usually requires that an independent auditor audits each mutual fund and prepares
                                           annual financial statements for fund investors and the regulator. In some cases, the auditor may also
                                           be responsible for checking fund compliance with laws and regulations, and may be obliged to report any

  Box 2.3: Regulating by âFunctionâ or âInstitutionâ

  When a country is considering establishing or regulating financial or securities markets, it will need to decide on an optimal regulatory
  approach, as well as how to empower, resource, and establish the regulator.
  In considering the regulatory approach to the financial services industry, policy makers will need to consider whether to regulate by
  function or by institution:
  â¢â¢ If regulating by function, each financial services activity, which may (or may not) be under a financial services conglomerateâwhether
     banking, insurance, or mutual fund managementâwill need to be clearly distinguished18 and be separately subject to regulation
     and a specific regulator for that function (for example, securities business under a securities regulator and banking under a banking
     regulator).19
  â¢â¢ If regulating by institution, the financial services institutionâtypically a bankâwill be given blanket permission under a single banking
     license to carry out all categories of financial services business, which will be regulated by the banking regulator.
  Generally, regulating the mutual fund sector by âfunctionâ rather than by âinstitutionâ is preferable because it allows clearer definition
  and helps to eliminate conflicts of interest by creating internal âChinese walls.â

    Box 2.4: Variants on Mutual Funds Formed as Open-Ended Investment Companies

    U.S. Model
    The U.S. model is most like an ordinary company, with a board of directors. Typically an operator takes the initiative to create the fund.
    The board of directors is responsible for protecting fund investors. The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires 40 percent30 of these
    directors to be independent of the operator. The law also requires fund directors to supervise fund operations and oversee areas of
    conflict of interest (such as fees) between the operator and investors. The U.S. model relies heavily on the availability of competent and
    experienced persons to serve as fund directors, which would be more challenging in emerging markets with nascent mutual fund sectors.
    Since the U.S. model places strong fiduciary duty upon the directors also, it requires products such as directorsâ liability insurance, which
    may not be available in a developing market. Hence the U.S. model may be difficult to replicate in developing countries.
    â¢â¢ Operating the fund: The board of directors is responsible, and contracts the various providers of services to the fund.
    â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The board of directors contracts a custodian to safeguard the assets.
    â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: This role is undertaken by the directors of the fund.

    Continental Europe Model
    In the continental European model, the operator (typically the fund management company) will again take the initiative to create the
    fund and will appoint directors. Although the investment company has a board of directors, this model gives the depositary a high level
    of responsibility. The depositary is responsible both for safekeeping the assets of the fund and supervising its operation. The depositary
    is required to be at least functionally independent31 from the operator of the fund.
    â¢â¢ Operating the fund:
      â¢	 For an externally managed fund, the directors will enter into contracts with various entities to provide services to the fund (this
         variation is âexternally managedâ).
      â¢	 For a self-managed fund, the directors appoint staff to manage the investments of the fund and operate the fund, although some
         activities may be contracted out. Although this model is unusual, investment companies can be self-managed in some continental
         European countries (e.g., Luxembourg).
    â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The depositary is responsible for safeguarding the assets.
    â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: This role is undertaken by the depositary.

    U.K. Model
    The U.K. model32 includes the novel concept of an Authorised Corporate Director (ACD). Although the U.K. investment company with
    variable capital can have individual directors, it is required to have an ACD or a legal entity licensed to manage a CIS. The ACD is thus the
    operator of the fund. Because the ACD cannot as a director supervise the operator of the fund (itself), the depositary, which is required
    to be legally independent of the ACD, is required to undertake this role. The logic behind this approach is that it is easier to regulate
    a licensed entity, and require this entity to have adequate capital and insurance, than to regulate individual fund directors or recover
    substantial damages from them.
    â¢â¢ Operating the fund: The ACD is responsible for operating the fund.
    â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The depositary is responsible for safeguarding the assets.
    â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: This role is undertaken by the depositary.

  Box 2.5: Variants on Mutual Funds Formed as Unit Trusts

  Unit Trust Formed by Trust Deed between Operator and Licensed Corporate Trustee
  This is the most common variant and is used in the United Kingdom and in various emerging markets including Kenya and Nigeria. The
  trustee usually must be completely legally independent of the operator of the fund.
  â¢â¢ Operating the fund: The fund management company is responsible for operating the fund.
  â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The trustee is responsible for safeguarding the assets.
  â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: The trustee is responsible for supervising the operation of the fund.

  Unit Trust Formed by Trust Deed between Operator (or âSponsorâ of the Fund) and Individual Trustees
  This is an uncommon variant seen, for instance, in India. In India the trust deed may be either between the âsponsorâ of the fund and a
  licensed corporate trustee (who must be fully independent of each other), or between the âsponsorâ and a board of individual trustees
  (at least two-thirds must be independent of the sponsor). In the second case, the board of trustees functions similarly to the board of
  directors of investment companies. The âsponsorâ must be an entity holding a financial services license that meets certain fit and proper
  requirements and that owns at least 40 percent of the appointed investment management firm.
  â¢â¢ Operating the fund: The fund management company or sponsor is responsible for operating the fund.
  â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The assets must be held by a custodian, which can be affiliated to the operator or sponsor but must act
     independently of the sponsor.
  â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: The individual trustees or the corporate trustee are responsible for supervising the operation of the fund.

  Unit Trust Formed by Its Constitution and the Responsible Entity
  In this last variant, the trustee and the operator are ârolled upâ into a single licensed firm known as âthe responsible entity,â as seen in
  Australia. The fund is formed through a constitution, or a legally enforceable document between the responsible entity and the fund
  members. The constitution lays out the rights, duties, and liabilities of the responsible entity in operating the fund.
  â¢â¢ Operating the fund: The responsible entity operates the fund.
  â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The assets are held by a custodian, appointed by the responsible entity. The custodian must be functionally
     independent from the responsible entity.
  â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: The responsible entity supervises the operation of the fund

Box 2.6: Variants on Mutual Funds Formed as Contractual Funds

Classical Contractual Fund
This is a common form in continental Europe and countries influenced by continental European tradition, such as most of Central and
Eastern Europe, Russia, Latin America, and Asia. These funds have different names in different countries; in France and Luxembourg,
they are âFonds Communs de Placementâ (FCP); in Germany, they are âInvestmentfondsâ; in Spain they are known as âFondos Communes
de InversiÃ³nâ (FCI). Depending on the law of the country, the fund is typically created either by a contract between (1) the operator and
the depositary, with the investor becoming a party to the contract by buying units in the fund or (2) the operator and the investor, where
the investor buys units in the fund under the constitution and/or the prospectus of the fund.
â¢â¢ Operating the fund: The operator is responsible for operating the fund.
â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The depositary is responsible for safekeeping assets of the fund.
â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: The depositary is responsible for supervising the operation of the fund.

                                                           Contractual Fund Formed by Contract
                                                             between Operator and Depositary

Variant on Classical Contractual Fund
In this fairly rare variation, the fund is created by a contract between the operator and the custodian,a or sometimes the operator and
the investors. The fund must have a custodian to safeguard assets but does not require a depositary to supervise operation of the
fund. In some cases, supervision is by the founder of the fund, as in Turkey until 2012. In others, as in Peru and Saudi Arabia, the fund
has a âcouncilâ or âboardâ of individuals who may be elected by fund investors to oversee the operation of the fund and therefore have a
supervisory role. This may be considered a weaker governance structure in terms of protecting investors because while the depositary
supervises day-to-day fund operations, the council may meet intermittently and will depend on information provided to them by the
operator.
â¢â¢ Operating the fund: The operator is responsible for operation of the fund.
â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The custodiana is responsible for safekeeping assets of the fund.
â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: The council or the founder of the fund is responsible for supervising the fund.

Brazilian Condominium
The Brazilian condominium,39 a form of joint ownership deriving from Roman law, is very similar to a contractual fund. A licensed entity,
known as the âadministrator,â creates the fund through a constitution. The administrator is responsible for both operating and supervising
the fund. This is similar to the Australian âresponsible entity,â which combines the roles of operator and trustee within a single entity.
In the Brazilian model the administrator may appoint an investment management firm (to which it may or may not be affiliated) to
manage the assets of the fund. The administrator will also appoint a depositary, which has both safekeeping and supervisory duties. The
Brazilian administrator-based structure offers considerable flexibility and encourages sector development, because the administrators
can create and operate mutual funds for independent investment managers that meet fit and proper and regulatory requirements.
â¢â¢ Operating the fund: The administrator is responsible for operation of the fund.
â¢â¢ Safeguarding assets: The custodiana is responsible for safekeeping assets of the fund.
â¢â¢ Third-party supervision: The administrator is responsible for supervising the fund.

    Box 2.7: Closed-Ended Funds and U.K. Example

    Closed-Ended Funds
    Closed-ended funds essentially operate like an ordinary public company: They market a one-off issue of securities (similar to an initial
    public offering) to attract a minimum value of capital that makes the fund commercially viable. If they succeed in attracting this
    minimum amount, the fund is formed either with a permanent life, or a fixed life of a specified period stated in the prospectus (usually
    five to 50 years). The fund is then listed, adding to the range of securities available in the market. Because the fund does not have to
    redeem its shares or units, it does not need liquid underlying assets. Thus the fund can invest in infrastructure, real estate, and venture
    capitalâtype companies although such funds may also invest in liquid securities. If the portfolios of such funds do become liquid over
    time, then they can convert to open-ended form.
    Before fund-specific law existed, closed-ended funds were created either using trust or corporate law. Thus in some countries (such as
    the United Kingdom), law and regulation do not include closed-ended funds within the definition of a collective investment scheme, and
    thus law relating to CIS does not apply to closed-ended funds. This is why countries that have, for historical reasons, followed the United
    Kingdomâs approach to regulating collective investment schemes have regulatory frameworks which do not govern closed-ended funds.

    Closed-Ended Funds in the United Kingdom
    In the United Kingdom, closed-ended funds are known as âinvestment companies,â that is, companies that exist to make investments,
    instead of creating goods or providing services. They operate under company law.
    Although the market conduct regulator governs the investment management of closed-ended funds formed as investment companies,
    the investment companies themselves are regulated only by company law and tax and listing requirements. Tax rules require that these
    funds may not be a close company,64 may not invest more than 15 percent of their value in any one issuer, and must be listed on a stock
    exchange. âInvestment companiesâ are a specialist subset of listed securities that have their own listing rules because, for instance, they
    do not have trading histories when they are listed, unlike ordinary companies.

  Box 2.8: Mutual Funds Formed as Investment Companies

  Enabling mutual funds as investment companies with variable capital is often challenging, because company law will typically apply to
  such companies. The formation process can be both expensive and cumbersome because of added procedures required under company
  law. For instance, the fund will need to register with the registrar of companies, as well as seek regulatory approval.
  These issues can be dealt with in various ways:
  â¢â¢ Add special clauses to company law or commercial codes: This is often difficult, given the complexity of corporate law and the time taken
     to pass or to amend such laws.
  â¢â¢ Law that governs mutual funds can disapply the relevant sections of corporate law: This is quite a common approach but needs expertise
     to ensure all relevant matters are considered. The disapplication must be addressed in law rather than regulation.89
  â¢â¢ Exclude mutual funds from company law: In effect, mutual funds formed as investment companies would then operate only under
     mutual fund law and regulation. However, in this case, investors would be vulnerable unless mutual fund law addresses the governance,
     creation, operation, and winding up of such funds (as it would with contractual funds).



  Box 2.9: Mutual Funds and Retirement Savings

  In countries where mutual funds play a large role in retirement savings, the sector has witnessed significant growth. Australiaâs mutual
  fund market, for instance, has become one of the largest in the world, in good part due to the role these funds play in âsuperannuationâ
  or retirement savings. Similarly in the United States, retirement assets held in 2012 through defined contribution pensions and IRAs
  amounted to 48 percent of the value of all long-term mutual funds (investing in equities, bonds, and a mixture of these) and 14 percent
  of the value of all MMFs.90
  In the United States, many defined contributionâtype retirement plans, such as IRAs, also invest directly into mutual funds. These
  personal pension plans are tax-privileged âwrappers,â which are essentially an individual account owned by the contributor; the plan is
  the âwrapperâ like an envelope within which law permits certain assets to be held. One of these assets is mutual funds. Research dating
  from 201391 also showed that 92 percent of households that owned mutual funds were using them to save for retirement purposes and
  that 81 percent of households that owned mutual funds held those funds within employer-sponsored retirement plans, demonstrating
  the importance of retirement-related savings incentives.

  Box 2.10: Brazil and Peru Taxation Regime for Mutual Funds

  Brazil Come Cotas System
  Under Brazilâs system, tax is levied from a fund, at regular intervals, on the calculated returnsâboth income and gainsâwhich accumulate
  in the unit value. Cash is raised to pay this tax by redeeming the appropriate number of units.
  Called come cotasâliterally âeating unitsââit sounds simple. But this tax is not levied on equity funds or on closed-ended funds and is
  in effect a tax on accumulated interest. The tax rate levied is between 15 and 22.5 percent and is complicated to calculate, applying
  differently to those who hold through the tax period versus those that redeem within it, and it may vary according to fund maturities.
  Although complicated, this system does ensure that tax payment is not deferred until the unit is redeemed from the fund, which is a
  benefit for the tax authorities.

  Peru
  In Peru, each mutual fund was previously required to separately calculate the taxable income of each type of investor (corporations and
  individuals) and separately withhold this tax. This was because tax authorities wanted to effectively levy tax at the fund levelâeven
  though funds were not taxableâbecause it was easier to deal with a single fund than with hundreds or thousands of investors receiving
  returns.
  This complicated system was made more complicated because different investor types were taxable at different rates on income and
  on gains, although those with an income or gains of less than S/.20,000 (around $675) were exempt.
  In addition, bank deposits were not subject to such taxes, and contributions to the mandatory pension system was tax exempt and
  proceeds tax free, both of which made mutual funds less attractive to investors.
  This system was changed in 2013, and the mutual fundâs administrative burden has reduced because now the fund is only required
  to deduct a flat 5 percent from profits (both income and realized gains) when an investor redeems. The new system reduces the
  administrative burden, as well as achieves an attractive tax rate by international standards. However, the tax treatment of bank
  deposits still remains more favorable.

    the fund is more than six months old, investors may not own          2.	 The fund suffers no tax. The fund distributes income to the
    more than 12.5 percent of the fund, and the fund must have at            investor, which is subject to tax at the relevant tax rate; the

    Impediments to Mutual Fund
    Development
  Introduction


  This chapter explores the nature and significance of market, or nonlegal/regulatory,
  drivers and impediments in developing the domestic mutual fund sector. These
  impediments are divided into three categories. The first type of impediment is the level
  of demand for mutual funds; that is, whether the number of investors in a country that
  are aware of mutual funds and have the resources to invest in them is sufficient. These
  investors may be institutionalâsuch as pension schemes, insurance companies, and
  other mutual fundsâor they may be corporate entities.1 They may also be individuals,
  who are saving to meet short- or long-term needs. A second type of impediment is the
  nature and quality of investable assets for mutual funds, that is, whether the range of
  investable assets is sufficient for funds to spread risk adequately and whether those
  assets are liquid enough to facilitate the operation of open-ended funds. These assets
  are typically money market instruments, government and corporate bonds, equities,
  and sometimes derivatives and real estate. The third type of impediment is the market
  structure of the mutual fund sector and the market infrastructure of the country within
  which it operates. This market structure or infrastructure may restrict the potential for
  development of the sector, for instance, by restricting access to distribution channels
  or posing barriers to entry. Each of these factors is explored in the following sections.


  Demand
  Countries differ in whether mutual fund ownership derives                     In these countries, retail demand is clearly strong and institutional

  Box 3.1: Distinction between Retail and Institutional Demand

  In a retail transaction, the individual chooses which fund to buy (whether that choice is advised or not). The individual may buy the units
  or shares directly from the fund or within a wrapper such as a defined contribution pension scheme.
  In an institutional transaction, the manager of an institutional portfolio (insurance, pension, or another mutual fund) decides to invest in
  a fund, without reference to the wishes of the individual scheme member or policy holder. (See chapter 1 for more on this.)
  The differentiation between the two types of transactions is simple when dealing with mutual fund sales made to defined benefit
  pension schemes or insurance companies or to other mutual funds, which are clearly institutions.
  However, in practice this classification is not consistent or may not hold true in all markets. In some countries, such as Kenya, statistics
  on the mutual fund sector simply do not differentiate between institutional and retail sales. In some countries, sales classified as retail
  may be classified as institutional in other countries. For example, in the United States, sales made through defined contribution pension
  schemes are categorized as retail, whereas in France they are categorized as institutional. When demand for mutual funds derives from
  unit-linked insurance products, this may be treated statistically as deriving from an institution (the insurer) or from the individual who
  takes out the unit-linked plan.
  Of course, all demand eventually derives from individuals because it is individual money that contributes to pension schemes, pays
  for insurance policies, and takes ownership stakes in companies, including those companies that offer pension schemes and insurance
  policies.


Institutional Demand
In countries where institutional investorsâpension schemes,              Even if regulation allows pension schemes and insurance
insurance schemes,4 and corporatesâare not very well developed           companies to invest into mutual funds, institutional demand

  Box 3.3: Money Market Funds and the Risks of Constant Value MMFs in Volatile Interest Rate Environments

  Money market funds are popular when they offer higher returns through their access to wholesale money market interest rates together
  with diversification of risk. In competing with bank deposits, these funds may also encourage banks to provide better rates of interest.
  Such funds can become systemically significant providers of finance to corporates. For instance, in the United States, MMFs at the time
  of the credit crunch were estimated to own around 40 percent of commercial paper in issue.38
  However, a possible downside is that investors may be misled into investing into money market or other funds, thinking that their capital
  is safer than it is. If the funds underperform, disillusion could set in and confidence in funds may be damaged as a result. This is why brief,
  clear, comprehensible disclosure of risk is important.
  Constant value MMFs, in particular, may be inadvisable in environments with volatile interest rates.39 In Kenya, for example, Central
  Bank benchmark interest rates between 2000 and 2012 had abrupt movements with relative frequency, ranging roughly between 1
  percent and 20 percent. Unless constant value MMFs hold very short-term paper, it is probable that such interest rate volatility would
  cause capital loss sooner or later, and such funds would âbreak the buckâ and damage market confidence.

62 | MUTUAL FUNDS in developing markets: addressing challenges to growth
  Box 3.4: Achieving Investment Diversification in Ugandan Equity Mutual Funds

  Uganda, which has had a mutual funds law since 2003,65 had underlying regulations requiring a fund to have a minimum of 16 holdings
  (four investments capped at 10 percent of fund value and 12 investments capped at 5 percent). However, the Ugandan Securities
  Exchange had only eight listed domestic securities and seven cross-listings. Turnover on the exchange was around $6 million in the last
  quarter of 2012.
  This made it virtually impossible for an equity mutual fund to operate effectively; simply not enough different equities were available
  for an equity fund to achieve the diversification required by the regulations. It was also very unlikely that an equity fund that raised $5
  million could get invested within a three-month period.

    Box 3.5: Nontraditional Distribution Channels for Mutual Funds in India

    Almost three-quarters of mutual fund assets under management in India is derived from the four big metropolitan areasâChennai,
    Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbaiâand the top 35 metropolitan cities accounted for around 90 percent of assets under management as at
    year end September 2013.75
    The Indian government has been focused on the need to expand the distribution of mutual funds beyond the major cities. It has sought to
    expand distribution channels for funds by allowing sales through independent financial advisers remunerated by fees from their clients.
    The government has also allowed âsimple and performingâ mutual fund schemes to be sold through postal agents (India Post has
    branches all across India), retired government and semigovernment officials, retired bank officers with service of at least 10 years,
    and other similar persons such as bank correspondents and persons who sell other financial products. In response to this expansion in
    permitted distributors, the mutual funds trade association has developed a special Mutual Fund Foundation Certification and one-day
    Mutual Fund Foundation Certification training program for these groups.

 Accounting Standards
 Because of inconsistencies in Moroccan generally accepted
 accounting principles (GAAP), some large institutional investors
 make arbitrage between direct investments in fixed-income
 securities and indirect investments in the same class of assets
 through dedicated funds for accounting or tax purposes. The
 valuation of securities in the balance sheet of Moroccan companies
 differs between Moroccan GAAP and international financial reporting
 standards (IFRS). In particular, debt securities are valued at their
 nominal value under Moroccan GAAP, whereas shares or units of
 fixed income funds are valued at their net value (mark to market)
 as calculated and published weekly (or daily) by asset management
 companies. In this context, some institutional investors such as
 insurance companies can monitor their taxable income for a given year
 depending on how they invest their technical provisions, either directly
 in fixed income securities or indirectly through dedicated fixed income
 funds. Accounting standardsâand tax rulesâshould therefore be
 reviewed to converge toward IFRS and prevent such arbitrages.
