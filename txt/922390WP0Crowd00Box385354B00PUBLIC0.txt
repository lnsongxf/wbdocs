This work is being supported as part of the World Bank’s Global Facility for
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) project, the Open Data for Resilience
Initiative (OpenDRI). Engaging the public in the process of collecting data on
location and characteristics of basic infrastructure and critical facilities has become
a key pillar of the OpenDRI project, which has engaged in activities that incorporate
this approach in Colombia, Haiti, Malawi, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia
and the Philippines. Understanding how governments can better interact with
volunteer communities will be critical to the future development of OpenDRI’s
work. The research is carried out at the Extreme Citizen Science group, University
College London (UCL).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report is based on a six-month study of the use of volunteered geographic information
(VGI) by government. It focuses on government use of information relating to a location,
which was produced through what is known as “crowdsourcing”, the process of obtaining
information from many contributors amongst the general public, regardless of their
background and skill level. The aim of this report is to provide a guide for the successful
implementation of VGI in government.

The findings are that:                                    Specifically, the most significant issues that need to
                                                          be considered from the start of any VGI project are:
•	 There are some established cases of close
   collaboration between government and the               •	 How the data collected will contribute to
   public, which range from land management and              government process and the organizational issues
   biodiversity monitoring to disaster response.             that this entails.
   These examples demonstrate that successful
   interaction is possible under certain conditions.      •	 The ways traditional GIS practices and concerns
                                                             over organizational change might limit the

Introduction

The acceptance of volunteered geographic information (VGI) as a valued and useful source
of information for governments is growing at all levels. Put simply, VGI is “crowdsourced”
geographic information provided by a wide range of participants with varying levels of
education, knowledge and skills (see Michael Goodchild’s writing for the original definition of
the term). While a growing body of research demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of VGI
when compared to official or government produced data sets, the progression towards their
adoption and wider use is slow. There are a range of mechanisms and methods available for
ensuring that crowdsourced information is fit for purpose so concerns about data quality are
not the major reason for the lack of adoption. Instead, organizational practices, regulations
and legal issues limit the rate of change.

of data collection and maintenance.

Learning from past
implementation of geographic
information in government

The history of digital geographical information is intertwined with government activities.
The system commonly recognized as the first GIS was created by the Canadian
government in the 1960s to map land use and agricultural productivity and suitability.
Moreover, the use of geographical information by government bodies at all levels – from
the local to the regional, national and intergovernmental – continues to be one of the most
significant applications of GIS.

Research methodology

The overall structure of the research process was as follows. First, seven cases known to the
research team were developed collaboratively to establish the relevant information required
for each case study and develop a questionnaire with appropriate fields to capture this.
Once the pilot case studies had been developed in January 2014, they were transferred to a
website. The case studies, together with introductory material and details about the report,
provided the context for the questionnaire, which was integrated on the site.

The website and questionnaire were tested with five     the questionnaire, the research team continued to

Case studies:
structure AND overview
Each case study is intended to provide an example of the use of VGI by
government or by the public, and summarizes the context, positive and negative
outcomes and main lessons. The case studies are presented in full in a later
section and are all deliberately short, with the same structure.
First, a summary table provides general information about the case study in the format below:

  Interaction type   The flow of the data (either crowdsourced or authoritative), in
                     one of the categories introduced earlier: Public" Government,
                     Government" Public" Government or Public" Government" Public.


  Trigger event      A specific event that might have triggered the data sharing (e.g. change in data
                     license, natural disaster, etc.), where relevant.


  Domain             The area in which the data sets have been used. This may include both an
                     abstract characterisation of the general area (e.g. generic mapping) as well as
                     information about the specific field (e.g. update of national topographic database).


  Organization       The organization(s) that initiated the data sharing process and those that have
                     been actively involved in the whole project.


  Actors             Interested parties/stakeholders that have contributed to, or benefited from, the
                     data sharing process in any way.


  Data sets          The data sets that have been shared and used by the public or the authorities
                     (including new data sets generated).


  Process            The process followed to implement the data sharing, data integration and
                     cooperation.


  Feedback           The immediate result returned to the initiator of, and/or participants in, the data
                     sharing process, if any.


  Goal               The original goal of the project and reason for exploring crowdsourced
                     geographic information.


  Side effects       Any other issues or outcomes.


  Contact point      The person who has either provided details about, or been significantly involved
                     in, the case study, when available.




                                                                                                            15

Low resources and need for infrastructure
support
Interestingly, this situation can be a driver for both
well-established NMAs, such as the one in Canada
where updates are needed to mapping covering 10
million km2, and newly established ones, such as
in South Sudan where basic topographic features
are needed to build the first data infrastructure
of the new state. Similarly, the implementation of
ambitious efforts like the “Smart City” project in
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, need support from VGI.


Research and development efforts
This includes exploring new products or new
directions of research. Examples are CROS, a

Update authoritative spatial data sets
A step further is the aim to support established
spatial infrastructures. Keeping data sets up to date
(mainly through change detection projects) is a
crucial task, especially for NMAs as this guarantees
the quality of their services. Examples include
NRCan, Towns Conquer, New York City’s open data
initiative, Ulaanbaatar’s “Smart City” and the US
Census Bureau.

Technical aspects

Of specific relevance here is the need to formalize and standardize VGI before it can be used
in government systems. This influences the following aspects:

Combination of conventional and open
source data
Many crowdsourcing projects use a wide range of
software applications, both closed and open source.
The Corine Land Cover in France and Natural
Resources Canada case studies prove that combining
various tools in different applications can widen the
technical horizons of an application and create new

opportunities. However, access to the knowledge
and experience of using these software tools is not
available to everyone and requires high technical
abilities.

Success factors

Elements that contribute to the success of VGI projects should be considered from the
outset and are often linked to the original drivers.

Identification of appropriate cooperation                  Workshops

The clear message in this report is that there is no “magic bullet” or perfect methodology
for a VGI project. However, it does reveal that there are a series of issues which need to be
addressed when considering a crowdsourcing project. Attention to these issues can increase
the likelihood of successful adoption by government and acceptance by the public.

Summary and way forward

This report has reviewed VGI use in government and identified success factors
and challenges. While suggestions of crowdsourcing best practices that were
identified by Brabham (2013) are relevant here, such as the need to define the
problem clearly, ensuring commitment from the organization and knowing the
online community, this report identifies several factors specific to VGI projects.
To summarize, the factors likely to influence the use of VGI relate to the following:

                                                         FixMyStreet is a web-based application, launched in
                                                         February 2007, which enables the public to report
                                                         local problems (e.g. abandoned vehicles, graffiti, unlit
                                                         lampposts, potholes, litter). Reporting is facilitated
                                                         by the use of Ordnance Survey maps as a backdrop

                                                         Issues reported by users are propagated to the
                                                         relevant local authorities by email. Users reporting
                                                         a problem are contacted by FixMyStreet after four

mobilized through the GBIF data portal.

For the submission of observational data there are
species and site forms, with the latter allowing a
more detailed recording of biodiversity information.
The data from these forms and collections are
extracted and merged with other data sets in the
NBDC for insertion into their spatial databases. Data
is quickly checked and made available for access and
visualisation on an online map. Those who submit
their data to the system can access this data in the
future.

When there is particular need for observation
or data collection for a specific species there is a
call for “species in focus” where the importance,
reasoning and biodiversity importance of a specific
species is outlined. The NBDC ensures that the
contributors have their efforts well recognized and
advertised online. For example there is an annual
distinguished recorder award presented to the person
who has made an outstanding contribution. This
is very important in recognizing the work of the
volunteers who submit data to initiatives like this.
Workshops are also held on a frequent basis which
report on the progress of this project, the types
of uses that this data is being put to, and how the
project can be sustained and improved. Events such
as Bioblitz (held annually) involve the general public
in biodiversity data collection events which have an
aspect of fun and competition.

the volunteer OSM community allows both the
government and the public to work together to create
and make use of up-to-date and high-quality spatial
data. Importing large and detailed data sets like
addresses and buildings is a complex process that
requires technical resources, significant labor and
solid coordination between the OSM community and
others involved. In this case the information released
by DoITT was up to date and of high quality, but
the same cannot be said of all municipal data sets.
It should also be noted that DoITT has expressed
interest in incorporating OSM into other parts of
their data management practices but have so far
been unable to due to the conflict between OSM’s
share-alike license and the public domain license
required by NYC open data mandates. There has
also been a great deal of communication between
the city government, the OSM community and the
people working on the import, which is critical to the
success of these kinds of efforts. It will be important
and useful to revisit this project in the future in
order to learn more but so far it provides an excellent
example of cooperation between local government
and the volunteer OSM community around open
data.


Main lessons
•	 Releasing government data sets freely into the
   public domains means citizens can download and
   create their own applications.

•	 VGI communities like those of OSM can keep
   government data sets up to date even in large,
   dynamic cities.

•	 Cooperation between VGI communities and
   relevant government departments allows them to
   work together to create and make use of up-to-date
   and high-quality spatial data.

since the activity profiles must be assessed not only
in relation to the amount of tweets and followers
but also with respect to the quality and type of
information sent. The latter relate to different fields,
which include simple messages for informational
purposes up to more complex messages addressing
planning and territorial management. The research
team classified the hashtags used by most municipal
profiles into several categories and the most widely
represented information related to culture and
tourism, followed by geographical information,
utilities and weather forecasts. Messages about
governance are still quite limited except in some
cases, demonstrating that the potential of Twitter
as a collector and distributor of information on
complex issues around which to initiate debates
and discussions has not been realized. Only a few
municipalities have used Twitter for emergency and
risk management, such as Castelnuovo Garfagnana
(earthquake) and some municipalities in Sardinia
(flooding). Nevertheless it is worth noting that the
news about L’Aquila’s severe earthquake of 2009 was
first announced through Twitter before other media.
