About the Australian Aid Program
Australia’s aid program promotes Australia’s national interests by contributing to sustainable
economic growth and poverty reduction. The aid program focuses on two development outcomes:
supporting private sector development and strengthening human development. On 31 August 2015,
Australia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs launched the Ministerial Statement on engaging the private sector
in aid and development - Creating shared value through partnership which invites businesses to work
with the Australian Government to help solve our region’s development challenges. The Strategy
recognises the private sector as a driver of economic growth, incomes and jobs, and as a partner for
government to achieve more effective and sustainable aid outcomes. For more information, visit www.

About Carnival Australia
Carnival Australia was formed in July 2004 to meet the growing demand for cruising and the number of
Carnival Corporation & plc cruise companies homeporting ships from Australia and New Zealand. Since
then, Carnival Australia has led the rapid expansion of the industry, which has tripled in the past five
years alone and now sees well over 700,000 Australians take a cruise holiday each year. Today, Carnival
Australia represents three homeported brands in Australia – Carnival Cruise Lines, P&O Cruises and
Princess Cruises – as well as another four international cruise brands that visit the region annually –
Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises World Cruising and Seabourn. For more information,

Executive summary

In recent years cruising has become one of the fastest growing segments of the
tourism industry. Globally, the Pacific Islands account for a small fraction of the
cruise industry (around two per cent in 2015)1, but expected growth in the coming
years is high. Given their geographic proximity, Australia and New Zealand are the
most important source markets for the region.
The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) and Carnival Australia have partnered in an effort to
provide baseline data on the cruise sector’s impact on the economies of Pacific
Island Countries (PICs). Given the importance of tourism to the economies of
many Pacific Islands and the growth of cruise tourism, there is an opportunity
to support further strategic, targeted development of the sector to increase its
positive impact on local economies.
The focus of this study is on the cruise tourism sector in Papua New Guinea (PNG)
and Solomon Islands (SI). PNG received 136 cruise ship calls at various ports in
2015, (which is similar to 137 in 2007). However, whereas the average passenger
capacity of cruise ships in 2007 was 347 passengers, in 2015 average passenger
capacity was 705 passengers. This trend indicates an increase in large cruise ships
in recent years. While SI received a lower number of cruises, it displayed an upward
growth projection.
The study contributes to a wide body of evidence on the tourism sector in the
Pacific Islands and builds on the strategies and initiative proposed to support
growth. To enable comparison of results between parallel studies, this study has
taken into account the methodological approach adopted in earlier studies, in
particular the 2015 study on the cruise tourism sector in Vanuatu2.




1	   Cruise Line International Association (CLIA) 2014 Deployed Survey among 18 international brands shows 6 per cent of the global capacity was
     deployed in Australia/New Zealand and Pacific. CLIA 2014 Australia Cruise Industry Source Market Report shows 39 per cent of the Australian
     cruise market is in South Pacific.

                      Indirect economic impact is the revenue
                      received by local businesses that supply
                      goods and services to businesses benefiting
                      from direct economic impact. It is the second
                      round impact of cruise tourism. Data was
                                                                                    Transport         Retail stores          Other

                      with businesses in six visited ports where
                      questions were asked about their cost
                      structure and main suppliers.


                      Total economic impact is the direct economic impact plus the indirect economic impact
                      of each country. It is a measure of the total economic activity generated by cruise tourism. For
                      the purpose of this study the final total economic impact is broken down by sector and by final
                      beneficiary (i.e. government, private beneficiaries and leakage).


                      Added value is the contribution of total economic impact to GDP. It is calculated as a sum of
                      wages and profits generated from cruise tourism.


                      Employment impact is the total economic impact on employment in the country. Calculations
                      are based on the ratio of reported employment (full-time and part-time employment) to revenue by
                      sector. This ratio is then multiplied by revenue from cruise tourism in each sector to estimate the
                      final employment impact. The data was collected through face-to-face interviews with businesses
                      in six visited ports by asking questions about their total revenues and the number of people they
                      employ. For example, if the businesses noted they employ two workers and had AUD 20,000 of
                      revenue in 2015, then AUD 10,000 of total economic impact from cruise tourism generates one job
                      in this sector. Due to low business acumen some businesses could not provide full-time equivalent
                      figures, so instead reported on the number of people that worked in the business on the day of the
                      cruise. As a result we refer to employment impact as employment opportunities.
                      Throughout the study, monetary values are reported in Australian Dollars (AUD) unless
                      otherwise stated.

Methodology
This study is based on primary quantitative and qualitative data gathered from the passengers and crew
on two cruises in November 2015 and January 2016:
 Cruise 1: November 2015 - Pacific Dawn with 2020 passengers and 690 crew capacity visited five ports
   in PNG (Alotau, Kitava, Rabaul, Kiriwina and Doini Island)
 Cruise 2: January 2016 - Sea Princess with 2272 passengers and 875 crew capacity visited five ports in
   PNG (Alotau, Doini Island, Kiriwina, Kitava, and Rabaul), one port in SI (Honiara) and one port in Vanuatu
   (Port Villa)
The study also used interviews conducted with businesses serving the cruise tourism sector at the visited
ports, as well as data provided by cruise companies handling cruise ships in PNG and SI. The methodology
is closely aligned to the approaches adopted in earlier studies, in particular the 2014 study on the cruise
tourism sector in Vanuatu3. The four core tasks completed as part of this study were:
 Direct economic impact analysis based on the expenditure data of 2,254 cruise passengers who
   completed a short survey at five PNG ports4 and one SI port5, and gathered administrative data
 Indirect economic impact analysis pertaining to the cost structure of business beneficiaries (and their
   suppliers) using information collected from face-to-face interviews with businesses, and the inputs of
   in-country experts
 A list of opportunities to develop cruise tourism in PNG and SI based on qualitative research (focus
   groups, face-to-face interviews) with passengers at surveyed ports and businesses, cruise lines, ship
   agents and in-country workshops with local stakeholders. Participants were asked to provide personal
   views on the current barriers and future opportunities to cruise tourism at particular ports, or in PNG
   and SI in general
 A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) of a shortlist of opportunities to help prioritise future actions to improve
   the impact of cruise tourism in the relevant economies



     Economic impacts of cruise tourism expenditure
     This summary presents two estimates of cruise tourism expenditure:
      The economic impact on the researched ports in PNG (Alotau, Rabaul, Kiriwina, Kitava and Doini
        Island) and SI (Honiara). These estimates are based on the data obtained from the two cruises
        and scaled up by the number of times cruise ships of similar size are scheduled to visit these
        ports in 2016
      The economic impact on the whole of PNG and SI accounts for the fact that mainly smaller
        cruise ships call at the researched ports and at other ports in PNG and SI. Assumptions were
        revised to reflect the lower port fees paid by smaller ships, the lower number of passengers
        per ship arriving in each port and the frequency of port calls. Extrapolation using cruise ship
        schedules for 2015 then took place to provide a first estimate of the total economic impact of
        cruise tourism on each country’s economy

     Unless otherwise stated, the impact reported is based on the economic impact of the researched
     ports. Insufficient data was available to estimate the country level impacts other than in aggregate.

                    ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

                    Direct economic impact
                    Papua New Guinea
                    In 2015, cruise companies, passengers and crew spent an estimated AUD 5.7 million in PNG across the five
                    researched ports. Depending on the port, each cruise ship call contributed an average of between AUD
                    24,000 and AUD 159,000 to the local economy.
                    Extrapolating this figure to the entire country, the total direct economic impact of cruise tourism in PNG is
                    estimated at approximately AUD 6.3 million6, with the researched ports receiving 89 per cent of the total.
                    The leading source of expenditure is generated through cruise companies (which account for 54 per cent
                    of total expenditure) mainly through a variety of fees paid to ports, government agencies or communities.
                    The remaining expenditure (43 per cent) comes from passengers mainly through tour purchases, with
                    crew expenditure representing three per cent of the total.
                    The distribution of expenditure among ports differs. The majority of expenditure in PNG benefits Alotau
                    (42 per cent) and Rabaul (41 per cent), as these are the entry ports and most developed for tourism. A
                    summary of total expenditure with a breakdown by PNG ports is provided in Table ES1 and Figure ES1.
                    For the 2015 impact assessment in PNG, a total of 60 calls were assumed across the five researched
                    ports. There were an additional 76 calls made at mainly smaller island destinations by cruise ships of a
                    smaller average size (between 150 – 300 passengers). It is estimated that these additional calls contribute
                    much less (11 per cent) to the total cruise tourism impact in PNG. On this basis, the five researched ports
                    focussed on in this study are considered representative of total cruise tourism impact.




                    6	   Extrapolation accounts for 76 ship calls made at other PNG ports to those researched. Passengers, crew and cruise line operators’ expenditure
                         were adjusted accordingly to account for a much smaller average vessel size (150 – 300 passengers).

                    ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

                    Solomon Islands
                    The total direct economic impact to Honiara port in SI for 2015 is estimated at AUD 0.6 million with each
                    cruise ship call contributing an average of AUD 46,169 to the Honiara economy.
                    As in the case of PNG, when this data is extrapolated to account for the smaller cruise ships and other SI
                    ports of call, the total direct economic impact of cruise tourism is estimated at AUD 0.9 million7.
                    The majority of expenditure comes from cruise companies (65 per cent of total expenditure). The
                    remaining expenditure comes from passengers (31 per cent) and crew (four per cent). Table ES2 provides a
                    summary of headline expenditure and Figure ES2 provided a breakdown of its source.

Passenger expenditure
Depending on the port, average passenger expenditure is estimated between AUD 7 and AUD 76 per day
in PNG. Average passenger expenditure is estimated at AUD 28 per day in Honiara, SI.
Passenger expenditure varies significantly due to large differences in spending opportunities (e.g. pre-
booked tours through cruise companies are only available in Rabaul and Alotau), and other factors (such
as the availability of ATMs, foreign currency exchange, shaded areas and toilets ashore), which make
venturing ashore more attractive.
Figures ES3 and ES4 following provide a summary breakdown of expenditure by port and expenditure type
for PNG and SI respectively.

                        Key drivers of passengers spend:

                                        Time passengers spend on shore: Studies across different countries consistently
                                        highlight that passengers who spend more time ashore also spend more.


                                        Passengers’ satisfaction with the variety of things to see and do: Passengers spend
                                        more if they think there are a greater variety of things to see and do. The majority of
                                        passengers that spent in PNG and SI would spend more on clothing, watches/jewellery
                                        and handicraft/souvenirs if more options were available.


                                        Availability of pre-booked tours: Passengers who pre-booked tours10 spent
                                        significantly more (on average AUD 79 in PNG) than those who did not pre-book tours
                                        (on average AUD 21 in PNG). Relative to other goods and services currently available,
                                        pre-booked tours are the most costly (up to AUD 130), but many passengers purchase
                                        them (47 per cent of passengers in Alotau and 48 per cent of passengers in Rabaul).
                                        Passengers with pre-purchased tours spend less on transport and more on souvenirs.




                    Crew expenditure
                    Due to only a small number of survey responses from crew members, the estimates of crew expenditure
                    are based on the Vanuatu 2014 study. Ports were classified into two groups: small ports (Doini Islands,
                    Kiriwina and Kitava) and medium ports (Alotau, Rabaul and Honiara). Based on the Vanuatu 2014 findings,
                    the analysis assumes that crew members spend an average of AUD 5 per day at small ports and AUD 28
                    per day at medium ports.



                                        PNG and SI lack pull factors for crew members to go and spend ashore. Global studies11
                                        indicate that crew members go ashore to access low-cost communication services (i.e.
                                        internet and phone) as on-board alternatives are expensive, food and beverage at local
                                        restaurants and bars, entertainment/night clubs and transportation from the ship to
                                        these amenities. They also tend to spend on clothes and electronics. All these facilities/
                                        products are scarce or not available in PNG and SI.

Cruise line expenditure
The majority of cruise company expenditure per port call relates to fees that directly flow to the
government. These fees differ significantly by port.
Port fees charged at the port of entry into the country (i.e. Alotau and Honiara) are higher, due to national
customs and immigration fees paid. Port fees also differ by vessel size. For the five researched ports in
PNG, the average size of a cruise ship per call was between 1,300 and 1,900 passengers, compared to 530
passengers in Honiara12.
Other company expenses on goods and services include port agent fees and corporate operational
expenditure.
Data for this assessment is based on internal estimates by Carnival Australia. Care was taken in using this
data by triangulating with information gathered from stakeholders including ship agents in PNG and SI.
Estimated total cruise line expenditure by port in 2015 is provided in Figure ES5.

12	 To account for differences in average passenger capacity and vessel size, cruise line estimates on port fees paid were re-weighted for ports
    where average passenger capacity was <700 pax (i.e. Honiara). It was assumed port fee per passenger are twice as high for smaller vessels (<700
    pax) if compared to bigger vessels. This assumption is based on the results of Anonymous Survey of Cruise Operators Expenses conducted by
    Seaports in 2014.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

                    Executive Summary JUNE 2016




                    Indirect economic impact
                    Indirect economic impact in PNG is estimated at AUD 0.2 million in PNG and AUD 0.04 million in SI. Small
                    indirect economic impact is a result of short supply chains and the structure of the economy.
                    Indirect economic impact is the revenue received by local businesses that supply goods and services to
                    businesses directly benefiting from cruise tourism. It is the second round impact of cruise tourism and the
                    size of this impact indicates how money multiplies in the economy.
                    The following are the two main reasons why the observed indirect impacts are low in both PNG and SI.
                     A large proportion of businesses directly benefiting from cruise tourism operate in the informal
                       subsistence economy of farming and fishing. Data from this informal economy is difficult to capture
                       and has limited indirect impact as revenue is kept by the family producing the good or service. Direct
                       income contributes directly to the household budget in such cases. This informal economic activity
                       is much more pronounced in PNG and SI than in other tourist destinations and should be taken into
                       account when interpreting this impact
                     By definition, indirect impact excludes the portion of direct economic impact that goes to the
                       government. Compared to other cruise tourist destinations (i.e. Vanuatu) the share of direct
                       expenditure that goes to government is large


                    Total economic impact
                    The total economic impact of cruise tourism is calculated as direct plus indirect economic impact. Total
                    economic impact in PNG is estimated at AUD 5.9 million. Total economic impact in SI is estimated at AUD
                    0.64 million.
                    Final beneficiaries of total economic impact are government and local private beneficiaries. Part of the
                    impact leaks into the economy through imports (e.g. insurance, fuel costs, profit to foreign owners of
                    businesses, employees).
                    Forty-three per cent (PNG) and twenty-seven per cent (SI) of total economic impact of cruise tourism
                    benefits local private beneficiaries. Governments receive 51 per cent (PNG) and 63 per cent (SI) of
                    expenditure. Estimated leakage is 6 per cent (PNG) and 10 per cent (SI).
                    The observed structure of total economic impact is a result of the following features of the cruise tourism
                    industry:
                     The impact on government is high because of a high share of collected port fees relative to other
                       expenditure
                     The impact on private beneficiaries is high as the expenditure from cruise industry predominantly flows
                       into tours operators and handmade souvenir businesses. These sectors are labour intensive, locally
                       owned and almost independent from imports
                     The impact on private beneficiaries is further increased because a large share of the economy in each
                       country is considered informal (i.e. businesses do not pay tax). It is assumed that the entire expenditure
                       at Doini Island, Kiriwina and Kitava flows into such subsistence economies

                    The added value of cruise tourism to PNG’s GDP is estimated at AUD 1.1 million or 0.01 per cent of GDP in
                    2015. The gross value added of cruise tourism to SI’s GDP is estimated at AUD 0.09 million or 0.01 per cent
                    of GDP in 2015.

Employment impact
In PNG, cruise tourism generated an estimated 203 employment opportunities (0.6 per cent of working
age population of the five researched ports). In SI, the industry generated 21 employment opportunities
in Honiara (or 0.06 per cent of the working age population). Measured employment opportunities relate
only to the private sector and exclude any impact by cruise tourism on employment in the public sector.
Figure ES6 presents the estimated impact of cruise tourism on employment opportunities in PNG and SI
by sector and by port.
These figures do not indicate full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs only but the number of jobs (including a
mixture of full-time and part-time/ad hoc employment depending on the sector) that cruise tourism
generates. The estimates are calculated on a ratio of reported employment to revenue for each sector
based on data obtained from interviews with businesses. For each sector, these numbers were used to
estimate the employment ratios which were applied to the total direct and indirect economic impact for
private beneficiaries. Due to the limited understanding of some business representatives interviewed,
full-time equivalent figures for employment were not provided. Instead, the number of employees
working in the business on the day of the cruise (e.g. the number of family members selling handicrafts)
was reported. As a result, for the purpose of this study, employment impact is referred to as employment
opportunities or jobs.
In line with the approach adopted in the Vanuatu 2014 study, the employment impact does not include
employment resulting from fees paid by cruise operators at ports or other tax and duty collections. But
given the significant size of this expenditure relative to other spend in PNG and SI some employment
impact is likely to occur (i.e. in port and government administration).
The specialist tourist retail sector (selling handicrafts and souvenirs) benefits the most in terms of total
employment opportunities despite the fact that this sector receives only about six per cent of total
economic impact in both PNG and SI. Handicraft and souvenir businesses have many ‘employees’ and are
mainly family run, but the intake from cruise tourism is low and not consistent because businesses only
open when a cruise ship is in port. For instance, based on qualitative research there are many handicraft
sellers at Kiriwina, but the majority of sellers are subsistence farmers. As a consequence, the number of
full-time equivalent employment created by cruise tourism is currently low as cruise calls are infrequent
and last for only a day. But the number of employment opportunities created is high since many people
engage in the sector once the cruise ship arrives.
The lessons of Vanuatu and Fiji (as more developed tourism economies) illustrate the future potential
for PNG and SI. Increasing the frequency of cruise calls and the numbers of passengers will encourage
local businesses to establish permanent retail premises and employ of full-time staff. The Vanuatu study
estimated full-time equivalent employment at 1,170 jobs. Similar numbers can be expected in PNG and
SI given a similar number and frequency of cruise passengers. Many of these jobs would come from the
services and amenities that are not yet available in PNG and SI, and/or new products such as organised
tours.

                    Summary of opportunities for improving the impact of cruise
                    tourism
                    To support stakeholder efforts to improve the economic impact of cruise tourism in PNG and SI, 11
                    options (six for PNG and five for SI) comprising of groups of preferred actions were subjected to a cost-
                    benefit analysis (CBA). The CBA validates the robustness of these options using the best available
                    information and data from Carnival Australia, Seaports Group and other published sources. Where
                    assumptions are made, they are set out in Section 6 of the study (and accompanying annexes).
                    To select the shortlist of the options, the Consultant firstly considered a long list of actions gathered
                    from businesses, in-country workshops and consultations within DFAT, Carnival Australia and the Pacific
                    Horticultural and Agricultural Market Access Program (PHAMA). These actions were then screened for
                    feasibility, before being shortlisted as options that would benefit from synergies for the CBA.
                    The purpose of the CBA was to help identify priority options based on their anticipated benefit-cost ratio.
                    A summary of the results is provided in Table ES4. The key findings are summarized below.
                     Providing an ATM or foreign exchange booth at/or near the wharf in Alotau (the first port of call for
                       many cruises) is found to have the highest benefit-cost ratio. In short, it was found that the Papua New
                       Guinean Kina (PGK) is not a frequently available currency for tourists visiting PNG and many traders in
                       PNG do not accept alternative currency (i.e. AUD). Without currency exchange facilities on the cruise
                       ship, this resulted in many passengers being unable to make purchases when visiting PNG ports. The
                       low fixed cost of providing this facility is easily offset by increased passenger expenditure for the 10
                       years assessed
                     In the same vein, improving information provided to passengers prior to disembarking in both PNG
                       and SI is estimated to have a large positive net impact. In-depth interviews with passengers indicated
                       that they wanted to spend more, but lacked the opportunities and confidence to do so. It is a relatively
                       low cost exercise to provide a three-minute quarantine video, update destination materials and
                       provide a map of the ports to encourage cruise passengers to explore and better navigate attractions
                       and amenities at each port visited. These actions also give passengers the confidence to purchase
                       handicrafts, resulting in higher expenditure
                     Increasing cooperation and coordination between businesses, local communities, government and
                       cruise operators particularly in the development of future tours and excursion offers (which are the
                       highest expenditure items for passengers), is also anticipated to generate significant net benefits.
                       Businesses should be better prepared for cruise ship arrivals with an improved range of better-priced
                       and coordinated products to offer passengers. Key to this option in PNG and SI is the establishment of
                       a more formalised cruise committee in each port with assigned roles and responsibilities. For example,
                       it is assumed these committees will take the lead in broadcasting the arrival of cruise vessels to local
                       businesses, and submitting relevant and updated destination information to cruise operators to ensure
                       information given to passengers is accurate and useful
                     Improving customs and immigration procedures in PNG is expected to generate significant benefits
                       as speedier and more efficient procedures allow passengers to spend more time ashore. Benefits
                       are estimated proportional to the extra time spent ashore when more goods and services are to be
                       purchased

                                                                                                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                                                                                Executive Summary JUNE 2016




 Improving port amenities (such as the provision of shaded areas and seating, sanitation blocks and
   litter bins) in many destinations is shown to have a significant net positive impact. The option makes the
   port area more attractive to passengers considering a trip ashore. When ashore, it also increases the
   time passengers are willing to spend in the port with a proportional increase in expenditure assumed in
   the analysis
 Opening up cruise destinations, such as Gizo and Tavanipupu in SI, requires significant upfront
   investments at high cost. For example, this includes jetties, upgrades to wharfs and hydrological
   surveys to be carried out before larger cruise ships can operate efficiently in these ports. However,
   over time the improvements will increase levels of expenditure due to a higher frequency of calls and
   numbers of passengers
 The new wharf at Honiara is already under construction and will provide net benefits within 25 years.
   However, the benefits to freight shipping operators from a new wharf are not quantified and are
   considered significant as they are the largest users of this infrastructure
In conclusion, the CBA highlights the importance of capacity building, improved communication and
information options to facilitate higher cruise tourism expenditure. These options also contribute to
supporting economic development through tourism where a limited formal economy currently exists
in many smaller destinations. Often low cost to implement, these options ensure local communities,
businesses and government realise the potential of cruise tourism for economic growth and employment.
These options achieve the highest benefit-cost ratios.
Infrastructure investment is also important for the longer-term prospects of these cruise tourism
economies. High in upfront costs, the benefits of these investments may seem low but they are essential
prerequisites for future economic development. Without a new wharf in Honiara, or similar infrastructure
at other destinations, cruise tourists will not visit these countries in the numbers expected, consequently
reducing the economic impact of the sector.

                                                   and increase cruise frequency. This could be
                                                   achieved by increasing the number of proclaimed

                                                   of using immigration services at non-proclaimed

                        reflecting the longer life to asset and the fact that this is investment is on-going.

1  Introduction
1.1  Approach and methodology
This study followed a data driven approach, including primary data collection from cruise operators, passengers,
crew, and tourism related businesses in PNG and SI. This data was collected through surveys, focus groups and
interviews on-board two separate cruises in November 2015 and January 2016. The ports of call on each cruise
are summarised in Figure 1.1 below.

The approach and methodology used for the economic impact assessment of the cruise tourism industry on the
economies of PNG and SI is in line with the global cruise industry studies conducted by Business Research and
Economic Advisors (BREA)16, as well as the previous Vanuatu 2014 study in assessing the following.
 Direct economic impact is the revenue the government and businesses receive from cruise ship tourism from
   the expenditure of cruise passengers, cruise crew members and cruise operators on goods, services, taxes and
   port fees in each country. Data was collected through passengers and crew surveys on board, as well as data
   provided by cruise operators (i.e. Carnival Australia)
 Indirect impact is the revenue received by suppliers of goods and services to businesses affected by direct
   impact. It is the second round impact of cruise tourism. The data was collected through face-to-face interviews
   with businesses in the six visited ports by asking questions about their cost structure and main suppliers




16	 Business Research & Economic Advisors (BREA) conducted several Economic Contribution of Cruise Tourism to the Destination Economies studies, the
    latest was published in October 2015. The scope of the study concerns the Caribbean, Mexico and Central and South America.

ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
INTRODUCTION JUNE 2016




 Total economic impact is the aggregation of direct and indirect economic impacts, and represents the total
   economic activity generated by cruise tourism in each country. In this study the final total economic impact
   is broken down by sector and by final beneficiary (i.e. government, private beneficiary or leakage). This study
   does not measure induced impacts which measures the additional impact from private beneficiaries through
   household expenditure by employees (direct and indirectly) employed by the tourism industry
 Added value is the contribution of total economic impact from cruise tourism to GDP. It is calculated as a sum of
   wages and profits generated by total impact
 Employment Impact is the total economic impact on employment in the country. It is calculated based on the
   ratio of reported employment (full-time and part-time employment) to revenue by sector. This ratio is then
   multiplied by revenue from cruise tourism in each sector to estimate the final employment impact. The data was
   collected through face-to-face interviews with businesses in each port by asking questions about their total
   revenues and the number of people they employ. For example, if the businesses noted they employ two workers
   and had AUD 20,000 of revenue in 2015, then AUD10,000 of total economic impact from cruise tourism generates
   one additional job in this sector. Due to the limited understanding of some business representatives interviewed,
   they could not provide full-time equivalent figures but rather reported the number of people that worked in the
   business on the day of the cruise. As a result we refer to employment impact as employment opportunities


   Economic impact of cruise tourism expenditure
   This study presents two estimates of cruise tourism expenditure:
    The economic impact on the five researched ports (Alotau, Rabaul, Kiriwina, Kitava and Doini Island) in PNG
      and one port in SI (Honiara). These estimates are based solely on the data obtained from the two cruises,
      scaling up by the number of times cruise ships of this size are scheduled to call in these ports in 2016
    The economic impact on the whole country of PNG and SI accounts for the fact that mainly smaller cruise
      ships call at ports other than the researched ports in PNG and SI. To do this, assumptions were revised to
      reflect the lower port fee paid by smaller ships, the lower number of passengers per ship arriving in each port
      and the frequency of calls to these other ports. Extrapolation on this basis provides a first estimate of the
      total economic impact of cruise tourism on each economy

   Unless otherwise stated, the impacts reported are based on the economic impact on the researched ports.
   Insufficient data was available to estimate the country-wide impacts disaggregated by sector and port.


A total of 2,254 passenger responses were collected. The average passenger response rate was eight per cent per
port (344 passengers per port), but passengers reported on average for 2.03 persons, in line with other studies.
Compared to the Vanuatu 2014 study, sample sizes are smaller but this was expected due to the limited number of
cruise ships surveyed (only two ships were surveyed) and the higher number of ports surveyed on each cruise ship
(six ports). However, the achieved sample sizes are large enough to provide statistically robust results.
The survey was complemented with four focus groups and several in-depth interviews with passengers on-board to
build an in-depth understanding of their spending behaviour and drivers.
In addition, 36 face-to-face interviews were conducted with businesses operating in the study ports. The aim of the
interviews was to collect data on the basic cost structure, levels of employment and main suppliers of each business
to compute the supply chain. Twenty-nine businesses were interviewed in PNG and seven businesses in Honiara, SI.
Due to small sample size, data was analysed in aggregate and triangulated with secondary literature and in-country
expert opinion before reaching robust conclusions.
Draft results of the economic impact assessment and underlying assumptions were presented and discussed at the
in-country workshops in PNG and SI in March 2016.

                                       ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
                                                                                           INTRODUCTION JUNE 2016




The study is based on in-depth qualitative and quantitative research conducted at five ports
in PNG and one port in SI

           Alotau – with a population of approximately 12,000, Alotau is one of the larger urban ports in PNG
           and the capital of Milne Bay Province. Here, cruise passengers can pre-book the largest variety
           of tours combining war, history and culture tours. There is a good range of places available to
           purchase food and drinks.




           Doini is a privately-owned island and resort with less than 100 inhabitants and a pleasant beach.
           Business activities include a restaurant serving food and drinks, and activities such as fishing,
           boat trips, kayaking, dancing and singing performances. There were no pre-booked or local tours
           available.




           Kiriwina with a population of 37,000, this is one of the largest and most populated islands of the
           Trobriand Islands where natives live a self-sufficient lifestyle. It is renowned for wood carvings and
           snorkelling. Many handicraft vendors line up by the footpaths at the beach to sell their goods to
           cruise tourists. No pre-booked tours were available on board cruise ships but local guides can be
           hired for a walk to the village in exchange for a donation.




           Kitava is a small tropical island with some 2,000 – 3,000 inhabitants. It is part of the Trobriand
           islands where the natives live a self-sufficient lifestyle. Cruise passengers can purchase a diverse
           range of goods including wood carvings, craft, shells, jewellery and coconuts. No tours were
           available to pre-purchase on the cruise ships. However, there are local tour guides offering Skull
           Cave visits and boat tours.




           Rabaul is an urban port in East New Britain province with a population of approximately 8,000.
           It is popular for its volcanoes, scuba diving, snorkelling sites, World War II history and cultural
           life. A variety of businesses serve cruise passengers including local tour operators, souvenir and
           handicraft vendors, supermarkets and local markets. Tours were available either to pre-book on
           cruise ships or to purchase directly from local operators.




           Honiara is the capital city of the Solomon Islands and has approximately 65,000 inhabitants.
           When large cruise ships arrive local businesses set up a craft and souvenir market at the wharf,
           offering a variety of handicrafts. Tours were not available to pre-book on cruise ships, but local
           operators were accessible at the wharf.




                                                                                                            PAGE 25
1.2  Limitation of this study
While every effort has been made to ensure that the sample of data collected is representative of the population,
and that the methods used in collection and analysis are robust, there are a number of limitations to this study:
 Estimation of induced impacts is beyond the scope of this study. Induced impacts, defined as the impacts
   of expenditure from private beneficiaries of indirect cruise ship tourism spending, (i.e. household expenditure
   from employees of businesses that benefit from cruise tourism) have not been considered as part of this study.
   To do so, would require an understanding of how private beneficiaries spend the income they received from
   cruise ship tourism
 The sample is based on data collected on two large cruise ships and smaller expeditionary cruise ships
   were not surveyed. Data collection was undertaken on two large cruise ships visiting PNG and SI with the
   most comprehensive itineraries, during the months of November 2015 and January 2016. The cruise tourist
   population on-board both cruises is considered representative of the larger vessels visiting PNG and SI in
   2015/2016. As the popularity of cruise tourism to PNG and SI continues to expand, the demographics of
   tourists and their spending patterns are likely to change. Therefore, the study only provides a snapshot of
   expenditure and its impact in 2015/2016. Although PNG and SI are also visited by a number of smaller cruise
   vessels and private yachts, surveying these passengers and crew was not within the scope of this study
 Sample data for estimating the expenditure of crew members was low. A survey of crew expenditure was
   undertaken on each cruise ship but the response rate from those who disembarked at each destination was
   very low. Several factors contributed to this outcome: (i) crew have limited time off from their duties while on-
   board and are reluctant to spend that time completing a questionnaire; (ii) very few crew members were found
   to leave the ship at each destination, other than at larger ports; and (iii) there is a high level of survey fatigue
   as most crew have encountered such surveys before on other cruise trips. In response, informal interviews
   were held between the researchers on-board and crew members to find out about their spending patterns and
   motivations for expenditure, which are included in our assessment. Nevertheless the amount of quantitative
   information obtained remains negligible. To account for such a small sample size, care has been taken by on-
   board researchers to validate the results by reviewing the estimated expenditure and ensuring it mirrors their
   general observations and experience of crew spending patterns. Secondly, the results have been compared to
   crew expenditure in other studies. As crew incomes and hours worked are similar across different cruises, it is
   reasonable to assume expenditure is similar
 Employment impacts from cruise line spending at ports were not estimated as part of this study. Due to
   the subsistence nature of the economy in many ports of call, full-time cruise tourism employment is limited.
   In addition, due to the limited business understanding of those interviewed, only the number of employees
   present on the day of the interview were provided. In the absence of secondary data on the structure of the
   supply chain and/or input-output tables for each sector, it was not possible to provide full-time equivalent
   (FTE) job numbers or detailed indirect employment impacts. As a result we refer to employment impact as
   employment opportunities

                                                                                              INTRODUCTION JUNE 2016




1.3  Comparison with/lessons from other studies
It is natural to compare the results of this study with similar studies conducted in other PICs or similar tourist
island destinations in the Caribbean. However, care should be taken in comparing countries and their economies.
As alluded to above, PNG and SI differ significantly from other PICs for the following reasons:
 PNG and to a lesser degree SI are highly undeveloped tourism destinations in terms of the number of cruise and
   other tourists they attract, the tourism infrastructure available to them (including road transport, cultural and
   retail destinations) and awareness of tourism as an important source of revenue among businesses. Numbers
   of visitors are increasing and improvements to infrastructure are being made, but it will take time to reach the
   numbers seen in similar Pacific and Caribbean tourist destinations
 Cruise ship tourism in PNG includes stops at otherwise hard to reach and largely unspoilt destinations. While this
   is ultimately the attraction of ports like Kiriwina, Kitava, and Doini Island, commercial business is limited. Many
   local people are employed in subsistence farming and fishing. Cruise tourism provides a supplementary source
   of cash income, in which products and services are sold to visiting tourists from no fixed premises or registered
   business. This informal economy is difficult to capture, and has limited indirect impact on the wider economy as
   revenue is kept by the family producing the good or service. Cash income contributes directly to the household
   budget in such cases. This informal economic activity is much more pronounced in PNG and SI than in other
   tourist destinations and should be taken into account when interpreting the expenditure findings. Namely the
   supply chains when assessing indirect impacts are very short, involving only one supplier, if any at all

Taking these differences into account, levels of passenger and crew spend are broadly aligned with the results
seen in Vanuatu and elsewhere in the Pacific Islands. A change to the itinerary in the second cruise also enabled
the expenditure surveys to be completed for Port Vila in Vanuatu. The results obtained from Port Vila confirmed
broad alignment of the results of this study. Furthermore, the assumptions used have been tested with tourism
representatives in each country and with the researchers who visited each port of call.

2  Direct economic impact

   PNG summary
   In total, cruise companies, passengers and crew spent AUD 5.7 million in PNG during 2015 across the five researched
   ports (Alotau, Rabaul, Kiriwina, Kitava and Doini Island). Depending on the port, each cruise ship call brought an
   average of between AUD 24,000 and AUD 159,000.
   If this data is extrapolated, the total direct economic impact of cruise tourism in PNG is estimated at approximately
   AUD 6.3 million.
   The major source of the expenditure is cruise companies (which account for 54 per cent of total expenditure) mainly
   through a variety of fees paid to ports, government agencies or communities. The remaining expenditure comes from
   passengers (43 per cent) mainly through purchases of tours. Crew expenditure accounts for only three per cent.
   The distribution among ports differs. The majority of expenditure in PNG benefits Alotau (42 per cent) and Rabaul (41
   per cent), as these are entry ports and are more developed ports. Total and breakdown of expenditure by port in PNG
   is provided in Table 2.1.
   The impact assessment for PNG in 2015 assumed a total of 60 calls at the five researched ports. There were also an
   additional 76 calls at other mostly small island destinations with significantly smaller average vessel sizes (between
   150 – 300 passengers). It is estimated that these additional calls bring a marginal share (11 per cent) to total cruise
   tourism impact in PNG. As a result, the five researched ports in this study provide a good insight.

SI summary
The direct economic impact to the port of Honiara in SI in 2015 is estimated at AUD 0.6 million. On average each cruise
ship call brought AUD 46,169 to Honiara.
If this data is extrapolated, the total direct economic impact of cruise tourism in SI is estimated at approximately AUD
0.9 million.
The majority of the expenditure comes from cruise companies (65 per cent of total expenditure) mainly through
different fees paid to ports, government agencies or communities. The remaining expenditure comes from
passengers (31 per cent) and crew (four per cent).

2.1  Cruise passenger expenditure
2.1.1  Headline expenditure
The aim of the passenger survey was to estimate the average onshore expenditure of cruise passengers at
different ports of call in PNG and SI. This expenditure includes pre-booked tours, purchases of handicrafts and
other products. The data obtained from the survey is used as the basis for direct impact modelling assumptions17.
Passengers’ expenditures varies significantly among the surveyed ports due to differences in spending
opportunities (e.g. the availability of pre-booked tours) and other factors such as the availability of ATMs,
currency exchange services, shaded areas and toilets ashore.
On average, passengers spend AUD 76 per day in Rabaul, AUD 47 in Alotau and between AUD 7 and AUD 11 per day
in smaller ports (i.e. Doini Island, Kiriwina or Kitava). In Honiara, passengers spend AUD 28 on average per day18.
The global average passenger spend is much higher, estimated in the region of AUD 17919. The Vanuatu 2014
Study estimated passengers spend AUD 96 in Port Vila, AUD 45 in Luganville, and AUD 11 in the Mystery Islands20.

                                                                                                DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT JUNE 2016




   Key findings
                     Qualitative research found passengers are often not expecting many services and don’t particularly
                     want them. Passengers are mostly interested in, and surprised by, the beautiful unspoilt locations, the
                     friendliness of the locals and rich local cultural history.


                     There was a consensus among passengers interviewed that not much money is needed to have a
                     great time at these locations. The main expectation from passengers is to be able to relax and enjoy
                     these pristine places.



                     Quantitative analysis confirms that on average passengers spent little (AUD7 to AUD11) at small
                     island destinations (Doini Island, Kitava, and Kiriwina).


                     Passengers’ expenditure during the entire trip (in PNG) is lower or equal to what they expected to
                     spend. Passengers expected to spend between AUD 150 and AUD 200 in total at the five visited ports
                     (P&O amount suggested at money exchange points). Based on the quantitative analysis, average
                     expenditure was AUD 150 per passenger across the five ports in PNG.


                     Passengers would like to contribute more to the local communities. Quantitative data shows
                     that most passengers would spend more on entertainment, tours, clothing, watches/jewellery and
                     handicrafts if more were available), or donations (both monetary and material).


                     Average passengers spent a significant amount (AUD 35 to AUD 50 on average) on pre-book tours to
                     book on-board cruise ships
                  Pre-book tours were not available on-board cruise ships to Honiara, Doini Island, Kitava and Kiriwina.
                    Pre-booked of tours will be available on Carnival Australia cruises to Honiara from May 2016 onwards
                  Discussions in focus groups highlighted that some passengers preferred to pre-book tours through cruise
                    operators. Others would like to book directly with local tour operators based on the perception that those
                    tours are cheaper with more money going straight to the community




The proportion of passengers going ashore is high. Survey results indicated that between 93 per cent (Kitava) and
97 per cent (Doini Islands) of passengers went ashore at the surveyed ports. This is consistent with the Vanuatu
2014 Study and the global average of 94 per cent21.
Once ashore, passengers spend between 3.4 and 4.3 hours (depending on the port) discovering destinations
before returning to the cruise ship. Globally, the average number of hours ashore is 4.4 hours22.
Among the different ports, Kiriwina Island and Kitava attracted the lowest number of passengers. A large
proportion (between 39 and 40 per cent) of passengers did not spend while ashore at these destinations. In
contrast, Rabaul attracted a high amount of passengers ashore (96 per cent), and only six per cent of them chose
not spend, with the average passenger returning to the cruise ship after 4.3 hours. A breakdown of passengers
going ashore by port and their spending pattern is provided in Figure 2.5.

Figure 2.6 below provides details on the observed average time spent ashore by port.


Figure 2.6  Detail of average passenger time spent ashore by port

              The average time passengers spent ashore is lower than the global average. Qualitative
              research found this is partly due to: heat, lack of basic facilities and a lack of food that is
              perceived to be safe to consume. Time spent on tours also influences the time spent ashore. A
              prominent pattern observed by researchers was that after a few hours of a full-day stop spent
              ashore, many passengers return to the cruise ship for lunch and are unlikely to return, choosing
              to stay aboard the ship during the remainder of the day. On average passengers spent:


    3.4 hours at Kiriwina: Passengers returned to boat
      fast. Some felt overwhelmed by too many vendors,
      there was not enough shade, no places to sit and               "[Kiriwina] Very picturesque
      the beach was not pleasant. Passengers also                    but not really tourist friendly"
      mentioned locals “begging”
    3.6 hours at Kitava: Passengers preferred Kitava
      over Kiriwina and stayed ashore longer. It had nice
                                                                     "There are not really many
      seating areas and shade. Vendors and locals were
      less “pushy”

2.1.2  Drivers of expenditure
This section identifies potential drivers of passengers’ on shore expenditure (average spend). The following
potential drivers were explored through quantitative analysis (passenger surveys) by calculating correlation
coefficients: household income, passengers’ satisfaction levels, availability of options and whether or not
passengers pre-purchased tours.
The factors outlined below indicate a strong correlation to mean spend, but this does not establish certainty that
the factors identified cause more spending. The analysis was conducted separately for PNG and SI where possible.
Due to the small sample size, availability of options and pre-purchased tours were explored in aggregate.



    Three key drivers of passengers spend23

                                          Time passengers spend on shore: Survey results across different countries consistently
                                          indicate that passengers who spend more time ashore also spend more on local products and
                                          services.
                                          Passengers’ satisfaction with the variety of things to see and do: Passengers spend more if
                                          they think there are a greater variety of things to see and do. Independent of the country, the
                                          majority of passengers that spent in PNG and SI would spend more on clothing, watches,
                                          jewellery, handicrafts and souvenirs if more options were available.
                                          Availability of pre-booked tours: Passengers who pre-booked tours spent significantly more
                                          (on average AUD 79) than those who did not pre-book tours (on average AUD 21). When
                                          available, many passengers purchased pre-booked tours (47 per cent of passengers in Alotau
                                          and 48 per cent of passengers in Rabaul).

There was a positive correlation between mean spend and time ashore of up to six hours for PNG and five hours
for SI. The downward trend in expenditure after five hours in SI illustrates the need for more things to do. We know
from qualitative findings that many passengers were prepared to spend more, hence the positive correlation.
In terms of satisfaction, there is a strong positive correlation between “variety of things to see and do” and total
spend in both PNG and SI. On average, passengers who were not at all satisfied with the variety of things to see
and do spent only AUD 13 and those who were extremely satisfied spent AUD 34.

                More than half of passengers were ‘very’ or ‘extremely satisfied’ with the current variety of
                things to see and do at most ports – especially at Doini Island, Kitava and Rabaul
                (see Figure 2.9).
    Doini Island rates the highest. It offers fishing, boat trips, self-guided walks around the Island and
      kayaking. There are many different groups performing cultural dances and songs, but less availability of
      crafts. Some passengers pointed out it felt more commercial, less authentic and more in line with other
      Pacific Islands
    Kitava is liked for being authentic, untouched and un-touristy. Passengers can purchase handicrafts, join
      tours with local tour guides to the lookout at the top of the hill, King Cameron’s Grave and Skull Caves,
      take a raft-boat to a deserted island and purchase food and drinks (coconut) from stalls
    In Rabaul many passengers go on tours (volcanoes and WWII history), the selection of handicrafts is good
      and includes local products as well as commercial “made in China” products

             Around one-fifth of passengers were ‘not very’ or ‘not at all’ satisfied with the variety of
             things to see and do in Alotau, Honiara and Kiriwina Island (see Figure 2.10).


 The main town of Alotau is about 30 minutes walk from the port and (especially those on tours) rarely
   make it into the town centre. Tourist offers close to the port are limited, there is no information desk or
   local tour operators at the port and signage is poor. Alotau has a good range of places available for food
   and drinks, however souvenirs and woodcarvings are less obvious to buy. Tourists can purchase a variety
   of tours such as Ahoima traditional cultural experiences (e.g. meet my family, Alotau history tour, the
   Battle of Milne Bay tour and traditional cooking classes)
 Kiriwina Island has the highest number of local people servicing cruise tourists. It is renowned for the
   wood carvings and spectacular snorkelling. But passengers commented there is not enough variety
   of handicrafts and some passengers were concerned that crafts are imported. There were local tour
   guides available for village tours, but passengers were not aware of this offer. Passengers also expressed
   concerns for animals with locals encouraging passengers to pay for photos with parrots and turtles

Cruise passengers were asked whether they would spend more if more options were available. More than 50 per
cent of passengers who spent would have spent more on entertainment activities, clothing, watches/jewellery and
handicrafts, if more were available.
Passengers who did not spend would most likely spend more on tours on the day (40 per cent), followed by handicrafts
(30 per cent) and clothing (28 per cent), suggesting a gap in the market for these areas in particular.
Responses were similar at ports of PNG and SI ports, but passengers in SI are more likely to spend more on most
items (if more options were available).

Passengers who pre-booked tours spent less on transportation, more in retail and handicrafts, but much the
same on food and beverage.
Collected passengers data does not allow for detailed analysis of spending patterns based on passengers’
demographics. Consistent with studies by BREA and the Vanuatu 2014 study, one survey per cabin was collected
and one passenger was asked to report spending on behalf of all cabin/family members. Based on such data
individual expenditure by gender or age cannot be identified.
Ninety-one per cent of passengers responding to the survey hold permanent residence in Australia. The
sample sizes of passengers from other countries (e.g. UK, US and Canada) are too small for statistical spending
comparison based on country of origin (because calculated differences are not statistically significant).

2.2  Cruise crew expenditure
The number of collected survey responses from crew was insufficient to conduct quantitative expenditure
analysis. To estimate the total direct economic impact of cruise crew expenditure, several assumptions were
made for based on the Vanuatu 2014 study and qualitative insights gathered during research on two cruise ships
visiting PNG and SI in November 2015 and January 2016.
For the purpose of analysis, ports are classified into two sizes:
1.	 Small ports include Doini Island, Kiriwina and Kitava. It is assumed that the size and type of expenditure
    compares to that of Mystery Island in Vanuatu
2.	 Medium Ports include Alotau, Rabaul and Honiara. It is assumed that the size and type of expenditure compares
    to Luganville in Vanuatu. Crews did not spend on duty free and entertainment activities in PNG and SI, as there
    are no such businesses operating (or they do not attract crew members) in these localities
Assumed share of crew going ashore is 13 per cent for small ports and 26 per cent for medium ports. In
comparison, the global average is 39 per cent24 (Table 2.3).
The analysis assumes that on average crew members spend AUD 5 per day at small ports and AUD 28 per day at
medium ports in PNG and SI from the Vanuatu study. As the wages of crew do not differ significantly between
Vanuatu and PNG/SI cruises, we consider this a sensible assumption given the absence of primary data on which
to base the analysis. The main expenditure is in food and beverage, retail (i.e. supermarkets) and transports. In
comparison, global average crew expenditure at port per day is AUD 9325.



                    Currently PNG and SI lack pull factors for crew members to go and spend ashore. Based on
                    global studies26, crew members go ashore to access cheap communication services (because
                    internet and phone, on-board connection is expensive), food and beverage at restaurant and
                    bars, entertainment/night clubs and transportation to these facilities. They also tend to spend
                    on clothes and electronics. All of these facilities and products are scarce or not available in PNG
                    and SI.

2.3  Direct expenditure by cruise companies
The majority of cruise company expenditure relates to fees that directly flow to the government of each country.
Data for this assessment is based on estimates by Carnival Australia, shipping and logistics companies working in
PNG and SI, as well as additional stakeholders.
Total direct expenditure by cruise companies in PNG in 2015 is estimated at AUD 1.6 million in Alotau and AUD 1.0
million in Rabaul. Expenditure at smaller island destinations is estimated between AUD 0.1 million in Kitava and
AUD 0.2 million in Doini Island. Total direct expenditure of cruise companies in Honiara in 2015 is estimated at AUD
0.4 million.
Fees paid by cruise companies at larger ports include a range of charges by government departments, port
authorities, and shipping and logistics companies including customs and immigration fees, quarantine fees, port
fees etc. It was assumed that customs and immigration fees and other national fees such as those charged by the
National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA) in PNG are charged at the first port of entry (i.e. Alotau and Honiara).
Fees at smaller island destinations are negotiated and flow directly to the community.
Based on a comparative example of fees paid by one large cruise ship at different ports, port fees, agency fees and
quarantine fees are comparable between the three larger ports (Alotau, Rabaul and Honiara). However, fees paid
for customs, immigration and the NMSA are much higher in PNG compared to SI. Together these fees account for
58 per cent of total fees paid in PNG (Alotau and Rabaul ports), compared to nine per cent at the SI port of Honiara
(see Figure 2.15).
Other direct expenditure by the cruise company relates to expenses on goods and services. This includes
corporate expenditure for operations (e.g. travel, accommodation and professional advisory fees). These
company expenditures were allocated evenly between Alotau and Rabaul based on the number of calls in 2015.
Procurement of other goods is mostly centrally managed from home ports, and there are currently no locally-
sourced products in PNG or SI for larger vessels. A port agent in Honiara noted that smaller vessels sometimes
purchase provisions from the port (e.g. eggs) and smaller vessels also pay for garbage disposal. It has not been
possible to quantify this extra expenditure in this study.

    Port fee challenges in PNG
                    Lack of coordination and a need to adopt international practices: Some stakeholders noted
                    there is a level of confusion between various authorities collecting fees from visiting ships in
                    PNG. Reportedly, each authority has a different method of charging fees, overtime, ad diem
                    allowances, policies related to boarding vessels in designated and undesignated ports etc. One
                    shipping agent noted that PNG needs to conform with internationally accepted practices
                    related to manifests, documentation and methods of charging vessels that are consistent with
                    other destinations.


                    High fees: Based on data gathered, fees charged in PNG are significantly higher than those in SI.
                    Some stakeholders and cruise ship operators noted recent high fees charges by NMSA might
                    result in some cruise ships bypassing PNG in the future. Based on their calculations this
                    especially applies to small (50-100 passengers) exhibition cruises that visit PNG once a year.
                    Ports in the Pacific region and around the world are under sustained pressure to keep costs to a
                    minimum, specifically for cruise ships if tourist destinations are to remain competitive.
                    However, a vast body of literature recommends port fees should be set at a level that covers the
                    expenses and investment needed to build and maintain a port as well as the local infrastructure
                    to accommodate cruise passengers28.


                    Legislation and customs rules: According to current legislation, the first port of entry for cruise
                    ships in PNG must be a declared port (e.g. Alotau, Rabaul, and Port Moresby). By law cruise ships
                    need to stop first at one of the declared ports before going to other destinations. However,
                    other PICs (e.g. Fiji, and SI) allow cruise ships to enter the country also through undeclared ports
                    (an example of undeclared port in PNG is Conflict Island). This opens up more possibilities for
                    cruise operators to better tailor their itineraries.

INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT JUNE 2016




3  Indirect Economic Impact
Indirect economic impact in PNG is estimated at AUD 0.2 million and AUD 0.04 million in SI. Small indirect
economic impacts are the result of short supply chains in the local tourism economy and the structure of the
overall economy (see Table 3.1).

 Impact

Indirect economic impact is the revenue received by local businesses that supply goods and services to
businesses directly benefiting from cruise tourism. It is the second round impact of cruise tourism and the size of
this impact indicates how money multiplies in the economy. By definition, indirect impact excludes the portion of
direct economic impact that goes to the government.
Indirect economic impact was calculated by simulating the supply chain of the five main industries benefiting from
cruise tourism in SI and PNG. In summary, the following was observed:
 Tour and entertainment services: The main local suppliers of tour operators are transport service providers
   (i.e. providing mini buses)
 Transport services: Transport services mainly rely on imported goods (imports of fuel and vehicle) and have
   limited indirect impacts
 Specialist tourist retail such as handicrafts, souvenirs and artwork: The majority of businesses in this sector
   operate in the informal economy. Data from this informal economy is difficult to capture and has limited indirect
   impacts as revenue is kept by the family producing the good or service
 General retail such as supermarkets: The main local suppliers of general retail industry (such as supermarkets)
   are larger local general retailers
 Food & beverage services: The main local suppliers of food and beverage services are local general retail
   industry (i.e. supermarkets)

4  Total Economic Impact
4.1  Summary
Total economic impact in PNG is estimated at AUD 5.9 million. Total economic impact in SI is estimated at AUD
0.64 million. The majority of this impact (97 per cent in PNG and 94 per cent in SI) comes from direct impact.
Final beneficiaries of total economic impact are government and local private beneficiaries. Part of the impact
leaks from the economy through imports (i.e. insurance, fuel costs and profits to foreign owners of businesses).
Forty-three per cent (PNG) and twenty-seven per cent (SI) of the total economic impact of cruise tourism
benefits local private beneficiaries. Governments receive 51 per cent (PNG) and 63 per cent (SI) of
expenditure. Estimated leakage is six per cent (PNG) and 10 per cent (SI).
The observed structure of total economic impact is a result of the following features of the cruise tourism
industry:
 Impact on the government is high because of a high share of collected port fees relative to other
   expenditure
 Impact on private beneficiaries is high since the expenditure from the cruise industry predominantly
   flows into tours operators and handmade souvenir businesses. These sectors are labour intensive,
   locally owned and almost independent from imports
 Impact on private beneficiaries is further increased because a large share of the economy in each country
   is considered informal (i.e. businesses do not pay tax). It is assumed that the entire expenditure at Doini
   Island, Kiriwina and Kitava flows into such subsistence economies

Added value impact of cruise tourism to PNG’s GDP is estimated at AUD 1.1 million or 0.01 per cent of GDP in
2015. Value add of cruise tourism to SI’s GDP is estimated at AUD 0.09 million or 0.01 per cent of GDP in 2015.

ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT JUNE 2016




4.1.1  Differences between researched ports
The islands of Kitava and Kiriwina differ significantly from the rest of the ports surveyed due to the fact that
these ports have limited services and no infrastructure. The islands function as subsistence economies and the
inhabitants are farmers. Cruise companies pay the anchorage fee, which directly benefits the community. Family-
owned businesses selling goods and services operate on an ad-hoc basis when cruise ships arrive. The revenue
from sales to cruise passengers complements subsistence farming and has not yet developed as an alternative
source of close to full-time employment.
The impact assessment assumes that revenues received from cruise ships are used entirely by local private
beneficiaries (for family consumption). There is no supply chain, no taxes paid (i.e. no government revenue), and
there is no leakage from the economy as all materials are locally-source through farming (e.g. wood, vegetables).
The ports of Alotau, Rabaul and Honiara are characterised by a larger business presence. The impact of direct
expenditure in these ports was calculated by simulating the flow of the money in the economy through the value
chain (including secondary effects). This section reports key findings per industry. A detail account of assumed
cost structure per industry and country is provided in Annex 3.


4.1.2  Tours and entertainment services
Tours and entertainment services in Alotau, Rabaul and Honiara range from war and colonial history tours (e.g.
Milne Bay Tour, Kokopo War Museum), to cultural tours, cultural performances and cooking classes. The operators
were separated into two groups:
 Registered tour operators serve passengers who pre-booked tours through cruise companies or online. There
   are also registered tour operators offering services ashore at the wharfs. Those operators pay related taxes,
   insurance and other fees. Tours can be pre-booked through cruise companies for Alotau and Rabaul. In Honiara
   pre-booked tours are only available online through other operators
 Unregistered tour operators also serve passengers while ashore. They do not pay related taxes, insurance
   and other fees. For example, in Rabaul tour operators need to pay a fee of 200PGK per person per day to access
   the port area and need to comply with local insurance regulation to offer services at the wharf. As a result, only
   two local tour operators gained access to the port area but many other businesses are crowded outside the
   main port gates. Reportedly, some of these tour guides are officially unemployed and offer tours to earn extra
   income. It is assumed that 40 per cent of tours ashore is purchased from unregistered operators

Private beneficiaries receive a high share of direct expenditure because the revenue is mainly used to hire local
tour guides and local transport providers.

4.1.3  Transport Services
Transport services are limited to mini buses and taxis operating at wharfs to transport passengers into towns or
on tours. These services are mainly hired by tour operators and accounted for in secondary impact.
This sector has a high leakage rates due to dependency on fuel imports with the cost of fuel accounting for a large
proportion of costs to businesses (see Table 4.3).

4.1.4  Specialist tourist retail services (handicrafts, souvenirs and artwork)
The majority of handicrafts sold are handmade and locally produced (e.g. wood carvings, baskets and drums etc.).
Vendors are often unemployed and/or have other jobs and set up ad-hoc stalls when cruise ships arrive. It was
assumed that 80 per cent of business in this sector are not registered and do not pay taxes, social security and
other related fees.
In Honiara, businesses set up a craft and souvenir market at the wharf offering a variety of products. Some craft
stalls are supported by local industry groups (such as the Solomon Islands Women in Business Association, which
provides stalls for free). Imported souvenirs (e.g. t-shirts and caps) are only available in Rabaul.
The sector has a high distributional effect since 99 per cent of the money spent on special tourist retail, benefits
private beneficiaries (see Table 4.4).

4.1.5  Food and beverage service industry (restaurants and bars)
Qualitative research suggests most passengers are not particularly interested in purchasing food and drinks
ashore as they are provided on-board. Many passengers are also deterred from eating locally produced food
because of food safety concerns.
Restaurant and bars such as the Honiara Yacht Club and Rapopo Plantation Resort in Rabaul, mainly serve local
guests and other tourists. The reported intake from cruise tourists is below 10 per cent.
It is estimated that a relatively high share of expenditure from the food and beverage sector flows to private
beneficiaries, mainly because businesses buy the majority of goods at local supermarkets and markets. The main
source of leakage (estimated at around 50 per cent of profits) is due to foreign business ownership.

4.1.6  General retail (supermarket and general store items)
The majority of products sold in the general retail sectors are imported. Businesses in this sector are largely
foreign-owned (i.e. predominantly Chinese, Fillipino or Australian). It is assumed that 80 per cent of profits leak
offshore and hence the estimated leakage is high (between 35 per cent and 48 per cent depending on the country).

4.2  Leakage and the informal economy
Studies estimate leakage in PICs is high due to the limited production of the economies and dependency on
imports (e.g. 41 per cent in Vanuatu, 60 per cent in Fiji). However, in PNG and SI the direct impact of the cruise
industry is predominantly in the tours and entertainment and specialist tourist retail services (souvenirs)
industries. These industries are labour intensive, have low leakage due to the high share of locally owned
businesses, and a minor share of imports in business costs (i.e. most of the souvenirs are produced locally and fuel
and vehicles are the main imports across the supply chain of the tour industry).
The informal economy as a share of the total economy is considered high. Based on official statistics 75 and
85 per cent of employment in PNG and SI respectively comes from subsistence agriculture. Based on research
observation, most businesses operating in the tour and entertainment and specialist tourist retail service
industries are informal (i.e. do not pay tax).

4.3  Employment impact
Estimates of the impact of the cruise tourism sector on local employment are based on reported employment-
to-turnover ratios obtained during interviews with businesses. The majority of employment generated through
cruise tourism is on a part-time basis, often complementing subsistence farming (which employs 75 per cent
of the population in SI and 85 per cent in PNG)29. This is particularly relevant in the smaller islands of Kiriwina
and Kitava and is also a dominant factor in certain sectors such as specialist tourist retail sector (handicrafts,
souvenirs, and artwork).
The reported impacts are not based on full time equivalent (FTE) employment but rather indicate the number of
employment opportunities (a mixture of full-time and part-time jobs depending on the sector) that cruise tourism
generates (see Table 4.7).
It is estimated that in 2015, 203 jobs in five ports were created in PNG as a result of cruise tourism. This equates to
jobs for 0.6 per cent of the working age population at these ports – of which 200 jobs were generated directly and
three indirectly. Most jobs were created in Rabaul (72), followed by Alotau (44) and Kiriwina (41).
In 2015, cruise ship tourism generated 21 jobs in Honiara representing 0.06 per cent of working age population.
Twenty jobs were created directly and one indirectly.
The specialist tourist retail sector (i.e. handicrafts and souvenirs) benefits most in terms of total employment
opportunities. This is despite the fact that this sector receives about only six per cent of total direct and indirect
impact in both PNG and SI. Handicraft and souvenir business have many ‘employees’ and are mainly family run but
the intake from cruise tourism is low and inconsistent because businesses only operate when cruise ships arrive.
For instance, based on qualitative research there are many handicraft sellers at Kiriwina, however the majority
of sellers are subsistence farmers. Hence, the employment opportunity generated from cruise tourism seems
large in number but only lasts for the day when the cruise ship arrives and there were only 10 cruise ship visits to
Kiriwina in 2015.
In line with the approach adopted in the Vanuatu 2014 study, the employment impact does not include
employment resulting from government revenues derived from fees paid by cruise operators or other tax and
duty collections.

The method adopted to calculate employment impacts in the previous Vanuatu 2014 study and BREA studies
differ marginally from the approach adopted in this study. In these studies the employment impact was estimated
by using the average full-time salaries for employees in each sector. The Vanuatu study additionally assumed that
more than 33 per cent of employment is part-time to derive estimate of employment opportunities. This study
does not make use of full-time salaries for employees in each sector due to the lack of available data for PNG and
SI, and the high share of sectors operating in the informal economy. As a result, the employment impact estimates
are based on a ratio of reported employment-to- turnover data obtained during interviews with businesses.

5  Opportunities for increasing the economic impacts
of cruise tourism in Papua New Guinea and Solomon
Islands
This section considers the opportunities that exist to increase the economic benefits of cruise tourism in PNG and
SI. It also assesses the barriers to greater cruise tourism impact and explores the potential for further growth of
the sector in these countries.


5.1  Barriers to the economic impact of cruise tourism

  Summary of key barriers to the economic impact of cruise tourism
  Research conducted through business interviews, in-depth cruise passenger interviews, and in–country
  workshops identified the following key challenges and barriers to increasing the economic impact of cruise
  tourism in PNG and SI.
   Basic port infrastructure is inadequate, limiting efficient access for larger cruise ships, specifically in
     Honiara (where a new wharf is now under construction), and in Kitava (where a new jetty is required to
     enable disembarkation of two tenders simultaneously) and Alotau (where new fresh water supplies are
     required, as per industry standard)
   Destinations lacked basic facilities to attract cruise tourists ashore and encourage longer visits, with
     increase expenditure. This includes a lack of adequate sanitation facilitates, shaded areas, seating and
     litter bins in most destinations, specifically in the port area
   A tourism industry is not established in some destinations and efforts are required to support businesses
     in developing their offer. Businesses need to work collaboratively with government, other businesses and
     cruise line operators to be prepared for the influx of tourists and maximise their economic impact. This
     issue is common, to varying degrees, across all ports
   Businesses lack commercial awareness and there is disconnect between cruise operators, local
     businesses and other stakeholders which, (linked to the previous point), contributes to limited business
     preparedness and an undeveloped tourism offer
   Cruise passengers lack confidence in the goods and services available. This is due to factors such as a
     lack of information on quarantine procedures when returning home, limited transparency of pricing from
     some souvenir sellers of souvenirs and a general lack of product understanding (i.e. cultural value and
     production methods of handicrafts)
   Leakage of indirect expenditure could be reduced by purchasing local throughout the supply chain
   The numbers of cruise tourists visiting PNG and SI is currently low compared to similar destinations.
     Security concerns, lack of destination information and marketing were the major factors highlighted that
     inhibit increased numbers of tourists visiting PNG and/or SI


The following is an outline of the problems identified, summarising the responses received from cruise
passengers, crew and businesses, and the findings of in-country workshops held in Port Moresby and Honiara in
March 2016.

                                           ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
                                                                                               OPPORTUNITIES JUNE 2016




5.1.1  Basic port infrastructure is inadequate, limiting access for larger cruise ships
A leading barrier to the development of cruise tourism in many of the ports is the lack of adequate infrastructure
to permit efficient access for larger cruise ships. Additional infrastructure is also required in hub ports (i.e.
Alotau and Honiara) to enable cruise ships to extend their stay at small ports and offer a more extensive cruising
schedule.
In Honiara, the wharf must be sufficiently large enough to permit the largest cruise ships in the Pacific region
(maximum length size of 264 metres) to berth and take on-board fresh water supplies at 50 tonnes per hour at a
quality meeting World Health Organization (WHO) standards. At present, cruise ships must anchor offshore and
tender passengers to shore. Passenger responses indicate that the inconvenience of this slow and inefficient
process was one of the reasons some passengers decided to stay on-board. For others it limited the time they had
ashore. The new wharf currently under construction will accept its first 200-metre plus cruise ship in September
2016.
As Alotau is the port of call for many cruise ships from Australia, there is a need for the same standard of fresh
water supplies to be available as in Honiara. The ability to take on fresh water is an important factor as it improves
the comfort levels for cruise ship passengers and helps to open up other destinations in the area to cruise tourism.
In smaller ports of call, (such as Kitava), the construction of a new jetty is required to enable two tenders to
disembark simultaneously so that passengers can be transported to and from larger cruise ships more efficiently.
Improvements are also required at Madang port to reinforce and extend the port berth to enable larger ships to
dock in port more regularly.
Without these infrastructure improvements, cruise operators will not be able to extend their cruise offer in
PNG and SI using larger cruise ships. The impact on passenger comfort and access to ports will also hinder the
development of cruise tourism in both countries.


5.1.2  The tourism industry is not established in some destinations
Kitava, Kiriwina and Doini are considered subsistence economies with most inhabitants relying on fishing and
agriculture for their livelihoods. Cruise tourism income is a rare source of cash to supplement otherwise low
incomes and is important as it enables families to purchase essentials which they cannot barter (e.g. fuel, boat
engine parts, and tools). The small local economy has not developed sufficiently to maximise the opportunities
that cruise tourism offers.
In the urban centres of Alotau, Rabaul and Honiara, (which have more developed economies), the tourism industry
is still considered to be in its infancy. Visits by larger cruise ships are increasing from a low base in comparison to
other Pacific Island destinations (e.g. Vanuatu and Fiji). As a consequence, the following features of the tourism
industry limited the passenger expenditure and the impact of cruise tourism more generally:
 Many businesses are family owned which limits the indirect impacts of cruise tourism expenditure as revenue
   goes directly in to household budgets. For instance, handicrafts and coconut drinks are typical products
   produced and sold to cruise passengers but these require limited production inputs and therefore have limited
   economic impact outside of the family
 Family members may not be paid for their work and are unlikely to be fully employed by activities related to
   cruise tourisms. As noted, many vendors see cruise tourism as a supplementary income rather than a primary
   source of employment. The implication is that while the number of persons employed may be high, only a
   limited number can be considered full-time and wages are likely to be below average full-time equivalent
   earnings

 Without an established tourism industry in smaller ports, there may be a reluctance to see its longer term
   potential. One business owner interviewed suggested that some vendors may see tourists as an opportunity to
   ‘make a quick buck’, opposed to a long- term business opportunity. In part this reflects the short time cruises
   have been stopping in these ports, and the infrequency of cruise ships which currently visit. This short-term
   mentality reduces the willingness of local businesses to invest in premises and the quality of their products and
   services, subsequently hampering the development of a more substantive tourism industry
While these issues are more acute in the smaller ports, the tourism industry in Alotau, Rabaul and Honiara is
no less under-developed according to passenger and business feedback (see box below). The contrast of PNG
and SI destinations with Port Vila on the second cruise in this study illustrates the scale of the gap – not only
in the number of businesses established to serve cruise passengers, but also in the level of cruise passenger
expenditure and its economic impact.
If PNG and SI are to benefit from the opportunities that cruise tourism offers, one of the first steps must be to
establish an economy and tourist industry with the capacity to handle the influx of tourists in a sustainable way,
while at the same time maintaining the unspoilt and uncommercial nature of the ports, (which many passengers
highlighted as a drawcard). Factors limiting the growth of businesses include limited access to start-up capital,
limited knowledge of financial management among business owners, limited awareness of tourism possibilities in
remote areas, and cultural challenges such as issues with local women setting up businesses.




  Summary of business feedback – tourism industry development
  “The cruise tourism industry is very new and the local businesses are trying to keep up – they have not seen this
  kind of influx before.” (Alotau)
  “Tourism is still very up and down –people are still learning.” (Alotau)
  “Locals need to be passionate about what they make, rather than trying to make a quick buck” – dishonesty and
  overcharging of tourists.” (Alotau)
  “It is an exciting time for the area due to the cruise ships and the income is often all the income people get from
  selling carvings, etc.” (Kiriwina)
  “They think cruise ships are great – it is the only way to make money – otherwise they just live of the land through
  farming.” (Kiriwina)
  “It will come – they are still getting their heads around it.” (Rabaul)


5.1.3  Businesses lack commercial awareness
A major draw for cruise passengers visiting PNG and SI is the uncommercial and unspoilt nature of the
destinations visited by cruise ships. However, pre-visit focus groups with passengers revealed that the lack
of commercial experience and awareness among businesses has led to reduced expenditure by passengers
compared to what they had planned to spend. There is a lack of business acumen about what to produce, how
to sell those products to cruise tourists and at what price. This also reflects the limited product offer in terms of
tours and handicrafts highlighted in the qualitative findings.

                                                                                               OPPORTUNITIES JUNE 2016




In some destinations the lack of established business premises to operate from meant that many handicraft
sellers have to travel from nearby villages in order to meet the cruise ship on arrival and sell products by the
roadside, at irregular intervals and with limited information on the price of goods for sale. On the second cruise
researchers noted some improvement in business acumen with vendors displaying fixed prices in Doini, providing
straws for coconut drinks, and instilling hygienic food-handling practices. However, this is not considered
common practice and passengers expect a higher standard before they are willing to increase expenditure.
Quotes from interviews highlighting this issue are provided in the box below.



  Summary of business feedback – business commercial awareness
  “There is a lack of knowledge of what tourists want – there is a disconnect between what is on offer and what is
  there.” (Tourist Authority, Alotau)
  “Products can be very expensive as some carvings are priced at 440 Kina and these are not very popular – tourists
  are typically looking for smaller items around 20 Kina.” (Alotau)
  “Local people have little knowledge of how to sell or run businesses so they need help from government (which is
  starting to happen).” (Alotau)
  “Need to educate the locals more on what is needed for tourists” (Rabaul)

The stop at Port Vila on the second cruise reinforced the scale of the problem. Casual observation of the
researchers revealed that expenditure by cruise passengers was much higher in Port Vila compared to previous
destinations visited. In part this was due to the fact that this was the last stop on the cruise and passengers were
encouraged to spend left-over currency.


5.1.4  There is a disconnect between cruise operators and local businesses
A disconnect between cruise operators, local businesses and other stakeholders is another factor impeding the
development of the tourism industry in PNG and SI. According to interviews with businesses the disconnect takes
three forms:
1.	 Limited communication about cruise schedules, resulting in many vendors missing the cruise ship visit. This
    is particularly relevant on the smaller islands where many vendors have to travel from nearby villages. In larger
    towns, the lack of communication results in many vendors not opening up their premises or being ill prepared
    for the influx of tourists. The majority of businesses interviewed in all destinations highlighted the need for
    better communication and collaboration between local providers and cruise ships
2.	 Lack of a long-term commitment by cruise operators to stop at ports does not provide conditions conducive
    to investment by local businesses. While there are enterprising locals who wish to start their own business and
    existing businesses wanting to expand (e.g. from a street stall to permanent premises), without a commitment
    by cruise operators to guarantee a regular stream of tourists, development is hampered.
3.	 Limited coordination and collaboration of local businesses and communities. Workshops highlighted the
    fragmented nature of many efforts to inform businesses of forthcoming cruise stops and the local response to
    ensuring businesses are open, streets are clean and attractive, and support is provided in terms of providing
    currency exchange services or destination information to passengers.

5.1.5  Cruise passengers lack confidence in the goods and services available
Although less developed than some South Pacific Island destinations, PNG and SI does offer a choice of
attractions, goods and services (including organised tours, handicrafts, food and drink) which passengers can
spend their money on. However, researchers observed that many passengers were reluctant to purchase goods
and services available for several reasons:
 Passengers were uncertain regarding quarantine rules and this deterred many consumers from buying
   handicrafts. On the first cruise passengers were provided with information through a video presentation,
   an on-board quarantine box, and a presentation by a cruise ship representative. On the second cruise less
   information was available to passengers and no quarantine box was provided. This meant passengers were not
   given nearly enough information to make informed purchasing decisions. Their concerns included not wanting
   to lose souvenirs at customs, not wanting to line up for inspection at customs, and not wanting to damage
   Australia’s ecosystem
 There was scepticism about whether the products available are genuine. Passengers were not willing to
   purchase handicrafts if they thought they were mass-produced or not locally made. Concerns about the finish
   of some items, (which were considered too consistent to be handmade), and the fact that the same items would
   appear at multiple destinations at different prices also led scepticism and confusion
 Prior to disembarking, passengers also stated that they are poorly informed of the spending opportunities
   and activities available at each destination (i.e. local markets, crafts, local tour guides, schedule of
   performances). On the first cruise, a printed document was left in cabins prior to each port of call. On the
   second cruise, no written information for Doini, Kiriwina, Kitava and Honiara was made available to passengers.
   In Alotau, Rabaul and Port Vila pamphlets were distributed on the first day of the cruise providing information
   on tours available for purchase through the cruise operator. However, some of the printed materials were
   out-of-date and not informative enough for passengers wishing to plan a day of activities. A destination
   expert was also on board the second cruise to provide lectures about each stop. The content of the lectures
   focussed on history, culture and sightseeing, but there was limited practical information on where things can
   be found at each destination, the prices of goods and services, and the options available to those wanting to
   take a local tour (see summary in the box following). Passenger feedback highlighted frustration at a general
   lack of practical information and in some instances “misinformation” provided by the lecturer on some ports.
   Although many were willing to explore each port with an open mind, they lacked the basic information needed
   to navigate each destination, arrange activities and make the most of the opportunities available
These factors resulted in passengers not feeling sufficiently confident and empowered to make the most of
the spending opportunities in each port of call. A summary of the feedback from businesses and passengers is
provided in the box following.

  Summary of business and passenger feedback – passenger confidence
  Quarantine uncertainty
  “There needs to be better information on the quarantine laws so passengers and locals know exactly what they
  can bring on board.” (Business, Alotau)
  “Many passengers are willing to take the risk but many are not – especially with bigger, more expensive
  purchases.” (Business, Rabaul)

  Destination information
  “There should be ‘do’ and ‘don’t’ information on what passengers can bring for the children on the island – books,
  pens, and paper are good. Lollies and soft drinks are not.” (Business, Kitava)
  “Awareness needed about local providers – there is no information on the boat leaflets about them.” (Business,
  Alotau)
  “There is no tourist website for Rabaul – it needs more advertising abroad which should be done by the local
  tourism board.” (Business, Rabaul)
  “There needs to be more information and more maps for tourists as well as easier transport – [the business] get
  very few visitors from the cruise ships.” (Business, Rabaul)
  There is an historical society in Rabaul – the cruise ships should contact them to help train tour guides who
  currently only give basic or incorrect information.” (Business, Rabaul)
  “Passengers had not conducted detailed research prior to this trip and were unsure of what to expect.”
  (Passenger focus groups and in-depth interviews)
  “The current consensus was that these documents [cruise provided leaflets] contain some information but most
  passengers would like more.” (Passenger focus groups and in-depth interviews)
  “Passengers like bringing gifts for the local communities which are much appreciated (e.g. pens, paper, and toys).
  However, many were unaware this was an option.” (Passenger focus groups and in-depth interviews)
  “Passengers would like more information about the products and services each port is renowned for.” (Passenger
  focus groups and in-depth interviews)


5.1.6  Passenger expectations are often not met
Despite expressing a willingness to be ‘surprised’ by what each destination offered and not wanting destinations
to become like Fiji (as one passenger quoted), many passengers found that destinations did not meet their
expectations for the following reasons:
 Limited awareness about options available to passengers: Many passengers felt that they were not informed
   of the options available to them. For example, many passengers did not know that local tour guides and
   transport could be arranged at each destination, rather than booked solely through the cruise operator. During
   focus groups, passengers stated that they often booked through the cruise operator even though it was more
   expensive because they considered it a safer and more convenient option. Nevertheless, would like to have
   been made aware of the alternatives and given the choice




                                                                                                                  PAGE 63
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
OPPORTUNITIES JUNE 2016




 This refers to Honiara in particular, where the second cruise did not arrange tours and it would have been helpful
   to know what local alternatives were available. Businesses confirmed they were willing to provide hire cars,
   drivers and other services to cruise passengers if tourists came to them but they require some promotion and/
   or information to be provided on-board the cruise ships
 Trip itineraries did not allow sufficient time to enjoy the scenery or learn from the experience. Many
   passengers felt rushed to “tick boxes” with little time left to engage with local communities and purchase the
   goods and services available. While it is understandable that tourists want to spend more time to explore and
   experience a place of interest, the research consultant noted that the tour provider often requires a strict
   schedule to enable the timely pick up of the next group of tourists. Feedback from passengers suggests
   the current balance is not quite right as passengers were only given to 5-10 minutes at each site on some
   excursions. On other trips, the number of stops was cut short, and in one case, the attraction was closed,
   unbeknownst to the tour guide
 Prices were higher than expected in PNG and SI, limiting cruise passenger expenditure. Many tourists
   expected PNG, in particular, to be relatively inexpensive and planned their expenditure accordingly. In reality,
   prices were broadly comparable to Australia for items such as drinks and food, which came as a surprise to
   many. More pre-cruise information was requested by passengers to plan their trips
 Information about the range of activities available was often limited. Passengers stated that they were given
   insufficient information about what there was to do at each destination, subsequently contributing to lower
   expenditure. Businesses highlighted the need to promote awareness of the activities and attractions available
   at each destination, (including scuba diving, surfing, sailing, fishing, walking etc.)

Insights from passengers and businesses concerning expectations are provided in the box below.



  Summary of business and passenger feedback – passenger expectations
  “Being able to deliver on the expectations of tourists through a range of products and training of the local
  people.” (Alotau)
  “Cruise ship could be very good for the hire car business but obviously there are many elderly passengers who
  don’t expect to drive – we would be happy to provide a driver if asked.” (Honiara)
  “Passengers would have liked to have known more about the opportunities to book local tour operators in Rabaul
  and Alotau (or local guides on island ports.)” (Passenger focus groups and in-depth interviews)
  “The annual Canoe Festival was held in early November (Alotau). There were expectations from passengers that
  they would be able to see this festival.” (Passenger focus groups and in-depth interviews)


5.1.7  Destinations lacked basic facilities
A common problem expressed in focus groups was a lack of facilities on-shore, which deterred cruise tourists
from leaving the cruise ship (i.e. to nearby villages) or to seek out attractions and businesses which could be
appealing to tourists (e.g. cafes, restaurants, handicraft vendors). Passenger feedback highlighted the lack of the
following facilities in particular:
 Limited currency exchange facilities on-board and on-shore. On the first cruise, a limited amount of local
   currency was available on-board and the cruise operator noted that the amount available had been reduced in
   recent years due to the operating costs associated with holding this money

                                                                                                 OPPORTUNITIES JUNE 2016




  On the second cruise, no similar provision was made available. In the less commercial destinations of Kitava,
  Kiriwina and Doini, there was no currency exchange facilities available ashore, forcing some vendors to
  exchange AUD for local currency, to enable passengers to make purchases. With limited local currency available
  to vendors, many passengers in focus groups considered they could have spent more. At larger destinations,
  passengers were frustrated by a lack of information about the location and opening hours of banks or currency
  exchange facilities. Without this information, very few passengers were able to find and use these facilities,
  leaving many with limited local currency. The exception was Honiara where foreign exchange facilities are
  available, ATMs are located close to the wharf and AUD is widely accepted
 Lack of maps and directional information to guide passengers: Passengers noted it was difficult to find
   destination maps and/or directions to basic amenities and services, (e.g. banks, toilets, food and beverage
   retailers, attractions, points of interest etc.). This information was not available prior to arrival in port, and once
   ashore there were limited signs and directions. As consequence, cruise passengers were reluctant to explore
   some destinations and were unaware of opportunities for leisure and entertainment where they could have
   spent money. This also contributed to many passengers returning to the cruise ship after only a short visit
   ashore, and the difficulty passengers had in exchanging currency on the second cruise
 Lack of sanitation facilities: many passengers were concerned about the lack of sanitation facilities ashore,
   particularly in the smaller ports of call. Even in the larger ports this was also considered a problem due to limited
   directional signage making it difficult for passengers to find these facilities even where they were available. As
   the number of cruise ship passengers visiting PNG and SI grows, this is clearly a priority need
 Lack of shaded areas: passengers reported that there was insufficient seating and shaded areas available in
   Kitava, Kiriwina and Doini. Many older passengers surveyed on both cruises cited this reason for staying on-
   board or returning to the ship after only a short time on-shore


5.1.8  Leakage of indirect expenditure
Leakage refers to the expenditure which flows out of an economy when a proportion of the costs of production
and profits flow to an overseas beneficiary. For example, fuel is often imported, so the amount a tour operator
pays towards fuel costs, taxes and some costs for the vendor, goes to the overseas fuel supplier. The less leakage,
the greater the impact on the local economy as money is allowed to flow into local investment, employment and
household expenditure.
Four sources of significant leakage were identified from the research:
 Cruise operator supply chains for goods and services. Each cruise takes on-board a large volume of goods and
   services at the destinations it visits and/or on before embarking on a cruise from its home port. Operators do
   not currently procure goods and services in PNG nor SI
 Cruise operator-organised tours and excursions: Many passengers are encouraged to purchase tours
   promoted on-board and sold through the cruise companies. These tours are often more expensive than the
   tours provided by local guides and as a proportion of the price goes to the cruise operator as profit, leakage
   from the local economy is increased. Allowing local providers to advertise on-board was suggested as a means
   to inform passengers of the alternatives, increase the number of local tours booked and increase the income
   to local economies. A caveat is that many passengers prefer to purchase cruise operator-arranged tours for
   convenience, insurance and general safety reasons. Cruise operators also only work with local providers that
   meet their minimum standards




                                                                                                                  PAGE 65
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
OPPORTUNITIES JUNE 2016




 A high proportion of cruise passengers go ashore, but return early, reducing the size of the captive market for
   local economies. For example, feedback from the first cruise highlighted that while passengers went ashore in
   the morning, many went back on-board for lunch and did not return ashore in the afternoon.
   Interviews with businesses in Honiara and Rabaul also highlighted that other than tour companies and vendors,
   local businesses (specifically cafes, restaurants and hotels) are not getting many tourists through the door. This
   reflects a number of issues related to limited transportation, the lack of prior information at each destination,
   low passenger awareness about what is available and a lack of local business promotion. Consultant notes
   highlighted that it may also not be in the interests of cruise operators for passengers to be spending more
   money on local food and drink. A local businessperson in Alotau suggested that better information could be a
   solution saying that:
   “Cruise operators also tell tourists to be wary of buying local food… they once prepared 1,500 meals and sold about 30”
 Foreign-owned businesses: As in the Vanuatu study, the research found that many businesses profiting from
   cruise tourism, (e.g. shop owners and tour operators) are owned by expatriates. Consequently, there is leakage
   of profits overseas which could otherwise be reinvested into local economies. In part, this is a reflection of the
   limited tourism industry and the difficulties associated with starting businesses in these countries, which can be
   addressed by supporting the development of local economies and increasing tourist numbers in the long-term


5.1.9  The numbers of cruise tourists visiting PNG and SI is currently low
compared to similar destinations.
The reasons given by businesses and passengers suggested that the reasons more people do not visit PNG and SI are:
 PNG has a negative reputation among some potential tourist markets, driven by crime in Port Moresby
   and media reports about the country. This negative perception is not limited to just cruise tourism and was
   identified by passengers and businesses as a hindrance to tourism growth in PNG
 There is limited promotion of PNG and SI as tourist destinations in the media. This extends to a lack of
   guidebooks, websites, and other sources of information that inform and promote destinations. These
   sources are also helpful for tourists who have decided to visit PNG and SI, as they can find out more about
   the attractions, culture and activities available. Businesses also suggested that more could be made of the
   connections many potential tourists have with the region (e.g. family members who fought in World War II) to
   find out more and visit in the future. Natural attractions such as unspoilt beaches, volcanoes, and coral reefs
   could also be featured more in promotional materials.
   Businesses on the smaller islands indicated that improved coverage of the water-based activities (such as
   scuba diving) would help to bring in more tourists
 Customs and immigration procedures in PNG could be improved. At present, cruise ships must use proclaimed
   ports for clearance which limits cruise itineraries and the frequency of calls. Cruise operators consider this a
   competitive disadvantage compared to other Pacific Island destinations. This could be addressed by PNG and
   SI permitting cruise operators to bear the cost of using immigration services at non-proclaimed ports, and
   bringing the process in line with other PICs in order to increase passenger time on-shore

6  Cost benefit analysis of the opportunities for
increasing the economic impacts of cruise tourism to
Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands
6.1  Introduction
6.1.1  Overview
This section introduces and then assesses the costs and benefits of a shortlist of options selected to address the
barriers and challenges preventing the full realisation of the economic impact of cruise tourism to PNG and SI. The
options include packages of actions to be taken together to benefit from synergies that reduce the cost and/or
maximise expected benefits.
The options were developed from a long list of actions developed during in-country workshops with businesses,
donors and government stakeholders; primary research with passengers and businesses during two cruises
in November 2015 and January 2016; and the additional input of cruise operators and the Seaport Group, port
infrastructure and development experts. Proposed actions were grouped into nine categories:
 Infrastructure investment actions
 Product development of goods and services available to cruise tourists
 Capacity building, (referring to actions to improve the absorption of cruise tourism expenditure by local
   economies)
 Communication and collaboration between local stakeholders, businesses, government and cruise operators
 Funding
 Training and education needs
 Passenger information and awareness
 Improving standards and awareness, to improve destination quality and enforcement of existing minimum
   standards
 Local impact

Each proposed action was prioritised as either a short-term priority (enabling planned cruise schedules in PNG
and SI to take place), or a longer-term priority to develop the potential of, and maximise the future benefits of
cruise tourism in each country. This helped to identify the most urgent actions that could be grouped together
as options. This exercise also identified actions that are so long-term in nature that they are not priorities for
this study. For example, developing a fly-cruise offer in PNG and SI was considered a long-term action which
requires not only cruise ships to be based in PNG or SI, but also a high frequency of direct flights and sufficient
airport capacity to be established before such an offer can be developed. This would also include improved road
connections between the port and airport. Experts consulted considered this action unfeasible in the foreseeable
future, but suggested it could be considered once the necessary infrastructure is in place 10 years or more from
now. For this reason the action was screened out.
The shortlist of proposed actions were then grouped as options, giving consideration to the on-going actions
of the private sector, local and national governments and development partners to any potential synergies to
support cruise tourism in PNG and SI. The final shortlist of options was then taken forward for the CBA.

6.1.2  Methodology for assessing the costs and benefits of the proposed options
The CBA aims to quantify the costs and benefits of the proposed shortlist of options. The impacts are assessed
over a 10-year period, reflecting the fact that many options require action in the first year, resulting in benefits
from years 2 to 10. This approach is consistent with the Vanuatu 2014 study.
A summary of the general assumptions used in the analysis is provided in Table 6.1. A more detailed description
of methodology used to quantify each option, the assumptions and data sources used is provided in Annex 4. An
elaborated summary accompanies the assessment of each option in the following sub-sections outlining options

6.2  Papua New Guinea
6.2.1  Option 1: Infrastructure improvements to existing ports of call
The following infrastructure actions were identified for ports of call in PNG to enable cruise ships to access each
destination and efficiently disembark passengers:
 Action 1: Extension of a jetty in Kitava to enable simultaneous disembarkation of two tenders for more efficient
   transportation of passengers to and from larger cruise ships
 Action 2: Alotau provision of fresh water supplies for cruise ships to WHO standards. As the first port of call for
   cruise ships from Australia, development of this capability is considered a priority for cruise development in the
   region
 Action 3: Madang reinforcement and extension of the port berth to enable more regular and larger ships to
   dock in port. Based on the assessment of the Seaport Group this would entail the construction of two sinker
   blocks and upgrades to fenders
All three actions are included under this option and are considered the responsibility of the relevant port authority
to implement.
The CBA results are provided in the box below.



   Costs
   The assumed unit costs are consistent with those used in the SI assessment, based on estimates provided
   by Seaport Group. In year 1 this includes the construction of beach shelters/huts (AUD 65,000) and
   extension of the existing jetty at Kitava (AUD 195,000), the improvement of water supplies at Alotau to
   WHO standards (AUD 195,000), and the construction of two sinker blocks and upgrades to fenders at
   Madang (AUD 39,000).
   Maintenance costs incurred in years 2-10, differ by capital asset, with 1-2 per cent of CAPEX per year
   assumed in the case of landing facilities (i.e. jetty), 15-20 per cent for beach shelters and 10 per cent for
   water supply equipment.
   Present value of costs: AUD 0.7 million
   Benefits
   These infrastructure improvements will increase the attractiveness and accessibility of these destinations
   for cruise ships, resulting in an increased number of calls to Kitava (an additional four in years 2-4 and seven
   in years 5-10 according to Carnival Australia projections, Alotau (two additional call in years 5-10), and
   Madang (an additional three in years 2-4 and eight in years 5-10).

6.2.2  Option 2: Upgrade port amenities in PNG
Option 2 combines a number of actions concerning improvements to the port area for cruise passengers.
The overarching objective is to make the port area more appealing to passengers, ensuring more passengers
disembark and increase their expenditure. This option includes the following:
 Action 1: Construct a sanitation block near or at the wharf area in Kitava and Kiriwina
 Action 2: Provide covered areas, including seating for passengers in Kitava and Kiriwina
 Action 3: Erect clear signage to enable cruise passengers to navigate from the port area to leading attractions
   and points of interest in Alotau and Rabaul. Although amenities exist (i.e. currency exchange and banks),
   passengers do not know where to go to reach them
This is an option for local and national governments to implement the above
The CBA results are provided in the box below.



   Costs
   The costs are assumed to be AUD 52,000 for the construction of a sanitation block, and AUD 97,500 for
   the construction of covered areas and seating for passengers in Kitava and Kiriwina. In Alotau and Rabaul
   improvements to signage are assumed to cost AUD 19,500. All costs are based on Seaport Group estimates
   and occur in year 1.
   Maintenance of the sanitation block is estimated to cost 10 per cent of CAPEX in years 2-10 and 5 per cent
   for the maintenance of covered seating areas.
   Present value of costs: AUD 0.2 million
   Benefits
   These improvements are likely to result in passengers spending more time ashore at each destination,
   increasing their total expenditure as a consequence. Passenger expenditure is assumed to increase
   proportionally with increased time ashore as follows:
   In Kitava and Kiriwina, time spent is increased from to 3.4 to 3.6 hours currently to 3.8 hours; as observed in
   Doini Island from year 3; and
   In Alotau and Rabaul, passenger time spent ashore is assumed to increase by 15 minutes from year 3.

6.2.3  Option 3: Streamlining customs and immigration procedures in PNG
Two actions are proposed under this option:
 Action 1: Legislative changes to enable the cruise operators to use non-proclaimed ports for clearance. This
   will allow cruise companies to plan itineraries more effectively and increase cruise frequency. This could be
   achieved by increasing the number of proclaimed entry/exit ports, or using procedures like other PICs where
   the cruise operator is allowed to bear the cost of using immigration services at non-proclaimed ports. Most
   of the costs associated with this new procedure (i.e. to fly a customs officer to the non-declared port of entry)
   would be borne by cruise operators directly
 Action 2: Improve the process of clearing passengers in line with processes used in other PICs. The current
   immigration process is cumbersome, takes a long time (requiring crew to collect and copy passports for all
   passengers) and reduces on-shore time for the passengers who must wait for their passports to be returned
   before disembarking. In other jurisdictions, (such as New Zealand), arrival formalities are performed at sea with
   authorities joining the vessels at the overseas port of departure. In other cases this is conducted on-board the
   ship before passengers disembark. This could be efficiently carried out in a processing area as passengers leave
   the ship

This option should be implemented by PNG’s customs and immigration service. The CBA results are provided in
the box below.



   Costs
   A Standard Cost Model (SCM) approach was used to quantify the cost of this option assuming:
   The time of 10 legislators for one month are required to undertake legislative change, (at PNG government
   pay scale 18); and
   The cost of training equates to 20 customs officers’ time for one month (at PNG government pay scale 10).
   Present value of costs: AUD 0.1 million
   Benefits
   As in the previous options, the benefits are assumed proportional to the additional time passengers spend
   ashore due to less onerous customs procedures. This option is also assumed to increase the number of
   calls to Conflict Island, which will be accessible under the new legislation. The detailed assumptions are:
   The number of calls to Conflict Island increases to nine calls per year in years 3-10. Spending levels are
   assumed to be similar to passenger expenditure observed in Kitava; and
   Increase in time spent ashore in Alotau by 15 minutes in years 3-10, due to less time spent on customs
   procedures by passengers.

COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS JUNE 2016




6.2.4  Option 4: Increase the provision of foreign exchange services
An acute problem in PNG ports of call was the limited availability of foreign exchange (forex) facilities, which
consequently limits passenger expenditure. Having a forex on-shore is costly due to the irregularity of cruise ship
calls, whereas the costs of a forex on-board would be borne by cruise ship operators alone, and hence are not
costed as part of this assessment.
 Action 1: Providing an ATM or foreign exchange booth at or near the wharf in Alotau
Providing one ATM near or at the wharf in Alotau was considered sufficient to meet the demand for forex based on
current passenger numbers. As Alotau is the first port of call for many cruises it was assumed that the availability
of an ATM machine at the wharf would increase passengers spend over the entire trip in PNG. The CBA results are
provided in the box below.



   Costs
   The costs of installing and operating a foreign exchange service in Alotau is estimated based on the
   following assumptions:
   AUD18,850 for the purchase and installation of an ATM machine in year 1; and
   10% of the purchase cost per annum in maintenance in years 2-10.
   Present value of costs: AUD 0.03 million
   Benefits
   From year 2, the presence of a foreign exchange service is estimated to increase expenditure by an average
   of AUD25 per passenger for the 20% of passengers who are assumed to make use of this new service.
   Present value of benefits: AUD 1.9 million

   AUD 1.87 million

6.2.5  Option 5: Development of the product offer in PNG
Option 5 combines two actions to develop the product offer in PNG:
 Action 1: Establish a more formalised cruise committee
 Action 2: Develop tours and excursions on smaller islands (i.e. Kitava and Kiriwina)
A major barrier to cruise tourism development and its economic impact is the lack of communication about
passenger data and cruise schedules between cruise operators and local stakeholders, and inadequate
dissemination of information within local economies.
One proposed action is to establish a cruise committee in each port composed of cruise tourism-related
stakeholders. The other is a role for tourism authorities to gather and disseminate information of national interest
to improve communication, cooperation and collaboration at the national level.




PAGE 72

                                                                                        COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS JUNE 2016




The terms of reference related to the roles and responsibilities of the cruise committee should include:
 Dissemination of information (e.g. cruise schedules, alerting businesses to Sunday arrivals)
 Share information on passenger expenditure and feedback
 Collect the opinion of businesses, conduct passenger research once ashore to provide accurate market
   intelligence to inform future development and decision-making
 Work with cruise operators to develop the cruise offer
 Planning and identifying future investment needs
 Function as the principle source of information to feed into leaflets, videos and other marketing information
   materials

Consultation also highlighted the need for the development of tours and excursions to meet passenger demands.
The analysis shows that the economic impact of cruise tourism is greatest from passenger expenditure on tours
and excursion in each destination. On the cruise trips surveyed, there were no tours available on-board in Kitava
and Kiriwina and the local tour market is in its infancy. It is recommended that capacity development training is
organised for current and potential tour operators in Kitava and Kiriwina.
The cost benefit analysis assumed the main cost under this option would be time spent by cruise committee
members to perform their function, as well as funding the capacity building for tour operators in Kitava and
Kiriwina. The main benefit would come from increased spending by passengers visiting PNG.



   Costs
   A SCM approach was used to estimate the costs of committee meetings and the time needed to administer
   the sharing of information. It is assumed that these costs will be incurred in all years. The Consultant has
   used SI employee survey data on average wage costs and estimated the time each activity involves, and
   estimated the cost by multiplying these two numbers per activity. The total cost is estimated by multiplying
   the number of persons involved in the activity, and/or it frequency. Table A4.6 in Annex 4 provides more
   details on the data used.
   Training costs were obtained via quotation from a training provider for a 1-3 month business capacity
   course in PNG. It is further assumed that this training is provided in years 1 and 2 only, with a 20 per cent
   administration fee charged on the training cost.
   Present value of costs: AUD 0.2 million
   Benefits
   Through improved communication and a better developed tour offer, it is assumed passengers visiting
   Alotau will spend more achieving 80 per cent of expenditure observed in Rabaul in years 3-10. In Kitava and
   Kiriwina passengers will spend twice more than the current spending on tours.

6.2.6  Option 6: Improving information provision to passengers in PNG
The need to improve the quality and quantity of information provided to passengers when making destination
and purchasing decisions was identified as a priority. Without this information, average passenger expenditure
is reduced partly due to uncertainty regarding quarantine restrictions, especially in relation to handicrafts (in
particular those with feathers and seeds).
The actions recommended to address low expenditure are:
 Providing quarantine videos and leaflets to passengers
 Updating destination information provided by cruise operators to passengers
 Developing and providing maps of the port, city centre and areas of interest
 Informing passengers of the opportunity to make donations
Efforts should be coordinated closely with those of the Pacific Horticulture and Agricultural Market Access
(PHAMA) program on quarantine issues and the cruise committee/ donor organisation regarding donations and
general information given to passengers. Cruise operators are also an important communication channel to
passengers and should be involved in implementation. It is anticipated that the cruise committee would take the
lead in this option. The estimated impacts are provided in the box below.



   Costs
   Estimates of the costs of this option are based on:
   A quotation of AUD 81,000 for the production of a three-minute video providing quarantine information;
   AUD 0.1 per double sided leaflet produced for passengers. It is assuming all passengers receive a leaflet on
   each cruise.
   Three days of a person’s time on an average government salary (from PNG Employment survey) per year to
   update map and destination information.
   The updating of the information and provision of leaflets occurs in each and every year.
   Present value of costs AUD 0.1 million
   Benefits
   This analysis conservatively estimates that by being more informed, passengers on average spend 20 per
   cent more on souvenirs and donations in years 3-10 than they do at present.

6.3  Solomon Islands
6.3.1  Option 1: Upgrade Honiara’s port infrastructure
The first priority for Honiara is to upgrade the port capacity in order to handle large cruise ships. An AUD 33.8
million investment, funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is already underway for the
construction of a new 180 to 200-metre long wharf in Honiara.
Cruise ships are currently required to anchor offshore and ferry passengers to and from the port in smaller
vessels. The journey takes 20-30 minute in each direction, making disembarkation much slower and less efficient
than it could be, and reducing passenger time on-shore. For the full economic impact of cruise tourism to be
realised by businesses in Honiara, a first step is to ensure that cruise ships are able to moor directly at the port
wharf, providing direct and efficient access to the town for passengers.
The new wharf will berth 220-metre ships by October 2016, 264-metres pending the successful operation of
220-metre ships and potentially up to 300-metre ships in the future. However, the location and environmental
conditions of the new wharf are not optimal and the original design was done for 200-metre cargo ships. Using the
facility for the larger cruise vessels is theoretically possible, but needs to be tested.  
A second priority is to ensure adequate fresh water supplies are available to cruise ships. As a first stopping point
for many cruises, fresh water supplies are needed in Honiara to replenish supplies before visits are made to
smaller ports in the region. The alternative would be greater desalination of sea water on-board. The provision of
fresh water also offers an additional revenue stream for port operators.
The specifications of the required actions are:
 Action 1: A wharf capable of handling future cruise ships of up to 264-metres in length, and current ships of
   220-metres in length (already in construction)
 Action 2: Water supplies to WHO standards of 50 tonnes per hour
Both actions are required in time for the inaugural call of Pacific Eden to Honiara on 1 October 2016. These actions
are considered the responsibility of the Solomon Islands Port Authority (SIPA).
If implemented, these improvements are expected to encourage more cruise ships to call in Honiara and increase
the time passengers spend ashore. It is estimated that in 10 years cruise tourism alone will cover some 50 per cent
of the costs of the investments needed under Options 131.




31	 Calculated benefit cost ratio is 0.5:1



                                                                                                               PAGE 75
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRUISE TOURISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA & SOLOMON ISLANDS
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS JUNE 2016




An additional benefit of the new wharf is increased capacity of Honiara’s port to handle larger cargo ships. The
expected increased number and revenue from cargo ships is not quantified due to the lack of available data. The
result of the CBA for Option 1 are presented in the box below.



   Costs
   JICA’s ‘Project for the Improvement of Honiara Port Facilities’ has allocated AUD 33.8 million including
   construction of the new wharf, which is assumed to take place in year 1. Seaport Group estimates the cost
   of improving the water supply available at Honiara to WHO standards to be AUD 195,000 in year 1, plus
   maintenance costs of 2 per cent of the initial cost per year thereafter.
   Present value of costs: AUD 48.5 million
   Benefits
   Two benefits are quantified:
   •	     Increased number of cruise calls to Honiara, including larger ships due to improved infrastructure
          (based on Carnival Australia growth projections)
   •	     Time spent onshore by passengers is increased from 3.7 hours on average to 4.3 hours (best
          performing large port of call surveyed – Rabaul)
   A third benefit – improved cargo handling from the new wharf – has not been quantified. The assessment is
   conservative, as in practice a new wharf would be expected to have a lifecycle in excess of 10 years, which
   would see the benefits exceed the costs over time.

6.3.2  Option 2: Upgrade Honiara’s port amenities
Option 2 combines a number of actions concerning improvements to the port area for cruise passengers. The
overarching objective is to make the port area more appealing to passengers, thus ensuring more passengers
disembark and increase their expenditure in Honiara. This option also ensures that port facilitates are better
equipped to handle the influx of passengers forecast to visit Honiara. This option includes the following actions:
 Action 1: Construct and maintain a sanitation block
 Action 2: Provide covered areas, including seating for passengers which is considered important to provide
   shade and cover in times of inclement weather
 Action 3: Provide clear signage to enable cruise passengers to navigate from the port area to leading
   attractions and points of interest
 Action 4: Provide litter bins and make the area more attractive for cruise passengers via port beautification

For cost purposes it would beneficial if these actions are implemented simultaneously to uplift the port area and
its facilities in preparation for larger cruise visits starting 1 October 2016. Actions should be taken by SIPA in
cooperation with the Honiara City Council. The CBA analysis is summarised in the box below.



    Costs
    Seaport Group provided estimates on the unit costs of constructing a sanitation block at Honiara (AUD
    52,000), covered areas and seating for passengers32 (AUD 97,500), provision of signage (AUD 19,500) and
    litter bins/beautification of the port area (AUD 13,000). These are all considered one-off costs incurred
    in year 1. Maintenance costs of 10 per cent of CAPEX are assumed for the sanitation block and other
    amenities, incurred in years 2-10.
    Present value of costs: AUD 0.3 million
    Benefits
    The benefit of the port improvements is that by making the area more attractive to tourists, they are
    more likely to spend more time ashore and therefore increase their expenditure (assumed proportionally).
    Time spent ashore is assumed to increase from the current 3.7 hours on average to 4.3 hours, based on
    the best performing port (Rabaul). It is assumed spending increases proportionally with time (i.e. a one per
    cent increase in time spent ashore increases spending by one per cent) The number of calls to Honiara is
    assumed to remain constant at seven calls per year from 2017.

6.3.3  Option 3: Development of product offer in Honiara
Option 3 combines two actions to develop the product offer in Honiara:
 Action 1: Establish a more formalised cruise committee
 Action 2: Develop tours and excursions

A major barrier to cruise tourism development and its economic impact is the lack of communication related
to passenger data and cruise schedules between cruise operators and local stakeholders, and inadequate
dissemination of information within the local community.
A cruise committee currently exists in Honiara, which meets on an ad hoc basis prior to the arrival of each cruise
ship. Individual businesses also broadcast cruise arrivals the day before to ensure businesses are open (especially
on Sundays) and are prepared to manage cruise arrivals on the day. However, the cruise committee would benefit
from more formalised roles and responsibilities, regular meetings, and the provision of a single point of contact for
all information on cruise tourism in the Soloman Islands.
The terms of reference for a more formalised cruise committee should include:
 Dissemination of information (e.g. cruise schedule, alerting businesses to Sunday arrivals)
 Share information on passenger expenditure and feedback
 Collect the opinion of businesses and conduct passenger research to provide accurate market intelligence to
   inform future development and decision-making
 Work with cruise operators to develop the cruise offer
 Plan and identifying future investment needs
 Function as the principle source of information to feed into leaflets, videos and other marketing and
   information materials

The last bullet mentioned above is important for a number of stakeholders (including cruise operators and
websites promoting SI as a tourism destination) to ensure that the information they provide to passengers is
accurate and reliable. The recommended frequency of meetings is once per month with attendance by all major
stakeholders.
Consultation also highlighted the need to develop tours and excursions to meet passenger demands. The analysis
shows that the economic impact of cruise tourism is greatest from passenger expenditure on tours and excursion
in each destination. On the cruise trip surveyed, there were no tours available on-board. Tours will be available on
P&O cruise ships from May 2016 onwards.

                                                                                          COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS JUNE 2016




Since the market is in its infancy, there is a need to improve the quality of tours. It is recommended that a capacity
development training is organised for current and potential tour operators in Honiara. The CBA results are
provided below.



   Costs
   A standard cost model approach was used to estimate the costs of committee meetings and the time
   needed to administer the sharing of information. It is assumed that these costs will be incurred in all years.
   This study has used SI employee survey data on average wage costs and have estimated the time each
   activity involves and the cost by multiplying these two numbers per activity. To estimate the total cost, this
   is then multiplied by the number of persons involved in the activity, and/or its frequency (see Table A4.6 in
   Annex 4 provides more details on data used).
   Training costs were obtained via a quotation from a training provider for a 1-3 month business capacity
   course in SI. It is further assumed this training is provided in years 1 and 2 only, with a 20 per cent
   administration fee charged on the training cost.
   Present value of costs: AUD 0.1 million
   Benefits
   Through better communication between stakeholders and the development of a tour offer, it is assumed
   passengers visiting Honiara will spend more, achieving level of expenditure close to the level observed in
   Alotau. Conservatively, the analysis assumes the spending increases to 80 per cent of the level reported in
   Alotau in years 3 and 4 (i.e. after training in years 1 and 2), and to 100 per cent of the level reported in Alotau
   in years 5 to 10.

6.3.4  Option 4: Opening up of destinations in the Solomon Islands to cruise
tourism
Realising the economic potential of the Soloman Islands as a cruise tourism destination requires the expansion
of the cruise offer from a single port of call (Honiara) to multiple ports in the country. Establishing multiple
destinations will in time scale up the economic impact.
The core market for cruise tourism consists of 7-10 day schedules from Cairns. Destination ports must therefore
be located within a day’s cruise of each other and be sufficient in number to provide 3-5 day packages. With
Honiara the home or focal port of call, the remaining destinations could include Gizo and Tavanipupu.
 Action 1: Opening Gizo as destination for large vessels
Consultation with cruise operators identified the following needs to be addressed in order to open Gizo as a cruise
destination:
  •	 A hydrographical study for the destination
  •	 Additional bollards/large cleats to be added adjacent the sloping concrete ferry wharf at Gizo to permit
     ship tenders to safely berth alongside
  •	 The red and white navigational beacons and green starboard hand buoy as marked on official chart BA
     1735 to be replaced to International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) standards at Gizo.
     This will assist ship tenders (lifesaving appliances) in making safe entrance and exit from the port area
  •	 Encouraging and supporting Solomon Islands Marine Safety Administration (SIMSA) to ensure the
     maintenance of navigational aids and an effective Marine Safety Information (MSI) system as required
     by the International Marine Organization Safety of Life at Sea (IMO SOLAS) convention
 Action 2: Opening Tavanipupu as a destination for large vessels
Developing this destination would require investing in the following areas:
  •	 Preliminary weather monitoring
  •	 Hydrological survey of reef entrance to Tavanipupu
  •	 Destination impact study
  •	 Landing facilities (i.e. jetty)
  •	 Beach shelters /huts

    Consistent with earlier assessment, maintenance costs are assumed to equate to 10 per cent of CAPEX

6.3.5  Option 5: Improving information provided to passengers in Soloman Islands
The need to improve the quality and quantity of information provided to passengers when making destination
and purchasing decisions was identified as a priority. Without this information, average passenger expenditure
is reduced partly due to uncertainty regarding quarantine restrictions, especially in relation to handicrafts (in
particular those with feathers and seeds).
The actions recommended actions to address low expenditure are:
 Action 1: Provide quarantine videos and leaflets to passengers
 Action 2: Update destination information provided by cruise operators to passengers
 Action 3: Develop and provide maps of the port, city centre and areas of interest
 Action 4: Inform passengers of the opportunity to make donations to local communities
Efforts should be coordinated closely with those of PHAMA on quarantine issues and the cruise committee/ donor
organisation regarding donations and general information given to passengers. Cruise operators are also an
important communication channel to passengers and should also be involved in implementation. It is anticipated
that the cruise committee would take the lead in this option.
The CBA results are provided in the box below.


  Costs
  Estimates of the costs of this option are based on:
   A quotation of AUD 81,000 for the production of a three-minute video providing quarantine information
   AUD 0.1 per double sided leaflet produced for passengers (it is assumed that all passengers receive a
     leaflet on each cruise)
   Three days of a person’s time on an average government salary (from SI Employment survey) per year to
     update map and destination information
  Updating the information and the provision of leaflets occurs every year.
  Present value of costs AUD 0.1 million
  Benefits
  The Consultant conservatively estimates that by being more informed, passengers on average spend 20 per
  cent more on souvenirs and donations in years 3-10 than they do at present.

6.4  Concluding remarks
The headline findings are summarised in Table 6.1.
Providing an ATM or foreign exchange booth at/or near the wharf in Alotau (the first port of call for many
cruises), is found to have the highest benefit-cost ratio. In short, it was found that the PGK is not frequently
available currency for tourists visiting PNG and many traders in PNG do not accept alternative currency (i.e. AUD).
Without currency exchange facilities on the cruise ship, this resulted in many passengers being unable to make
purchases when visiting PNG ports. The low fixed cost of providing such an amenity is easily offset by increased
passenger expenditure for the 10 years under assessment.
In the same vein, improving information provided to passengers in both PNG and SI is also estimated to have
a large positive net impact. In-depth interviews with passengers indicated that they wanted to spend more, but
lacked the opportunities and confidence to do so. It is a relatively low cost exercise to provide a three-minute
quarantine video, update destination materials and provide a map of the ports to encourage cruise passengers to
explore and better navigate each port visited. These actions will also give passengers the confidence to purchase
handicrafts, ultimately resulting in higher expenditure.
Increased cooperation and coordination between businesses, local communities, government and cruise
operators, particularly in the development of future tours and excursion offers (which are the highest expenditure
items for passengers), is also anticipated to generate significant net benefits. Businesses should be better
prepared for cruise ship arrivals, with an improved range of better-priced and coordinated products to offer to
passengers. Key to this option in PNG and SI is the establishment of more formalised cruise committees in each
port with assigned roles and responsibilities. For example, it is assumed these committees will take the lead in
broadcasting the arrival of cruise vessels to local businesses and providing destination information to cruise
operators to ensure information given to passengers is relevant and up-to-date.
Improvements to customs and immigration procedures in PNG is expected to generate significant benefits
as speedier and more efficient procedures free up additional time for passengers to spend ashore. Benefits are
estimated proportional to the extra time spent ashore, when more goods and services are likely to be purchased.
Improving port amenities, such as the provision of shaded areas and seating, sanitation blocks and litter bins,
in many destinations is shown to have a significant net positive impact. The option makes the port area more
attractive to passengers considering a trip ashore.
Opening up cruise destinations such as Gizo and Tavanipupu in SI, requires significant upfront investments at
high cost. For example, this includes jetties, upgrades to wharfs and hydrological surveys to be carried out before
larger cruise ships can operate efficiently at these ports. However, over time the improvements enable increased
levels of expenditure from a higher frequency of calls and numbers of passengers.
The new wharf at Honiara is already under construction and will provide net benefits within 25 years. However,
the benefits to freight shipping operators from a new wharf are not quantified in the assessment due to lack of
data. The anticipated benefits would be much greater as cargo shipping is the largest user of the port. To enable
more cruise tourists to visit Honiara, this option was considered priority.

                                 procedures like other PICs where the operator
                                 is allowed to bear the cost of using immigration
                                 services at non-proclaimed ports. Most of the
                                 costs associated with the new procedure (i.e. to
                                 fly customs officers to the non-declared port of
                                 entry) would be borne by cruise operators directly

                                 with processes used in other PICs. Currently the
                                 immigration process takes a long time (requiring
                                 passport copies to be taken for all passengers,

          Annex 1  Methodology

          A1.1  Selecting a sample of cruise ships and ports for primary
          data collection
          Only a handful of cruise ships were calling into PNG and SI ports during the data collection period
          (November 2015 – March 2016). Based on purposive sampling, two ships were selected for research:
           P&O Pacific Dawn departing Brisbane Australia on 7 November and calling into PNG ports of Alotau,
             Kitava, Rabaul, Kiriwina and Doini
           Princess Cruises/Sea Princess departing Brisbane Australia on 22 January and calling into PNG ports of
             Alotau, Doini Island, Kiriwina, Kitava, Rabaul as well as Honiara in SI and Port Vila in Vanuatu


          A1.2  Survey of passengers and crew members
          A survey of passengers and crew members was conducted to collect data for on-shore spending and visit
          satisfaction. For the purpose of comparison, the survey questionnaire followed the same structure and
          questions used for BREA and Vanuatu 2014 studies.
          The following protocol was applied at each port of call of the two selected cruise ships:
           Paper-based surveys were distributed to passenger cabins by crew members at each port of call
           The surveys were collected by crew members from passenger cabins the following day
           Surveys were distributed before each port of call of the cruise
           By completing a survey after each port visit and leaving it in cabin for collection, passengers entered a
             promotion to win the ‘ultimate cruising package’ to be enjoyed on the last day of the cruise
           A leaflet was distributed along with the surveys to passengers. The leaflet included details of the
             promotion and details for recruitment to later stages of passengers’ research (see A1.3 Additional
             Qualitative Research with Passengers)
           A sample size of 100 passengers per port was targeted to ensure robust results

A1.3  Additional qualitative research with passengers
An in-depth understanding of passenger and crew expenditure at each port was gathered through a four-
step approach to passenger research:
 In-depth interviews (Phase 1)
  •	 Approximately 20-30 interviews were conducted per cruise during the first three days after
     departing Australia, each lasting around 20 minutes
  •	 The purpose of the Phase 1 was to discuss expectations of spending at the ports prior to arrival
     and what aspects they are looking forward to
  •	 Vouchers were provided by Carnival Australia to incentivise passenger participation
 In-depth interviews (Phase 2)
  •	 Phase 2 interviews were carried out once passengers and crew visited a port, and used to
     collect instant qualitative feedback on the experience and spend at each port
  •	 The team conducted approximately 5-10 interviews per cruise, each lasting approximately 10-
     15 minutes
  •	 Vouchers were provided by Carnival Australia to incentivise passenger participation
 Focus groups
  •	 Four focus groups took place on each ship during days 7-10 on the return trip to Australia
  •	 Passengers discussed overall experiences of the ports and what they have spent money on.
     Discussions focused on what demands and expectations passengers had when visiting ports
     that were not met, and what they would be willing to spend if the tourism offer was enhanced
  •	 Groups were segmented by travel group and life-stage to capture differences in demands and
     expectations of the ports in question
  •	 Vouchers were provided by Carnival Australia to incentivise passenger participation
 In-depth interviews (Phase 3)
  •	 The final phase interviews took place on days 7-10 as the cruise returns to Australia
  •	 The team conducted approximately 20-30 interviews per cruise, each lasting approximately
     10-15 minutes to discuss overall experiences of the ports and what they spent their money on
  •	 Incentives were considered to encourage participation by passengers and crew


A1.4  Business research
When passengers were visiting the port, researchers carried out interviews with 5-10 businesses per day
using a short survey. The survey took between 10-25 minutes to complete and requested information
on the basic costs structure of businesses, levels of employment and their suppliers to enable a reliable
mapping of the value chain.
The format of the business interviews proved slightly challenging with some businesses due to low
business acumen. As a result, specific questions around business costs were not always answered (in
detail). Instead, business owners were instead able to provide personal views on opportunities and
challenges regarding cruise ship tourism and its impact on their business.

          A1.5  Cruise operator and shipping agent data
          Administrative data was collected from:
           Cruise operators (i.e. Carnival Australia) including:
            •	 Number of port calls per year, by how many vessels
            •	 Number of passenger visits per year to PNG and SI
            •	 Size of vessels and crews
            •	 Itineraries (including day trips, excursions and entertainment)
            •	 Take-up of excursions/tours/entertainment by passengers
            •	 Cost of itineraries - to cruise passenger (if pre-booked or discounted)
            •	 Taxes, fees and surcharges paid by cruise at each port, including fuel costs
            •	 Value of goods and services taken on board vessel at each port, by vessel/itinerary
            •	 Local staff used by cruise (on board or in port services if known)
          We also gathered opinions/ data on:
            •	 Projected future demand for cruises
            •	 Expected future schedules and itineraries in PNG and SI
            •	 Expected changes in vessel size
            •	 Expected changes to passenger offering (i.e. facilities, activities, trips/excursions)
            •	 Required infrastructure developments in the countries to support future cruise tourism growth
          Other large cruise operators were also contacted (i.e. Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise
          Lines) but they didn’t have cruise ships visiting PNG or SI in 2015.
           Shipping agents handling cruise ships in PNG and SI:
            •	 Number and type of cruise ships handled at each port in 2015
            •	 Examples of port fees charged to the cruise operator


          A1.6  Main differences with previous studies
          During the Vanuatu 2014 study, the survey with passengers and crew members was administrated by the
          hotel operation staff on board of the cruise ships. There was no direct presence of researchers on-board.
          However, a small number of cruise ships visiting PNG and SI during the study period and the large number
          of ports required a different approach.
          As a result, two experienced market researchers from TNS Australia were present on-board two cruise
          ships to encourage passengers’ participation in more than one survey and conduct other qualitative
          research (see A1.3 Additional Qualitative Research with Passengers). Quantitative findings of the current
          study are hence enforced with qualitative insights gathered during field work.

Annex 2  Quantitative analysis of passengers’
spending drivers
The table below summarises the correlation between the potential driving factors and mean spend, and
compares them with the Vanuatu 2014 study. The factor that is strong and positively correlated to mean
spend indicates (but does not establish with certainty) that the factor causes more spending.

          Annex 3  Cost Structures and Assumptions
          This annex outlines the draft assumptions made related to the indirect impact assessment on the
          economy of PNG and SI:
           It shows assumed cost structure for each of the industries covered in the study
           It maps out the assumed flow of the money into one of the three final categories (local beneficiaries,
             government and leakage)
           Summarizes the sources for assumptions

          These assumptions and cost structures were applied to the ports of Alotau, Doini Island, Kitava, Kiriwina
          and Rabaul in PNG and Honiara port in SI.

A3.6  Kitava and Kiriwina and Doini Islands
The islands of Kitava, Kiriwina and Doini Islands differ from the rest of the ports surveyed. Kitava and
Kiriwina function as subsistence economies and the inhabitants are farmers. Doini Island is a privately
owned island. In Kitava and Kiriwina, businesses selling goods and services are ad-hoc, family owned
businesses set up only when cruise ships arrive. As a result, the impact assessment assumed the revenues
received from cruise ships are used entirely by private beneficiaries (for family consumption), there is no
supply chain, no taxes are paid (i.e. no government revenue) and nothing leaks from the economy (all the
material is sourced locally from farming e.g. wood, vegetables).

          Annex 4  Assumptions for cost benefit analysis

          A4.1  General assumptions
          The CBA covers a 10 year period for all options. The discount rates used for options in SI and PNG are 7
          per cent (as assumed in the 2014 Vanuatu Study) minus the inflation rates of the respective countries. The
          inflation rates of Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea are 5.95 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively –
          these are the average inflation rates over 2011-2014.
          For options which involve infrastructure constructions, it is assumed that all construction costs will be
          paid in year 1 and the associated maintenance costs will be incurred from years 2 to 10.
