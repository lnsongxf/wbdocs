Executive Summary
More than 90 per cent of the rural population in Senegal relies on solid fuel – charcoal and
firewood in particular, but also dung and agricultural residues – to meet its household
cooking needs. In the 1970s, Senegal began a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy
programme that is widely regarded as a success story of inter-fuel substitution. Following the
withdrawal of these subsidies in 2009, however, the market for LPG experienced a
significant setback. Households in the capital, Dakar, tend to use a mix of cooking fuels, but
their use of charcoal has gradually increased in recent years in response to the drop in LPG
usage.
This dominance of biomass usage in Senegal has resulted in significant adverse economic,
health, social, and ecological impacts, and measures are urgently needed to promote a
range of alternative household cooking fuels that are both cleaner and more sustainable.
Against this background, the World Bank commissioned this study to assess the feasibility of
promoting the use of a number of alternative cooking fuels in Senegal, which were pre-
identified for possible support under its Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management
Project (PROGEDE II). Four alternative fuels were analysed in terms of their potential for
adoption by households for cooking, each in a different region of Senegal: (a) briquettes in
Dakar, (b) ethanol in Saint-Louis, (c) biogas in Kaolack, and (d) pure plant oil (PPO) in
Tambacounda.
The study includes a baseline assessment of household cooking fuels in Senegal, including
a number of alternative fuels, as well as an analysis of their potential supply chains. Its
objective is to inform a range of relevant stakeholders – in particular the Ministry of Energy
and Mines in Senegal, the World Bank’s PROGEDE II, nongovernmental organisations,
investors and private sector companies – about strategies to increase production of and
access to these alternative fuels.
The study also presents important lessons on each alternative fuel deriving from household
surveys in each region, a review of the relevant literature, interviews with stakeholder
organisations, and focus group discussions (FGDs).
Briquettes in urban and peri-urban Dakar
Senegal’s capital is likely to be one of the most important demand centres for any alternative
fuel commercialised in the country in the future. Although consideration should be given to
what factors would lead to an increase LPG utilisation by both urban and peri-urban
households in the Dakar region, in the context of alternative fuels, an understanding of the
still relatively high (and growing) use of biomass fuels, particularly biomass briquettes, is
important. The use of briquettes could partially or even wholly replace charcoal and firewood
in both urban and peri-urban households in Dakar – and, if used within more efficient stoves,
could offer a cleaner-burning and cheaper alternative without the necessity of major
behavioural change.
We estimate that the sale price of briquettes in Dakar, which will depend on transport costs,
will fluctuate between CFAF 150 and 200/kg. At CFAF 20.2 per megajoule (MJ), briquettes
cost about half of the price of charcoal and two-thirds the cost of LPG in Dakar. Retailers will
likely be able to sell briquettes easily once end users start to appreciate the benefits, in
particular the fact that briquettes compare highly favourably with charcoal for cooking,
without having any major disadvantages provided they are produced to a high quality.
The study concludes that there is high potential to create a vibrant market for briquettes in
Dakar. The main challenges are likely to be (a) achieving the same quality of production

   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal               9
compared to charcoal and (b) scaling up production to meet potential demand, as the current
supply chain is still fairly informal and contributes to only a small percentage of fuel used for
household cooking.
Finally, the study suggests that a national awareness-raising campaign be conducted,
focusing first on the urban centres of Dakar, Saint-Louis and Kaolack. Targeting urban and
peri-urban households, the campaign would highlight the performance qualities of briquettes,
the money and time saved by their use, and the potential long-term health benefits.
Ethanol in urban Saint-Louis
The study finds similarly clear potential for the development of an ethanol market in Saint-
Louis. This could bring a range of social, economic and health benefits both to urban
households and to the businesses involved in ethanol production. An initial ethanol market
would be likely to target (a) urban charcoal users who use LPG as a secondary fuel and (b)
LPG users who could benefit from using a more affordable fuel.
Due to what would probably be ethanol’s comparatively high initial selling price of CFAF 320
per litre, it is likely that it would be affordable only in urban households in Saint-Louis. In
terms of cost per MJ, in the Saint-Louis region briquettes (CFAF 15.1/MJ) would remain the
lowest-cost option, followed by ethanol (CFAF 22.9/MJ), charcoal when used with improved
stoves (CFAF 23-53/MJ) and LPG (CFAF 31-38.3/MJ).
This study recommends that a pilot project be conducted through an initial collaboration with
the Senegalese sugar cane company, Compagnie Sucrière Sénégalaise (CSS). This would
aim to supply 1,500 households with ethanol by using the 550,000 litres of ‘head’ ethanol
produced (and currently wasted) by CSS’s ethanol plant in the city of Richard Toll.
Biogas in rural Kaolack
The study finds that although rural Kaolack has the right social and agricultural conditions for
the penetration of biogas technology to occur, it lacks sufficient awareness of the benefits of
the technology to really reach scale. The newly-established national government biogas
programme, designed to allow rural households to adopt biogas systems using subsidies
and loans, aims to overcome some of the existing barriers to take-up. However, it is also
recommended that the Senegal government should stimulate not only demand but also
supply – by supporting the development of a range of biogas suppliers that are currently
unable to construct the biogas systems or to train end users to maintain them efficiently.
In the Kaolack region there is good level of awareness around biogas, and many households
have expressed a strong interest in adopting the technology. However, the survey reveals a
lack of awareness of the national biogas programme, the benefits of which have not been
enjoyed by the majority of the population.
The research discovered that if the subsidies and loans that are available were accessed, on
the basis of current consumption rates and fuel costs in Kaolack, the cost of a 4 m³
biodigester could be paid back in 1-1.3 years. In addition, the survey reveals that households
in the region are used to accessing both formal and informal loans, suggesting a potential for
developing a specific microcredit mechanism for households willing to purchase biodigesters
and for entrepreneurs willing to invest in biogas.
However, the region still lacks biogas technology suppliers, and the few that do exist suffer
from low profit margins. This stems from a weak demand, mainly constrained by the low
purchasing power of households, coupled with the high upfront cost of the technology.
Senegal’s national biogas programme needs to become active at the regional level. Local
enterprises and micro-finance organisations need to be fully involved to enable households

   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal               10
to access loans and subsidies. Finally, the government should look at alternative solutions
suggested by stakeholders involved in the sector, and develop a capacity building strategy to
address enterprises’ need not only for technical assistance, but also for business
management skills.
Pure plant oil in Tambacounda
Although the region has the appropriate environmental conditions for the production of PPO,
in particular using the plant Jatropha curcas, PPO’s application as a household cooking fuel
does not seem to be a feasible option for Senegal. This has been demonstrated by the lack
of success of earlier initiatives which have attempted to introduce PPO (particularly
Jatropha) for cooking in the region.
The Tambacounda region is well endowed with biomass resources and, in terms of
household cooking fuels, charcoal and firewood are the least-cost options. The price per
megajoule of biomass ranges from CFAF 5 (for charcoal used with an improved stove) to
CFAF 11.8 (for charcoal used with an inefficient stove). This compares to CFAF 31.2 to
CFAF 38.3/MJ for LPG, and PPO obtained from Jatropha which costs CFAF 700 per litre or
CFAF 35.4/MJ.
It is therefore very unlikely that PPO use would significantly increase in uptake vis-à-vis
other biomass fuels unless it becomes more competitive in terms of affordability and quality,
particularly from the perspective of emissions and usability. It is also unlikely that the
minority of LPG users in Tambacounda will switch to using PPO, for which there are no
significant economical and cleanliness advantages. Alternative uses of PPO are possible,
however, such as powering machines and basic electrification.
The following is a summary of feasibility for the four alternative fuels in the four regions.

Introduction
Most of Sub-Saharan Africa continues to rely overwhelmingly on traditional fuels and
cooking technologies, both of which are a major cause of death and illness as well as a
range of socio-economic and environmental problems. More than 90 per cent of the rural
population of Senegal relies on solid fuels – charcoal and firewood in particular, but also
dung and agricultural residues – to meet its household cooking needs. In the 1970s, the
government of Senegal began a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy programme that is
widely regarded as a success story of inter-fuel substitution. Following the withdrawal of
these subsidies in 2009, however, the market for LPG experienced a significant setback.
Today, households in the capital, Dakar, tend to use a mix of cooking fuels, but their use of
charcoal has gradually increased in recent years, generally in response to the drop in LPG
usage.
The primary objective of this study is (a) to establish a baseline for the current level of
penetration of four alternative cooking fuels in Senegal in a number of pre-identified regions,
and (b) to assess the feasibility of adopting them in those regions. The four fuels are
briquettes from charcoal dust and agricultural residues; ethanol, mainly from sugar cane
residue (that is, molasses); pure plant oil (PPO) from locally grown, oil-bearing plants such
as Jatropha curcas; and a household biogas system using mainly livestock waste.
The inception phase allowed the study team to review the relevant background information,
including key documents, and to collect and compile the secondary data relevant to the
research objectives. The baseline assessment provided information not only on current
levels of penetration of alternative fuels and stoves, but also on the existing cooking situation
of households in the four pre-identified areas of Senegal. The baseline and feasibility
assessments provided comprehensive information on urban and rural domestic fuel use and
cooking stove acquisition, ownership, management, utilisation, consumer preferences,
willingness and ability to pay, and gender roles related to household energy issues.
This study can help stakeholders understand the potential for scaling up each of these
alternative fuels in the four regions as well as in the country as a whole as well as facilitate
Senegal’s move toward the sustainable and extensive use of appropriate alternative cooking
fuels.
Chapter 1 provides a synthesis of the background information collected during the inception
phase, while Chapter 2 presents the methodology used for the baseline, focus group
discussions and key informant interviews. Chapter 3 presents the structure for chapters 4–7,
which elaborate on the findings and recommendations for each fuel and region, including an
analysis of the demand, supply and costs. The final chapter summarises the report’s
recommendations.

Senegal has a surface area of 196,712 km² and a population of 12 million. Geographically
and politically it is divided into 14 régions and subdivided into 45 départements, 103
arrondissements, 110 municipalities, 320 communautés rurales and 13,212 villages.

Senegal’s key export industries are phosphate mining, fertiliser production and commercial
fishing. It is currently carrying out iron ore and oil exploration, although it still relies heavily on
donor assistance and foreign direct investment to stimulate its economy.
Until around 2012, Senegal’s GDP was composed of agriculture (15.3 per cent), industry
(22.7 per cent) and services (61.9 per cent) (CIA 2012).
Senegal’s rural population is 7.3 million, comprising approximately 700,000 rural households
in over 13,000 villages (see Table 1.1). Whilst the total urban population is less (at just over
five million in 2010), urbanisation is increasing fairly rapidly, and is expected to continue to
do so (ANSD 2010).
Rural households are generally dispersed, with 75 per cent of Senegal’s population living in
villages of fewer than 500 inhabitants, 23 per cent living in villages of 500–2,500, and only 2
per cent of rural population living in villages of over 2,500.

Senegal has a fairly diverse ethnic variation. Wolof is the largest single ethnic group (43 per
cent); others include the Fula (a nomadic, pastoral community herding cattle, 24 per cent)
and Tukulor (differing from the Fula only by the sedentary nature of their society, 24 per
cent), the Serer (15 per cent), Lebou (10 per cent), Jola (4 per cent), Mandika (3 per cent)
and a number of other smaller communities.

1.1.1 Geography and vegetation cover
Situated in coastal West Africa, Senegal has a total area of 196,712 km2, including 4,190
km2 of rivers and waterbodies. (This is important in the context of irrigation for crops,
including ‘energy crops’ used to make biofuels.) The nation borders Mauritania to the north
and Mali to the east along the Senegal River, whilst to the south-east and south, more or
less following the Casamance River, it borders Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, respectively. The
Gambia penetrates into the country for more than 320 km from the Atlantic coast eastwards
along the river with the same name. Senegal is a relatively flat country, essentially one of
plains and plateaus, with a maximum altitude of 400 m.
Senegal’s water resources include rivers (in particular the Senegal, Gambia and
Casamance), Guiers Lake, Anambé Basin, Sine, Saloum, and Ferlo Dead Valleys. Although
these resources – up to hundreds of billions of cubic metres – depend on rainfall variability,
they provide strong agro-pastoral development opportunities, such as the irrigation potential
of 350,000 hectares along the Senegal, Gambia and Falémé rivers (OMVS 2013). This is of
particular relevance to biomass purposely grown for fuel production, including wood and
charcoal (which in turn affects briquetting production), ethanol, pure plant oil, and biogas.

1.1.2 Climate
Senegal’s Sudano-Sahelian climate features a dry season from November to May and a
humid (rainy) season from June to October, caused respectively by northeast winter winds
and southwest summer winds. Average annual rainfall ranges from 1,200 millimetres in
southern Senegal to 300 millimetres in the north. Temperatures range from 15°C in January
in the northwest to a maximum of 42°C in May along the eastern border with Mauritania. The
mean temperature roughly increases from west to east, from 25°C to 30°C. These climatic


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                   14
variables significantly affect the types and intensity of vegetation in the country, and thus the
types and quantities of fuels (including alternative fuels) that can be produced (Enda 2010).

1.1.3 Agriculture and livestock
Forty two per cent of Senegal (81,560 km2) is agricultural land, of which 69.3 per cent
(56,500 km2) is under pasture. However, although farming involves almost 75 per cent of the
working population, it constitutes only 15 per cent of GDP. A significant proportion of
Senegal’s farmland consists of small family farms, which have an average cultivated land
size of 4.3 hectares. This means that 70 per cent of Senegal’s agricultural holdings
constitute 33 per cent of the cultivated land area.1 Senegal’s main agricultural areas are
situated in the regions of Thiès, Diourbel, Fatick and Kaolack, the latter two being cut
through by the bassin arachidier (groundnut basin). The main agricultural products are
peanuts, millet, corn, sorghum, rice, cotton, tomatoes and green vegetables.
Livestock contributes to the livelihood of around 30 per cent of Senegalese households.
Pastoralists and agro-pastoralists mainly raise cattle, sheep and goats; their participation in
the meat market is marginal. Most Senegalese rural households are involved in traditional
(that is, small-scale) poultry raising. Measured in tropical livestock units (TLUs),2 cattle
constitute 60 per cent of Senegal’s livestock, and sheep and goats just over one quarter,3 all
of which can be important suppliers of the feedstock for biogas production. The total
livestock population in terms of TLUs increased by nearly 20 per cent over the past decade,
showing its potential importance for biogas in the future, particularly if it continues to grow.
Senegal’s livestock density (according to 2005 data) results in 0.36 TLU per hectare
agricultural land and just over 12 TLU per agricultural holding. Cattle density decreases to
the north, east and southeast. The highest densities are found in the Casamance, south of
the Gambia, and in the area roughly marked by the cities Thiès–Louga–Kaolack–Mbour (the
bassin arachidier), which is of most relevance for biogas production (SNV 2007).

1.2 Access to modern cooking fuels in Senegal
There is an overwhelming reliance across most of sub-Saharan Africa on traditional fuels
and traditional cooking technologies, which are a major cause not only of death and illness
but also of a range of environmental problems. In Senegal, the use of traditional fuels (wood
and charcoal) is putting great pressure on forests and contributing to the degradation of the
environment (see below for some examples of this).
Although the government of Senegal, hoping to reduce this dependence on traditional fuels,
subsidized LPG supplies for more than two decades, the subsidy was withdrawn in 2009, a
move which – along with supply disruptions – has already led to a decline in LPG usage.
The current access rate for LPG is still only approximately 28 per cent of the overall
population, with about six million people having no access to ‘modern’ fuels despite the
population growth. Approximately 83 per cent of the rural population and 58 per cent of the
urban population still cook with solid fuels (see Table 1.2) including charcoal, firewood and
animal dung.

According to a recent study (World Bank 2013b), charcoal is the most common fuel used
overall, followed by LPG in urban areas and firewood in rural areas; Box 1 discusses
common perceptions of each. Seventy-one percent of households currently use at least one
improved or clean solution such as Jambaar stove, Malaagi stove or LPG stove.


Box 1. Basic perception of currently used fuels in Senegal
Firewood: A traditional and very affordable fuel. Mostly used by rural households, it is considered as
a dirty fuel which requires hard work.
Charcoal: An interesting compromise between fuelwood and gas. Charcoal is perceived as
affordable and widely available by urban households.
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG): The ideal fuel. A large majority of non-users indicate they would
immediately switch to gas if they could afford it.

In 2013, Senegal was ranked twelfth in the sub-Saharan Africa region in terms of access to
modern fuels, as shown in Figure 1.2.

However, Senegal’s progress has reverted in recent years, following the phasing out of the
LPG subsidy in 2009 as well as an energy crisis from 2007 to 2010, during which the country
also experienced stock shortages resulting from supply problems. National LPG
consumption fell from 33 per cent in 2002 to 28 per cent in 2011 at the same time as
charcoal consumption increased from 5 per cent to 11 per cent (see Figure 1.4).4

  It is important to note that a large percentage of the households analysed as part of this study were charcoal
users. Although this is not necessarily indicative of the country as a whole, they are believed to be the household
type most likely to switch to using alternative cooking fuels, due to the fact that they currently pay for their fuel
rather collect it for free. In addition, as this study shows, most households cook with a range of fuels, making the
picture of one-dimensional fuel consumption somewhat reductive.

This dependence on solid fuels has dramatic consequences on the health of both rural and
urban populations (see Figure 1.5). However, health is not the only issue. The time spent
collecting firewood is significant, at an average of 3.1 hours per day (World Bank 2013a), as
well as education and gender issues. Affordability is another important issue, with Senegal
having one of the highest charcoal prices in Africa (see Figure 1.6).

The significant economic, social, and ecological effects of this dependence on biomass for
household cooking, summarised here, explain the need to take action to promote alternative
cooking fuels that are more efficient and sustainable:
                         40,000 hectares of forest are lost every year, mainly due to the cutting down of trees
                          for firewood, as well as to forest fires and desertification;
                         The price of traditional fuels (in particular firewood and charcoal) has more than
                          doubled in the last 10 years;

      More than 8,000 people die annually from diseases caused by indoor air pollution;
      45 per cent of Senegal’s primary energy demand comes from biomass (31 per cent is
       directly used as firewood and 14 per cent in charcoal production);
      Exposure to harmful emissions can have a strong negative impact on education and
       gender, particularly when women and children are predominantly involved in the
       collection of fuels and cooking.
This report focuses on the current usage of traditional and alternative fuels in Senegal, in an
attempt to understand how best to scale-up the adoption of these cleaner and more efficient
fuels in the most sustainable and cost-effective manner. Clean cooking fuels and
technologies are crucial for improving health and reducing environmental degradation, and
this study presents a valuable contribution towards ensuring that Senegal is at the forefront
of efforts to scale up the use of clean cooking technologies.

1.2.1 Clean cooking programmes in Senegal and relevant stakeholders
The Senegalese household cooking sector is dominated by a number of stakeholders who
lead several major initiatives. Of note is the Ministry of Energy’s domestic energy division,
which has developed a number of relevant policies. However, there remains a lack of
policies focusing specifically on the promotion of alternative fuels through (a) private sector
development and (b) targeted subsidies. Evidence has shown that these two factors are
significant in enabling sectoral change to take place.
Three main policy documents currently outline household cooking initiatives in Senegal:
      Lettre de Politique de Développement du Secteur de l’Energie 2012 (LPDSE
       2012). The objective of this policy is to achieve 50 per cent household access to
       modern energy services by 2015, as set out within the United Nations Millennium
       Development Goals (MDG) framework. The letter also sets a 15 per cent target for
       market penetration of renewable energy sources and biofuels.
      Lettre de Politique du Sous-Secteur des Combustibles Domestiques 2010
       (LPSSCD 2010). This policy aims at ensuring the long-term supply of household
       cooking energy for urban and rural households while protecting forest resources and
       the environment. Specifically, it seeks to managing forest exploitation; promote
       alternative energies; adapt institutional, regulatory and fiscal frameworks; and
       circulate good practices. Four strategic lines of intervention were developed to
       achieve specific, well-defined results such as increasing and regenerating forest
       areas, fighting illegal wood fuel and charcoal production, increasing fiscal revenues,
       and building public-private partnerships using specific revenue sources allocated to
       increasing energy access and fighting poverty.
      Loi sur les Biocarburants (biofuels law). Passed in December 2010, this decree
       defined specific rules regarding biofuel production in such areas as sources, pricing,
       tax and customs procedures, promotion and packaging. It allows the use of certified
       seed while forbidding the use of genetically modified seed and food crops for biofuel
       production.
Senegal’s household cooking sector is broadly characterised by a relatively weak and
informal private sector network, and by initiatives led mostly by the government and funded
by international institutions. The following are the main institutions involved:
      The World Bank’s Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project
       (PROGEDE) is an improved-cookstove programme implemented by the Senegalese


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal             19
        government (first phase 1999–2008) with funding from the International Development
        Association (World Bank), the Netherlands' Directorate-General for International
        Cooperation and the Global Environment Fund. Its second phase (2010–2016) is
        being funded by the World Bank and the Nordic Development Fund. PROGEDE
        seeks to modernise the household cooking fuels and cookstove markets through the
        differentiation of a range of fuels, improvement of the supply chains and support for
        appropriate energy regulations. The target of the second phase is the dissemination
        of 420,000 improved biomass stoves throughout the country.
       PERACOD,5 a programme for the promotion of sustainable energy, rural
        electrification and sustainable supply of household fuels, is funded by BMZ and led
        by GIZ under the supervision of the Senegalese Ministry of Energy. It started in 2004
        and is due to end in 2015, and its objective is to contribute to a lasting improvement
        in access to of rural energy services, with a focus on renewable energy (such as
        home solar systems) and the development of a sustainable supply of household fuel.
       The National Agency for Ecovillages (ANEV6) was created by the Senegalese
        government in 2008, and includes an active component which promotes improved
        cookstoves in 20 established ‘ecovillages’. This was due to close at the end of 2013.
       The Centre for Study and Research in Renewable Energy (CERER7) is a
        research institute of the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar (UCAD). Established in
        1980, the centre’s mission is to research and develop renewable energy technologies
        which enhance the nation’s energy independence, economy and environment, and to
        educate students, practitioners, and the public about the results. The main areas of
        research include bioenergy fuels. CERER has recently been selected by the Global
        Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC) as a regional testing centre for household
        cooking technologies; it also provides capacity building and carries out the testing of
        laboratory equipment.
       The National Domestic Biogas Programme (Programme National de Biogaz
        Domestique de Senegal; PNB-SN) is a national umbrella organization for local NGOs
        working on biogas, and is managed by the Senegalese government. It is currently
        offering a subsidy and loan system for household biogas systems.
A number of other global and regional initiatives are also being implemented. They include:
       The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC) is an international organisation
        working on increasing access to improved cookstoves and clean fuels in developing
        countries. Currently working in West Africa, including Senegal, the Alliance is leading
        the establishment of international standards for cookstove quality and performance
        and is providing capacity building for regional testing laboratories, including CERER.
       The ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) is
        currently leading the development of the regional West African Clean Cooking
        Alliance (WACCA) initiative, which aims to provide access to efficient, sustainable
        and affordable cooking energy throughout the entire ECOWAS region, including
        Senegal. Its main objectives are to promote the policies and regulatory framework

           support and harmonise standards and labelling practices; and promote networking
           and knowledge sharing in terms of technologies and innovations within the region.
          At the national level, WACCA will assist in mapping existing initiatives on fuel and
           cooking equipment, and in updating national strategies for cooking energy. By
           identifying solutions and bottlenecks, this initiative will facilitate the local production of
           equipment and fuels as well as markets for both. Key elements of the initiative will be
           the establishment of financing mechanisms and the implementation of awareness
           campaigns. WACCA is implemented jointly with several technical partners, including
           ETC-ENERGIA,8 GACC, the Austrian Energy Agency, GERES,9 GIZ, and the
           International Centre for Energy, Environment and Development (ICEED).

2. Approaches and methodology
Following an initial review of existing literature on the household cooking sector in Senegal,
the study team held discussions with a range of relevant organisations and reviewed the
status of the main alternative fuels available – especially biogas, briquettes, ethanol and
pure plant oil (PPO). From this baseline it was then possible to define which regions to select
for fieldwork.
The study approach and methodology were then refined and finalised, in particular the
development of the survey instruments and the sample selection and design, including the
pre-testing and revision of the data collection tools. These included both household surveys
from the demand side and key informant interviews and focus group discussions from the
supply side. This chapter provides a detailed outline of the methodology and the tools used
for this baseline and feasibility study.

2.1 Alternative fuel region selection and design
The survey was conducted in four representative regions, one region for each of the four
alternative fuels chosen. Although other regions also have potential for the production and
purchase of these alternative fuels, resource constraints restricted the study to one region
per fuel.
The regions were chosen using the following criteria:
      The availability of feedstocks for each alternative fuel type;
      The status of the alternative fuel sector in each region, including any existing
       supported programmes;
      The availability of relevant technologies for the processing and distribution of each
       alternative fuel;
      The status of private sector involvement in the production and distribution of each
       alternative fuel;
      The potential market size for each alternative fuel, based on the prices of each fuel
       and stove technology and the number of purchasing households; and
      The socio-cultural acceptability of each fuel and the potential for scale-up.
After initial discussions with a range of stakeholders, it was decided to focus on the following
main alternative fuel types, one in each of the four regions studied:
      Briquettes. Briquettes are already being produced in both Kaolack and Saint-Louis,
       and both of these regions were investigated. Household surveys were conducted in
       Dakar to investigate the potential of briquette use, mainly as a replacement for
       charcoal. The potential for briquette production depends mainly on (a) the availability
       of suitable potential feedstock, (b) the availability and production of technologies and
       (c) the efficiency of distribution and retail networks. In Saint-Louis, the main
       briquetting resources available are charcoal dust, the typha plant, and balle de riz
       (residue from rice processing); in Kaolack and Diourbel the main resource is the
       peanut shell (these are the main peanut producing regions of the bassin arachidier,
       or groundnut basin).
      Ethanol. Because ethanol is currently produced in only one location in Senegal –
       namely, the urban area of Richard Toll in the Saint-Louis region – household
       questionnaires and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in that region.
       (Household questionnaires were also completed in Dakar to understand the potential


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal              22
       demand for ethanol in the capital.) In addition, key informant interviews were carried
       out in Saint-Louis, to gather information about production from sugar cane and other
       feedstocks, such as cashew nut fruit in the area of Casamance.
      Biogas: Biogas is currently being produced in several regions of Senegal, including
       Thiès, Kaolack, Fatick, Kaffrine and Louga, where a number of companies
       manufacture and install systems and several organisations support its uptake. After
       an assessment of the market potential (suitable farming households with enough
       animals, market development of biogas in each region, maturity of its current
       production), it was decided to conduct household surveys, FGDs and key informant
       interviews in Kaolack.
      Pure plant oil: PPO is produced in several regions of Senegal. Although still at quite
       an early stage of development, PPO production is believed to be most advanced in
       Tambacounda. Household questionnaires, FGDs and key informant interviews were
       thus carried out in this region.

2.2 Survey tools

2.2.1 The household questionnaire
The study team developed a comprehensive household questionnaire designed to elicit
information on a range of relevant issues for each household, including socio-economic
characteristics, current energy usage, and likely ability to take up a range of alternative fuels.
The socio-economic characteristics are those related to cooking habits or able to influence,
either directly or indirectly, cooking conditions. These include the identification of the
respondent and their location; their household demographics; their education, including
literacy and education enrolment; their household characteristics, including construction
material, number of rooms and layout of the cooking area; their employment and occupation;
their income, consumption and expenditure; their ownership of assets (including land,
livestock); their access to basic services (specifically health, water and education); their
ownership of indicative appliances, such as radios, televisions and mobile phones; their
membership of formal and informal associations and networks (such as saving and credit
cooperatives and microfinance institutions); and the dynamics of their purchasing decisions.
The cooking energy characteristics include the household’s energy use, expenditure, use
and ownership of cooking appliances; cooking fuel acquisition (including type of cooking
fuels, consumption level and expenditure); mode of acquiring cooking fuels (purchased or
collected); household members responsible for cooking fuel acquisition and family meal
preparation; time and distance travelled to collect or purchase cooking fuels; time spent
cooking each day; major types of foods cooked; satisfaction level with and limitations of
current cooking fuels and cookstoves; problems associated with existing cooking fuels and
stoves (indoor air pollution, fire hazards, etc.); the prevalence of respiratory or health issues
related to household cooking; their awareness of alternative fuels and clean cookstoves;
their anticipated attributes of clean cooking solutions by households (in particular alternative
fuels and clean cookstoves); and their willingness and ability to pay for clean cooking
solutions.
The team chose 320 households and divided them into rural and urban households,
depending on the type of alternative fuel and the region, as highlighted in Table 2.1.
Sampling was carried out using a two-stage ‘cluster sampling’ approach, where clusters
(villages or enumeration units) were selected during the first stage, and households were


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                23

Table 2.1 Distribution of households and methodology for selection

The questionnaire took an average of one hour to complete, with four enumerators working
in each region (Figure 2.1) to complete an average of seven questionnaires per day. The
enumerators were trained to ensure they understood the questions and completed each
questionnaire within the allocated time.

2.2.2 Focus group discussions
The study team also held focus group discussions to gain more qualitative information about
groups of households. The discussions, each of which involved between 10 and 15
individuals, were conducted in each of the four study regions.

2.2.3 Key informant interviews
Finally, the team interviewed informants to gather information about the supply side for each
of the main alternative fuels. Informants included manufacturers of alternative-fuel
cookstoves (such as those that burn briquettes), fuel distributors and retailers, potential
alternative-fuel producers (sugar estates, sugarcane growers, plant oil growers and
agricultural cooperatives), and other key stakeholders such as bi- and multilateral
organisations and government institutions.
In total, 30 interviews took place, with an average of 7–8 interviews for each of the four
alternative fuels (biogas, briquettes, ethanol and PPO). Table 2.2 lists some of the relevant
organizations working in the regions where the use of each alternative fuel is significant.

2.3 Pre-test and revision of the data collection tools
The survey instruments were then tested in urban and peri-urban areas of Dakar to ensure
that (a) respondents could understand them completely; (b) the questions were in the most
logical sequence; (c) the interviews were of the appropriate length; and, in particular, (d) the
interviews yielded the answers needed for a thorough assessment of each alternative fuel.
Some changes were made to the survey, particularly in respect to the clarity of wording and
modification of the response options to ensure that the data could be easily recorded and
transferred to the database. Certain questions, or parts of questions, were also added or
omitted.

2.4 Survey methodology
Next, collaborators in the field from ENDA Energie were hired as local enumerators to
complete the household questionnaires in each of the four regions, under ENDA’s
supervision. ENDA also carried out the focus group discussions and key informant
interviews for each fuel type in each of the main regions. Table 2.3 shows the overall survey
timeline.

3. Feasibility of alternative household cooking fuels in Senegal
As discussed in Chapter 2, four regions were selected from preliminary findings that showed
a potential correlation of each region with one of four alternative fuels; surveys were
conducted accordingly. Chapters 4-7 present the survey results, with each chapter divided
as follows:
      Introduction. A brief introduction to the specific fuel in the region.
      Background. Information on the demographic, economy and geography of the
       region.
      Household cooking. A description of the current household cooking characteristics
       (including fuels and stoves used in urban and rural areas) of each region.
      Potential demand for the alternative fuel. Identification of the main problems in the
       current domestic energy context, and thus of the gaps the alternative fuels may be
       able to fill. This is broken down into three sections:
           o   Perceptions of current stoves and fuels. An understanding of what
               households consider as the main problems with their current fuels and stoves,
               thereby giving direction on what criteria alternative fuels should cover;
           o   Drivers for acquiring new fuels and stoves. Reasons given by the
               surveyed households for adopting a new alternative fuel;
           o   Willingness to pay for new fuels and stoves. To assess whether the fuels
               will be able to penetrate the market, it is critical to understand households’
               willingness to pay for the new fuel. This section also includes findings from
               current expenditures and access to finance;
      The supply side. Assesses the supply side, including the current contextual situation
       and supply chains;
      Conclusions and recommendations. Assesses the feasibility of each alternative
       fuel in the region with specific recommendations for its deployment. Includes a cost
       comparison of current fuels/stoves and an analysis of the fuels from the end user
       perspective, whilst also looking at the supply side where possible.
Finally, Chapter 8 presents final conclusions and recommendations.

4. Briquetting in urban and peri-urban Dakar
None of the alternative fuels included in this study are produced in Dakar – and, because the
city lacks the required primary resources, they are not likely to be at significant scale in the
future. Senegal’s capital city is nevertheless likely to be one of the most important demand
centres for briquettes thanks to its large population and relative wealth.

However, this potentially large latent demand depends on a range of factors, including the
city’s population growth (estimated by ANSD at 3.4 per cent in 2012) and the changing
demand for types of cooking fuel within the city. There has, for example, been a recent
reduction in demand for LPG following the elimination of the LPG subsidy and its
consequent gradual increase in price, as well as the more frequent interruptions to its
supply.

Concomitant with this fall in LPG usage, charcoal usage in Dakar has increased. However,
the price of charcoal has also been increasing, mainly due to the introduction and
enforcement of forestry fees and the long distances that they need to be transported from
where it is produced. This increasing cost of raw materials (wood from trees) may be an
important influence on charcoal demand in the near future. This will have a knock-on effect
on the acceptance and usage of any alternative fuels that might be introduced in the near
term, particularly within a largely unregulated market, which is the current situation for the
household cooking sector in Senegal.

4.1 Background
The population of the Dakar metropolitan area grew from 374,700 in 1961 (right after
independence in 1960) to 2.77 million in 2005. Estimates are that it is growing at an average
rate of over 2 per cent per year, and is likely to have a population of five million by 2025 (see
Table 4.1).

Despite recent efforts to slow urbanisation in Senegal through a range of decentralised
development opportunities, the Dakar region is now home to 24 per cent of the Senegalese
population even though it occupies only 0.28 per cent of its land area (see Figure 4.1).
Economically, this region is the dominant centre of the country, containing more than 80 per
cent of Senegal’s permanently registered employees and more than 90 per cent of
employees in the transport, finance, and industry sectors.

Figure 4.1 Map of Dakar, Senegal

Any rapidly growing urban population faces a range of challenges to ensure that the basic
needs of its population are met: housing, work, and food, and a range of energy resources,
including cooking fuels. According to the Monitoring Unit of the Program to Fight Poverty
(Cellule du Suivi du Programme de Lutte Contre la Pauvreté, or CSPLP), part of the
Senegalese Ministry of Economy and Finance (Ministère de l’Economie et des Finances;
MEF), the Dakar region, with a household poverty rate of 12 per cent, is the least poor of the
14 regions that make up Senegal.10 While this is in itself not very surprising – the region’s
relative wealth is what attracts so many people to it – its large population means that, if the
absolute number of poor people is calculated, the Dakar region comes out as second
poorest, just beneath the rural regions of Fatick and Louga.
There are also significant income disparities between different parts of the city. For example,
in the department of Pikine nearly 24 per cent of households do not have the means to earn
CFAF 5,610 per month (required to purchase the minimum daily food intake of 2,400
calories per person), and so have no spare income to pay for clean cooking fuels. An
understanding of this range of wealth between different areas of the Dakar region is
essential when considering any new programme designed to support alternative cooking
fuels.
Furthermore, although approximately 50 per cent of the total monetary income for the whole
country is concentrated in Dakar, poor households in the region derive the majority of their
income from relatively uncertain and irregular sources: the informal sector (27 per cent),
private sector business (24 per cent) and remittances from abroad (12 per cent). This makes
life quite precarious, and planning more difficult, particularly when considering the switch to a
new, uncertain cooking fuel, or whether to invest in a new cookstove (such as that needed
for briquettes). A clear, significant advantage to doing so must be presented first.

4.2 Household cooking
Peri-urban households in the Dakar region rely on three main sources of fuel for cooking:
LPG, charcoal and firewood. Many households use a range of these fuels, with different
combinations of each depending on income level.
From the mid-1970s until 2009, the Senegalese government encouraged the transition from
charcoal to LPG for households through the use of subsidies and promotion campaigns. In
1974, the government began a programme of equipment subsidies to reduce the price of
LPG stoves and fuel tanks, followed in 1977 by a subsidy on the gas itself. Small (2.7 kg)
subsidised LPG canisters and the stoves needed for its use were made widely available in
an attempt to overcome the obstacle of ‘lumpy’ (large) payments often cited as a major
obstacle to poorer urban households wanting to switch to LPG or electricity.
In 2009, the national government, advised by the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU), decided to phase out subsidies for LPG to align Senegal with the relevant
regulations in the rest of the region. It is still the case that LPG is still widely available in peri-
urban areas of the country and a well-functioning distribution network is in place. However,
the reality for the peri-urban poor in the Dakar region remains bleak in relation to LPG
usage. Their relatively low income levels, combined with the progressive withdrawal of the
governmental LPG subsidy and an unpredictable supply market, have all had a detrimental
effect on their LPG consumption levels. Even though the national demand for LPG is still
relatively high, its demand by poor households fell after the subsidy withdrawal.
Although LPG is an appropriate cooking fuel, its price even when subsidised is beyond the
reach of the poor in the Dakar region, and a cheaper ‘improved’ alternative fuel, such as
briquettes, may thus be more appropriate. Table 4.2 summarises the main positive and
negative issues surrounding LPG usage in the Dakar region.

Table 4.2 Summary Matrix of LPG usage in peri-urban households of Dakar, Senegal
Source: ENDA 2008.

The survey found that LPG is always used by almost 80 per cent of urban households and
occasionally by 10 per cent. In peri-urban areas, however, LPG is always used by only 38
per cent of households and occasionally by 23 per cent. Electricity is not used for cooking
purposes at all in either urban or peri-urban households, mainly due to its high cost.
The other main fuel of choice for peri-urban households in the Dakar region is charcoal,
which is easy to use and widely available. It can also be bought in small quantities, which
better matches the purchasing patterns of many poor households. Charcoal is also used as
a backup fuel for LPG when there are shortages, or when a household’s savings are

fuel.

Although charcoal is fairly accessible, its price is closely associated with (a) the season and
(b) the costs associated with transportation from the production sites, which are often more
than 500 km from Dakar in the forested regions of Tambacounda and Kolda. Another
significant issue is the liberalisation of the charcoal market, as the national government
believes that self-regulation will lead to improved productivity. Charcoal market actors along
the supply chain have taken advantage of this lack of government regulation and sell the
charcoal at inflated prices in Dakar, claiming that rising oil prices have led to high
transportation costs. In addition, inefficiencies and lack of technical expertise in the
production of charcoal has resulted in very low productivity. This could be remedied by the
government imposing quotas and production licences, but to date it has not done so.
Charcoal is still always used by about 20 per cent of urban households in the Dakar region
and occasionally by 40 per cent of households. In peri-urban areas this proportion is much
higher, with 35 per cent of households always using charcoal (and 38 per cent occasionally
using charcoal).
Firewood, the third most popular household cooking fuel in peri-urban households, is mostly
used as a backup during shortages of LPG or charcoal. It is also perceived as being more
appropriate for cooking traditional meals. However, the use of firewood in the generally small
peri-urban households results in the highest emission levels of any of the fuels, causing
serious health hazards such as respiratory ailments and eye irritation. In addition, firewood is
generally only used with the traditional three-stone stove. This is highly inefficient and results
in high long-term costs for the peri-urban households in the Dakar region who use it, and
who have to purchase most of their firewood rather than collecting it (as is done in rural
areas). It is important to note that the same regulations regarding the collection and
transportation of charcoal also apply to firewood, with similar implications for biomass
briquette production and distribution.
In urban households in the Dakar region firewood is no longer used on a permanent basis:
LPG and charcoal are the main fuels used. In contrast, firewood is always used by 28 per
cent of peri-urban households and sometimes used by 13 per cent of peri-urban households.
When firewood is collected rather than purchased, in peri-urban areas of Dakar it is mainly


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                        31
sourced from the household’s own farmlands (45 per cent) or from their own homesteads
(45 per cent), whereas in urban areas the consumption of firewood is marginal. The average
peri-urban household’s consumption of firewood is relatively low – an average of just 31 kg
per month, of which 13 kg (42 per cent) is collected. This results in an average monthly
expenditure on firewood of CFAF 1,389. This fairly low firewood consumption (around 1 kg
per day in the peri-urban region of Diakhiratt) can be explained by the fact that it is used as a
secondary (together with charcoal or LPG) or tertiary fuel (with both charcoal and LPG).
Finally, agricultural residues are used by only 5 per cent of peri-urban households, and not
at all by urban households.
In the Dakar region, the use of household cooking fuels in peri-urban and urban areas
largely follows the same broad trends, particularly when compared with the disparity
between rural and urban areas in other regions of the country. This is important to note when
planning programmes to promote alternative fuels in Dakar, as it means that interventions
within both urban and peri-urban regions can be developed along the same lines.

Household cooking and gender
Compared with other regions of Senegal, Dakar presents some significant differences
regarding the decision-making process associated with household cooking technologies and
fuels, in particular concerning the social dynamics within urban areas and the traditional
gender-focused division of labour. Although men still have an important role in the decision-
making progress as it applies to household cooking, women are increasingly involved. For
example, the decision regarding stove acquisition is made entirely by women in only 20 per
cent of peri-urban households, whereas in 44 per cent of urban households women are
responsible for which stove is chosen. In 15 per cent of peri-urban areas and 18 per cent of
urban areas it is a shared decision between men and women to a lesser extent; in 20 per
cent of peri-urban households (against only 3 per cent in urban households) it is a decision
shared equally by all members of the household.

4.3.1 Perceptions of current cooking fuels and stoves
Compared with other regions of Senegal, a lower proportion of households in Dakar said
they were dissatisfied with the fuel they use for cooking. This is particularly true in urban
Dakar, and is mainly due to the relatively high penetration of LPG (Senegal’s preferred
cooking fuel11) and charcoal (generally considered to be cleaner and more user-friendly than
firewood). Figure 4.3 summarises the main reasons given by households for their
dissatisfaction with their cooking fuel.




11
  According to a recent report, LPG is perceived as the ideal fuel because it is ready to use, reliable and clean
(World Bank 2013b).

Figure 4.3 Reasons for dissatisfaction with current fuels in the Dakar region

Overall, the followed are the main issues related to household cooking fuel use in the Dakar
region:
        Almost half of peri-urban households and urban households in the Dakar region are
         dissatisfied with their cooking fuel with high prices of the fuel cited as the primary
         reason.
        Smoke is a more significant problem in peri-urban areas. This can be explained by
         the relatively high use of LPG in urban areas as well as the differences in kitchens
         and the location where cooking takes place, which tends to be better in urban areas.
        Cooking time is a minor issue for both urban and peri-urban households;
        In both peri-urban and urban areas, all respondents state that only women are
         exposed to the health issues of smoke, with eye infections, coughing and respiratory
         problems being the main health problems (amongst these, 53 per cent and 40 per
         cent of peri-urban and urban households respectively consider eye infection to be a
         major issue; 53 per cent and 20 per cent of peri-urban and urban households
         respectively consider coughing to be a major issue, and 28 per cent and 25 per cent
         of peri-urban and urban households respectively considering respiratory problems to
         be a major issues).
From these responses it is clear that most of the problems relate to the use of solid fuels
(charcoal and firewood). LPG is the preferred cooking fuel, with the only problems
associated with it being ones of cost and accessibility. Although it is important to consider
how the use of LPG can be extended within both urban and peri-urban households in the
Dakar region, the still relatively high (and growing) use of biomass fuels is important in the
context of an analysis of alternative fuel usage. It is unlikely that any of the alternative fuels
will be cleaner burning or easier to use than LPG (although they may be as good or almost
as good, and can compete on price), but they could constitute a preferred option to charcoal
and firewood in both urban and rural areas of the Dakar region. The use of briquettes could
replace charcoal and firewood in both urban and peri-urban households and, if used within
more efficient stoves, could offer a cleaner burning and cheaper alternative without requiring
major behavioural change.

4.3.2 Drivers for purchasing new household cooking stoves
When considering the future promotion of briquettes within the Dakar region, it is important
to consider insights and lessons learned from the promotion and penetration of improved
biomass cookstoves. At the same time, the usage and performance of briquettes is very
similar to that of charcoal and useful links can be made from analysing charcoal markets.
The following presents a summary of the main insights into household usage of improved
biomass cookstoves in the Dakar region (see also Figure 4.4):
       There is already a relatively high level of awareness of improved cooking fuels in
        urban and peri-urban areas of the Dakar region, with 95 per cent of peri-urban and
        93 per cent of urban households aware of the benefits of improved cookstoves.
        Almost all households in both areas would like to own an improved stove;
       The desire to reduce household fuel expenditure is by far the main reason (77 per
        cent in peri-urban and 90 per cent in urban households) that respondents say would
        encourage them to acquire an improved stove;
       Time saved during fuel collection (14 per cent in peri-urban and 13 per cent in urban
        households) is the second most important reason;
       Other reasons, including those relating to health issues (smoke, cleanliness) are
        marginal.

Figure 4.4 Reasons for adoption of improved stoves

These main insights are very important when considering the potential uptake of briquettes
within the Dakar region. Briquettes tend to be cheaper than charcoal, while either reducing
(or at least not increasing) cooking time. However, despite the potential benefits of, and
opportunities for, the use of alternative fuels in the region – particularly briquettes –little
awareness of them currently exists:
       Only 25 per cent of peri-urban households were aware of any type of alternative
        cooking fuel including briquettes.
       Urban households were able to identify a much larger spectrum of cooking fuels,
        including biogas (55 per cent), briquettes (45 per cent), PPO (45 per cent) and
        ethanol (27 per cent).
This level of awareness of alternative fuels in the Dakar region, particularly in urban areas,
can be used as starting point for a programme on the promotion of alternative fuels in


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                 34
Senegal, and will be very useful when starting a targeted marketing campaign. It will be
important to identify the main information sources accessed by people in each region so that
the information on each fuel, particularly briquettes in Dakar, can be distributed.
Once informed of the potential benefits of briquettes, most households in both peri-urban
and urban areas declared an interest in accessing them, giving the following specific
reasons for choosing to switch to briquette use (see also Figure 4.5):
       Savings to household cooking fuel expenditure is the most important factor given in
        households in both urban and peri-urban areas (89 per cent and 72 per cent
        respectively);
       Other reasons, in particular smoke and cleanliness, which are noted as being
        important problems with their current stoves, are only of marginal importance in
        terms of any alternative fuels being promoted.

Figure 4.5 Drivers for using alternative fuels in peri-urban and urban areas

Any efforts to raise awareness of alternative fuels, particularly briquettes, should take into
consideration the perception of most households regarding fuel price and fuel expenditure.
Rather than taking into account the long-term benefits – chiefly improved health and time
saved – most households think in terms of day-to-day purchases. It is important that future
programmes work to promote the long-term benefits, particularly to households who may not
otherwise see past the day-to-day exigencies.

4.3.3. Willingness to pay for new fuels and stoves
The relative importance of household expenditure on energy use (and in particular on
household cooking equipment) is a good indicator for understanding the uptake of improved
cookstoves and alternative fuels in Senegal and how energy access affects livelihoods. The
survey reveals that urban households allocate a higher proportion of their monthly budget to
energy than do peri-urban – a monthly allocation of CFAF 17,193 (US$34) in urban areas,
and CFAF 11,940 (US$24) in peri-urban areas. These figures are even higher when cooking
stoves are included (CFAF 19,333 (US$39) and CFAF 13,572 (US$27) in urban and peri-
urban areas, respectively).
Despite the fact that in urban areas the household energy budget is higher, energy
expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure is similar to that in peri-urban areas (10.24
per cent in peri-urban areas and 10.74 per cent in urban areas).

   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                   35
When asked about their willingness to pay for alternative fuels, households generally
suggested amounts lower than their current monthly expenditure on energy (see Figure 4.6).
This is an issue that needs to be overcome.

Figure 4.6 Willingness to pay for alternative fuels and stoves in Dakar region

The results indicate that CFAF 10,000 (US$20) should be regarded as a threshold of a
household’s willingness to pay for an alternative fuel stove: all peri-urban households and 95
per cent of urban households say that they are not willing to pay more than CFAF 10,000.
The evidence suggests that stoves costing more than CFAF 10,000 (US$20) will be limited
to a niche of higher income households, unless an alternative fuel stove can convince
households otherwise, either on its performance or quality. Therefore a programme to
support the development of a thriving briquette market in the Dakar region needs to support
market actors in producing a stove with a market price below US$20 – which seems possible
based on the price of improved stoves suitable for briquettes currently being produced in
Senegal. In addition, the average household monthly expenditure on an alternative fuel,
such as briquettes, should also not exceed CFAF 10,000 per month.
Compared to other regions of Senegal, a much higher percentage of households in the
Dakar region deal with both formal and informal financial service organisations, both as
savers and borrowers. More than half (53 per cent) of urban households have used formal
financial institutions to save, with only 3 per cent using informal institutions. In peri-urban
areas, however, only 25 per cent have saved with formal financial institutions and 13 per
cent with informal institutions (Figure 4.7). The number of households who have used credit
from formal sources is slightly lower, but is still about 40 per cent for urban and 25 per cent
for peri-urban households. Thirty per cent of urban and 25 per cent of peri-urban households
are members of credit and savings cooperatives.

Figure 4.7 Savings and loans using formal and informal institutions in Dakar

This is very important when considering a new alternative fuel programme in the Dakar
region because credit is likely to be an important factor in enabling households to purchasing
a improved briquette stoves costing more than US$20. The Dakar region has relatively well-
developed formal and informal savings and loan systems that can be supported in
developing specific loan packages for alternative fuel stoves. This will also be important
when considering the development of a vibrant supply side for briquette production to
support local entrepreneurs who may need loans to set up companies to produce and
distribute the briquettes and stoves. (See Section 4.4.)
The demand-side data generally indicates that there is considerable potential demand for
alternative fuels, particularly for briquettes from both urban and peri-urban households within
the Dakar region.

4.4 Supply side
The briquetting fuel sector in Senegal is still in its infancy, with a relatively limited number of
technologies in use by only a couple of producers – in particular BRADES, based in Saint-
Louis. Briquette production was also tested by CARBOSEN, based in Kaolack. The
availability of potential feedstocks for briquette production is, however, quite large: they can
be produced from a range of agricultural and biomass materials, including rice husks, cotton
plants, peanut and cashew nut shells and reeds, in addition to the more typical feedstocks of
charcoal dust and sawdust. The development of an entire supply chain – from the collection
and production of the feedstocks to the production, distribution and retailing of the briquettes
– offers important opportunities for job creation and income production.
Although BRADES and Bio-Terre in Ndem, still produce briquettes, several other companies
that were involved in the sector until recently have encountered serious problems, resulting
in them ceasing production. Of note amongst these are CARBOSEN and Pronatura (see
Box 2 and Figure 4.8).




   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                        37
Box 2. Briquettes producers in Senegal

Since its creation in 1992 in Kaolack, NOVASEN has focused on sorting and selling groundnuts. In
1999, it started the production of oil and now is the second largest mill in the region after SUNEOR
(former SONACOS). In 2013, only the oil production sector of NOVASEN changed its name and is
now trading as COPEOL.
CARBOSEN was established in 2008 with the objective of deriving value from unused peanut husks.
It was a joint venture between NOVASEN, which provided the feedstock, and CARBO, a European
company that has mastered the industrial kiln technology. However, despite developing a good
reputation for briquette quality, they were not able to produce the briquettes for very long because the
equipment was purchased from the Netherlands without technical manuals, and some parts were not
adapted for use with peanut shells. (According to key informants, briquette production also started
without any feasibility or market study.) However, thanks to CARBOSEN’s respected reputation there
is still potential for the business to develop in the future
BRADES is a small company based in the town of Saint-Louis. It has been producing biomass
briquettes and improved cookstoves since 2007, with support from PERACOD (which is in turn
supported by GIZ). BRADES is a family business with six full-time staff and five part-time staff. It
produces high-quality briquettes from charcoal dust, although it recently started testing other raw
materials including carbonised agricultural residues and reeds, which are abundant in the Saint-Louis
region. Although it is currently attempting to mix charcoal dust and Typha australis, production costs
seem relatively high and may lead to technical constraints. Tests are also being carried out using rice
husks.
BRADES produces an average of approximately 12 tonnes of briquettes per month, which are sold in
sacks of 1 to 25 kg. Two to three tonnes per month are sold directly from the factory and nine to ten
tonnes in local markets in Saint-Louis. The market price is approximately CFAF 150/kg (although this
varies between retailers) and CFAF 100/KG when purchased directly from the BRADES factory site,
which is far less than the average price for charcoal of CFAF 350/kg.
Eighty per cent of BRADES’s market for briquettes is in Saint-Louis, with the remainder in Thiès and,
to a lesser extent, Dakar. Even though this is a relatively new market, demand is growing steadily,
mainly due to its highly competitive price. BRADES believes there is great potential to increase
production, especially as it is now starting to use additional resources, particularly processed reeds
and agricultural residues, such as rice stalks and husks. However, the company has several
problems to overcome, including transportation and equipment challenges. They currently obtain the
charcoal dust from several different locations where it is stored and processed for distribution; it is
generally delivered to the factory every couple of days.
In Tambacounda, a small company, Rassoul, created in 2011, is considering producing briquettes
from charcoal residues. The company has faced technical problems with its machinery, however, and
is considering partnership with a private company, SODEFITEX, which already has its own
briquetting project using cotton stems and has carried out research on briquetting from cotton stems
and biofuels from sunflowers over the past four years.

Figure 4.8 BRADES: main briquetting production steps

Briquettes are not yet sold in Dakar on a commercial scale. According to briquette producers
BRADES, COPEOL/CARBOSEN in Saint-Louis, SODETIFEX in Kaolack and Bio-terre in
Ndem, the current price for briquettes is respectively CFAF 75 and CFAF 100/kg when sold
locally. However, the wholesale price for retailers in other regions, according to producers’
estimation, is around CFAF 150/kg. This means that users would have to pay more than
CFAF 150 (probably around CFAF 200/kg) to buy briquettes in Dakar. They are thus likely
only to be used mostly in urban areas, and by wealthier households in peri-urban areas,
predominantly as a replacement for charcoal.
The study identified four main factors resulting in the failure of these briquetting initiatives.
These would almost certainly be overcome with support from a well-designed market
development programme:
   1.   lack of household awareness of the products, leading to low demand;
   2.   lack of consistency in the quality and supply of the briquettes;
   3.   need for special stoves for briquettes, which are not always available for purchase;
   4.   briquettes produced from rice husks are not liked. This is due to their relatively low
        calorific value (compared to charcoal), which results in a much lower cooking speed
        and excessive production of ash.
A wide variety of feedstock can be used to produce briquettes suitable for cooking, although,
as highlighted above, some (such as that obtained from rice husk straw) may not perform as
well as charcoal. Table 4.3 summarises the feedstock potential for briquette production from
a range of materials, and highlights the large quantities of agricultural residue available in
Senegal.

The potential for producing briquettes from groundnut shells is also believed to be great,
particularly in the Kaolack region, where groundnuts are produced on a large scale. The
supply chain for briquettes produced from groundnut shells involves a limited number of
stakeholders with significant financial assets from their income from groundnut production
(this is despite the technology required for groundnut briquetting process being more
complex than that needed to produce charcoal dust). At the level of production and
commercialisation, the main stakeholder used to be CARBOSEN, which recently went out of
business (see Box 2 on previous page).
Compared to charcoal, charcoal dust briquettes seem to offer a significantly more affordable
option for households. This is of particular relevance, as most households surveyed in the
Dakar region cited affordability as the major driver when considering a new cooking fuel.
At BRADES in Saint-Louis region, the wholesale selling price is less than one-third that of
charcoal, and still less than half the price when sold in the markets in Saint-Louis. The main
challenge is likely to be around the quality of production compared to charcoal, and being
able to scale up production to meet the potential demand, as the current supply chain is still
fairly informal and only contributes to a very small percentage of household cooking usage.
In Saint-Louis, BRADES currently only produces 25 tonnes of briquettes per month, which is
far below the needs of the city, let alone the potential demand from the Dakar region. They
say that their current production is only around 50 per cent of their capacity, but even if they
reach this target it is still fairly low overall, considering the potential market in the urban
centres of Saint-Louis and Dakar.

4.5 Conclusions and recommendations
Because of its large population and the relative wealth of its households, Senegal’s capital
city is likely to be one of the most important demand centres for any alternative fuel
commercialised in the country. Many households use a range of fuels (LPG, charcoal and
firewood) in different combinations depending on their income level.
Compared with other regions of Senegal, fewer households expressed dissatisfaction with
their cooking fuels, particularly in urban Dakar, a result mainly of the relatively high
penetration of LPG. Despite its ease of use and low emissions, however, LPG is considered
to be a relatively unaffordable fuel for most poor households in urban and peri-urban in
Dakar. Charcoal is quite accessible, but its price is closely associated with the season as
well as transportation costs.
Although it is important to consider how LPG can be further utilised within both urban and
peri-urban households in the Dakar region, the still relatively high, and growing, use of
biomass fuels is important in the context of alternative fuels; the use of briquettes could start
to replace charcoal and firewood in both urban and peri-urban households of Dakar, and if


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                     40
used within more efficient stoves, could offer a cleaner burning and cheaper alternative,
without requiring major behavioural changes.

Enhancing demand
      Any marketing campaign for briquettes should highlight their potential monetary
       savings, as this is the main reason households give for shifting to a new cooking fuel;
      As long as a steady supply of the briquettes can be established and the quality of
       production can be maintained at relatively high levels, the demand for briquettes is
       likely to grow rapidly once the end users become more aware of their existence.
      To scale up demand for briquettes, it is recommended that a national, urban-focused,
       awareness-raising campaign be started, initially focusing on the urban centres of
       Dakar, Saint-Louis and Kaolack. The campaign will target both urban and peri-urban
       households, highlighting the performance qualities of briquettes as well as the
       potential long-term benefits in terms of time-saving and health.
      A programme to support the development of a thriving briquette market in the Dakar
       region needs to support market actors to produce a stove with a market price below
       CFAF 10,000. This seems feasible based on the price of improved stoves suitable for
       briquettes currently being produced in Senegal.

Improving production
      The main challenges are likely to be (a) maintaining the quality of production
       compared to charcoal and (b) scaling up production to meet the potential demand, as
       the current supply chain is still fairly informal and contributes to only a very small
       percentage of household cooking usage.
      All potential feedstock resources for briquette production need to be carefully
       mapped out throughout Senegal, including all agricultural and waste resources, to
       get an understanding of the potential future production and spatial distribution of the
       available resources.
      Tests need to be carried out on different potential briquetting feedstock to understand
       how they compare (from the end users’ perspective ) to charcoal – especially with
       respect to quality such as heat of combustion, level of emissions, speed of cooking
       and ash production.
      Further research is needed on a range of briquetting technologies to ensure that all
       the available feedstocks can be turned into high-quality briquettes that meet end-
       users’ requirements.
      Building on the success story of BRADES, a range of SMEs in different regions of
       Senegal should receive capacity building that enables them to set up briquetting
       production companies. This should include technical support as well as business
       model development to ensure they can set up sustainable and appropriate
       briquetting businesses.
      To further support the development of the briquetting sector, the government of
       Senegal needs to start tackling the unregulated and illegal production of charcoal.

Creating a strong supply chain
      An important opportunity for job creation and income production in Senegal lies either
       in the development of an entire supply chain or in integration with other supply


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal            41
          chains, such as that for charcoal. This would involve everything from the collection of
          the feedstocks (such as charcoal dust) to production, distribution and retailing efforts.
         The large-scale transportation of the briquettes from their place of production (in
          areas of significant agricultural residue and charcoal production) can be based on the
          current transportation routes used by charcoal. However, because these
          transportation avenues to Dakar are largely unregulated by the national government,
          this may lead to over-inflated prices and a lack of supply responding to demand.
         A greater level of regulation of the transportation of all biomass fuels (including
          charcoal, firewood and briquettes) is needed to increase the transparency of the
          sector, to try to eliminate the corrupt practices and money flows, and to reduce
          current market distortions that are pushing up the prices of the biomass fuel sector,
          mainly in the transportation sector.

Pricing
Briquettes are not yet sold in Dakar at any significant level; in Saint-Louis the price is CFAF
100/kg wholesale and CFAF 150/kg in local markets. In Kaolack, CARBOSEN estimates the
sale price of briquettes to be CFAF 75/kg. In Dakar the price will vary, depending on the
transport price, but is likely to be between CFAF 150 to 200/kg. Considering the price of
charcoal – which is about the same in Dakar as briquettes when purchased in 50 kg bags,
but can be much higher when bought in small quantities (around CFAF 250/kg) – retailers
are likely to be able to sell briquettes relatively easily once the end users start to understand
their benefits.
Figure 4.9 shows the relative prices of a range of household cooking fuels against the
calorific value of the fuels. Briquettes are significantly cheaper than most other fuels, and still
compare very favourably against the cost of charcoal, used both with traditional and
improved cookstoves.

Note: The prices shown for ethanol and Jatropha oil are those in their region of production rather than in

Dakar does offer a good potential market for briquettes, as the price of charcoal is much
higher in other urban centres, in particular Saint-Louis and Kaolack. These areas outside the
capital are nevertheless likely to be the most likely initial market for briquettes, due to the


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                              42
potentially higher profit margins for the briquettes in these areas. The market for briquettes in
Dakar will develop once these more lucrative markets are served.
The relatively well-developed formal and informal savings and loan systems in Dakar could
be supported in developing specific loan packages for producers and distributors of
alternative fuel stoves.

Overall conclusions
The market barriers to briquetting in urban and peri-urban Dakar can be overcome by
developing a positive enabling environment for briquette production, suitable standards and
quality control, tax incentives, and awareness-raising programmes, as well as a range of
supporting services including appropriate credit and capacity building support.
If these are addressed, a thriving supply chain of briquette producers, distributors and
retailers can be developed to serve the potentially significant demand in Dakar. The
producers will need to supply high-quality briquettes that are clean, burn efficiently, and are
affordable in relation to the other main fuels (charcoal and firewood) against which they will
be competing. The focus group discussions made it clear that briquettes could be perceived
as being a ‘charcoal-plus’ fuel, in the sense that households use them in a similar way to
charcoal, whilst being slightly more efficient and cleaner burning, and fairly comparable in
price.

5. Ethanol in urban Saint-Louis
Evidence from recent studies in Madagascar and Kenya has shown that ethanol is both a
clean burning fuel (it produces very low levels of both carbon monoxide and particulate
matter) and a popular alternative among local households (Practical Action Consulting/WB
2011, Practical Action Consulting/UNDP 2011). It generally does not burn at as high a
temperature as LPG, but it is easy to use and is significantly cleaner burning than kerosene
and biomass fuels.
Although ethanol can be produced from the distillation of a variety of sugar and starch-based
crops, in Africa it has traditionally been made from sugar cane molasses, an often
underutilised by-product of sugar production. The main region of sugar production in
Senegal is around the town of Richard Toll, north of Saint-Louis, where the country’s main
sugar producer, CSS (Compagnie Sucrière Sénégalaise), is based. CSS’s annual production
of molasses is estimated at 42,000 tonnes, with an estimated ethanol annual production of
20 million litres per year.
Despite the production of ethanol in the region, there is as yet no market for it as a
household cooking fuel. However, in Saint-Louis there is potential for such a market to
develop, as highlighted by the recent gradual penetration of briquettes as a substitute for
charcoal in the city of Saint-Louis.

5.1 Background




Figure 5.1 Map of the Saint-Louis region

The Saint-Louis region (the main city is also Saint-Louis) is located in the northern part of
Senegal (Figure 5.1). It covers an area of 19,034 km² and has an estimated population of
over 900,000 (ANSD 2010). It is divided into three departments and seven districts, nineteen
municipalities and eighteen rural communities. This is a strategic region of Senegal because
of its location, its economic importance and its local resources: the Senegal River and its



   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal           44
tributaries, Lake Guiers, the Diama dam, and the two largest agro-industrial units in the
country.
Saint-Louis has a long tradition in both fisheries and livestock, with its extensive pastoral and
forested areas and its community of fisherfolk whose experience and expertise is known
beyond the borders of Senegal. The history and culture of Saint-Louis make it an attraction
for tourists. In terms of timber and forest resources, major initiatives are being undertaken to
address the serious threat of desert encroachment.

5.2 Household cooking
The experience of other sub-Saharan countries, such as Kenya, Mozambique and Ethiopia,
has proved ethanol as a cooking fuel to be better suited to urban than rural populations.
There are a number of reasons for this, such as households’ ability to pay, the pre-existence
of supply networks, and the fact the method of using ethanol is similar to that of other
modern fuels such as LPG, which is used more by urban than rural households. However,
the survey was designed to assess the potential for ethanol use among both urban and rural
populations, resulting in the following main findings (see also Figure 5.2):
      In rural Saint-Louis, the energy consumption pattern is typical of that of rural
       Senegal, with most households using firewood as their main source of fuel (89 per
       cent) and charcoal as a secondary fuel. It would clearly be difficult to shift those rural
       households to a modern fuel such as ethanol.
      Nevertheless, in urban areas LPG is the main fuel for over 60 per cent of
       households, followed by charcoal and firewood. However, most urban households
       also use charcoal as a secondary fuel to cook their meals.
      Of particular note is that briquettes are currently being used by 5 per cent of urban
       households, mainly because of (a) the establishment of the small briquette
       manufacturing company BRADES, and (b) the active promotion of briquettes,
       particularly under the GIZ-supported PERACOD programme.
      In terms of firewood stoves, open, three-stone fires predominate, particularly in rural
       areas, and to a much lesser extent in urban areas, where firewood is often used as
       tertiary fuel. Traditional enclosed stoves are used by about 10 per cent of rural
       households; only 5 per cent use improved firewood stoves.
      In terms of charcoal stove usage, the proportion of charcoal users equipped with
       simple charcoal stoves is almost the same across the region, with 74 per cent in rural
       areas and 75 per cent in urban areas. However in urban areas, 16 per cent of
       households are equipped with improved charcoal stoves, whilst none are using such
       stoves in rural areas.
      Women collect all the firewood in 87 per cent of households in rural areas; in the
       remaining 13 per cent the task is shared between women and men. The average
       distance travelled to collect firewood in rural areas is 2.3 km.
      In both urban and rural areas, cooking is done predominately by women, with the
       permanent support of female children (32 per cent in rural areas and 52 per cent in
       urban areas).
      Only 16 per cent of rural households cook outdoors in an open space, against 20 per
       cent of urban households. This indicates that indoor air pollution is likely to be an



   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal               45
       acute problem in both rural and urban areas, although to a slightly lesser extent in
       urban areas.

Figure 5.2 Cooking fuels in Saint-Louis

These findings indicate that there are three main segments of domestic cooking in Saint-
Louis: rural households using firewood, urban households using LPG and urban household
using charcoal. A programme to establish a new market for ethanol fuel will have most
success if it targets charcoal users who use LPG as a secondary fuel and LPG users who
will prefer a cheaper clean fuel, as these are households who are already purchasing fuels
but would be interested in a high-performance fuel if it can compete on price.

5.3 Potential demand for alternative fuels
Because ethanol is not currently produced or sold as a household cooking fuel in Senegal, it
is impossible to assess its demand. However, based on our understanding of the demand for
other alternative fuels in Senegal, coupled with insights gained from the household survey, it
is possible to certain conclusions regarding its potential penetration into the cooking sector in
the region.

5.3.1 Perceptions of current stoves and cooking fuels
Most of the households surveyed (67 per cent in urban areas and 84 per cent in rural areas)
are currently not satisfied with their cooking fuel: smoke is considered to be the main issue in
rural areas, whilst the high cost of fuel is the main issue in urban areas (see Figure 5.3).
Long cooking times is another significant issue for both rural and urban households. They
can be related to the fact most of them use inefficient stoves, but also to the type of food
they cook, such as the Senegalese national dish thiebou-diène (rice and fish), which
requires a long cooking time.

5.3.2 Drivers for purchasing new household cookstoves
With regard to alternative cooking fuels in rural and urban areas households, 68 per cent
and 70 per cent, respectively, have heard of alternative cooking fuels. Briquettes are by far
the best known alternative cooking fuel among rural households, most likely as a result of
the manufacturing facilities for briquettes in this region coupled with a promotion campaign
for fuel substitution which includes competitive prices for briquettes. There is little knowledge
of other fuels apart from biogas, which is known by a small minority (16 per cent of rural and
36 per cent of urban households).
Rural households are not familiar with ethanol, and only 7 per cent of urban households
have heard of the possibility of using ethanol as cooking fuel. However, 16 per cent of the
surveyed urban households, on hearing of its relative cleanliness and ease of use, declared
they would like to use it. This finding provides a clear indication that any ethanol initiative in
the region would require an intense awareness and marketing campaign. A good indication
of what such a campaign should emphasise is suggested by the fact that, according to this
survey, the reasons for switching to alternative fuels, including ethanol, are mainly fuel
expenditure savings (74 per cent and 53 per cent in rural and urban areas, respectively) and,
to a lesser extent, time saving for cooking and fuel collection (Figure 5.4).
This in turn shows that, to penetrate both urban and rural areas in Saint-Louis, ethanol must
be priced to be economically competitive with current fuels. More broadly, for ethanol as a
household cooking fuel to be successful in Senegal, it must perform well in terms of cooking
speed, cleanliness and lack of emissions, as well as overall ease of use.

5.3.3. Willingness to pay for new fuels and stoves
To assess whether ethanol could penetrate the Saint-Louis market, it is critical to understand
people’s willingness to pay for the new fuel compared with their current expenditure.
In Saint-Louis, rural households consume an average of 98 kg of firewood each month.
Monthly expenditure, however, is only CFAF 5,278, as approximately 25 per cent of firewood
is collected. In urban areas, the picture is very different; although average monthly
consumption of firewood is just 10 kg (around one-tenth that of rural areas), expenditure is
CFAF 1,262. Urban households relying on LPG expect to spend CFAF 16,000 per month in
fuel.

Figure 5.4 Drivers for using alternative fuels in rural and urban areas.

From the survey it emerged that almost two-thirds of urban households (72 per cent) and
almost 85 per cent of rural would not pay more than CFAF 10,000 for an ethanol stove (see
Figure 5.5). By including the focus group discussion in the survey results, ethanol appears
affordable only to the urban population, as they would be able to pay more in monthly fuel
purchases than rural population (CFAF 7,000–10,000 as opposed to CFAF 5,000–7000),
and would be more willing to pay over CFAF 10,000 for a stove.

Figure 5.5 Willingness to pay for an ethanol stove (CFAF/month) in Saint-Louis

The experience of ethanol household cooking programmes in other African countries
(particularly Kenya, Madagascar and Ethiopia) indicates that in the short-term, ethanol
stoves would probably need to be imported, until local capacity has been developed to
produce efficient and safe ethanol stoves in Senegal. As imported ethanol stoves are likely
to cost US$30–60 (CFAF 2,700–5,400), it is likely that many potential ethanol users would
need access to some form of credit to purchase an ethanol stove. It is worth noting that most
urban and rural households (54 and 79 per cent, respectively) have already accessed some
form of saving-credit schemes in the past, even though this tends to have been through
informal institutions (see Figure 5.6).

Figure 5.6 Savings and loans using formal and informal institutions

The average size of loans taken out by households in the previous year varies from CFAF
65,656 in rural areas to CFAF 214,737 in urban areas, with the proportion of the average
loan amount to the average annual income being 3 per cent for rural households and 4 per
cent for urban households.
Rural households use loans mainly for farming activities, in particular for fertiliser, whilst
urban households use them for a variety of household expenses, including social services
such as health and education.
In Saint-Louis, households were unaware of the potential use of ethanol as a household fuel.
Many, however, expressed a willingness to try it if it were made widely available, accessible,
affordable and easier to use.

5.4 Supply side

5.4.1 Ethanol production
CSS has already invested CFAF 4.6 billion in an ethanol facility with an annual capacity of
21.5 million litres located in Richard Toll, about 130 km from Saint-Louis city. This is the only
large-scale production unit in the country, although it is not devoted to producing ethanol for
energy usage (see below). CSS has been in operation since 1970, but started the ethanol
production unit only in 2007. The ethanol is produced entirely from molasses, a by-product of
producing sugar from sugarcane.
Industrial ethanol (that is, containing more than 96 per cent alcohol) is currently sold mainly
to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Senegal’s largest consumers are local
companies, which absorb more than 51 per cent of production; companies from
neighbouring countries12 purchase the remainder (CSS interview).




12
     These include Burkina Faso (which absorbs 30 per cent of exports), The Gambia, Ghana and the Ivory Coast.



      Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                          49
However, the ‘head’13 of ethanol production cannot be sold to industries because of its low
90–95 per cent alcohol content. According to CSS, about 550,000 litres of ethanol ‘head’ is
produced every year that is neither used nor sold. This type of ethanol is ideal for use as a
cooking fuel and it could be targeted towards the household cooking market.
CSS does not disclose the production and selling costs for bulk purchases. However, while
the selling price for industrial ethanol is CFAF 470 per litre, CSS suggested that the price of
head ethanol is CFAF 320 per litre. A further advantage is that there are currently no specific
taxes on head ethanol (such as those duties on alcoholic beverages which exist in other
countries). CSS is currently burning off the 550,000 litres of head ethanol and they
expressed to the study team a clear willingness to provide the amount needed to any
operator or researcher wanting to investigate further.
The market for ethanol as a household cooking fuel also depends on the cost of ethanol
cookstoves, whether they are imported or manufactured locally. These are generally more
expensive than charcoal cookstoves

5.4.2 Ethanol distribution
If demand can be created for ethanol as a household cooking fuel, the potential solutions for
its distribution will depend on the available packaging options, which have not yet been
investigated as it has never been tried. Again, CSS expressed a clear interest in any
recommendations for this. Looking at existing distribution networks in the country, two
possible options present themselves for distribution of ethanol:
        distribution to urban households in a manner similar to that of kerosene, which is also
         a liquid;
        using the same companies and distribution channels as those used by LPG. In this
         way it could be distributed to small and medium enterprises – such as bakeries,
         restaurants and hotels – that also typically pay for their cooking fuels, and are
         interested in fuels that have a lower environmental and health impact.

5.4.3 Ethanol stoves
Because ethanol is a new fuel in Senegal, it is necessary to maintain its reputation by
avoiding the dissemination of low-quality stoves. However, the manufacture of ethanol
stoves is generally quite complex, and the cost of production will be passed on to the
consumer, with a consequent effect on the market for ethanol. The local production of
household ethanol stoves has been considered in Mozambique, Kenya and Ethiopia, but at
the moment prototypes have been produced only in Kenya. The only verifiably safe ethanol
stoves are currently produced in Europe. Potential importers would do well to liaise with
Project Gaia14 and CleanStar Mozambique,15 which have successful experience with
importing stoves in Africa.
Although the cost of such a stove is likely to be prohibitive for a large percentage of
Senegal’s population, local manufacture should be considered only at a second stage, when
the market for ethanol has shown its potential.


13
   The head is the fraction of ethanol produced as a by-product of pure ethanol (100 per cent alcohol). It still has
some water content and thus a lower alcohol content.

5.5 Conclusions and recommendations
The findings of this study show clear potential for the development of an ethanol market in
Saint-Louis. This could result in several social, economic and health benefits, not only to
households but also to businesses involved in ethanol production.
An initial ethanol market would likely target both LPG users and urban charcoal users who
use LPG as a secondary fuel. Most members of these groups use simple stoves for their
daily cooking needs, and the resultant health issues affect mostly women and children.
In the Saint-Louis region, briquettes remain the least cost-option in terms of price per
megajoule, followed by ethanol and charcoal when used with improved stoves. Saint-Louis
also has a comparative advantage in terms of transport, given the existence of an ethanol
plant in the region as well the existing production of briquettes, albeit on a small scale.
Furthermore, following the removal of the LPG subsidy, charcoal used with improved stoves
has become cheaper when considering the calorific value (although charcoal used with a
traditional stove remains the most expensive cooking fuel option).
If one takes as given CSS’s suggested price of CFAF 320 per litre, on the basis of other
studies indicating an average household consumption of 1 litre per day, CFAF 9,600 would
be required to cover the monthly cooking fuel expenses for an average urban household.
This is in line with the benchmark of CFAF 10,000 that emerged from the discussions with
urban households, which would make ethanol competitive with both LPG and charcoal used
in efficient stoves, when considering the cost per megajoule, as highlighted in Figure 5.7.

Figure 5.7 Price per megajoule of cooking fuels in St Louis (CFAF)

The main barrier for the penetration of ethanol will be the cost of the stove, which is much
more expensive that of improved charcoal stoves or an average LPG stove. For instance,
even ethanol stoves in Mozambique, which benefit from a subsidy, cost US$30 (CFAF
15,000), which is two to two-and-a-half times the price of an improved charcoal stove in
Saint-Louis. Most households will have difficulty paying the entire price in cash, particularly
in peri urban and rural areas.

The focus group analysis shows that loans, particularly those obtained through tontines
(traditional credit societies), have already been used for the purchase of improved stoves.
For small amounts, the study showed that such traditional financial mechanisms are the
preferred channel. Some women currently pay a weekly instalment of CFAF 700, taking less
than six months to pay back loans for improved stoves with an average price of CFAF 5,000.
For an ethanol stove, a nine-month period to pay back the loan should be considered. At an
interest rate of 18 per cent, this would result in nine monthly instalments of CFAF
1794/month. This would be in line with both (a) the capacity of low-income households and
(b) current practice of micro-financial institutions in Senegal, including interest rates.
The study shows that there is potential for a pilot study for 1,500 households in urban Saint-
Louis, with the aim of distributing 1 litre per household per day. CSS expressed a clear
interest in testing this market and in seeing the 550,000 litres of ‘head’ ethanol
commercialised. This could be a good place to start piloting the market. After that,
production can be considered either by CSS or other interested investors.
Of course, although ethanol is currently fairly competitively priced, a functional supply chain
is required, and links with the kerosene and LPG supply chain should be considered. As
ethanol for cooking is almost completely unknown in Saint-Louis, a campaign targeting
urban households should be launched before starting any commercialisation pilot.
Finally, lessons from initiatives in other countries, including Kenya, Madagascar and
Mozambique, can be applied in Senegal by government, NGO and private sector actors.
Production can be piloted in the Saint-Louis region. The recommendations for stakeholders
interested in exploring ethanol for cooking in Senegal are as follows:
      The long-term commercial viability of ethanol production depends on (a) the ability of
       the producer to access an affordable and reliable supply of source materials (in this
       case molasses from sugar cane production) and (b) the existence of a stable market
       for the ethanol fuel and its co-products, such as ethanol cookstoves.
      Any organization deciding to pilot ethanol in Saint-Louis should include these
       measures:
       -   Add flavours and colour to the ethanol to make it unattractive for human
           consumption.
       -   Standardise the packages and labelling.
       -   Learn the lesson of previous studies, namely, that the design of the ethanol stove
           matters.
       -   Factors associated with obtaining the fuel, such as access and price, are also
           significant.
      One of the main problems with using ethanol as a household cooking fuel is its high
       flammability. It needs careful handling and usage (like kerosene and LPG, which are
       equally flammable). If an ethanol pilot is to be conducted, it is vital that the stove
       used is a high quality one, and that it is tested, and ideally used first in a similar
       context.
      Most households are unaware that they can use ethanol for cooking. There is thus a
       clear opportunity to create a strong reputation around it.

      The experience of other countries seems to indicate that ethanol can be produced at
       a price similar to that of charcoal. If this were the case, it would be likely to generate
       a high demand as it is much more user-friendly than charcoal and burns more
       cleanly.

   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal               52
   If ethanol can be produced in sufficiently large quantities at a competitive price, it
    could complement LPG in other urban areas, including Dakar. However, for this to
    happen a long-term development strategy is required. This would include the
    establishment by the authorities of an attractive framework (i.e., favourable
    regulations, tax incentives, and so on) for the private production of ethanol
    specifically for use as a household cooking fuel, as well as for suitable stoves and
    awareness-raising campaigns to create the demand from end users.

6. Biogas in rural Kaolack
Biogas is generated when any organic matter (such as animal dung, crop residues or kitchen
waste) is fermented in the absence of oxygen. Biogas contains around 60 per cent
combustible methane (along with carbon dioxide and traces of other gases), and it is this gas
which can serve as a convenient fuel for a variety of applications such as cooking, lighting
and motive power. In addition, the bio-slurry (the biological residue left over after the gas is
produced) can be used – either directly or as a composting agent – as organic manure to
improve soil fertility.
Biogas technology thus produces a very clean burning fuel as well as a high-quality organic
fertiliser, and benefits households from the perspective of improved energy services,
agricultural production and improved health and sanitation, as well as a range of gender-
and environment-related benefits. It is also significantly cheaper in the long run than most
other cooking fuels because, once the biogas production system has been installed, the gas
is produced almost without cost.
Although Senegal’s history of biogas technology dates back to the 1950s, it was only in the
mid-1970s that it began to take off, with the introduction of two Indian, floating drum–model
biogas digesters. These were established by the Senegal branch of Caritas, in Thiadiaye,
Fatick region (although most digesters were at first installed for demonstration and research
purposes only). The main actors in the development of biogas technology in Senegal include
École Supérieure Polytechnique de Dakar (ESP), Centre Régional Africain de Technologie
(CRAT), Centre d'Études et de Recherches sur les Energies Renouvelables (CERER), and
Environmental Development Action in the Third World (ENDA Energy).
The technical potential of household-scale biogas digesters in Senegal is estimated to be
between 170,000 and 400,000, (SNV 2007). Kaolack is one of the most important regions for
biogas for a number of reasons: the level of work on biogas to date, the livestock present in
the region, and the number of biogas enterprises already active in the region. At the same
time, however, a number of factors need to be addressed, such as livestock breeding
methods, poor knowledge of the technology and the lack of involvement of microfinance
institutions. To promote the dissemination of biogas, the government of Senegal has recently
started to subsidise biogas digesters.

6.1 Background
The Kaolack region, with a population of about 1,066,000, lies on the border with The
Gambia to the south (Figure 6.1). The capital, Kaolack city, is a port on the Saloum River. It
is a major peanut marketing and exporting centre, and has a large peanut oil factory and a
number of other important industries, including brewing, leather tanning, cotton ginning and
fish processing.
The region is predominantly rural, however, with about 80 per cent of the population
employed in agro-pastoral practices. A recent socio-economic analysis revealed a marked
difference between rural and urban Kaolack (SNV 2007). However, as biogas technology is
only really appropriate for those rural and peri-urban households with domestic livestock (at
least two cows), this study assesses only the potential of domestic biogas within rural
households.




   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal              54
  Figure 6.1 Map of Kaolack

Unusually for Senegal, the difference in levels of educational achievement between urban
and rural Kaolack is not significant. There is, however, a poverty gap: the annual urban
income (CFAF 3,500,000) is approximately 3.2 times higher than that of rural areas (CFAF
1,082,212). The rate of access to a potable water supply is 100 per cent in urban areas and
82 per cent in rural areas, with the average time taken and distance travelled by rural
households to access it being an average of two minutes and 140 metres, respectively.
Women are entirely responsible for collecting water in both urban and rural areas.
Kaolack is one of the main agricultural regions of Senegal, part of the bassin arachidier
(groundnut basin) and home to the production of a range of cash crops, including peanuts,
rice and cotton. Agricultural activity, particularly farming, is the primary employment for 43
per cent of rural households, while trade makes up 40 per cent of the employment of urban
households (ANSD 2010). Salaried employment within the local administration is the second
most important source of livelihood for both rural (18 per cent) and urban (25 per cent)
households. Other employment opportunities for rural households include trade (17 per
cent), other diversified sources of livelihood (15 per cent), and daily labour (5 per cent).
About 15 per cent of urban households earn their livelihood from daily labour.
In rural areas, 98 per cent of all households own the home they live in, a good indication of
the potential for long-term investments made by rural households, such as biogas digesters.

6.2 Livestock production
As Figure 6.2 shows, most of the surveyed rural population of Kaolack own livestock, with
almost 30 per cent possessing cattle. About 45 per cent of surveyed households already
collect the dung from their livestock, either for composting (32 per cent) or for direct



   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal            55
combustion (13 per cent). More than half collect the waste from their cattle sheds or inside
their homesteads, while 12 per cent collect it from open grazing areas.

Figure 6.2 Types of livestock and use of animal waste in Kaolack region
Note: The livestock total is higher than 100 per cent because some households own more than one type of
livestock.

These conditions all constitute positive indicators for the potential uptake of domestic
biodigesters in the Kaolack region.

6.3 Household cooking
The rural Kaolack energy consumption pattern is typical of many other parts of rural
Senegal, with firewood being the main domestic cooking fuel (Figure 6.3.).

Firewood is the main source of cooking fuel for everyday use for 83 per cent of rural
households, while charcoal and LPG are used on a daily basis only by 12 per cent and 3 per
cent of rural households, respectively. A small minority (3 per cent) uses agricultural
residues as a tertiary cooking fuel.

As expected, the ownership of cookstoves in the Kaolack region directly correlates with the
rate of fuel usage. The traditional three-stone cookstove is the predominant technology in
rural households, with 73 per cent using it to burn firewood (Figure 6.4). It is, however,
interesting to note that 13 per cent of rural households have already adopted improved
cookstoves, with a much lower percentage (5 per cent) using an enclosed traditional stove.
Traditional and improved charcoal stoves are owned by only 20 per cent and 12 per cent of
rural households respectively.

6.4.1. Perceptions of current stoves and cooking fuels
Ninety-eight per cent of surveyed rural households reported dissatisfaction with their current
cooking fuels and stoves. The main reasons given are related to smoke, long cooking times,
high fuel consumption and the high cost of fuels (Figure 6.5).

Note: This is based on the 98 per cent of households not satisfied with their cooking technology and fuel.

In rural Kaolack the cost of cooking is ranked third, as cooking fuels are collected, thereby
incurring no monetary expense for a significant proportion of the households. In rural
households, smoke is the most important issue, followed by cooking time. An additional
issue which emerged from the focus group discussions was that the availability and price of
current fuels is strictly dependent on the season (that is, the price is higher during the rainy
season).

6.4.2 Insights into biogas in the region
Biogas is a well-known technology in rural Kaolack: of the approximately half of all
households who are familiar with any alternative fuels, all have seen a biodigester. The
alternative fuels that the households want to use seem to be based on prior knowledge of
the fuels (biogas is amongst the best known alternative fuel technologies in the region): of
the 63 per cent of households who are aware of alternative fuels, 92 per cent chose biogas,
and only 8 per cent chose briquettes.
The reason for choosing biogas is primarily for saving on fuel expenditure, followed by
cleanliness and smoke reduction (see Figure 6.6). This contrasts with what is stated by
households as their main issues with current cooking fuels, but it shows that they perceive
biogas as a free fuel, and that they understand the potential to pay back the initial upfront
cost. Safety, in the sense of reduction of fire hazard, is also one reason why households
would choose this technology.

Figure 6.6 Drivers for using biogas in rural and urban areas

According to one woman interviewed in the focus group discussions who has seen a family
in her village using a biodigester, the technology is useful because it produces free fuel,
without smoke; it cooks fast; and it is easy to operate; the technology clearly has a good
reputation among households. Although this is an indication of a potential high demand for
biogas in the region, it is also clear that not all the households would be willing to have a
biodigester even if they could afford one.

Biodigesters need attending to daily to shift the waste and slurry. In determining how best to
promote the technology, it useful to understand how households would absorb this additional
work requirement. The survey revealed that in 37 per cent of households the digester will be
operated only by the men (husband and sons), in 21 per cent by women (wife and
daughters), and in most cases by varying members of the family (Figure 6.7).

Although these figures indicate a balanced approach to sharing the work, it would be
necessary to know the situation of each individual household and the daily tasks of its
members to determine whether the operation would in fact be carried out equally.

6.4.3 Willingness to pay for new fuels and stoves
Buying a biodigester would represent a significant investment for the average small holder in
Senegal. To design an effective, targeted marketing campaign, it is thus important to
understand who is the household’s main decision maker in regard to the purchasing of large
items.
In terms of who makes the decisions about major household purchases (including new
stoves) in rural Kaolack, the survey shows there to be a fair balance between husbands and
wives (Figure 6.8). This means any marketing campaign should target both genders in order
to stimulate demand.

Figure 6.8 Decision makers for major purchases and stove purchases in rural Kaolack

The ratio of total household expenditure to energy expenditure for cooking (including
equipment) is a good indicator when assessing the budgets households allocate to their
energy needs and how such decisions affect their livelihood. The survey shows that an
average of CFAF 8,212 per month is devoted to cooking fuels in rural Kaolack. As shown in
Figure 6.9, most of households who consume firewood both purchase and gather it. The

average household consumption of firewood is 233 kg per month; the monthly expenditure
for this is CFAF 4,429 as approximately 32 per cent of firewood (74 kg) is collected.

Figure 6.9 How firewood is procured in rural Kaolack

In rural areas, firewood is generally collected by women (72 per cent), who travel an average
distance of 1.7 km to do so. This shows that firewood, despite being the main fuel, is still
available within a reasonable distance of the area investigated by this report, and presents a
potential barrier to the uptake of biodigesters.
Because households are used to either collecting their own fuel or paying for it on a daily or
weekly basis, a typical barrier to accessing biogas is the initial upfront cost. In contrast to
other alternative fuels, biogas requires a significant initial expense to cover both the
construction of the biodigester and the purchase of an appropriate stove. It is thus necessary
to consider how much a household is able to spend and whether it can access external
finance. It is also essential to determine how long it would take households to recoup the
initial cost through the savings in fuel purchasing over time.
As Figure 6.10 shows, households were asked how willing they would be (a) to pay for an
alternative cookstove which is clean and cooks fast and (b) to pay monthly for an alternative
fuel such as biogas. Although 15 per cent said they would not be willing to pay anything,
most (60 per cent) are willing to pay up to CFAF 10,000 for a stove and CFAF 10,000 for the
fuel per month, and 25 per cent are willing to pay more than CFAF 10,000.
However, from focus group discussions it emerges that CFAF 5,000 is the actual price
households are willing to pay per month for alternative fuels, and around CFAF 4,000 is what
they would pay for an alternative stove. A good means of calculating actual ability to pay is
to match these figures with a household’s current expenses: the result is that in rural
Kaolack the average household would spend between CFAF 5,000 and CFAF 10,000 per
month on domestic energy.




17
    The figures are higher or less than 100 per cent as some of the households both purchase and collect
firewood.

Figure 6.10 Willingness to pay for alternative cookstoves and fuels in Kaolack (per month)

Although past experience has shown that biodigester use would allow people to recoup their
initial expense within a few years and to cook for free after that, most rural households do
not have enough cash to cover the upfront capital cost. An assessment of (a) access to
loans and (b) household experience of saving and loan management would help when
considering ways to scale up dissemination of biodigesters in the region.
The survey findings (Figure 6.11) indicate that in Kaolack 22 per cent of rural households are
members of credit and saving cooperatives and that 22 per cent have used credit from
formal sources. About 37 per cent have accessed informal sources of loans. Significantly,
the average total for loans taken out in 2012 by the households surveyed was CFAF
102,983. This indicates that most households need to borrow either from formal or informal
sources to cope with their total expenditure on household and professional activities.

As shown in Figure 6.12, most loan applications in both rural and urban areas (as indicated
by the survey category ‘other’) are for petty trade, house construction, poultry, health and
consumable household goods. These account for 59 per cent of loan applications in rural

areas and 83 per cent in urban areas. Loans for farm inputs (fertiliser, seed, purchase of
livestock) are also common, mainly in rural areas. These findings show that households in
the region are used to accessing both formal and informal loans, and that there is therefore
potential for developing specific microcredit systems for households willing to purchase
biodigesters.

6.5 Supply side
Biogas is currently being used in a number of regions of Senegal, overseen by the National
Domestic Biogas Programme of Senegal. Several biogas technologies are already in use,
including the fixed dome and plastic varieties, with the main feedstock generally being cow
dung. For the smallest household biogas unit (4 m³), a minimum of two cows are required.
As Figure 6.13 shows, the pace of biogas implementation in Kaolack has dropped in the last
two years, although the demand remains.

Assuming the existence of sufficient feedstock and water, the key barrier is cost. In this light,
Senegal’s existing biogas programme (Box 3) is an important asset. The programme has
estimated the technical potential at between 175,000 and 400,000 installations, sufficient for
the development of a manufacturing sector in Senegal. According to a previous study (SNV
2013), around 30,000 households in Kaolack would be suitable for biogas use.
Before the subsidies were introduced, the investment costs for a fixed dome biogas
installation in Senegal ranged from CFAF 612,000 for a 4 m3 installation to CFAF 892,000
for a 10 m3 installation. Construction using stabilised clay blocks rather than brick would
reduce investment costs to CFAF 406,000 and CFAF 591,000, respectively (SNV 2007).
In June 2013, around 460 biodigesters were installed with PNB-SN support The aim is a
target of 7,000 in five years. Many development programmes (such as Senegal’s
ecovillages) include biogas in their technology package not only to address energy issues
but also to extend the use of organic fertiliser (provided by the biodigester effluent) in
agriculture. Biogas could thus experience real diffusion through the enlargement of the grant;
the market approach in the dissemination of biogas has led to the emergence of micro
enterprises specialising in the field of biogas.




 Box 3. The National Domestic Biogas Programme

 The National Domestic Biogas Programme of Senegal (Programme National de Biogaz
 Domestique de Senegal; PNB-SN) was launched started in 2009 with the financial support of the
 Netherlands government via the Directorate General for International Cooperation (DGIS), and
 managed by Humanist Institute for Cooperation (HIVOS) of the Netherlands for all six countries of
 the Africa Biogas Partnership Programme (ABPP). SNV was responsible for providing technical
 support.
 The programme’s market-based approach promotes the development of a mix of private and
 public organizations: the state, the builders or construction companies, financial institutions, local
 authorities, and the communities or beneficiary households. Given that the income level of the
 target households is low, and that the average cost of acquiring a biodigester is currently CFAF
 450,000, the programme has established a funding mechanism to allow microfinance institutions to
 lend to companies that construct biodigesters (such as ECB) as well as to households that wish to
 buy them.
 Indeed, the programme has an agreement with the Mutual Savings and Credit Union (Union des
 Institutions Mutualistes Communautaires d'Epargne et de Crédit; U-IMCEC) to provide financial
 support up to a maximum of CFAF 1.5 million for a credit group and CFAF 500,000 for individual
 credit over 12 months (the possibility of exemption may not exceed 18 months). The programme
 also benefits from financial support from the government of Senegal in the form of a grant (Table
 6.1). Taking into consideration the subsidies in place and current prices, the investment costs
 range from CFAF 355,000 for a 4 m³ unit to CFAF 730,000 for an 18 m³ unit. Because the fixed
 subsidy of CFAF 160,000 is irrespective of size, it will be proportionally higher for small-scale units.
 For instance, the selling price of an 8 m³ biogas digester is CFAF 449,773; a subsidy would
 account for 36 per cent of this. For an 18 m³ unit the subsidy will be only 22 per cent of the price.
 PNB-SN’s first five-year phase ended in December 2013. The program is now in a transitory phase
 (2014) during which the next five-year phase is being designed.

Table 6.1 Biogas subsidies for different digester sizes (CFAF)

In the Kaolack region biogas digesters are installed by Entreprise des Travaux Hydrauliques
et de Construction (ETHEC). Created in 2011, ETHEC can install three to four biogas units a
month. The feedstock used is cow dung, as it is the case in most biogas units. So far the
company has installed eighteen units, of which five are 10 m3 and thirteen are more than 10
m3. The average profit per unit is around CFAF 100,000 (US$200). Interviews with company
representatives show that (a) installation costs and (b) the promotion campaign are the main
constraints to the scale-up of biodigesters and ETHEC’s business. According to them, one
possible option to overcome the financial constraint would be a subsidy proportional to the
size of the unit, rather than a lump sum as it is now.
If applied, loans and subsides designed by the National Domestic Biogas Programme could
really speed up the penetration of the technology in Kaolack. One biodigester with 4 m³
capacity can produce up to 1.44 m³ of biogas per day, which is enough to keep a single
burner stove going for 3.5 to 4 hours. Assuming that 80 per cent of the gas produced (1.15
m³) is used per day, it will replace 6 kg of firewood or 2 kg of charcoal (Table 6.2).

Table 6.2 Payback period of 4 m capacity biodigester showing the cost and savings

Table 6.2 shows that a household which is able to pay the upfront cost of the biogas system
with the help of the subsidy would be able to pay back the cost of the biodigester in about a
year. However, because most households are unable to afford the initial capital cost, they
would need to access the loan scheme provided by the national programme. With CFAF
140,834 credit provided over 18 months to cover the cash contribution of the beneficiary,
plus the subsidy of CFAF 160,000 from the government and an in-kind contribution from the
beneficiary of CFAF 52,741, a household would pay CFAF 7,777 per month for 18 months.
This is only slightly higher than the average amount rural households pay for cooking fuel in
Kaolack, and only slightly above the price most households indicated they are willing to pay
for clean fuels. This means that after one and a half years the household would have a free
supply of biogas, as well as the bio-slurry produced as a waste product, which would reduce
the expense of fertiliser.

6.6 Conclusions and recommendations
The study shows that rural Kaolack has the right social and agricultural conditions for the
penetration of biogas technology. However, it still lacks sufficient awareness of the benefits
of the technology to really reach scale. Although the newly-established national biogas
programme provides subsidies and facilitates loans, it is also recommended that Senegal
should stimulate demand by supporting the development of a range of biogas suppliers in
the region that are currently unable either to construct the systems or to train end users to
maintain them sufficiently.
      In Kaolack region, there is a good level of awareness around biogas and households
       clearly express their interest in the technology. However, the survey reveals a lack of
       awareness around the national biogas programme amongst households; the benefits
       of which have not yet been widely enjoyed by the population.
      The research shows that if the subsidies and loans were accessed, and considering
       current fuel consumption and costs, the cost of a 4 m³ biodigester could be paid back
       in 1-1.3 years. The survey also reveals that households in the region are used to
       accessing formal and informal loans, suggesting a potential for developing a specific
       microcredit mechanism for households willing to purchase biodigesters as well as for
       entrepreneurs willing to invest in biogas.
      There remains a lack of biogas technology suppliers in the region, and the few that
       exist suffer from low profit margins. The low margins are (a) due to weak demand,
       which is constrained by low household purchasing power (versus the high up-front
       cost of the technology); and (b) as a result of poor business management capacity.
      Looking at the potential of domestic biodigesters in Kaolack, the need is clear for a
       wider range of companies operating in the sector.
      The survey clearly demonstrates that governmental subsidy would not suffice to
       make the upfront cost feasible for most households, but that specific loans under the
       National Biogas Programme can be accessed by households to make up the
       shortfall. The survey also shows that households in the region are used to accessing
       both formal and informal loans, suggesting a potential for developing a microcredit
       mechanism specifically for households willing to purchase biodigesters, and for
       entrepreneurs willing to invest in biogas. The government should look at alternative
       solutions suggested by stakeholders involved in the sector; a suggestion from one
       entrepreneur from Kaolack is to make the subsidy proportional to the size of the
       biodigester rather than a lump sum.
      The National Domestic Biogas Programme needs to make its presence felt at the
       regional level. Local enterprises and micro-finance organizations need to be fully
       involved in facilitating household access to loans and subsidies.
      Although this study focused on the feasibility of biogas in Kaolack, the findings give
       wider indications regarding the economics of cooking in the region, as shown in
       Figure 6.14.

Note: See Annex A for methodology.

Briquettes and charcoal used with improved stoves are the least-cost option in the Kaolack
region. However, this is not so for charcoal if it is purchased in small quantities, which is a
least cost option only when it is purchased in minimum quantities of 50 kg and used with an
improved stove.
Overall, as stated earlier, it is recommended that the government should aim to stimulate
demand not only through subsidies and loan facilitation, but also by supporting the
development of a range of biogas suppliers in the region.

7. Pure plant oil in Tambacounda
There is a great deal of literature available on the plant Jatropha curcas, particularly as its
original selling point was that it can grow on marginal lands (although evidence later
emerged that yields thus achieved are much lower than those obtained from fertile land).
The pure plant oil (PPO) extracted from the Jatropha seeds can be used to power basic
diesel engines (such as those used for water pumps and on multi-functional platforms), and
in Senegal this is its main use. There is no relevant experience of using Jatropha oil for
cooking.
Although PPO crops, particularly Jatropha, have been planted in many regions of Senegal,
the production of oil that might be suitable for household cooking is believed to be most
advanced in Tambacounda, where PERACOD have been working.

7.1 Background
Tambacounda region is located in Eastern Senegal, on a sparsely populated Sahelian plain
(see Figure 7.1). The population is about 605,000 and the climate characterised by two
seasons: the rainy season from June to October and the dry season from November to May.
The capital city of the region (also Tambacounda) has an estimated population of 80,000
people.




Figure 7.1 Map of Tambacounda region

Agriculture provides the majority of the employment and dominates the economy, with a
focus on cash crops such as cotton and peanuts. In the southern part of the region the
mining industry plays a role, with tourism being focused around the Niojkola-Koba National
Park.

7.2 Household cooking
The energy consumption pattern in rural Tambacounda is typical of that of rural Senegal, in
that a predominance of firewood is used for household cooking. In urban areas, there is a
tendency to use a mix of fuels (LPG, charcoal and firewood), with the survey confirming the
role of charcoal as being dominant in urban areas. LPG is used on an irregular basis by 10
per cent of urban and 3 per cent of rural households (see Figure 7.2). The phasing out of
LPG subsidies in 2009, combined with high poverty levels and the close physical proximity to
firewood and charcoal resources, explains the relatively low rate of LPG penetration in this
rural area of Senegal. On the one hand, according to one of the women interviewed, LPG is
available to buy in shops but is expensive and does not last as long as charcoal, which is
more economical. On the other, the message obtained from focus group discussions with
people from rural Tambacounda was that LPG is almost non-existent in rural areas, with only
a few households using gas, and there are general difficulties in buying and refilling the gas
cylinders, which requires a long walk to the main city. The problem is thus not just one of
economics but also of availability of supply.

Figure 7.2 Household cooking fuels used in Tambacounda region

In rural areas, a higher proportion of households – 85 per cent in rural Tambacounda against
23 per cent in urban areas – benefit from having a separate indoor kitchen (see Figure 7.3).
This lower figure can be explained by the scarcity of space in the city, where most of
households (70 per cent) cook outside the house. However, indoor air pollution is reported to
be an acute problem for both rural and urban households: rural (95 per cent) and urban
households (83 per cent) report health problems due to cooking practices.

Traditional stoves and open three-stone fires are the predominant equipment used in urban
and rural areas by those whose main fuel is firewood. Despite the high price of charcoal, it is
the main fuel for 60 per cent of urban households, and the use of traditional stoves (the
simple charcoal stove or metallic stove) remains predominant, with 80 per cent of urban
charcoal users using this type of stove and only 13 per cent having an improved charcoal
stove. All the surveyed rural households use firewood, with only 5 per cent using an
improved cookstove, while the majority (78 per cent) use a fixed traditional stove and 17 per
cent still cook on a three stone fire.

7.3 Potential demand for new fuels

7.3.1 Perceptions of current stoves and cooking fuels
Of the households surveyed, all of the rural and 80 per cent of the urban ones expressed
dissatisfaction with the cooking fuel they use. In common with the other regions of this study,
urban and rural households had different reasons for this dissatisfaction, which extends to
the type of stove they use (Figure 7.4).

Figure 7.4 Reasons for dissatisfaction with current cooking solutions

In urban areas, fuel cost is the main issue, unlike in rural areas where cooking fuels are
generally collected without incurring major monetary expense. In rural areas, adverse effects
on health and extended cooking time cause the most dissatisfaction. These would be an
important constraint to the market development of alternative fuels in rural areas, in
particular for PPO.
The lower proportion of households in urban areas expressing dissatisfaction with levels of
smoke emission and the slow rate of cooking can be ascribed to the different types of fuels
used, as well as where the cooking takes place and the cooking practices, which to a large
extent explain the health problems. Eye infections, respiratory problems and coughing are
the main health problems reported by households, with some disparities according to the
geographical location.18

  Ninety-six per cent and 80 per cent of rural and urban households, respectively, experience eye infection as a
major issue. Respiratory problems are reported by 90 per cent of rural households and 53 per cent of urban

7.3.2 Drivers for purchasing new household cooking fuels and stoves
As a number of Jatropha initiatives in the region have been unsuccessful, it is useful to
understand the context in terms of PPO’s visibility and reputation in Tambacounda.
Of the 60 per cent of urban households that are aware of alternative fuels, 63 per cent are
aware of PPO; this compares to 43 per cent of rural households.
However, very probably because of PPO’s poor reputation in the region, although most
households – 80 per cent of rural and 88 per cent of urban – expressed a desire to use
alternative fuels, only 23 per cent of urban and 3 cent of rural households declared any
interest in using PPO for household cooking. Of note is the relative interest in using biogas
and briquettes in this region, something that should be harnessed to build links with different
regional initiatives (Figure 7.5).

Figure 7.5 Willingness to use alternative fuels in urban and rural Tambacounda

When asked what would induce them to switch to their preferred alternative fuels, both urban
and rural households gave as their main reasons (a) time saved when cooking and (b) fuel
expenditure savings (Figure 7.6). Paradoxically, despite respondents in urban areas
purchasing most of their fuel, about 50 per cent of urban households reported fuel collection
time savings as a reason for their willingness to switch to alternative cooking fuels. At the
moment, because no PPO household cooking stoves are available in any country in West
Africa, it is not clear whether it would be more efficient and cleaner than an improved
charcoal stove. In addition, if the oil is not well processed, it is likely to perform worse than
charcoal in addition to being more expensive.

7.3.3 Willingness to pay for alternative fuels and stoves
Compared to other regions of Senegal, fuel expenditure in Tambacounda is relatively low. In
rural Tambacounda, only 1.5 per cent of total household expenditure is devoted to energy,
while in urban areas this figure, although much greater at almost 12 per cent, is still
comparatively low.
This sharp difference between urban and rural households is due to the fact that cooking
fuels in rural areas are mainly collected and therefore not considered as a cost. Urban
households devote a much higher budget to energy (CFAF 6,632 per month) than rural
households (CFAF 625 per month). These figures are even higher when the cost of cooking
equipment (mainly stoves) is included.
Because many households do not know the specific differences and benefits of different
alternative fuels, the survey asked about their willingness to pay for a fuel which would bring
them the general benefits of an alternative fuel (such as clean and fast cooking and reliable
supply). From their responses, it emerged that the majority of both urban and rural
households would not pay more than CFAF 10,000 per month for fuel and no more than
CFAF 10,000 for an alternative fuel stove. However, from the focus group discussions it was
possible to restrict the benchmark of monthly expenditure to CFAF 5,000 (Figure 7.7). In
addition, according to the household interviews, urban households would need to access
credit for this, while rural households suggested a seasonal payment system, due the
irregularities of their incomes from agricultural production. These alternative methods of
payment need to be investigated further.
An analysis of the total household income and total expenditure shows that on average both
urban and rural households need to borrow either from formal or informal financial services
to cope with the total household and professional financial needs. Overall, 28 per cent of
rural households and 20 per cent of urban households belong to credit and savings
cooperatives. However, savings are limited to a minority of both urban and rural households.
The total household borrowing seems quite high when compared with the total annual
income – particularly in rural areas, which confirms the rural-urban poverty gap. In rural
areas, total loans were estimated at CFAF 77,250 (US$154.5), which is more than 18 per
cent of their total income. In urban areas, this ratio is slightly under 10 per cent, with
households having accrued loans totalling CFAF 101,350 (US$202) against a total annual
income of CFAF 1,034,048.

Figure 7.8 Savings and loans using formal and informal institutions in Tambacounda

Households’ attitude towards credit varies directly with their location in rural or urban areas.
In rural areas, loans are almost entirely taken on to support on farming and livestock-related
activities, whilst in urban areas only 29 per cent of the credit pertains to livestock. The
remainder of loans are taken out for other purposes, such as for the purchase of household
equipment, including cookstoves.
Although there is a definite need for clean cooking solutions in Tambacounda, the survey
findings clearly indicate that both urban and rural households in the region are not interested
in PPO. Other solutions, such as briquetting in urban areas and biogas in rural areas, are
likely to be considerably more appropriate and more easily accepted.

7.4 Supply side
The production of PPO in Senegal has been going on for a number of years. It has mainly
been obtained from the Jatropha curcas plant, and a number of organisations, including the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have helped support the sector, in


        Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                                           72
particular under their regional programme on multifunctional platforms for productive uses of
energy. As well as being used in diesel generators that have been adapted, PPO can also
be used directly in household cookstoves, such as the PROTOS stove developed by Bosch
Siemens (although this initiative has since gone out of business). The production and
potential use of PPO have been piloted – particularly in the rural regions of Tambacounda,
Kolda and Kédougou, where PROGEDE are currently working – although there are major
issues in securing a good supply of feedstocks on which the PPO is based.
Production of PPO from Jatropha is specifically featured in Senegal’s agricultural strategy
(ENDA 2010). With regard to the supply chain and irrespective of the end use (cooking fuel,
transport, electricity generation) the Ministry of Agriculture has set up the following
principles:
      Jatropha producers should receive sufficient financial incentives;
      The majority of shares should be owned by Senegalese private capital along the whole
       supply chain;
      Because land is the responsibility of local authorities, there should be no lease or sale to
       developers of biofuel.
In the Tambacounda region, over 600 hectares in Jatropha have been planted by
PROGEDE and private operators. The initial objective of biofuel production was for local
consumption; however, today the only current market in the region is the production and
selling of seed to processors outside Tambacounda that extract the oil for uses other than
cooking.
PROGEDE has been involved in Jatropha plantations for biofuel production since 2003.
Working with local artisans, PROGEDE has also developed a stove for cooking with
Jatropha, although this stove never quite reached the market, and the study team found no
information on how well it performs in relation to other household cooking stoves.
The current estimated price for one litre of Jatropha oil is CFAF 700, which equates to a
price of CFAF 35/MJ (about three times the price per megajoule of charcoal in the region).
Discussions with local PROGEDE staff make it clear that a real market for Jatropha oil for
cooking, and its related stove, has never really developed in Tambacounda, and is unlikely
to do so in the future.
According to an interviewee19, the main reasons for lack of penetration of PPO in the region
were technical:
          During PROGEDE 1, a traditional, locally manufactured press was used to extract
           the oil from Jatropha seeds. The oil was then dirty and very smoky when burnt. For
           this reason households could not see the benefits of this cooking solution.
          During PROGEDE 2, technical issues were caused by lack of knowledge transfer to
           local technicians: the processing machinery was imported, but without the sufficient
           technical support.
According to Mr Diouf, for these reasons farmers have lost faith in Jatropha oil and have
started to uproot their plantations. During the last four years, some research has been
carried out into the potential of PPO extracted from sunflower, sesame and cotton plants.
Evidence of its potential as a household cooking fuel has not emerged, however, so it is
unlikely that it will become commercially viable in the short term.

7.5 Conclusions and recommendations
With most of rural population of Tambacounda relying on firewood, and most urban
households relying on charcoal and firewood (most of which is not harvested efficiently or
sustainably), there is an immediate need for action to create a market for more sustainable
cooking solutions in the region.
However, quite early on during the interviews and surveys it became clear that there is no
current market potential for PPO as a household cooking fuel in Tambacounda. Although
there is a clear need for alternative fuels in the region, using PPO for cooking does not seem
to be a feasible solution, at least not in the near future, and particularly considering the poor
reputation of Jatropha.
In addition, the Tambacounda region is very well-endowed with biomass resources, making
charcoal and firewood the least cost options, even when charcoal is used with an improved
stove. As shown in Figure 7.9, charcoal and firewood are from three to seven times cheaper
than Jatropha oil. It is therefore very unlikely that PPO will displace or be used as
complimentary to traditional biomass (firewood and charcoal), particularly when the benefits
of using PPO (such as its clean burning potential and its ease of use) have not been shown.
The development of biogas might be considered as an alternative option.

Figure 7.9 Cost comparison of different fuels in Tambacounda
Note: see Annex A for methodology.

Although not planned as part of this study, a demand for biogas (already present in the
region) and briquetting clearly emerged. Further analysis of the feasibility of (a) extending
the use of these two fuels in the region and (b) linking of them to initiatives in other regions
of Senegal (particularly Saint-Louis and Kaoloack) and at national level is thus
recommended.
PPO seems to have a great production potential; however, despite all the initiatives that
have been developed so far, it has been fairly unsuccessful. Lessons from the pilots
conducted in Senegal and the surrounding region provide important information for the future
development of PPO, but so far the existence of a viable market for it as a cooking fuel has
not been proved.
Finally, it is recommended that before any programme on household cooking using PPO
starts, more research is needed to test PPO as a household cooking fuel, including the
potential development of a suitable stove. Such research would increase understanding of


   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal                74
how well it performs in terms of emissions, efficiency and ease of use from a household
perspective. Before this is done, it is recommended that of the four alternative fuels
assessed, PPO be given the lowest priority.

8. Final conclusions and recommendations

8.1 Briquettes in urban and peri-urban Dakar
The capital of Senegal is likely to be one of the most important demand centres for any
alternative fuel commercialised in the country. Although it is important to consider how the
utilisation of LPG can be extended within both urban and peri-urban households in the Dakar
region, an understanding of the still relatively high (and growing) use of biomass fuels is
important in the context of alternative fuels, particularly biomass briquettes. The use of
briquettes could partially or wholly replace charcoal and firewood in Dakar’s urban and peri-
urban households and, if used with more efficient stoves, could offer a cleaner burning and
cheaper alternative without the need for major behavioural change.
It is estimated that the sale price of briquettes in Dakar will depend on the transport price,
and will fluctuate between CFAF 150 and CFAF 200 per kg. In Dakar, the comparison of
cost per megajoule (MJ) shows that CFAF 20.2 per MJ is about half the cost of charcoal and
two thirds that of LPG. Thus, it should be relatively easy for retailers to sell briquettes once
the end users start to understand their benefits, in particular that briquettes compare very
favourably with charcoal for cooking, with no major disadvantages provided they are
produced to a high quality.
To scale up the demand for briquettes and develop a market, the following
recommendations should be considered:
      A national, urban-focused, awareness-raising campaign should be started, initially
       focusing on the urban centres of Dakar, Saint-Louis and Kaolack. It would target both
       urban and peri-urban households, highlighting the performance qualities of briquettes
       as well as money savings and the potential long-term benefits in terms of time
       savings and health.
      A stove with a market price of under CFAF 10,000 should be developed for the
       Senegal market. This seems feasible, based on the price of improved stoves suitable
       for briquette use currently being produced in Senegal.
      The main challenges are likely to be (a) maintaining the quality of production
       compared to charcoal and (b) scaling up production to meet potential demand. The
       current supply chain is still fairly informal and only contributes to a very small
       percentage of household cooking usage; further research on a range of briquetting
       technologies is thus needed to ensure which feedstock can be turned into high-
       quality briquettes that meet the requirements of the end users.
      Business and technical capacity building needs to be carried out to support a range
       of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in different regions of Senegal, allowing
       them to set up briquetting production companies.
      Available feedstock for production of briquettes should be mapped out throughout
       Senegal and quality of different feedstock tested relative to charcoal.
      To further support the development of the briquetting sector, the government of
       Senegal must begin to tackle the unregulated and illegal production of charcoal.
      The development of an entire supply chain (or the integration to other supply chains,
       such as that for charcoal) – from the collection and production of the feedstock (such
       as charcoal dust collection) to production, distribution and retailing – offers an
       important opportunity for job creation and income production. The large-scale

   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal              76
       transportation of the briquettes from their place of production, in the areas of
       significant agricultural residue and charcoal production, can be based on the current
       transportation routes used by charcoal.
      The relatively well-developed formal and informal savings and loans systems in
       Dakar could be supported in developing specific loan packages for alternative fuel
       stoves.

In conclusion, if a number of market barriers can be overcome and a positive enabling
environment for briquette production developed – including the development of standards
and quality control, tax incentives, and awareness-raising programmes, as well as a range of
supporting services including appropriate credit and capacity-building support – then a
thriving market chain of briquette producers, distributors and retailers should emerge to
supply the potential significant demand in urban and peri-urban households of Dakar. The
focus group discussions made it clear that briquettes could be perceived as a ‘charcoal-plus’
fuel, in the sense that they are used by households in a similar way to charcoal whilst being
slightly more efficient and cleaner burning, and fairly comparable in terms of price.

8.2 Ethanol in urban Saint-Louis
The findings of this study show a clear degree of potential for the development of an ethanol
market in Saint-Louis. Ethanol use offers households a range of social, economic and health
benefits and provides opportunities for businesses involved in its production.
The development of an initial ethanol market should target existing LPG users and urban
charcoal users who use LPG as a secondary fuel. Most cook with simple stoves, and the
related health issues affect mostly women.
In the Saint-Louis region, briquettes (CFAF 15.1/MJ) remain the least-cost option in terms of
CFAF per MJ, followed by ethanol (CFAF 22.9/MJ) and charcoal used with improved stoves
(CFAF 23–53/MJ).
Assuming that the current price of CFAF 320 per litre does not decrease (this price is
suggested by CSS), and based on results from other studies that show an average
household consuming one litre of ethanol per day, a total of CFAF 9,600 would cover the
monthly cooking fuel expenses for an average urban household. This is in line with the
benchmark of CFAF 10,000 that emerged from discussions with urban households, and
would make ethanol competitive with both LPG and charcoal used with improved stoves.
One of the main barriers to penetration of ethanol is the cost of the stove, which is much
more expensive than either the improved charcoal stove or an average LPG stove. For
example, a subsidised ethanol stove in Mozambique costs US$30 (CFAF 15,000),
approximately two to two-and-a-half times the price of an improved charcoal stove in Saint-
Louis. Any marketing initiative could consider offering the option of a nine-month period to
pay back the loan needed to purchase an ethanol stove. Assuming an interest rate of 18 per
cent, this would result in nine monthly instalments of CFAF 1,794/month, which is in line with
(a) the capacity of low income households and (b) the current practice of micro-financial
institutions in Senegal. Alternatively, bundling of the stove with the sale of ethanol is another
possibility, which would enable payment for the stove in instalments through the purchase of
the fuel.




   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal               77
The recommendations are as follows:
      CSS has expressed an interest in testing this market and particularly in seeing the
       550,000 litres of ‘head ethanol’ commercialised. This means there is potential for
       starting a market for 1,500 households in urban Saint-Louis (at 1 litre per household
       per day).
      Of course, although ethanol is currently fairly competitively priced, a functional supply
       chain needs to be developed. Links with the kerosene and LPG supply chain should
       be considered.
      As ethanol for cooking is almost completely unknown in Saint-Louis, a campaign to
       target urban households should be launched before starting any pilot or
       commercialisation.
      Finally, it is also possible that if ethanol can be produced in sufficiently large
       quantities, and if the price is competitive, it could start to displace or complement
       LPG in other urban areas, including Dakar. However, to make this a reality, a long-
       term development strategy is required, including the establishment by the authorities
       of an attractive framework for the private production of ethanol as a household
       cooking fuel, as well as for suitable stoves and awareness-raising campaigns to
       create the demand from the end users.

8.3 Biogas in rural Kaolack

The study shows that rural Kaolack has the right social and agricultural conditions for the
penetration of biogas technology; however, it still lacks sufficient awareness of the benefits
of the technology to really reach scale. Although the newly-established National Domestic
Biogas Programme aims to promote household use of biogas systems through the provision
of subsidised systems and loans, it is recommended that the government of Senegal support
the development of a range of biogas suppliers in the region that are currently either to (a)
construct the biogas systems or to (b) train the end users to maintain them.
The study shows that:
      There is a good level of awareness around biogas in the Kaolack region, and many
       households are clearly interested in the technology. However, awareness of the
       national biogas programme is lacking, and its benefits are thus not being enjoyed by
       the households for which it was designed.
      If the subsidies and loans were accessed, considering current fuel consumption and
       costs, a 4 m³ biodigester could be paid back in 1-1.3 years. The survey also reveals
       that households in the region are used to accessing both formal and informal loans,
       suggesting the potential for developing a specific microcredit mechanism for
       households willing to purchase biodigesters as well as for entrepreneurs willing to
       invest in biogas.
      There are insufficient biogas technology suppliers in the region, and the few that do
       exist suffer from low profit margins due to weak demand. The main constraint is the
       low purchasing power of the majority of households, coupled with the high up-front
       cost of the technology.




   Baseline and feasibility assessment for alternative cooking fuels in Senegal              78
The recommendations of this study are as follows:
      The National Domestic Biogas Programme should further support the development of
       biogas enterprises in Kaolack, providing a wide range of services from installation to
       maintenance.
      To stimulate demand, the government of Senegal should develop a programme to
       support the development of a range of biogas suppliers in the region. The national
       biogas programme needs to become active at the regional level. Local enterprises
       and micro-finance organisations need to be fully involved so that households can
       access loans and subsidies.

8.4 Pure plant oil in Tambacounda
With the majority of the rural population relying on firewood and most of the urban
households using charcoal for cooking, in Tambacounda there is an immediate need for
action to provide access to sustainable cooking solutions. However, although the region has
the right conditions for PPO production, its application for cooking does not seem to be
feasible. Attempts to use other PPOs besides Jatropha for cooking have also been fairly
unsuccessful. Indeed, as Tambacounda region is well-endowed with biomass resources,
charcoal and firewood are the least-cost options. It is therefore very unlikely that alternative
cooking fuels will displace traditional biomass.
Insights from producers showed that the quality of oil produced was low for various technical
reasons.The prices per megajoule of biomass range from CFAF 5 (for charcoal used in
improved stoves) to CFAF 11.8 (for charcoal used in inefficient stoves), and from CFAF 31.2
to CFAF 38.3/MJ for LPG. PPO obtained from Jatropha is now sold at CFAF 700 per litre, or
CFAF 35.4/MJ. It is therefore very unlikely that the production of PPO will displace traditional
biomass fuels unless they prove to be competitive both in terms of affordability and quality,
particularly from the perspective of emissions and usability. It is also unlikely that the
minority of households using LPG in Tambacounda will shift to Jatropha, again, unless the
economical and cleanliness advantages could be demonstrated.
Although in Tambacounda the survey focused on the feasibility of PPO, results revealed a
clear demand both for biogas (already in use in the region) and briquettes. We thus
recommend further analysis of the feasibility of (a) stimulating demand for these two fuels in
the Tampacounda region and (b) integrating them with similar initiatives, both in other
regions and at the national level.

the four alternative fuels assessed in each of the regions examined in the study.

Table 8.1 Feasibility levels of the four alternative fuels in the four regions
Note: green=high, yellow=medium, red=low

The study demonstrates that (a) not all alternative fuels have an equal potential for
dissemination and uptake in Senegal, and that (b) there is much greater potential for
immediate action and short-term dissemination of briquetting in the urban and peri-urban
areas of Dakar and in rural Kaolack, and of ethanol in urban Saint-Louis.
The conclusions are:
            The penetration of briquettes in Dakar is highly feasible.
            There is a good opportunity for testing ethanol in Saint-Louis, as both supply and
             demand conditions there are ideal.
            The development of a biogas market in rural Kaolack has high potential, but it will
             depend on tailored financing schemes being developed.
            PPO for cooking is not a feasible option in Tambacounda, where further analysis of
             the potential of biogas use should be carried out.
A number of general conclusions can be drawn from the four regional assessments. These
include:
            The geographical location of households (particularly between rural, peri-urban and
             urban areas) as well as their social characteristics (whether they are poor or more
             affluent) has a significant impact on the demand and potential for each of the
             alternative fuels assessed. Because of this variability, any national-level promotion
             plan for each of the four alternative fuels under consideration will need to be carefully
             tailored to meet these differences.
            Many rural households continue to see domestic energy as a free commodity, even if
             they clearly identify smoke and time as serious issues related to their fuel utilisation
             and collection. Before the penetration of alternative fuels can be realistically
             considered, a longer-term strategy – one that focuses on awareness creation and
             supply chains for alternative fuels – would be more appropriate for this section of the
             population.

   Field results show a strong correlation between willingness to pay and awareness of
    alternative fuels. An important recommendation is to develop well-grounded
    marketing campaigns to increase demand for alternative fuels. This will in turn lead to
    the increased willingness of households and small businesses to invest in these fuel
    production technologies and stoves.
   Awareness-raising campaigns and marketing initiatives should focus on the key
    benefits of alternative fuels, in particular the cost savings and time savings (both in
    terms of cooking and collecting firewood) they present, along with the health benefits
    resulting from reduced emissions.

Annex A. Methodology for calculation: prices, efficiency and
calorific values

1. Prices
The prices for firewood and charcoal shown in Table A-1 are extrapolated from the survey
data and expressed in terms of in CFAF/MJ of useful energy. According to the survey, there
are sharp price differences according to region, particularly for firewood and charcoal. All
prices were converted into CFAF/MJ to get the relevant cost comparisons, taking into
consideration (a) calorific value, (b) efficiency of equipment and (c) various assumptions on
the prices depending on the fuels.

Table A-1. Fuel prices in the four regions (CFAF)

LPG prices are fixed. However, there are some minor differences according to region:
       Prices for charcoal briquettes are based on information supplied by Brades. This is
        still a limited market. Assuming large-scale production, detailed calculations need to
        be carried out;
       Currently there is no market either for ethanol as a cooking fuel or for Jatropha oil.
        Prices were obtained from ENDA and the producers. The price of Jatropha was
        estimated at CFAF 700 per litre and ethanol at CFAF 320 per litre.

2. Efficiency
The efficiency figures in Table A-2 are based on the literature for, and consultant experience
with, stove technologies in Senegal in particular and in West Africa in general.
 Type of stove                         Efficiency       Average efficiency
 Three-stone                            10–14%                12%
 Traditional charcoal                   16–20%                18%
 Improved charcoal                      30–34%                32%
 LPG, ethanol, Jatropha PPO             45–55%                50%
Table A-2. Average efficiency of various stove types

For each type of stove there are no differences in energy efficiency across the four regions.

3. Calorific values
The respective average calorific values are as follows:
          Firewood: 18 MJ/kg
          Charcoal: 31 MJ/kg
          LPG: 42.5 MJ/kg
          Briquettes : 31 MJ/kg
          Ethanol: 28 MJ/litre
          Jatropha: 39.5 MJ/litre20
