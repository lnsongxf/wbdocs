                                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Micro, small and medium manufacturing and service enterprises (MSMEs) are an
important instrument of India’s economic development, contributing to upwards of 9
percent of such growth in 2012. Almost 95 percent of businesses in this sector are
micro-enterprises, with manufacturing serving as a dominant industry followed by
service-related enterprises and those engaged in repairs and maintenance. And it is a
largely informal landscape: Nearly 93 percent of enterprises in the MSME sector are
unregistered and about 84 percent of the jobs are in such places.

Although MSMEs are considered to be pro-poor, inclusive and labour intensive models
for economic growth, women’s employment and participation in the sector is low:
Women constitute a fifth of the sector’s total workforce, with female-owned businesses
comprising nearly 14 percent of registered and 9 percent of unregistered MSMEs. Such
enterprises are mostly home-based and smaller, employing fewer workers on average
than businesses owned by men. The largest percentage of women-owned MSMEs is in
the ready-made garment industry, followed by food products and beverages and the
textile industries.

Despite women’s modest participation in the MSME sector, women’s entrepreneurship
is increasingly acknowledged as an important yet untapped source of economic growth.
Indeed, the Government of India has made significant legislative and structural
developments in the MSME sector, including launching schemes to support women.
Donor agencies and civil society organizations have also offered initiatives to promote
women in the workforce. Recognizing women’s potential, it is therefore critical to
understand how to enhance their role not only in MSMEs, but in the economy as a
whole, to ensure that India’s economic progress is inclusive and equitable. To date
however, there has been no systematic study of gender issues in the sector.

The World Bank commissioned the International Center for Research on Women
(ICRW) to address this gap in knowledge. Specifically, ICRW researchers conducted a
qualitative study to assess the nature of women’s participation as entrepreneurs and
employees in India’s MSME sector, identify challenges to their advancement in relation
to existing gender norms, and gauge potential opportunities for women’s economic
growth. ICRW’s findings are expected to inform government policy for strengthening
gender equality and women’s economic empowerment in the MSME sector.

ICRW found that women entrepreneurs’ decision to enter the sector and their growth
trajectory are affected by their access to professional networks and associations, capital
and information, their visibility through registration as well as gender issues around
women’s multiple commitments at home and perceived disadvantages in marketing.
Similarly, the parameters that affect women’s growth as workers include the gender
differentiated jobs and wages women secure, terms of employment that include softer
contracts, working conditions, and benefits and lack of opportunities for enhancing their
skills and advancing their careers.



Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                              10 / 128
We hypothesized that the number of factors that influence the number of women who
participate in MSMEs and the quality of their experience, has an impact on women’s
potential for growth in the sector. Optimal growth can be defined as entrepreneurs
moving their businesses from a micro to a medium endeavour of higher value; and
workers advancing their careers through promotions, higher wages and benefits.

For the study, ICRW collected data through key informant interviews and field visits to
three MSME industries and three Technology Centres throughout India. The industries
were selected based on the level of women’s participation in the cluster, its growth
potential and its location. The clusters included the ready-made garment group in
Ahmedabad, fruit and vegetable processing in Pune and the information technology
hardware and electronics manufacturing cluster in Bangalore. Technology Centres were
selected for their presence in the study clusters or as examples of best practice because of
their strategic overlap with the World Bank’s Technology Center Systems Project
(TCSP), an effort at strengthening and developing financially sustainable Technology
Centres (TCs) in order to enhance the productivity of MSMEs through improved access
to technology, business advisory services as well as skilled workers.

What follows is a highlight of the key findings that emerged from our study of women
entrepreneurs and workers in the MSME sector, as well as from our examination of the
role Technology Centres play in promoting women’s participation in the sector.



Women Entrepreneurs
Women entrepreneurs are less visible: Women entrepreneurs lack visibility in the
sector because many women-owned MSME businesses are in the micro segment, home-
based and less likely to be registered. Unregistered enterprises are unable to benefit from
government schemes, making women-owned enterprises particularly susceptible to
missing out on available government support.

Entrepreneurship Development Programs are underused: Entrepreneurship
Development Programs are offered to promote growth of small and micro
entrepreneurs. Overall, these programs are sought by and have helped women who had
no experience working in businesses of any kind or who lacked business exposure in
their chosen industry. However, there is a paucity of capacity building programs for small
entrepreneurs to grow and expand their enterprises through training in the areas of
leadership and human resource management.

Women’s ability to take risk depends on external support: We found that women
who start on their own take fewer risks and prefer to begin their businesses with low
financial investments. Women entrepreneurs tend to prefer freedom from debt and
perceive it as a positive indicator of business stability. This affects their ability to take
risks. Alternatively, women are willing to take higher risks when they have strong support
from their families or male business partners.



Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                 11 / 128
Securing start-up finance is difficult: Across India, women entrepreneurs have lower
access to finance than male entrepreneurs. While start-up capital was difficult for both
women and men entrepreneurs, prevailing gender realities and gender-biased attitudes of
financial institutions make it more difficult for women to access loans.

Business marketing is a challenge: MSMEs in India, irrespective of ownership, are
characterized by weak marketing. Women entrepreneurs are further handicapped by
resistance from vendors, lack of market knowledge and marketing skills, restricted
mobility and their initial hesitation to engage in spaces traditionally dominated by men.

Uptake of government schemes is not optimal: In our sample, all women
entrepreneurs had availed of some government scheme. However, the lack of awareness
and poor access to networks are big factors in the gap between the presence of schemes
and their uptake, especially for new entrepreneurs. Another major limitation is the
tedious paper work involved in taking advantage of schemes. Although these issues are
faced equally by men and women, existing gender norms, roles and socialization of
women make the challenges they face more pronounced.

Women-owned enterprises that have male support in marketing and finance are
more likely to expand in scale: Women business owners who have a supportive
spouse or male family member are able to grow their enterprise more than those solely
owned and run by women. In such businesses there is a clear gender division of roles
with men being primarily responsible for marketing and accessing finances.

Women have poor access to business networks and associations: For women, poor
access to information can be both the cause and effect of their limited access to
networks. While all micro-entrepreneurs find it difficult to make time to participate in
networks, there are gender specific constraints that disadvantage women more than men.
Typically, associations are male dominated spaces; further, women’s ability to network is
handicapped by their restricted mobility and constraints on time due to handling the dual
responsibilities of business and home. Women also self-censor and thus tend to be less
assertive in reaching out or promoting themselves.



Women Employees
Women workers are mostly in low and unskilled jobs: In all the clusters visited, there
are gender-marked roles for all tasks along the value chain of production. How workers’
abilities are categorized vary across industries, but we found that jobs requiring a lower
skill set were largely performed by women and those requiring a higher skill set by men.
This high presence of women in low-skilled jobs is due to poor education and skills
training among newcomers to the workforce; gender stereotyping of tasks by factory
owners and the workers themselves and the time restrictions of women workers. Women
are constrained for time both because of their dual responsibility and the unwillingness
of factory owners to allow women to do late shifts.



Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                              12 / 128
Women have little presence in managerial and technical positions: There are very
few women in supervisory positions, which typically entail more responsibility, longer
hours and the ability to manage workers. Women are often reluctant to take on this level
of responsibility as they lack confidence and feel additional responsibilities at work will
conflict with their responsibilities at home. Also, women tend to have shorter work
tenures at work due to marriage and children, and companies prefer to hire men who are
more likely to stay longer.

Jobs are stereotyped by gender: Gender-stereotyping of work inhibits women’s
growth potential. Many higher skilled jobs are those that require higher physical effort
and dexterity. Women are known for their dexterity as well yet few women enter these
jobs, which are in traditionally male arenas, largely because the higher skills are associated
with more strenuous work. Excluding women from these skilled jobs also has strategic
advantage for businesses as male workers are able to work longer and more flexible
hours.

Type of recruitments: The pattern of recruitment of workers varies across micro, small
and medium enterprises. In the micro and small units, workers are recruited through
informal networks and there were no differences reported in the recruitment patterns of
men or women. A large proportion of workers in the RMG and FVP clusters were casual
workers with limited or no benefits. The IT Hardware and Electronics Manufacturing
units were all registered enterprises and had formal terms of employment for all
employees in the units.

Most unskilled workers are categorized as “casual labour”: Women, comprising the
bulk of the unskilled labour, tend to be employed under non-contractual arrangements
and do not enjoy worker benefits. Labour laws have induced inflexibility in the clothing
industry, which has led to smaller businesses circumventing these laws. However, some
progressive employers provide benefits informally, which tends to create allegiance
among women workers for those employers.

Wage differences between men and women exist among workers as well as
employees: Wage discrimination is one of the key challenges faced by women workers.
We found that women workers and employees earned less than their male counterparts
for similar jobs. While in some cases differential wages were paid for the same work, in
others women earned less because they were unable to work late shifts and therefore
tended to earn less than their male counterparts.

Proximity, safety and working conditions are important job considerations for
women: Women were more likely to stay in a job where the enterprise owner was female
who took extra care to ensure the women workers’ safety, where there was constant
work and a fair and safe commute. Men were reported to easily change jobs prioritizing
income over other concerns. All units visited across clusters had fair working conditions
for women, but lacked crèche facilities.

Women’s options for upward mobility are limited: Male and female factory floor
workers either come with previous work experience or learn their skills on the job. Even

after many years of experience in a particular task a worker is unlikely to move up the
production chain unless she is proactive about learning new skills. Men tend to be more
ambitious and aspire for more skilled tasks.

Dual responsibilities constrain women’s potential for income growth: Women’s
care responsibilities are one of the major impediments to women’s participation in the
workforce in India. Dual responsibilities and the constraints they place on women’s
personal time often restrict their income growth potential. Constraints on time also are
perhaps one of the primary reasons why women are viewed as less aspirational.

Safety issues may limit women’s potential for growth: While women may have time
constraints that prevent them from staying longer hours, this is coupled with the
reluctance of owners to take the responsibility of keeping women for evening or night
hours due to security concerns. Entrepreneurs acknowledge that women have the
potential to complete any tasks if they have the aspiration and the will power. However,
structural factors of safety and gender expectations make the concerns more complex
beyond personal aspirations.



Technology Centres
For our study, we assessed three Technology Centres (TCs) with an eye to gender-related
challenges and opportunities in an effort to understand the differential constraints
women face in the training and job placements offered through TCs, as well as the policy
implications of these. These centres were set up to make the Indian small enterprises
sector competitive by providing services and trainings. Also known as tool rooms, TCs
offer a few institutionalized long-term courses and various short-term courses in
response to demand from the government, industry or students. Overall, TCs aim to:

        Supply skilled labour to industry through training courses
        Provide consultancy services for MSMEs to improve product quality and
         productivity
        Create tools, dyes and moulds for MSMEs

The three centres included in our study were The Central Tool Room and Training
Center (CTTC) in Bhubaneswar, Orissa; the Indo-German Tool Room (IGTR) in
Ahmedabad, Gujarat; and the Flavours and Fragrance Development Center (FFDC) in
Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh. At each centre, we examined gender participation in trainings by
focusing on the measures in place to ensure women’s participation, the status of
women’s participation, the gendered preferences for courses, and the gender-responsive
provisions of the TCs.

Incentives to ensure women’s participation are limited: TCs take no specific
measures to attract women candidates for long-term courses, and the CTTC and IGTR
do not offer any scholarships for women students. Incentives for women candidates are
available only through a few national and state-level government programs.


Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                            14 / 128
Women’s participation in the training program is less than optimal : Women’s
overall participation in TCs remains low, mostly due to gender stereotyping of jobs and
training courses, the lack of specific marketing to women and the sometimes remote
location of TCs. This low participation is also due in part to a preference by women to
enter the hospitality and retail sectors, which require less training and are perceived as
being more suitable work places for women.

Gendered preference of training courses exists: In engineering-focused TCs there is
gendered preference in course selection. Women are more concentrated in courses such
as engineering design and electronics and less in manufacturing and mechanical courses.
There were no female trainees in machine maintenance courses. The gendered
preference of courses is also due to the fact that jobs are marked by gender stereotypes
as well as women’s unwillingness to take up courses that involve the use of heavy
machinery and physical strength.

Entrepreneurship development is not provided through TCs: TCs by design do not
provide entrepreneurship development training linked to the technical trainings they
offer. This is perhaps one of the reasons why very few trainees launch their own
enterprises. In FFDC for instance, the absence of enterprise development inputs is
particularly conspicuous, since the sponsored programs for technical training are aimed
at entrepreneurship development.

Life skills and gender sensitization training are non-existent: Life skills training and
gender sensitization are not offered through TCs. Such educational opportunities are
especially important for young women who often lack the communication skills
necessary to successfully navigate the workplace and who feel less confident about taking
jobs far from their hometowns.

Location and infrastructure of TCs can be a barrier: Institutes like FFDC that are
located in remote geographical locations and have limited facilities like safe transport,
accessible markets, schooling for children and recreational activities within the campus
can be restrictive for women. Women are less likely to enrol in such centres.

Few women faculty members: The presence of women administrative staff and faculty
was low to minimal at all three TCs we visited. Fewer women faculty was explained by
gender-specific reasons, such as a shortage of qualified women candidates and the
shorter tenures of women staff due to marriage and related reasons. The remote location
of the FFDC serves as a further disincentive for women staff and faculty.

Limited job placement for women trainees is affected by gender specific factors:
In all three TCs, job placements were offered only for the long-term courses and
placement rates for women in engineering-focused centres were low. Women were
considered unsuitable for manufacturing jobs due to the physicality of the jobs and the
multiple shifts required of staff members. The perception amongst the TC faculty and
women trainees was that women were better suited to design jobs where they have
limited interaction with male staff and work at a desk instead of on a shop floor. Also,
we found that companies prefer women for these jobs as they feel women are more

patient, can sit for long hours and can do more intricate work. On the supply side,
women trainees are hesitant to take up placement offers in distant places.

TCs are not required to place trainees in MSMEs: The TCs do not have a mandate
for placing their trainees in the MSMEs and students prefer placements in large
companies. In addition to salary considerations, larger companies are able to provide
better working conditions for women employees compared to small firms.



Recommendations
ICRW’s study highlights that gender norms and stereotypes cut across many of the
challenges women entrepreneurs and women workers face in the MSME sector in India.
These concerns underscore the critical need to integrate gender training with
entrepreneurial training and provide gender sensitization of facilitation institutions and
membership to associations at all levels. In addition, institutions that promote women’s
entrepreneurship – and women themselves – must be challenged to negotiate new
boundaries in terms of women’s roles, expectations from them, their leadership and
management styles and the way they can access credit, schemes and links with markets
and business networks.

Based on our findings, we discuss below several recommendations that can accelerate
women’s presence and progress in the MSME sector; foster a more accessible, equitable
labour force; and ultimately, contribute significantly to India’s economic development.

Women Entrepreneurs

        Mechanisms need to be put in place to enable more systematic collection
         of gender-disaggregated data on the critical parameters informing the growth
         and development of the MSME sector. Currently the paucity of this data
         prevents any comprehensive analysis of gender issues in this sector. MSME
         census can provide a more detailed segment for women entrepreneurs and
         workers as a separate component.

     Create incentives to encourage the registration of micro and small
      enterprises, as well as map ownership by gender for both registered and
      non-registered enterprises. This will aid in increasing the visibility and
      credibility of women-owned enterprises.

     Enhance the outreach, monitor the uptake and redesign the underutilized
      schemes to foster the growth among micro- and home-based businesses, which
      in turn will enhance women’s participation in MSMEs.

     Provide gender trainings relevant to the MSME for men and women in
      Entrepreneurship Development Institutes of the Government and Technology
      Centres. All trainings should focus on gender biases that pervade the market

         place and its implications for entrepreneurship development and employment
         among women

     Provide Entrepreneurship Development alongside technical trainings,
      especially for women, with an emphasis on equipping them with leadership,
      market and finance skills.

     Set up portals that provide information about various business development
      service providers as women lack professional networks to access such
      information.

     Sensitize financial institutions to government policies for credit for women
      and to the barriers women face in MSME sector in accessing finance. This
      will ease women’s to access to credit through the existing provision of the
      government.

     Design financial products to reach out to the smallest and least visible
      businesses. Such products also should be amenable to women’s limited
      resources and their scale of operation.

     Increase women’s participation in professional networks through setting
      up MSME-focused associations, especially where micro and unregistered
      businesses are the norm

     Establish more women-only entrepreneur associations and encourage
      existing industry associations to enhance membership of, and services to, women
      entrepreneurs in the constituencies they serve.

     Expand district level associations to make them more women inclusive.
      This will be useful especially given the high proportion of rural entrepreneurs.

     Design Cluster Development Programs in a way that clusters and their
      services cater to the context specific needs of the women entrepreneurs in the
      area. Flexibility in approach and conceptualisation of clusters will be required to
      better meet the needs of women entrepreneurs. Cluster Development Programs
      can be effective in enhancing the market linkage and providing business relevant
      services to women entrepreneurs.

Workers

     Create opportunities locally and nationally that build the basic job skills
      for women workers who come with little education. Acquiring minimal skill
      prior to them securing employment will enhance their earning potential

     Industries in the MSME sector need to monitor the effectiveness of
      workplace policies and benefits for women. This will help improve the terms
      of employment for women workers, especially those who are considered
      unskilled

     Provide life skills training on the job or through skills training institutes to
      women workers and employees to build their self-efficacy, negotiate gender
      constraints, improve their communication and comprehension to follow complex
      tasks and manage their time and problems effectively. This will impact their work
      productivity and help them advance in their jobs.

     Create regulatory mechanisms and incentive-based frameworks for
      unregistered enterprises to ensure that women are provided with benefits and
      basic amenities.

     Incentivize businesses to enhance women’s presence in jobs that require
      diverse skills. The enactment of the Companies Act and available Corporate
      Social Responsibility mandate are opportunities that can be creatively used to
      enhance women’s participation in the workforce.


Technology Centres (TC)

     Provide financial incentives for women to enrol in long-term training
      courses provided by TCs. This will not only challenge the gender norms related
      to skills and jobs, but also will spur a more effective supply of technically trained
      women.

     Improve infrastructure and amenities to be more attractive to women in
      residential courses, and to boost women’s enrolment.

     In order to enhance participation, target women candidates through
      linkages with institutions of higher learning, the National Skill Development
      Council, and civil society organizations working with young girls and women.

     Locate TCs in relevant industry clusters to enhance the availability of well-
      suited jobs for locally trained women.

     Provide post-placement support to encourage more women to accept work in
      distant places.

     Provide comprehensive gender sensitive and other trainings to men,
      women, students and faculty to challenge existing gender-based stereotypes that
      restrict women’s job opportunities and growth. This should include life skills
      programs to build women’s abilities to negotiate the gender boundaries they face.

                                              INTRODUCTION

MSMEs1 are an important instrument of growth for India’s economy. The contribution
of the MSME sector to India’s GDP was estimated to be around 8-9 per cent in 2012
after agriculture; MSMEs have emerged as the second largest source of employment in
India. Although MSMEs are considered to be pro-poor, inclusive and labour intensive
models for economic growth, women’s employment and participation in the MSMEs
continues to remain low. Women’s entrepreneurship on the other hand has been
increasingly acknowledged as an important yet untapped source of economic growth.2
However under-represented, women entrepreneurs contribute to the economy as they
create new jobs for themselves as also for others, as well as contribute to the economic
well-being of the family, poverty reduction and women’s empowerment3. For growth to
be inclusive and equitable, it is critical to understand how to enhance the role of women
in the economy and in particular in the MSME sector. Although the MSME sector in
India has been researched and evaluated from a financial point of view, there has been
no systematic study of gender issues in this sector.

In order to fill this gap, the World Bank has commissioned International Centre for
Research on Women (ICRW), Asia Regional Office, New Delhi to conduct a short, field
based assessment of ‘Gender Issues in MSMEs in India.’ The study involved field-
based assessment of gender related issues in select MSME clusters to identify challenges
and opportunities for inclusion of women in higher numbers and at higher levels of
growth in the MSME sector. The study findings will ultimately be operationalized into a
Bank-supported MSME project in India and help inform Government of India policy on
more inclusive growth of the MSME sector, especially towards strengthening gender
equality and economic empowerment of women in the sector.

Objective of study

The study on Gender Issues in MSMEs in India will produce an overview and analysis of
the key gender issues in the MSME sector, with a focus on selected MSME clusters. It
will identify key issues related to women’s ownership of and employment in MSMEs,
female labour force participation, wages and working conditions, employability and skill
building, enterprise development and access to credit, and markets.


1MSMEs    are classified into micro, small and medium manufacturing and service enterprises based on size of
investment in plant and machinery. The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, passed in 2006 in
India, identifies a micro enterprise as one “where the investment in plant and machinery does not exceed twenty five
lakh rupees”; a small enterprise as one “where the investment in plant and machinery is more than twenty five lakh
rupees but does not exceed five crore rupees”; and a medium enterprise as one “where the investment in plant and
machinery is more than five crore rupees but does not exceed ten ” (The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
Development Act, 2006, found at http://www.and.nic.in/C_charter/indust/msmeact2006.pdf).

The specific objectives are:

        Identification and assessment of key gender issues in labour force participation,
         employment and employability, entrepreneurship development and women’s
         economic empowerment, as well as constraints and priorities in the context of
         MSMEs and Technology Centres in India through a review of secondary
         literature and national polices
        Mapping of relevant public policies, institutional mandates, and government
         schemes promoting women’s employment and entrepreneurship in MSMEs and
         Technology Centres, and identification of areas that need strengthening.
        Stocktaking of gender dimensions of strategies and programs of donor agencies
         such as UNIDO, UNDP, DFID, ADB, GIZ etc. in the MSME and Technology
         Centres. To review about half a dozen of such interventions to profile and
         highlight salient features of the intervention.
        Highlight perceived successful examples and innovations by NGOs, private
         sector and MSME industry associations promoting better gender outcomes in
         MSMEs.
        Assessment of women’s employment and entrepreneurship issues and constraints
         (e.g., employment, entrepreneurship, credit, vocational skills and
         entrepreneurship training, gender sensitive HR practices and welfare services,
         personal security, etc.) in select MSME clusters and Technology Centres.
        Identification of potential opportunities and specific interventions and for
         improving gender outcomes in MSMEs and Technology Centres in India.


Research Questions and Framework

Given that this is an exploratory study we have kept the scope of the study small and
manageable with an emphasis on addressing the gaps we find in existing evidence. The
objective of the study is to understand the status of women’s participation in the MSME
sector and the potential opportunities for their growth. Our understanding is that women
may be in particular industries owing to demand and supply side factors that determine
and regulate their employment and entrepreneurship in the sector. This study will try to
understand these factors and how they influence women’s participation and growth in
the MSME sector. The study aims to answer the following three research questions:


1. What is the status of women’s employment and entrepreneurship in the MSME sector (i.e. what
   proportion of workers or owners are women and what are the patterns of work or entrepreneurship
   vis-à-vis men)?

2. What is the growth potential for women in this sector (i.e. are there distinct pathways for
   advancement and what are the enabling factors)?

3. What are the challenges that women face in their advancement as employees or entrepreneurs, and
   how do these challenges operate and interact with existing gender norms?

Overall Methodology

The study is a qualitative research study involving the collection of both primary and
secondary data. The data collection for the study was done through a review of literature
and secondary data, key informant interviews and field visits to three MSME clusters and
Technology Centres. More specifically the study entailed the following:

        Literature review: Review of relevant literature on women’s participation in
         MSME sector, government policies and programs, and donor and civil society
         initiatives for women in the MSME sector; and analysis of secondary data where
         available.
        Key informant interviews: The ICRW research team interviewed relevant
         government and non-government stakeholders and experts at the national level
         as well as from states where the field visits were conducted to better understand
         the initiatives and approaches to promote women’s participation in the MSME
         sector in India. For this see Appendix A.
        Field-based assessment: We made field visits to three clusters and three
         technology centres to understand first-hand the opportunities and constraints
         pertaining to women’s participation in the MSME sector both as entrepreneurs
         and employees. The visit entailed a study of three to four women-owned
         enterprises and one to two men-owned enterprises. We conducted in-depth
         interviews with entrepreneurs and employees as well as a few interviews and
         focused group discussions with workers. A transect walk was conducted through
         each unit to better understand their facilities and working conditions. We also
         interviewed all stakeholders related to the clusters and technology centres. The
         process of selection of the clusters is detailed in the following sub-section.


Selection of clusters

The selection of clusters was a multi-step process (see Figure 1). Given that it was a small
study and sample, we adopted a few key criteria to focus on clusters that would
adequately represent the issues identified above.
Selection of enterprise by size: We decided to focus on micro and small enterprises
as they constitute the larger segments of the MSME sector of the 15.64 lakhs registered
MSMEs 99.83 percent are Micro (70.19 %) and Small (25.17 %) enterprises employing
95.36 percent of workers.
Selection of sub-sector: We chose to keep the focus on the manufacturing and service
sectors based on their share in the MSME sector. Manufacturing comprises 67.1 percent
of the MSMEs and the service sector comprises 16.78 percent of the MSMEs, repair and
maintenance constitute 16.13 percent of the MSMEs.
The selection of industry/cluster: The selection of industries and in turn clusters is
based on two main criteria outlined below. Based on these criteria as well as availability
of information and ease of access to the cluster, the selected industries and clusters
mentioned below have been identified.

     1. Industries that have the highest percentage presence of women entrepreneurs and workers. Based
        on the MSME census these are :
             a. Textile and wearing apparel (Ahmedabad Readymade Garment
                 Cluster). 48.02 percent of women-owned enterprises are in textile and
                 wearing apparel.4
             b. Food processing (Pune Food Processing Cluster). 9.8 percent of the
                 women- owned MSMEs are in this industry.

     2. A non-traditional, skill-intensive and high growth industry and has potential for increased
        participation of women workers and entrepreneurs
             a. Information Technology Hardware and Electronics (Bengaluru)


Technology Centres

As part of the study we also visited three technology centres. The centres were chosen
either as examples of best practice, because of their strategic overlap with the World
Bank’s TCSP for internal learning and application or their presence in our study clusters.
These centres are:
     1. Central Technology and Training Center, Bhubaneswar, Orissa
     2. Indo-German Tool Room, Ahmedabad, Gujarat
     3. Flavours and Fragrance Development Centre, Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh

Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                           24 / 128
Framework for Analysis

The cluster and industry overview provides an indication that MSMEs are significant in
their presence and have a high potential for women’s participation both as entrepreneurs
and employees. The objective of this study is to explore and understand the status of
women as entrepreneurs and workers in the MSME sector and the constraints and
opportunities for their growth.

Based on a review of literature, we have conceptually hypothesized that growth is a
longer term impact outcome that is affected by a range of intermediary factors. Coad and
Tamwada document that small enterprises managed by women have lower expected
growth rates because of conservative social attitudes towards women in traditionally male
dominated arenas, and/or because female entrepreneurs are expected to be less
ambitious in terms of growth targets and more concerned with earning just enough to
provide for their families5. Additional evidence suggests that women entrepreneurs in
India do face several societal and systemic barriers that affect their entry and growth into
sectors. The barriers include limited access to finance, information, productive
resources, technology, education and relevant technical and managerial skills 6. Societal
constraints and household responsibilities make them more risk averse and affect their
self-confidence.7

Access to formal finance is a key barrier to the growth of women-owned businesses,
leading to over 90 percent of finance requirements being met through informal sources.8
Although the financing needs for women-owned enterprises are not radically different
from the needs of male-owned enterprises, the level of financial exclusion is higher due
to a combination of factors. The social status of women and prevalent social norms
influence perceptions of financial institutions about women’s ability to repay loans and
run successful growth-oriented businesses. Moreover, most women entrepreneurs are
not aware of government schemes and programs, funding agencies, grants, loans and
certification procedures9.

Women entrepreneurs also lack both formal and informal networks to access key
information about credit, products and markets. Women entrepreneurs’ networks act as
important sources of information and as a very valuable mechanism for business
promotion and information exchange. 10 Shah also suggests that for setting up an
enterprise most women receive financial and other kinds of support from informal
sources, in particular husbands, while a very small proportion access government
schemes and programs.

For women as entrepreneurs, the decision to enter the sector and then the subsequent
pathways to growth are thus affected by

        Access to networks/associations: This is important because critical
         information about the business and markets is shared through associations and
         also through informal networks of business people.
        Access to capital: Many small or micro sized enterprises remain that size or do
         not aspire to grow because of the problems with easy access to capital as well as
         the fear to undertake loans that require a lot of administrative work.
        Access to information: Information about markets, product innovations and
         schemes are shared through networks and associations which women lack.
        Visibility through registration: Many women’s enterprises are survival and
         distress driven and thus remain micro or small in size, largely unregistered and
         thus invisible for policy outreach.

Likewise the study also focuses on women as workers, i.e. their participation and growth
in the labour force. Similarly, their decision to enter the workforce and their subsequent
advancement in their work is affected by a range of factors. These include women’s care
responsibilities, and macro level gender inequality measured as wage discrimination and
barriers to entry into preferred jobs. 11 Gender typecasting of jobs appropriate for
women also impacts the levels where women enter the labour force and their subsequent
advancement. Lack of adequate skills is one of the major impediments affecting women’s
participation in the workforce, particularly in the secondary and tertiary sectors,
perpetuating their concentration in low paid and unorganized sectors. 12 Furthermore,
women workers in the unorganized sector particularly are faced with low wages by doing
piece work; inappropriate working conditions; an absence of social security, maternity
benefits and sexual harassment provisions; decline in the number of work days available;
and conversion to casual and temporary status13.

Thus, the parameters that affect women’s growth as workers in the labour force can be
conceptually categorized as

        Type of work and wages: Gender stereotyping about the roles appropriate for
         women and the fact that women often enter work with low skills suggests that
         most of the women workers are in low skilled jobs with lower wages, and higher
         skill jobs are deemed more appropriate for men. This sustains the gender wage
         differentials and also affects the ability of women to advance from low skilled to
         higher skilled jobs.
        Terms of employment: Women are often found in larger numbers in informal
         employment as casual and non-contractual labour.
        Working conditions and benefits: Women workers, particularly informally
         employed, often face adverse conditions at work in terms of long working hours,
         inadequate leave and maternity benefits, absence of crèche services, and no
         medical insurance or provident fund.
        Opportunities for skill up-gradation and advancement: Gender stereotyping
         of womens’ roles in the value chain, low level of skills of women at entry into
         workforce, combined with the adverse conditions of work limit their own ability
         to advance their skills and the employer’s desire to offer opportunities for skill
         up-gradation. This affects women advancement at the workplace.

Our hypothesis is that if women’s participation not in sheer numbers alone but also in its
qualitative aspects, is optimized, then the potential for growth would be optimized. For
both women entrepreneurs and workers there are some growth parameters that need to
be impacted in order to trigger a pathway to optimal growth. Optimal growth is defined
specifically for women entrepreneurs, in terms of higher value business and a move from
micro to medium, and for women workers in terms of skills for advancement,
promotions, higher wages and benefits (see Figure 2).

In Figure 2 below, the conceptual framework also identifies a gender bubble, above the
two boxes on factors that affect both women workers and entrepreneurs and their
growth in the MSME sector. The gender bubble or lens identifies factors that
differentially affect women’s growth both as workers and as entrepreneurs. The MSME
specific parameters that affect growth may be as such gender neutral, but in interaction
with the gender lens they amplify and differentiate the effects on women entrepreneurs
and workers compared with men entrepreneurs and workers. While we have not studied
male entrepreneurs and workers due to the small scale of the study, unless we met them
opportunistically, we have assessed the quantitative and qualitative aspects of growth
from a gender lens, that is, whether these issues uniquely affect women, differentially
affect women and/or are gender neutral.

                               OVERVIEW OF THE MSME SECTOR

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have emerged as an important
instrument of India’s economic growth over the last five decades. 14 The sector
contributed eight percent of the country’s GDP in 2007-200815. Further, this sector has
consistently registered a higher growth rate than the rest of the industrial sector. MSMEs
are credited with generating the highest rates of employment growth and account for a
major share of industrial production and exports. The highly innovative and high growth
MSME sectors are textiles and garments, leather and leather products, auto components,
drugs and pharmaceuticals, food processing, IT hardware and electronics, paper,
chemicals and petrochemicals, telecom equipment, etc. MSMEs are also complementary
to large industries as ancillary units. 16

Of the 214.38 lacs MSMEs in India, only 15.64 lacs (7.29%) are in the registered segment
and the rest (92.7%) are in the unregistered segment. 18 In keeping with its largely
informal nature, 84.14 percent of MSME sector jobs are in unregistered enterprises,
which account for 72 percent of all manufacturing jobs and a huge 95.4 percent of all
MSME service sector jobs.
Most enterprises in the MSME sector are micro enterprises. According to the Fourth All
India Census of registered MSMEs (2006-07) 19 , 94.9 percent enterprises are micro
enterprises, 4.9 percent are small and 0.2 medium enterprises. Employment across
MSMEs has a similar distribution by size with 70.2 percent of total employment in
MSMEs in micro enterprises, followed by 25.2 percent in small and 4.6 percent in
medium enterprises. Industry-wise distribution of MSMEs shows that 67.10 percent of

18 The NCEUS defines an enterprise in the unorganized sector as enterprise employing less than 10 workers (GoI

2010). These enterprises are typically established through own funds or funds obtained through non-institutional
sources, they lack managerial bandwidth, do not have established channels for marketing and are centered on a single
traditional technology.
19 Throughout this section when we say MSMEs we are referring to registered MSMEs, unless otherwise specified.




Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                                         28 / 128
MSMEs are manufacturing enterprises, 16.78 percent are service enterprises and 16.13
percent are repair and maintenance enterprises.
A little less than half of all registered MSMEs operate in rural areas (45.23 %). Almost all
enterprises (96.81 %) are found to be operating perennially whereas the share of
enterprises running seasonally and casually is 3.19 percent. The state-wise distribution of
MSMEs show that more than 55 percent of these enterprises are in the six states of Uttar
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.
Where participation of different social groups is concerned, as per the Fourth Census
2006-07, 7.60 percent of the enterprises are owned by Scheduled Caste (SC)
entrepreneurs, 2.87 percent by Scheduled Tribe (ST) entrepreneurs and 38.28 percent by
entrepreneurs from Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Thus, 48.75 percent of the
registered working MSMEs are owned by socially backward classes. However, gender
distribution in the MSME sector does not demonstrate such an inclusive picture.



Women in the MSME sector

Women participate in the MSME sector as entrepreneurs, managers and workers. In this
section we discuss the nature of women’s participation at these three levels.

Women Entrepreneurs

Women-owned enterprises constitute a small proportion of enterprises in the MSME
sector. According to the Fourth MSME Census 2006-2007, 13.7 percent of registered
MSMEs and 9.1 percent of unregistered MSMEs are owned by women20. Incidentally
13.7 percent of registered MSMEs and 9.1 percent of unregistered MSMEs are also
actually managed by women. Gender disaggregated data by size of enterprise shows that
women’s ownership is the highest in the case of micro enterprises, followed by small and
then medium enterprises (Table 2).

20 An enterprise (manufacturing or services) managed by one or more women entrepreneurs in proprietary concerns,
or in which she/ they individually or jointly have a share capital of not less than 51 as partners/shareholders/directors
of a private limited company/members of a co-operative society is called a ‘woman enterprise’.

Female-owned and female-managed enterprises tend to be significantly smaller in terms
of average number of employees than their male-owned and male-managed
counterparts. 22 Most female owned enterprises are home-based. Owner-operated
enterprises have no hired workers and are run by self with or without the help of unpaid
family members. The proportion of owner-operated enterprises among women is much
higher compared to their male counterparts23 (Table 3).

Gender disaggregated data across different sectors reveals that the share of women
owned MSMEs is the largest in the services sector followed by manufacturing and then
repair and maintenance (Table 5).

continue to operate trades traditionally considered to be the domain of women. As

found to be higher in rural than in urban areas.27

The states with the highest percentage of women owned MSMEs are Manipur, Mizoram,
Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in rural areas, and in urban areas Jammu and
Kashmir, Mizoram and Meghalaya (Table 7). These high proportions in North Eastern
states and Kerala are perhaps a reflection of the more egalitarian traditions in ownership
of property due to matrilineal traditions of these regions.28

The gender-caste overlap indicates that the share of female-owned and female-managed
enterprises is significantly greater among SC-ST-owned enterprises than those owned by
others, and especially by Hindu upper-castes (Table 8). This may reflect historical taboos
on upper-caste women, which were absent for lower-caste women, on entry into public
arenas of economic production.29

Women Workers

Women constitute a fifth of the total workforce in the MSME sector. According to the
Fourth MSME Census 2006-07, the rate of women’s employment in registered MSMEs
is 20.45 percent and that in unregistered enterprises is 13.02 percent 30 . Gender
disaggregated data across MSMEs shows that women’s employment like ownership is the
highest in the case of micro enterprises, followed by small and then medium enterprises
(Table 9).

Gender disaggregated data across different sectors reveals that the rate of female
employment is the highest in manufacturing MSMEs, followed by MSMEs in the
services sector and then those in repair and maintenance (Table 10).

Profiles of National Policies and Schemes for Women in MSME’s in India

In the last decade there have been significant legislative and structural developments in the
MSME sector in recognition of the economic potential of the sector especially in terms of its
contribution to manufacturing, employment generation and GDP. The MSMED Act was
established in 2006 34 which not only introduced the definition of medium enterprise but
significantly broadened the definitions and coverage of the micro and small enterprises industry
to include both the manufacturing and services sector. Subsequent to the enactment MSMED
Act 2006, the Ministry of Agro and Rural Industries and Ministry of Small Scale Industries were
merged into the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).

The increased importance of the sector was also marked by the setting up of the Prime Minister’s
Task Force in 2009, to identify issues inhibiting growth of the sector35. In 2011, the Planning
Commission constituted a Working Group on MSMEs Growth for the 12th Five Year Plan
(2012-17). The terms of reference of the Group were to carry forward recommendations of the
Prime Minister’s Task Force and to suggest a specific action plan and milestones to be achieved
within the 12th Plan period. Further, the terms of reference also mandated suggestions to address

problems of the unorganized sector and proposals for devising programmes/schemes to facilitate
overall growth of the MSME sector.

These structural and legislative developments have been accompanied by significant policy shifts
aimed at largely strengthening the growth potential of the sector and making it more inclusive.
The primary responsibility of promotion and development of MSMEs lies with the state
governments. However, the Government of India supplements the efforts of the state
governments through various initiatives. The role of the Ministry of MSME and its organizations
is to assist the state governments in their efforts to encourage entrepreneurship, employment and
livelihood opportunities, as well as to enhance the competitiveness of MSMEs in the changed
economic scenario. The MSME ministry is charged with assisting MSMEs to scale up, design
policies and facilitate the implementation and monitoring of schemes and programs. In addition
to the MSME ministry, most industry–specific ministries also have schemes and policies to
support the MSME units in their sector.

These larger changes and accompanying policy shifts acknowledge the contribution of women in
the sector and recognize the need to strengthen the participation of women. The extent to which
the recognition of the potential of women entrepreneurs and workers has resulted in effective
measures is yet to be assessed. In our review we find that the Government of India schemes
across ministries fall into two broad categories- ‘women-specific’ and ‘women-inclusive’. The first
category includes only those schemes that are exclusively meant for women. We find that women
specific schemes are highly limited in number and have their origin in the policies meant for the
erstwhile small scale industries and not in the recent policies of the MSME sector.

There are only two women specific schemes from the MSME ministry both of which are carrying
–over from the Small Scale Industries era. See Box 1.



                   Box 1: Women – Specific Schemes of the MSME Ministry

         1.   Mahila Coir Yojana: The Mahila Coir Yojana is a self-employment scheme in place since
              1994. The main objective of the scheme is to provide self-employment to rural artisans,
              enable them to get better returns and reduce the drudgery involved in traditional spinning
              methods. The scheme provides motorized ratts/ motorized traditional ratts to women
              artisans at 75% subsidized rate after providing them the necessary skill in its operation
              through field level training.

         2.   Trade Related Entrepreneurship Assistance and Development (TREAD): The
              TREAD programme launched in 1998, aims at the economic empowerment of women
              through the development of their entrepreneurial skills in non-farm activities. The
              Government grants up to 30% of the total project cost with the remaining 70% of the
              project cost being financed through a loan. In addition, the government grants up to Rs.1
              lakh per programme to training institutions/NGOs for imparting training to the women
              entrepreneurs.




The women-inclusive schemes of the MSME ministry follow from the new policy directives of
the MSME Ministry and include schemes where women (along with other vulnerable groups like
SC, STs and persons with disabilities) are provided higher benefits/concessions/ assistance than
‘general’ beneficiaries. The more noteworthy women-inclusive schemes mainly provide support
and assistance in three broad areas-credit, handholding and marketing (See Box 2).

Besides women inclusive schemes, one of the MSME Ministry’s main areas of emphasis in
strengthening women’s participation has been on providing long and short term
Entrepreneurship Development Programs for first generation women entrepreneurs. Women
participants are given financial incentives such as fee waiver sand/or stipends for attending the
trainings. The Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE) in Guwahati, the National Institute for
Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD) in NOIDA, National Institute
for MSME (NI-MSME) in Hyderabad and the National Small Industries Corporations serve as
the nodal agencies for providing these trainings and programs. For 2012-2013 a total of 45,371
women had been trained by these institutes. The EDPs include trainings of various kinds
including entrepreneurial skills, management, trade specific and technical skills. In order to avail
of credit and technical support schemes of the ministry, it is mandatory for a first time woman
entrepreneur to undertake one or the other programs offered by these institutes.

Besides MoMSME, scheme-based provisions for women-owned MSMEs are also available
through other government bodies and ministries. For example in the RMG cluster in
Ahmedabad and the FPI cluster in Pune, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC)
support women entrepreneurs in MSMEs to market their products in national fairs. In the IT
and ESDM cluster in Bengaluru, Visvesvaraya Trade Promotion Center, a body of the
Government of Karnataka (VTPC) focused on developing the export market for the industries in
Karnataka provides special concessions for women-owned enterprises when they choose to
participate in international trade fairs.

Women-inclusive provisions may be available from industry-specific ministries. For instance the
working group on FPI for the 12th Five Year Plan recommended ensuring and enhancing the
existing coverage of food processing schemes for Women and SHGs as measures of/for
inclusive growth. Most schemes of the Food Processing Industry are now implemented under
the National Mission for Food Processing. In the capacity building and training components
there are concessionary provisions for women participants.

                  Box 2: Women Inclusive Schemes of the Ministry of MSME36

    Credit Assistance

         Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme: The objective of the scheme is to
         generate employment opportunities in rural and urban areas by setting up new micro
         enterprises and increasing the wage earning capacity of artisans. Relaxation is provided to
         women beneficiaries under the scheme in the following manner. i) The margin money subsidy is
         provided at the rate of 25 % of the project cost for women in urban areas and at 35 per cent for
         women in rural areas. For the general category it is 15 % and 25% respectively; ii) In case of
         women entrepreneurs, the beneficiary’s contribution is 5 per cent of the project cost wh ile in the
         case of others it is 10 %; iii) Bank finance in the form of loans is 95 % of the project cost in case
         of women and other weaker section borrowers and 90 % of the project cost in case of others.

         Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme (CLCSS): The scheme aims at facilitating technology
         up gradation by providing 15 % upfront capital subsidy. In the scheme priority shall be given to
         women entrepreneurs.

         Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGFTMSE) : Set up by
         Government of India and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), the trust fund is
         meant to facilitate the availability of credit without collateral and third party guarantee up to a
         maximum of Rs.100 lakh for Micro and Small enterprises. In case the borrower fails to pay back
         the lending institution, CGFT will pay back to the lending institution up to 75% of the borrowed
         amount for general beneficiaries and 80% for women entrepreneurs.


    Handholding Support

         Rajiv Gandhi Udyami Mitra Yojana (RGUMY): The objective of the scheme is to provide
         handholding support and assistance to the potential first generation entrepreneurs. Both through
         lead organisations known as ‘Udyami Mitras’ and ‘Udyami Helpline’ (a Call Centre for MSMEs),
         first time entrepreneurs are supported with legal, technical and procedural matters, including
         guidance and information on the establishment and management of the new enterprises. Under
         this scheme urban and rural women are provided margin money subsidy at the rate of 25% and
         35% respectively; the rate for general beneficiaries is 15% and 25% respectively. In addition while
         the beneficiary contribution is 10% for general candidates its 5% for women candidates.

    Marketing and Technology Assistance

         International Cooperation Development Scheme: The important objectives of the scheme are
         technology infusion and/ or up gradation of Indian Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
         (MSMEs), modernization and promotion of their exports. Under the scheme, many MSMEs are
         facilitated to participate in international exhibitions, trade fairs and buyer-seller meets abroad.
         Women entrepreneurs are encouraged to participate in these fairs and 90-95% of their costs for
         space and travel are borne by the Ministry through this scheme.

         Market Assistance Scheme: The scheme provides marketing support to Micro, Small &
         Medium Enterprises through National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) to enhance
         competitiveness and marketability of their products by organizing International Technology
         Exhibitions in foreign countries and promote participation in International Exhibitions/Trade
         Fairs among other things. For women entrepreneurs 95% of the costs are borne by the Ministry of
         MSME as against 75% to 85% of the costs for general category participants.

     Cluster Development Support
            MSME Cluster Development Scheme: The MSME Ministry’s Cluster Development
          Programme aims at the holistic and integrated development of micro and small enterprises in

          and infrastructure up gradation. The contribution of the government for these interventions
          varies between 30-80% of the total project cost. However, in the case of clusters where women

          own more             Sector
                        than 50%      in India
                                  of the  enterprises, the contribution of the M/o MSME can be up to 90% of      38 / 128
          the project cost.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development also has a few schemes that are more focused
on self-employment and income generation but can also indirectly promote entrepreneurship.
However most of the measures of the MWCD are administered through support organisations,
are low in scale and promotes SHG-based collective entrepreneurships.

The most noteworthy programme of MWCD is the Support to Training and Employment
Programme for Women (STEP). Launched in 1986, it aims to increase the self-reliance and
autonomy of women by enhancing their productivity and enabling them to take up income-
generating activities. It provides training for skill up gradation to poor and asset-less women in
the traditional sector viz. agriculture, animal husbandry, dairying, fisheries, handlooms,
handicrafts, khadi and village industries, sericulture, social forestry and wasteland development. It
aims to promote both wage and self-employment. The sequence of activities envisaged is one of
mobilizing women into viable groups, improving their skills, arranging for productive assets/
access to wage employment, creating backward and forward linkages, improving/arranging for
support services, providing access to credit, generating awareness on gender issues and nutrition;
the scheme also aims to sensitize project functionaries.1

What is less explored and bears the potential of providing the needed fillip to promoting
women’s employment and entrepreneurship is the new strategy of the National Mission for
Empowerment of Women for enhancing their economic empowerment. Included among its
strategies are i) the strengthening of women’s access to easy credit in rural sector; ii)revamping
Rashtriya Mahila Kosh and giving it the status of a non-banking financial institution and
increasing its corpus; iii) evolving long term strategy to provide skills and capacity building of
women to provide them security against global meltdowns and equip them to seek out
employment opportunities in the era of globalization; iv) providing support for enhancing
women’s rights to land ownership and providing infrastructure support for women farmers and
iv) to bring women under financial inclusion.

The extent to which the measures of the MoMSME Ministry and other government bodies
address the needs of women and strengthens their participation is not fully known. A more
recent assessment suggests that provision of schemes for women in the MSME sector has been
found to be inadequate, including an inadequacy in the gender budget of the Ministry of MSME,
which for 2012-2103 comprised 15% of the total plan outlay of the ministry.37 As our analysis
suggests, while the availability of schemes and programs for women may be inadequate, it’s the
processes and procedures involved in accessing and availing them that face the greatest barriers.
The barriers are largely hinged on gender-based roles and expectations that impose limits on
women and their ability to take advantage of available opportunities. In the absence of gender
assessment and analysis of the available schemes and their reach to women, one is unable to
conclude whether the schemes recognize the specific barriers and address them procedurally. For
instance in our assessment we find that the uptake of scheme is less than optimal mainly owing
to the lack of information and poor networking among women entrepreneurs. In addition we
found that the outreach efforts by the MSME departments and institutes at the state level remain
poor.

Additionally what needs to be explored is how the different ministerial policies and programs can
converge with a specific focus on enhancing the participation of women in the MSME sector.
Currently the efforts are compartmentalised and piecemeal. Perhaps there is a need for more
strategic planning and long-term goal setting that needs to be informed by the evaluation what
the current measures actually achieve and where the key gap areas are.

Profiles of Innovations in MSME Sector with respect to Women

Promotion of women’s participation in the MSME sector does not seem to have
received much focused attention. Thus we find that innovative initiatives in this regard
have been few in the Indian context. In the initial review we find that other than CSOs
that have been invested in women’s economic empowerment, government and donor
initiatives on women in the MSME sector have been more experimental and a small part
of the larger agenda to promote the MSME sector has a whole. The few innovations we
have profiled include those of UNIDO, SIDBI, SEWA and Udyogini. The details of the
profile are found in Appendix B.

Profiles of Donor Initiatives

The main developmental strategy being followed by donor agencies is that of cluster
development. The strategy was pioneered by UNIDO in the early 1980s after
international experiences of the same. The core understanding that drives this strategy is
the realization of external economies and joint actions i.e. collective efficiency. To
provide cluster entrepreneurs with competitive advantages in ways such as using
complementary machinery, possibility to access specialised business development
services, innovations achieved through the exchange of ideas supported by institutional
mechanisms and possibly collective marketing mechanisms. This strategy allows local
stakeholders to gain from collective efficiency.
UNIDO and GIZ have followed the cluster development approach in their MSME
sector interventions. Their activities consist of awareness-raising events, study tours and
exposure visits, facilitating the development of business linkages and providing capacity-
building and training. Further donor agency interventions can be found in Appendix C.

    FIELD-BASED ASSESSMENT OF MSME CLUSTERS FOR A GENDERED
                                            ANALYSIS

Introduction

This section presents the findings of the field visit to three clusters, the Readymade
Garment (RMG) in Ahmedabad city, Fruits and Vegetables Processing (FVP), a part of
the larger Food-Processing cluster in Pune and the Information Technology Hardware
and Electronics Manufacturing cluster in Bengaluru. In each cluster we met with
stakeholder organizations both governmental and non-governmental, and women-owned
enterprises. In Ahmedabad and Bengaluru we also visited a male-owned enterprise to get
a comparative perspective. Our visits to each enterprise comprised of interviews with
entrepreneurs and factory floor workers. Where possible we also met with a few
supervisory and technical employees. Where available, we also collected secondary level
data for the cluster. In terms of the stakeholder organizations, we mainly visited local
level industry associations, training institutes and business development service
providers.

Based on our findings from secondary literature and expert interviews, we identified
some key parameters that affect growth for entrepreneurs and workers in the MSME
sector and their gender dimensions. The objective was to understand if and how these
parameters affected women and whether they posed specific disadvantages to women
vis-a-vis men. In this section we provide an analysis of the findings, the key challenges
and the policy implications for strengthening the participation of women in MSME both
for entrepreneurs as well as workers.

This section has four distinct subsections. In the first two sub-sections we provide a brief
overview of the three industries we have selected and the clusters we have visited for the
study. Sub-section 3 provides a gender analysis of women’s entrepreneurship in MSMEs.
Sub-section 4 similarly provides an analysis of gender issues for women workers and
employees in MSMEs. In these sub-sections we also outline the main challenges to
women’s participation and the policy implications for strengthening it.

Industry Overview

We begin by describing briefly the three industries in terms of a few key parameters of
growth, significance and overlap with the MSME sector.

Food Processing Industry

The Food Processing Industry (FPI) in India is the fifth largest sector in the Indian
economy. It contributes more than 14% of the manufacturing GDP and over 6 % of




Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                 41 / 128
the country’s overall GDP.38 The food processing industry in India is divided between
the organized and unorganized sectors 39 , with the unorganized sector accounting for
more than 70% of the production in terms of volume and 50% in terms of value.40

In 2011, 1.6 million people were employed in the registered FPI and about 4.7 million
were employed in the unorganized FPIs. As per the Ministry of Food Processing
industries employment in the registered food processing industries have been increasing
steadily over the years till 2011. Since 2011 there has been acceleration of employment in
the registered FPI41.

The Food Processing Industry in India is a sunrise sector with a high growth potential.
This is evident as the contribution of the Food Processing sector to GDP has been
growing faster than that of the agriculture sector42. India is the second major producer of
fruit and vegetable after China, accounting for 10.9% of the global fruit production and
8.4% of the global vegetable production. It is estimated that only 2% of this total
produce is processed and about 25% is wasted suggesting a huge potential for growth
and efficiency. 43 It is expected that Fruits and Vegetable Processing (FVP) will increase
from the current 2% to 25% by 2025.44

In the MSME sector, of all the registered enterprises 14.2% are in the food processing
and beverage sector, underscoring its significance. The Food Processing Industry, after
Readymade Garments, also registers the second highest participation of women in the
MSME sector, both in terms of entrepreneurship and employment. Around 13.3% of the
FPI enterprises in the MSME sector are owned by women. Exact data is on the
percentage of women are employed in the FPI MSME sector is not available.

Challenges faced by the FPI sector include inadequate access to technology, credit, and
lack of access to best practices in manufacturing, packaging, branding and marketing. In
addition, there is a shortage of skilled human resources and low involvement of the state
governments in developing clusters45.


Ready Made Garment (RMG)46 Industry

Textile and Clothing (T&C) Industry constitutes 4% of India’s GDP, 12% of Industrial
Production and 10.5% of total exports of goods. A large part of the garment industry is

in the informal home-based sector,47 with 94% of the units and 70% of the employment
being in the informal sector.48 Ready Made Garments is a highly labour-intensive, low-
technology product although now there is a growth in high technology processes in the
readymade garment sector as well49. It is estimated that a total of 1.28 million persons
worked in the commercial apparel industry in 2005-06, of which half worked in the
small, medium and large enterprises using power. Most of the units were found to be
working on job-work basis (ibid.). Like in the FP industry, there is a massive gap in the
availability of skilled labour in the garment sector as well.

The RMG industry occupies 15.67% of all registered manufacturing MSMEs and
approximately 9.9% of all employment in the registered MSME sector. There is a high
presence of female entrepreneurs in the sector. About 48% of all women-owned
registered MSMEs fall in the RMG industry, which makes it the industry with highest
percentage of women owned enterprises in the MSME sector.

In terms of its growth potential, the removal of the Small Scale Industry (SSI) reservation
for woven apparel in 2000 and for knitted apparel in 2005 is expected to contribute to
higher exports and employment generation underscoring the significance of this industry.

One of the main challenges facing the garment sector in India is that it is highly diverse
and fragmented and comprises small scale, non-integrated weaving, finishing and apparel
making enterprises. Further, the industry is afflicted by slow and uneven modernization
in several segments including garment manufacturing 50 . The garment sector is
undergoing significant expansion and modernization in recent years due to the de-
reservation.



IT Hardware and Electronics Manufacturing Sector

The IT and Electronics Manufacturing Industry is costing India more than it is
contributing to the country in terms of GDP etc. It is said that the export bill of
electronics will soon exceed that of the country’s oil bill. The demand for electronics
hardware is projected to increase from 45 billion USD in 2009 to 400 billion USD by
2020. Recent policies like the National Electronics Policy of 2012 are meant to convert
this situation into an opportunity for manufacturing in India. The government is
promoting the Electronic System and Design Manufacturing (ESDM) industry through
various endeavours including cluster development and skill-building to create trained
manpower.


47 Unorganized sector in India manufacturing is comprised of establishments with fewer than 10 employees (or fewer
than 20 if the establishment does not use electricity).

Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                                              43 / 128
The Indian Electronics and IT Hardware sector has six key segments, namely Consumer
Electronics, Industrial Electronics, IT Hardware, Telecommunication Equipment,
Electronic Components, and Strategic Electronics. Consumer Electronics and Telecom
Equipment are the largest segments with about 27% share each in total production51.

In terms of product, the Managing Director of KENOICS (Karnataka State Electronics
Development Corporation) explained that India does more assembly work than
manufacturing, basic elements of the industry like electronic chips are exported from
other countries. Indian companies are adept are system integration manufacturing.

The sister industry of Information Technology (IT)/Information Technology enabled
services (ITeS) had added more to the country in terms of GDP, exports etc. with India
hosting the world’s second largest technology cluster in the world (Karnataka). The
bifurcation of IT and electronics as software and hardware oriented industries is
becoming less definite; a combination of software programming and electronic assembly
is required for the production of more and more goods. This makes the need to support
and augment the IT hardware and Electronics Sector all the more relevant.

Nationally, the industry employed about 4.4 million persons in 2009; this was expected to
be 16.1 million in 2014 and 27.8 million in 202052. The opportunity for growth is to the
tune of India becoming an innovative leader in the ESDM cluster, to contribute to 10%
of the 400 billion USD opportunity, and to create 20% exports from India by 2020.53

Enterprises in the IT hardware and electronics manufacturing sector all appear to be
registered enterprises. The nature of this activity precludes it from being home-based.
Manufacturing units are usually registered under the Factories Act and service and sales
enterprises under the Shops and Establishments Act.

There is some evidence that there are very few women entrepreneurs in electronics
manufacturing in this industry cluster. Since the sector is being promoted it does not
figure on the major datasets for MSMEs- e.g. the MSME Census of Registered
Enterprises.

IT Hardware and Electronics Manufacturing MSMEs face problems of being unable to
capture market opportunities which require large production facilities therefore not being
able to achieve economies of scale, homogenous standards and regular supply. Access to
consulting services, new technology and highly skilled labor is a major constraint for the
MSMEs in this industry. MSMEs always looking at their bottom line, with narrow profit
margins, remain myopic in their research & development, making innovative
improvements to their product and processes rendering them unfit to capture new
markets.

Cluster Overview

While the industry overview provides broad data about the significance of that industry
for the MSME sector and particularly for women’s participation, the cluster overview
describes the cluster selected for each industry for the study from an on the ground
perspective.



Food Vegetable Processing (FVP) Cluster Pune

The Pune FPV cluster, which is a part of the Food Processing Industry, has evolved over
time owing to Maharashtra’s favorable climatic conditions for the production of fruit and
vegetables. In 2007 it got a tranche of resources through the DFID funded cluster
development project titled “Implementing BDS for SMEs in Pune Fruit and Vegetable
processes” undertaken between 2007 and 2012. The four year project aimed at linking
FVP enterprises with business development service providers. The objective was to
improve the productivity and competitiveness of FVP enterprises in the cluster. The
diagnostic study conducted as a part of this intervention helped both develop and map
the stakeholder organizations within the cluster (See Figure 3).

Evident in Figure 3, the cluster map of stakeholders, the MSMEs in the Pune Food
Processing Cluster are well served by a comprehensive set of business development
service providers such as CITFI and APEDA, industry associations like MCCIA and
financial institutions such as NABARD and SIDBI. In the absence of gender
disaggregated data, it is difficult to state what the uptakes of these services are by
women-owned MSMEs.

The FPI cluster in Pune city is relatively small with a total of 1023 registered MSME
units with 550 units specializing in fruits and vegetable processing (DIC Pune).

According to a cluster development program report carried out by Apex Cluster
Development Services (for SIDBI) the total turnover of the cluster in 2007 was around
Rs.850 crores with employment of 13000 persons. The cluster mainly catered to the low
income market segment which was approximately 75% of its total market. The exports
were quite small as compared to the domestic sales and there were hardly 25-30 firms
involved in direct exports.54 There is no recent data (after 2007) that provides whether
the situation has changed over time. From our field-based interactions however there
seems to be an increasing shift towards an export oriented market with more awareness
of branding and packaging.



Readymade Garments Cluster Ahmedabad

The Ahmedabad city is considered an RMG cluster due to multiple concentrations of
garment-manufacturing units across the city. The entire city of Ahmedabad is
considered a cluster. There have been no interventions made in the RMG cluster in
Ahmedabad from governments or donor agencies that we were able to find out about.
Consequently unlike the FPV cluster in Pune, the understanding of this cluster and
availability of data on the cluster is limited and fragmented.

According to available data provided by the District Industries Center (DIC) for
Ahmedabad city, there are a total of almost 10,000 registered units in the ready-made
garments industry. The largest concentrations of garment units are in Sarangpur,
Gheekanta and Panchkuwa, each neighbourhood having between eight to nine hundred
registered MSME units. The DIC’s database indicates that RMG manufacturing takes
place in forty neighbourhoods in Ahmedabad.

Based on knowledge gathered from key informants, neighbourhoods like Gheekanta
have a high concentration (800 to 900) of small units, which are unregistered and often
‘temporary’ appearing and disappearing seasonally. Bapunagar has a high concentration
of garment job-worker in their homes. Areas like Narol or Vatwa are considered to be
industrial areas on the outskirts of Ahmedabad with larger factory-like units.

The General Manager of the District Industries Center, Ahmedabad reiterated that much
of garment manufacturing in the city takes place in the unregistered and informal sector.
Small units with up to 10 employees that are engaged in job-work are unlikely to register
with the DIC. Those with an investment of over 5 lakh find it necessary to register their
enterprises.

The government in the recent past has set up special economic zones for the ready-made
garment industry in Gujarat. One such Apparel Park has been set up in Khokra on the
outskirts of Ahmedabad for example. The GIDC Apparel Park is meant to host export-
oriented firms only.



IT Hardware and Electronics Manufacturing in Bengaluru

Bengaluru has been recognized as the 4th largest technology cluster in the world and the
city has a long history of facilitative factors that allowed it to take on this persona. The
industry has enjoyed encouragement from policies, tax exemptions, and creation of
common facility centres, research and training institutes, highly skilled and
knowledgeable manpower making it an internationally competitive hub.

The electronics manufacturing industry in Bengaluru is less developed but equally
important to support the IT sector and decrease the import bill as mentioned in the
earlier section. Bengaluru’s enterprises in this industry broadly focus on the production
of semiconductors, Electronics and PCB, embedded solutions, computers and
peripherals.55 Towards this manufacturing the city hosts some notable industrial clusters
within the Bengaluru cluster are Electronic City and Peenya Industrial Estate.56 The CEO
of the Electronics City noted that there are about 180 enterprises (including supporting
enterprises – testing labs, etc.) of which 70 are MSMEs.

It is estimated that Bengaluru’s Electronic System Design Manufacturing (ESDM) 57
industry today accounts for 2.8 billion USD and directly employs 30,000 persons58. It is
projected that the ESDM industry in Bengaluru can increase its revenues to 15 billion
USD, employing 240,000 persons by the year 2020 and further to 27 billion USD
employing 380,000 persons by 2025. These projects have been made by the Karnataka

category is an older formulation used widely in academic and industry literature. The term ESDM has started to be
used by the Government of India in the past few years.

There is potential to develop the ESDM sector to meet domestic demand as well as to
use the capabilities created to successfully export ESDM products from the country. The
National Policy on Electronics aims to address the issue with the explicit goal of
transforming India into a premier ESDM hub. Electronic Manufacturing Cluster (EMC)
Scheme supports creation of world-class infrastructure for attracting investments in the
ESDM sector. This has been initiated by the Department of Electronics and IT,
Government of India.

Though data from the DIC, Bengaluru is available and available on the website of the
MSME DI, the categorization of the data does not easily lend itself to identifying the
number of units that would fall in the IT Hardware and Electronics Manufacturing
sector. There is some evidence that there are very few women entrepreneurs in
electronics manufacturing in this industry cluster. Since the sector is being promoted it
does not figure on the major datasets for MSMEs- e.g. the MSME Census of Registered
Enterprises.

                   GENDER ANALYSIS OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS

Low visibility of women entrepreneurs

Overall the MSME sector is characterized by low presence of women’s entrepreneurship
across clusters. According to the Fourth MSME Census 2006-2007, 13.72 percent of
MSMEs in India are owned by women. 60 Interestingly, a similar percent of MSME
enterprises are also managed by women61. The industries in the MSME space with the
largest percentage of women-owned enterprises are wearing apparel (48%), food
products and beverages (13.3 %) and textiles (10.4 %).62

The literature in the sector indicates that registration is a complicated process requiring
documentation that the majority of enterprises in the MSME sector cannot provide.
This may be one reason for the lower registration of women’s enterprises and
consequently their lower visibility. Unfortunately schemes associated with
entrepreneurship stimulation from the Government of India are accessible only to
registered units. Women’s enterprises that are home-based or unregistered are unable to
benefit from these schemes.

Key informants shared with us that few women like to locate themselves in the industrial
locations for in RMGs and food processing. Most women entrepreneurs doing garments
chose to start ‘boutiques’ rather than set up garment manufacturing units. Similarly, the
majority of women in food processing prefer to set up home-based operations, which
they can easily combine with their other domestic and family responsibilities. Such
enterprises are unlikely to register or tap government schemes.

The data from this study shows that woman-owned enterprises in the clusters range
between 8-18 percent (see Table 12). Ascertaining women’s presence at the cluster level
for readymade garments for example was difficult as there was no gender disaggregated
data available with DIC. A crude analysis of the data on registered RMG enterprises in
the MSME sector from the DIC indicates that approximately 829 of the 10,000 firms
that are registered are under women’s names. Since women’s ownership in RMG sector
is around 10%63 and the percentage of registered women owned business is much less
than 10% we could explain this difference by the fact that most women entrepreneurs in
the readymade garment industry are commonly found running small home-based
businesses, which operate as stand-alone businesses.

The Pune DIC has developed customized software to capture gender-disaggregated data
for all the FPI units.64 From this data we learn that of the total of 1023 enterprises for
Food Processing, 184 are owned by women, which is approximately 18% of women’s
ownership in the registered cluster specific enterprises. The Pune DIC data does not
subcategorize the industries within food processing. From another source it is learned
that there are about 550 FVP units within the larger FPI cluster in Pune. 65 This data
source on FVP however does not provide gender disaggregated data on ownership of the
units.

                       *Commensurate data for the Bengaluru cluster is not available

In our sample all the units were registered with the DIC. However, in the RMG and
FVP cluster, only four of the nine women-owned enterprises were registered under the
Factories Act. The other five either had small operations or had a large number of casual
workers. In Bengaluru all the units were registered with the DIC and further registered
either under the Factories Act or the Shops and Establishment Act (See Box 3).

It is important to note (reiterated by many of the stakeholders interviewed) that
registration in a woman’s name may not imply that she runs the enterprise. Women
entrepreneurs are eligible for special incentives and concessions under various
government schemes and policies. In order to avail of the advantages available to
women entrepreneurs, men sometimes opt to register the units in the names of their
wives while remaining the de-facto owners of the units. The other reason registration
data may be misleading is because many women-owned enterprises are home-based or
within the unorganized, unregistered sector. This is particularly so in the RMG and FVP
sectors, where the traditional skills of sewing and cooking are associated with women and
the costs of starting a business are low.

The implication of running smaller-sized enterprises is that it becomes less desirable to
register them. A micro entrepreneur may not be as resourceful or have enough time or
the desire to comply with a lot of government regulations that registration entails.

Although experts in the field note that registration processes have been simplified, the
overall impression is that the process is cumbersome and tends to deter registration.

In order to track the progress of enhanced numbers of women as entrepreneurs in these
clusters it is important to have data available on a consistent indicator that measures
ownership. But there is inconsistency in the availability of data not just for this indicator
but for a range of indicators which is discussed under a different section in the
recommendations of this report.



                                            Box 3: Registration

      According to the 4th MSME Census (of registered and unregistered enterprises) 93% of the
      MSMEs in India are unregistered. Precisely only 7% of enterprises in the sector are registered. The
      registration of units may fall under different provisions and procedures.

      While enterprises can come under the ambit of the state under a variety of acts and laws,
      enterprises unregistered with the Ministry of MSME (via DICs) are not eligible for MSME
      Ministry schemes and policies. The MSME Act 2006 has prioritized registration (though making it
      voluntary) under the MSME ministry as the via media to access schemes from the ministry. From
      the perspective of the Ministry of MSME an enterprise falls under its purview through the
      modalities of EM1 and EM2 registrations.

      In addition to the registration with DIC an enterprise with more than a stipulated number of
      workers has to be registered under the Factories Act. Non-manufacturing MSMEs are registered
      under the Shops and Establishment Act rather than the Factories Act.

      In addition to registration with DIC and under Factories Act, enterprises need additional
      registrations with certain authorities such as registration for VAT- if they are exporting they need
      an export license.




Role of education and training in creating entrepreneurs is helpful but not
definitive

Professional training and experience can be considered an important indicator of
women’s motivation to become an entrepreneur. With prior experience an entrepreneur
has confidence to achieve higher levels of growth perhaps with a higher ability to take
risk as well. Kantor’s66 study of women home-based micro-entrepreneurs in the garment
sector in Ahmedabad found that, more than formal education, it was garments-related
training and years of experience that added value to the enterprise.

Based on our sample we observed that a history of prior engagement with the sector
either as professionals, employees or exposure through a family business often served as

a key factor in starting an enterprise. Very few came with only a diploma or a graduation
degree straight into the business. We identified different pathways of transitions that
women have made from working in the industry to starting up their own enterprises.

For example, a micro entrepreneur moved from operating Self-Help Group-based
livelihood activity in the food processing sector to setting up her own micro-unit. Other
pathways of transition include moving from working in the family business to setting up
their own small and medium enterprises. A third pathway is where women have worked
in the sector, e.g. RMG, before they set up their own enterprise in the. In this instance,
most of these women also had some specialized training in designing and manufacturing.
According to the women entrepreneurs interviewed, the knowledge gained through their
exposure to the industry gave them the confidence to start up their own enterprises.
Prior work experience also helps women transition to entrepreneurship even where they
may not have industry-specific expertise. For example, an entrepreneur with fifteen
years’ experience in the IT industry was able to set up a micro enterprise in the food-
processing industry of which she knew little at the outset.

Prior engagement with and exposure to the industry helps women understand and learn
the skills of the trade and helps them make more accurate assessments of financial
investments needed, threats and risks to the business, the operational processes and the
potential commercial viability of the products or services. Partly confidence comes from
the knowledge and networks of human resources they become familiar with and are able
to draw on more easily when setting up their own enterprise

The role of higher education in entrepreneurship development is difficult to ascertain in
our sample. All the entrepreneurs in our sample (except one) had either a graduation or
post-graduation degree, hence it is difficult to state with certainty the value higher
education may have had to their enterprise compared to an entrepreneur who does not
have higher education. It does seem that formal education of women does not always
determine or restrict the type of industry or sector in which women choose to start their
businesses. For example, only two of the five women entrepreneurs in the Bengaluru
cluster engaged in electronics manufacturing had a technical background.

Women who are more educated are overall more confident. We were also told by the
MSME DI in Bengaluru that education helps a woman because she is able to have better
networks. Education sometimes also overlaps with a higher socio-economic class, which
brings advantages lacking in poorer and less educated women. Poorer women are less
likely to have the networks they can leverage for their business. It is not uncommon,
therefore, for less well-off women to use the SHG route to entrepreneurship.

       There are a few kinds of women entrepreneurs. There are those who are educated. These
       are the women of Clik, AWAKE [Bangalore Industry and Entrepreneurship
       Associations]. They have good financial support and family backing. Then there are
       women who fall under the SHG model who do not have much education. These women
       develop skills of entrepreneurship as a group. They use different strengths to produce and
       sell their goods. – Director, MSME DI, Bangalore-Urban

Limited use of Entrepreneurship Development Programs

Entrepreneurship Development Programs (EDPs) have been prioritized for women by
the MSME sector67. In India, the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Development
Institutes, various State Small Industries Development Corporations, the nationalized
banks and even NGOs, are conducting various EDP programs to cater to the needs of
potential women entrepreneurs, who may not have adequate educational background and
skills. The Office of DC (MSME) has also opened a Women’s Cell to provide
coordination and assistance to women entrepreneurs facing specific problems68.

The EDPs may be short or long-term programs. The short-term EDPs range from one
to eight weeks and focus the training on the principles of planning and implementing an
economic activity, on how to develop successful businesses and how to increase
entrepreneurial opportunities in their regions. A few long-term programs integrate
entrepreneurship development with technical training in a specific industry - this was
seen particularly in the case of the food processing industry.

In our sample we did not find a very high uptake of the EDPs. Of the thirteen women
entrepreneurs only six had participated in any Entrepreneurship Development Programs.
Of them, only two had taken a government-run EDP program and four had taken EDPs
run by NGOs or private organizations. Of the six, only three had sought the program on
their own initiative and saw it as a useful step towards building their enterprise. Of the
other three, one had to take the government-run EDP as a requirement for availing a
MSME loan under the Prime Minister’s Employment Guarantee Program and two other
had been nominated through the Goldman Sachs initiated program on developing
women entrepreneurship. One of the respondents who went through the Goldman
Sachs 10,000 Women Initiative program, an entrepreneurship development program,
(detailed in Box 5) found it extremely helpful.

       After the ISB program my way of looking at business changed. I learned valuable
       skills in negotiation and marketing.


Overall, EDPs were sought by and helped the women who had no prior experience
working in businesses of any kind or lacked business exposure in their chosen industry.
Entrepreneurs who had prior business experience did not see the need to undertake
EDP training. In fact what these respondents suggested was that more than training,
prior business and professional experience helps them get the necessary training required
to start up an enterprise.

Women, who did not use the EDPs, had undertaken short management and leadership
training programs in the process of expanding their businesses. However, leadership and
human resource management training is not always a part of EDPs. Our respondents
suggested that there is a perceived need for skill-capacity building for these areas;
especially human resource management is important where women entrepreneurs have
to manage male employees and workers. These skills are lacking in some women

that male employees handle the day-to-day operations and floor management.

The available EDPs were not perceived as relevant for women who had existing
enterprises and needed skills to cope with growth and expansion.


                                            Box 4: Handholding

      A private entrepreneurship and skill training institute in Pune has re-adopted a model that allows
      for behind-the-scenes handholding for fresh entrepreneurs.

      The institute offers technical EDPs such as Food Processing EDP, which combine the skills
      required to create food-based products with the skills to run a successful enterprise. The institute
      has been running for several decades and has been able to adapt its resources to aid new
      entrepreneurs.

      A Senior Trainer explained that recently-graduated trainees are put in touch with sector-specific,
      established entrepreneurs who have previously taken EDPs at the institute. These entrepreneurs
      have the required licenses for food production and hygienic production spaces. New
      entrepreneurs make use of these production spaces and run a second shift to run their own
      production. This allows for less investment on part of the new entrepreneur who can invest the
      saved money in building their brand. This model lessens failure rates for fresh entrepreneurs.

                           Box 5: Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Women Initiative

      10,000 Women is a global initiative that fosters economic growth by providing women
      entrepreneurs around the world with business and management education, mentoring and
      networking, and access to capital. To date, the initiative has reached over 10,000 women from
      across 43 countries through a network of 90 academic and non-profit partners.

      The 10,000 Women initiative was launched in 2008 by the Goldman Sachs Foundation. 10,000
      Women has supported women from countries as diverse as Liberia, Egypt, Brazil, India and China
      through a network of 90 academic and non-profit partners. More than 30 of the world’s leading
      business schools have participated in the program. The initiative is founded on research
      conducted by Goldman Sachs – Womenomics and Women Hold up Half the Sky – the World
      Bank and others, which suggests that such an investment can have a significant impact on GDP
      growth.

      Program participants, referred to as “scholars,” are taught practical skills by instructors from some
      of the most well-regarded business schools in the world. Scholars also are offered mentoring,
      business support services and networking opportunities with partner institutions, local businesses
      and Goldman Sachs staff.

      In India, the Indian School of Business (ISB) implements 10,000 Women in several major cities.
      Working with classes of 30 women in each cohort, the program includes 150 hours of training in
      entrepreneurship and business management, including business planning, marketing, finance,
      accounting and human resource management. ISB faculty presents lectures and engages scholars
      in analysing local case studies, as well as in panel discussions. Successful entrepreneurs (including
      10,000 Women alumni) participate as guest speakers. Each scholar develops a business plan under
      the guidance of faculty members. Scholars study on-site at ISB for one week per month for three
      months. In addition, the program provides scholars with mentoring and networking opportunities
      with partner institutions.

      10,000 Women graduates report immediate and sustained business growth. Thirty months after
      completing the program, 82% of surveyed graduates have increased their revenue and 71% have
      added new jobs. On average, graduates doubled the size of their workforces and revenues
      increased nearly fivefold. An independent assessment by the International Center for Research
      on Women found that graduates attributed changes in their businesses performance and increased
      confidence to the business and management education and support they received through the
      program. Nine out of ten participants pay it forward by mentoring and teaching business skills to
      other women.




Women opt for low financial risks and micro- level operations

According to the Fourth MSME census 2006-2007, women’s ownership is highest in the
case of micro enterprises, followed by small and then medium enterprises. Deshpande
and Sharma (2013) also find that female-owned and female-managed enterprises tend to
be significantly smaller in terms of average number of employees compared to their
male-owned and male-managed counterparts. Moreover, the proportion of owner-
operated enterprises among women is much higher compared to their male
counterparts.69


69Owner-operatedenterprises have no hired workers and are run by self with or without the help of unpaid family
members (GoI 2010). These can be reasonably seen as representing survival activities, possibly distress-driven.



Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                                         55 / 128
Secondary literature also reinforces the finding that women are lower risk takers than
their male counterparts. A multi-country study on women entrepreneurs found that
poor business education and a lack of work experience makes women risk averse and
deters entrepreneurship development among them 70 . A GEM 71 study also found that
regardless of country, educational attainment, or work status and income, women
entrepreneurs tend to be less confident and more pessimistic as compared to their male
counterparts. A respondent from a professional network in Bengalurru noted:

       Women get very comfortable once they reach a certain size, they don’t want to take
       risks. Women entrepreneurs often have to be told and explained that they should take a
       quantum leap. They don’t always understand that increasing production can reduce
       many costs. – Senior Management, AWAKE

Our interviews with women entrepreneurs across the three clusters suggest that women
who start on their own are less risk-taking and prefer to begin at a micro-scale, with low
financial investments. Two factors affect their decision for investment and in turn their
scale of operation. First as discussed later in the report, getting start-up capital from
external sources is difficult. Second, women are under-confident about the commercial
success of their enterprise, therefore prefer to test the waters before they expand their
businesses and thus not likely to take a loan as they start up. A woman entrepreneur in
the electronics manufacturing industry told us that with pride that she was a debt free
company and preferred to operate in that way. Other women who have taken loans also
do so reluctantly, especially if they have low assets to offer as collateral, and want to
repay their debts as soon as possible.

We found that the food processing industry is seen to be an easy industry for women to
enter due to the low financial risk in manufacturing, small quantities of processed fruit
and vegetable products and the pre-existing skill in cooking and food preparation among
women. Two women entrepreneurs from FPI cluster in Pune with micro enterprises
noted that they used their personal resources to start small operations from their home
as they were unsure of their commercial success. They expanded their operations, a year
or two after starting out, when the appreciation and demand for their products were
established among family, friends and local markets.

Male support is often a strategy for risk reduction and growth

Interestingly women’s ability and confidence to take risks seems to be dependent on
having family support for their businesses. Women are willing to take slightly higher risks
when they have strong support from families and in some cases male business partners.
The presence of a male family member provides confidence to navigate the more
challenging areas of marketing and finances. In Pune, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru we find
that women who had slightly larger businesses, i.e. small and medium enterprises, had
family-based investment or, at the very least had the involvement of their spouses or
male relatives who were supporting the enterprises with accessing finance and in
marketing of products. At times the spouse joined the woman’s business after it had
grown.

There were various examples of how male/family support was significant for a woman-
owned enterprise. In the Pune cluster, one of the medium-enterprise owners had helped
set up and had worked in her husband’s business in manufacturing of engineering
products before she started her own enterprise. Her husband currently serves as a
director in her company and is chiefly responsible for overseeing finance marketing. The
second entrepreneur started out with a small investment and grew exponentially.
Eventually her business merged with the company of businesses owned by her brother-
in-law, who had provided her financial and technical support for her business initially.
She is currently a director in the merged company. In the RMG cluster, an entrepreneur
who had grown from an micro to small enterprise within a span of 12 years and
registered almost 15-20% growth annually, started the business on her own. Once she
decided to expand her micro-business to a small-scale enterprise, she changed her
company from a female proprietorship to a private limited company with her husband as
a 40% shareholder in the company. The husband now looks after the export division.
In Bengaluru, a woman entrepreneur started out as a ‘small’ unit with investment of Rs.
25 lakhs in 1997. The investment was extremely high for this entrepreneur but she had
the strong moral support from her father and her mother-in-law. The latter even
mortgaged her property to enable the entrepreneur to get a working capital loan. And
now she is planning to expand her business by partnering with her male cousin.

The growth of women-owned enterprises is also affected by gendered factors such as the
perception of clients or issues of mobility and safety. The two quotes below illustrate
this point. One woman entrepreneur in Bengaluru noted,

         Clients don’t trust women with larger orders. They feel you will not be able to deliver.
         They keep giving you incremental orders and try out with small quantities. This is my
         feeling. Men are able to bag a bigger order without being able to show their authenticity
         about it. We have to keep proving ourselves and our capabilities.

Another entrepreneur, also in Bengaluru pointed out that business from the African

       However, it is not easy for a woman to just take off and go to Africa. A man can
       easily travel to Zimbabwe or Sudan; a woman has to make sure there is adequate safety
       and security.

Irrespective of how the men get involved or support women owned enterprises, it is
clear that women did use these options and relied on them as strategies for access to
finance and marketing.

Getting start up finance is difficult for women and men – but more so for women

According to the most recent study by IFC 72 across India, women entrepreneurs have
lower access to finance than male entrepreneurs and are unable to meet their own
finance needs fully. The total finance requirement of women-owned MSMEs in 2012 was
around Indian rupees 8.68 trillion ($158 billion) and the total supply of formal finance to
women-owned MSMEs was around Indian rupees 2.31 trillion ($42 billion). This
resulted in a finance gap of Indian rupees 6.37 trillion ($116 billion), or 73 percent of
total demand. The review of literature also highlights that women entrepreneurs are
more likely to face higher interest rates, be required to collateralize a higher share of the
loan, and get shorter-term loans. Based on the fact that women’s access to finance at the
start-up stage is more challenging than men, because they either have no assets or less
assets compared to men, the Government has provided schemes that require less
collateral from women.

Experts in the sector reiterate that access to finance is one of the key constraints both
men and women face equally in the MSME sector in India, especially at the start-up
stage73. Seven of the thirteen women entrepreneurs had used their personal savings or
taken a personal loan to start their businesses and three had access to MSME loan
(received through nationalized banks) in addition to private savings, and only one
woman entrepreneur took a commercial loan from a private bank as the government
bank asked for higher collaterals (See Figure 4). The two male entrepreneurs in
Bengaluru and Ahmedabad that we interviewed had also used their own funds to start
their businesses.

Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                                 58 / 128

 There are several difficulties in getting a loan for start-ups. On the demand side,
entrepreneurs felt that it was too time consuming to put together the paperwork for
loans and they also felt that they would likely to be unsuccessful due to the attitudes of
the bankers. Often, entrepreneurs are not even aware of the various loans based
government schemes they are eligible for. On the supply side, bankers are very cautious
and reluctant to give loans to new businesses, which lack a track record for the fear of
accumulating non-performing assets. An official of the MSME department also noted
that sometimes bank managers were not fully versed in government schemes, especially
in smaller branches.

Notwithstanding the fact that access to finance is equally difficult for male and female
entrepreneurs, we found that prevailing gender realities and gender biased attitudes of
financial institutions make it more difficult for women to access loans. Typically first
time women entrepreneurs inspire less confidence in a loaning institution. As reported by
some of the entrepreneurs in our sample, bankers tend to assume that women’s
enterprises are more prone to sickness and failure. Bankers’ assumptions it seems are
based on beliefs that the women will devote less time to their businesses than men.

We found that even though some of the MSME loan schemes do not require collaterals,
in practice, banks do ask for them. The real disconnect is that while Government has
issued guidance for interest free loans, bankers are actually obliged to ensure full loan
recovery by their institutions. They do not create the space for a certain amount of loans
to default for new businesses even though the schemes allow default. Despite the efforts
by the governments to provide loans without collaterals and credit guarantee to women
start-up MSMEs, the reality is quite different and this discourages women to access
loans.

First-time women entrepreneurs, dealing directly with banking institutions, may face
inordinate delays in receiving the funds and often fall back on support from male
counterparts or spouses to ease the process of accessing finance (See Box 4).

                               Box 6: Loan Difficulties – An Example

      The entrepreneur (E1) accessed the PMEGP after learning about the loan scheme from the
      Development Officer of the KVIB whom she had maintained a good working relationship with.
      The procedure for getting the loan was “not at all easy” and was “not entrepreneur -friendly”. As
      part of the scheme, if she took a loan of Rs. 25 lakh the government would give her a subsidy of
      25% on the loan. “Many of the concerned authorities indicated that they wanted bribes. It took
      over 6 months to get the loan passed after which even the bank officials wanted bribes. I never
      paid a bribe so the whole process kept getting delayed. Once the loan was passed, the bank asked
      me for collateral. I had FD investments of 8 lakh that had to be kept as a bond. Imagine, I had to
      give an 8 lakh bond for a 16 lakh loan. The bankers were not forthcoming in giving me details of
      the scheme – I could have paid an extra 1% interest rate and got the loan without collateral. But
      they never told me any of this, I found out only a few years later. Not only were the 8 lakh FD
      investments mortgaged but so were the sewing machines. They would not let me take a loan
      without making my husband sign as a guarantor because he had an “assured income” despite all
      the mortgages.

      I repaid the loan over 2.5 years instead of 5 years. They did not free my collateral despite the fact
      that I repaid the loan and paid it before time. Even to free my collateral they wanted bribes. So
      many times I had to threaten the bank saying that I’ll shut my account and move to another
      bank.”




Accessing finance and dealing with financial institutions is considered a challenge even
by educated and well-connected women.

          “My husband and CA were there to help me when I had to take a bank loan. I am sure I
         could have done it on my own but because I knew less about the procedures than they did, it
         would have taken me three years compared to the two years that it took them.” -Women
         Entrepreneur, Ahmedabad cluster

Additionally, it is also a challenge to get finance to make an investment to grow the
business. For example, after a business is running, the entrepreneur may need on-going
loans either for a working capital or to expand the scale. What we find is that in
negotiating these loans, much depends on the relationship that the entrepreneur is able
to establish with the bank she is dealing with. In some cases, the women entrepreneur
respondents noted, that once their business was established, and the bank had become
their partner, they were able to get on-going access to finance as and when needed.
However, before that stage is reached, business growth for both women and men in
MSME sector is adversely affected by lack of finance. Women entrepreneurs in
Bengaluru told us that they are caught in a chicken and egg bind. To get a loan from the
bank they need a purchase order from a company; however, they are unable to get a
purchase order till they can demonstrate their increased production capacity. A bank
loan would enable them to invest in increased production capacity and thereby get larger
purchase orders. While this issue is not gender specific, it gets layered by the fact that
there is a gendered unequal access to networks and relationship management, which can
result in differential access to finance for men and women.

Limited marketing skills and gender stereotypes make market engagement a
challenge for women

MSMEs in India, irrespective of ownership, are characterized by weak marketing. Most
MSMEs do not have money to invest in market research, advertisement, and packaging
and are unable to carry out design and technical improvements to keep up with market
demands.74 As has been observed in the literature, women entrepreneurs may face these
challenges in marketing their products because they lack market knowledge and
marketing skills.75

The typical MSME, which operates at the micro level and has a small turnover, is
constrained in the resources it can devote to expanding its market share. As one
entrepreneur in Pune explained -

         I would like to have on-line sales for my product. However, to pay for a payment
         gateway I would have to invest an amount almost equal to my current turnover. I am
         willing to pay transaction fees, and would find it really useful to have a shared portal
         where I could market my products.

In our sample, marketing and distribution was mentioned as a major challenge, by both
micro and small entrepreneurs. More specifically women respondents noted that
establishing marketing linkages and expanding the markets for their products is
particularly challenging. This may also be due to their restricted mobility and their initial
hesitation to engage with the market spaces that are traditionally associated with and
dominated by men. Additionally, an interesting insight on why this might be the case,
was provided by a key informant in Pune, who noted that women tend to prioritize
quality of products over market outreach.

At the initial stages of the business, engaging with the markets, for both sale and
procurement of raw materials and machinery, women face resistance. This may be
because market vendors tend to associate this aspect of the business with men and not
women. One of the women managers in Pune, in charge of operations of her medium-
sized family owned company, faced stiff resistance from vendors when negotiating for
the procurement of machinery. The vendors in this case insisted on meeting with male
counterpart in the company.

Once women prove themselves in the business, they are less likely to face these attitudes
from vendors. As one of the entrepreneurs from the Ahmedabad cluster noted-

         When I first started the business, people would treat me with kid-gloves. I went to
         meet someone regarding some fabric I needed. He asked ‘are you sure you will be able
         to do this business? Why don’t you run a boutique like so many other women are

         doing? When I would go to buy supplies, they would not even show me things properly.
         They would think I was buying for my home - they could not believe I ran a
         commercial operation. Now that I have succeeded, the men are all very respectful
         towards me.

It is important to note that although the women in our sample had overcome the barriers
to marketing, the more established small and medium enterprises had all-male teams
handling the marketing and sales divisions. Also, where entrepreneurs had spousal or
family support, the marketing and sales was handled mainly by their male counterparts.

Uptake of government schemes is not optimal

There are multiple government schemes for women entrepreneurs but the uptake of
these schemes is reported to be low. According to a recent study no women
entrepreneurs found it ‘very easy’ and only 23% of women entrepreneurs found it ‘easy’
to access government schemes. The others reported varying levels of difficulty.76

As discussed earlier in the report the MSME sector in general and women in the sector in
particular are served by schemes from a range of ministries and organizations both at the
state and national level. However there is no gender disaggregated data available on the
uptake of the schemes. Scheme uptake data is also at not available in DICs. The only
gender-disaggregated data available is by the MSME ministry for trainings availed of by
women under government schemes. Officials in the government and in banks like SIDBI
indicated that the uptake of the available government schemes by women entrepreneurs
is not optimal. In the absence of data the actual scheme uptake by women is difficult to
ascertain.

In our sample all thirteen women entrepreneurs had availed of at least one government
scheme, with most schemes being related to either to credit or participation in business
exhibitions and fairs. A minority had availed of schemes for technology up gradation in
their factories. There was limited awareness of the other schemes related to training and
infrastructure development. They had learnt of the loan-related schemes primarily
through chance encounters with individuals or from male counterparts in their families.
The exception was Bengaluru, where four of the five women entrepreneurs were well
networked and had become aware of the schemes through industry associations and
informal networks.

Sometimes there is incomplete understanding about a scheme, or the officials concerned
are not able to clarify the benefits of the scheme and thus an entrepreneur is unable to
benefit from it. As one entrepreneur in Bengaluru told us,

       I did a course on Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP)
       and the permissible loan limit under the scheme is 25 lakhs. However the banker told
       me that I would get only Rs. 5 lakhs as loan without collateral. I was also given to
       understand that if I availed of this subsidized loan, I would not be able to avail of any

        other government subsidy. That is what I understood at that time (in 2010). So I
        decided not to take the loan.

Another major disincentive for availing of government schemes is the tedious paper
work and regulatory processes involved in availing of schemes. Although these problems
are faced equally by men and women, existing gender norms, roles, and socialization of
women makes the challenges they face more gendered. Lack of time owing to dual
responsibilities of work and home, gender attitudes of the officials, and women’s own
hesitation to deal with public office affect the ease of accessing schemes. It is not
uncommon for women who go to apply for a scheme to come back with a male family
member in order to avail schemes and respondents indicated possible rent-seeking as a
reason.

The schemes are not always well implemented. Thus even when there is a scheme on
paper it may not work well to benefit women entrepreneurs. One RMG entrepreneur
reported,

        The KVIC tried to get me to participate in their exhibitions by offering me stall
        concessions. They are very unorganized and they don’t give one any time to prepare. I
        would get a phone call at 7 pm saying there is an exhibition tomorrow morning. I
        couldn’t plan, make products for sale or organize my staff, so I hardly took up their
        offers. These are shallow schemes - it’s a very superficial way of helping people.

Lack of awareness and poor access to networks are big factors in the gap between
presence of schemes and their uptake. First time entrepreneurs find it especially difficult
to create the time to find out about possible schemes that can help their business.

Growth rate of women-owned enterprises is considered to be lower than men

Globally, women entrepreneurs are not only underrepresented in the MSME sector but
the average growth rate of women’s enterprises is significantly lower than the average for
men’s enterprises77. The growth of women run enterprises are affected by several gender
specific factors. Societal constraints and household responsibilities increase women’s risk
averseness and affect their self-confidence both of which affect the growth of their
businesses. A study78 found that the desire for flexibility, job satisfaction and quality of
life are significant in the entrepreneurial decisions made by women, and sometimes
adversely affect enterprise growth.

In our sample we found that the growth of the enterprise varied by ownership patterns.
Women-owned enterprises that have the support of a spouse or male family member
registered better growth than those that were solely owned and run by women. In
Ahmedabad the only enterprise that had grown by 20% in terms turnover (from its
inception 12 years ago) was one where the unit, although successfully established by the

women, was run jointly with the entrepreneur’s husband at the time of expansion. One
female entrepreneur, who does not have a male family support and whose business had
been operational for 3 years claimed 15% growth in its client base but not in turnover. A
male owned enterprise on the other hand had shown consistent growth in terms of
turnover since the inception of the unit 12 years and currently claimed to have a 100%
growth rate. In Pune both enterprise that had either family-based ownership or spousal
support showed over 100% growth rates. Of the two women owned and women run
enterprises one showed no growth while one showed less than 50% growth. While the
growth in Bengaluru’s electronic enterprises had been uneven for both women and men
owned enterprises, male owned enterprises had seen bigger growth leaps than those
owned by women.

Growth sometimes requires moving to larger premises that are usually available only in locations
that are further away. Reluctance to move to a distant location can limit the growth of a home-
based business. A FVP entrepreneur in Pune who has set up a production unit on the terrace of
her home noted,

       They are talking of giving land for a factory in an area far away. But how can I go
       there? I have to look after my household. For a man it is easy – he can just shift to
       the far away location. But how can a woman do that? Also it is not safe for her to
       stay on her own in a new place. A man has no such handicap.


Dual responsibilities especially when they have young children make it difficult for women
entrepreneurs to devote the time and effort required to expand their businesses. In the face of
their family responsibility women are less likely to prioritize their business expansion or work
over their domestic work and more likely to feel guilty about neglecting household roles as
women. A woman entrepreneur in Bengaluru told us:


         My daughter does not want me to be just a housewife – she likes the fact that I have a
         business. At the same time, she wants me to be at home when she comes back from school.


Where the families are supportive (mothers and mothers-in-law) and share the domestic
responsibilities women can focus more on their businesses.

In Ahmedabad, in the unit that was jointly owned by a husband and wife, the wife routinely had
to take leave of absence during her children’s exam or other family responsibilities. For the same
reason the micro-entrepreneur in Pune preferred to be home-based even though she had already
leased a property to shift her business. She had been only recently been linked to the local
markets and was poised for growth but chose to delay it because of her responsibilities at home.

Women entrepreneurs in Bengaluru told us that they deliberately chose to grow modestly
with stable growth and retention of workers because they wanted to do other things in
addition to their business which include balancing household responsibilities and
volunteering time for mentoring budding entrepreneurs.

Uncertainty about the future of the enterprise is another factor that affects the growth of
women-owned enterprises. Women entrepreneurs in Bengaluru told us that while they
were passionate about their enterprises, they were not sure if their children would want
to continue in their businesses. This sometimes affected their motivation for growth.
While men may face similar succession issues these did not affect their growth plans in
the same way.

An interesting finding was the different ways in which the women entrepreneurs assessed
their own growth. While turnover is a standard indicator of growth some entrepreneurs
in our sample felt that growth of the enterprise can be defined in other ways as well. For
instance, a couple of entrepreneurs felt that the fact that their client base had increased in
number and that they were manufacturing a bigger range of items were also indicators of
business growth.

                          GENDER ANALYSIS OF ASSOCIATIONS

Introduction

In each cluster we identified various industry associations both sector-specific and
associations that spanned all industries. Both FPI cluster in Pune and the RMG cluster
in Ahmedabad have the state-level industry associations located in the respective cities.
In Pune, the Maratha Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA)
serves as the primary multi-industry association. The Gujarat Chambers of Commerce
and Industries (GCCI) and Gujarat Garment Manufacturer’s Association are the two
main associations in Ahmedabad associated with RMG. Bengaluru has several multi-
industry associations and industry-specific ones. The oldest multi-specific association,
viz. the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) was
formed in the 1930s. The Karnataka Association of Small Scale Industry Association
(KASSIA) was formed to focus on small scale industries. Around the same time
associations specific to the electronics industry were formed, viz. Consortium of
Electronic Industries of Karnataka (CLIK; formed in 1982). Bengaluru also has a branch
of the national association Manufacturers’ Association of Information Technology
(MAIT) which was formed in the 1990s.

The Bengaluru cluster was unique in that it was served by several women entrepreneurs
associations. AWAKE, the Association for Women Entrepreneurs of Karnataka, was
established in 1983 and perhaps is the oldest multi-industry association of women
entrepreneurs. eMerg, Engineering Manufacturer Entrepreneurs Resource Group, was
set up in 2006 by seven women entrepreneurs in the electronics manufacturing industry
to address issues specific to women-owned enterprises. eMerg now includes women
entrepreneurs in engineering, technology and services. A recent entrant to this category
is Confederation of Women Entrepreneurs or COWE. This last association started its
Bengaluru chapter recently and so far does not have any entrepreneurs in the electronics
or IT industries.

In this section we look at the relevance of associations to enhancing women
entrepreneurship development and their ability to access them. We find that while
associations are beneficial and at times critical to enterprise development, women overall
have poor access to these associations and networks for a range of reasons that include
the scale of operations, women inherent hesitation to network, their lack of time and the
poor outreach of associations.

Associations are valuable venues for information exchange for women-owned
MSMEs

Entrepreneurs’ networks and associations across industries are important sources of
information and are considered as very valuable mechanisms for business promotion.

Outside of Associations, less formal entrepreneurs’ networks are also important sources
for business promotion79.
The ex-President of the Business Women’s Wing (BWW) at the Gujarat Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (GCCI) felt that start-ups could benefit greatly from the
information and government linkages available through associations; the association is
actively helping women entrepreneurs’ members grow their businesses. The government
finds it convenient to liaise with firms through industry associations and both the BWW
at GCCI and the Gujarat Garment Manufacturer’s Association engage regularly with the
government for issues like firm registration and dissemination on information about
government policies. Several entrepreneurs in Bengaluru told us that they had made
important business linkages through the B2B (Business 2 Business) meets organized by
the industry associations, especially the ones organized by the women’s associations.
Associations also step in occasionally to facilitate operational and regulatory aspects of
specific units (See Box 6)

      “A firm in a Special Economic Zone was unable to sell its products to the buyer because the
      goods were damaged. They thought of selling the goods in the local market at reduced prices.
      However, to bring the goods out of the SEZ, the firm was required to pay full taxes on the goods,
      even though they were damaged. GGMA intervened on the firm’s behalf and they were allowed
      to bring the goods out without paying the required tax.”

The women entrepreneurs we met in Bengaluru are well networked and belong to several
of the multi industry, industry-specific and women-only associations. Almost all of them
underscored that membership in the associations was an important source for getting
information and accessing government schemes. In the IT Hardware and Electronics
Manufacturing sector, changes in technology and products change dynamically and
frequently. Entrepreneurs particularly valued industry associations’ role of holding
seminars on the technology and product changes at pace with changes in the market.
SIDBI, in their UNIDO partnered interventions on cluster development, identified the
lack of relevant information to be of particular disadvantage to women entrepreneurs,
often an underlying cause of the other systemic barriers they tend to face in enterprise
development. We found that for women, poor access to information can be both the
cause and effect of their poor access to networks.
The importance of association membership and networks can be discerned from the fact
that in Ahmedabad cluster the most successful women entrepreneur, running a small
sized enterprise, was part of several formal and informal networks, including serving as a
onetime president of the women wing of GCCI (E3; Figure 5). She was emphatic that

actively sought and maintained her networks.

Genders-specific concerns affect networking for women

We found that limited time to access networks or information by entrepreneurs can be a
function of the size of the enterprise and affects both men and women equally.
Entrepreneurs of micro enterprises have limited financial resources and tend to handle
multiple responsibilities in their businesses, leaving them with little time to join networks
and industry membership associations. In two of the three clusters in our sample most
entrepreneurs with micro-enterprises had few formal or informal networks. Women who
owned micro-enterprises and were solely responsible for the management, with no
support either by family or business partners, had fewer networks compared to women
that had some form of family support. In comparison women who owned medium and
small enterprises had more networks as these units have a relatively larger workforce and
the activities were more decentralized.

However there are gender specific constraints that women face in joining networks or
fostering informal networks. This may be due to social and cultural reasons because the
networks are male dominated spaces. Additionally, because of the low presence of
women in the manufacturing sector overall and in the business world in general, there is
an absence of informal business networks of women that women can leverage.

Further, as some of the entrepreneurs and experts in the field observed, women’s ability
to network is constrained by their restricted mobility and constraints of time on account
of handling dual responsibilities of business and family. As the Vice-chairperson of the
Women’s Business Wing of GCCI observed:

            Women spend little time [on networks]…women have to generate business networks
            since their time is so limited due to the dual responsibility of taking care of their
            households along with their businesses.

Also as pointed out to us by some of the key informants in the field, women also self-
censor and thus tend to be less assertive in reaching out or promoting themselves. As the
entrepreneur from E3 mentioned above pointed out:

            When I started as a women’s wing’s chairperson, I had read an article in the Times of
            India and I still have the clipping -about Womaniya networks. ‘Women are weak in
            networking’, it said. The writer gave an example that I really liked. If you are going
            into for an interview as a 20 year old if you go to a lady telling her this she will advise
            you to ‘be prepared, know your answers, be honest’ but if you go to a man he will call
            up two people and say this boy/girl is coming for an interview please take care of
            him/her. That kind of networking, women do not have! Now that you ask me this,
            yes, its true, its absolutely a must. We have started a business clinic the very base is
            that amidst women we should have a strong network. I am not weak at it, I believe in
            making contacts and making a network, I make sure I have people around me who I
            can look up to in times of problem but women don’t believe in that. They live in some
            cocooned space. And I think it’ll be hard to survive on women only networks.

Entrepreneurs in the Bengaluru clusters were the exception because they were all well
networked with others in the industry and with government departments.80 Most of the
women-owned enterprises were older enterprises (ranging from 15 – 25 years old).


Low Membership of Women in Associations and their Executive bodies

The presence of women in the executive bodies of the male dominated industry
associations such as GGMA and CLIK or multi-industry associations such as MCCIA,
FKCCI and GCCI is low(see Table 13). The associations primarily serve the interests of
large and medium sized industries that are mainly male-owned. Even in an industry
association for MSMEs such as KASSIA in Bengaluru there are only three women in the
45 member executive committee.

There are few women members in Pune’s primary industry association, viz. the Maratha
Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA).                  MCCIA has
approximately 200 women members out of a total of 3200 members. The executive
committee of the MCCIA is all male. Respondents note that these multi-industry
associations are naturally dominated by the interests of the majority membership that is
male.

Women thus get few opportunities to be part of the mainstream governance of these
bodies. All multi-industry associations visited such as MCCIA, GCCI and FKCCI have a
women’s wing or Women Entrepreneurs Committee (WEC) and all women members
automatically become members of this wing. The objective of the WEC is to assist
potential and existing women entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. It is not that they
choose this wing over the general chamber. However, the women’s wing can serve the

80   Our access to the women entrepreneurs in Bengaluru was through an association of women entrepreneurs.

case of the GCCI.


          Table 13: Presence of Women in Industry Associations in RMG and FPI




Membership in Associations is affected by costs and limited outreach

Access to formal networks and association can be limited because of relatively high costs
of membership fee as well as the inability of associations to proactively reach out to
smaller and start-up businesses. Smaller enterprises often lack the information about
these associations and their benefits especially if they are first-time entrepreneurs.
Further, being heads of small enterprises and multi-tasking for various business
operations they have little time to find out about and participate in association activities.


Women entrepreneurs associations can be more enabling

Bengaluru cluster has an unusually high presence of active associations of women
entrepreneurs. Founding members of these associations shared their motivation to set up
their respective association was to enable a unique focus on women-owned enterprises
that is often not prioritized by the larger industry associations that are dominated by
men. In fact the founder member of one of the women entrepreneur’ s association, who
also has been the president of the WEC at FKCCI, decided to promote a women-
entrepreneur’s association as she was frustrated at the lack of interest of a multi-industry
association to promote events addressing issues specific to women entrepreneurs

More experienced women entrepreneurs are active members of the industry associations
but recognize their marginal representation and limited ability to serve the interest of
women from within the industry associations. A woman entrepreneur explained how she
recently started a woman-specific entrepreneurship association in spite of the fact that
she was heading the Women’s Entrepreneurship Committee at the Federation of
Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry. She explained that the programs and
measures that were proposed by the women’s wing were not taken seriously by the
Executive Committee of the FKCCI.

Cluster Development Approach can enhance linkages with Associations

As demonstrated in Pune, CDPs can be facilitative in enhancing the networking of
women entrepreneur and in turn promoting small businesses by proactively reaching out
to women entrepreneurs. The Pune Fruit and Vegetable CDP was routed through the
MCCIA. The two women entrepreneurs in our sample had both been associated with
the Pune CDP and benefitted from this association. The CDP made them aware of
licensing requirements, packaging and food safety features, and also helped them make
linkages for product development, packaging and marketing. Associations partnering in
the CDP had also helped the two enterprises get government subsidies for machinery
and bar code registration.

              GENDER ANALYSIS OF WOMEN’ AS WORKERS IN MSMES



Women constitute a fifth of the total workforce in the MSME sector. According to the
Fourth MSME Census 2006-07, the rate of women’s employment in registered MSMEs
is 20.45 percent and that in unregistered enterprises is 13.02 percent 81 . Gender
disaggregated data across MSMEs shows that women’s employment like ownership is the
highest in the case of micro enterprises followed by small and then medium enterprises
(Table 14).

Type of work

Women workers are mostly in low and unskilled jobs

The employment pattern of workers in the sample varied across the industries and
clusters. The presence of women in the workforce was defined largely by the nature of
the work required and in that what was considered appropriate for women. In all clusters
there were gender-marked roles for the work along the value chain of production. The
latter was particularly relevant for the RMG units in Ahmedabad where women workers
are less than twenty percent of the total workforce except in the case of the smallest
firm.

In contrast, in Pune, the smallest unit had hundred percent women workers and in the
remaining units the female workers comprised sixty to eighty five percent of the total
workforce. In the FPI units, all processing is done on-site because the product is
perishable and there are surrounding concerns around hygiene and quality. The FPI units
have a large volume of several low-end, low-skill processing and packaging work like
cleaning of bottles, sorting of fruits and vegetable and packaging that has to be done by
hand for which the industry preference is for women workers. Women are considered

suitable for these jobs as these are low skill jobs that require patience and dexterity,
characteristics associated with women and not men. Further, owing to the prevailing
gendered understanding of skills in the industry, women are considered to have a better
understanding of preparation of recipes and cooking. Thus in smaller units that have
minimal mechanization,the workforce tends to be dominated by women.

The categorization of skilled and unskilled workers varies across the industries. For
example in the RMG industry all machine-based tasks are considered skilled. In the FPI,
production-floor workers, even if they operate machines, are considered unskilled; only
lab-technician and managerial positions are considered as skilled categories. The
Bengaluru cluster requires a high level of skill and education in its workforce for design
and research of electronic goods. However, workers even in Bengaluru cluster, are
considered semi-skilled and need to be trained to the needs of the specific firm they join.
In our sample only 13% of the skilled sections of employees were women; women made
up a majority of the production workforce (71%) which requires less skill and less
educational qualifications (see Table 15 and 16). While RMG and FPI are largely labour-
intensive industries, IT and ESDM are require higher skill levels. Thus in the latter all
workforce was in the skilled category.

Amongst the skilled jobs too there is a gender segregation where the lower skill jobs like
machine operators in the RMG cluster are done by women and higher skill jobs like
pattern setting and cutting are done by men. In the FPI industry, other than a few lab
technicians and administrative staff, majority of the women comprised of unskilled
workers. With a few exceptions, most of the unskilled women workers were engaged in
non-mechanized, manual work of sorting and cleaning of bottles, fruits and vegetables
and in manual packaging of some ready mixes i.e. work at the lowest end of the value
chain.

This high presence of women in mostly low and unskilled jobs is explained by a host of
reasons. First, women at the worker level come from poor socio-economic backgrounds
and mostly lack the education and skills training and therefore tend to join the workforce
at the lowest end of the value chain. Second, there is a gender stereotyping of tasks and
jobs at the factory floor where women are considered unsuitable for mechanical and

technical work (discussed in detail in a later section). Hence with the exception of one
unit in the FPI cluster in Pune, women in the factory floor were not considered for skill
up-gradation. Third, women themselves, internalize the prevailing gender norms of
appropriate roles and hesitate from undertaking activities or skill training in areas that are
traditionally associated with men. This was particularly true for the FPI industry where
mechanization of processes is increasing. One of the enterprises in the FPI unit in Pune
has been endeavouring to promote gender-equal and gender-responsive employment
opportunities. They are trying to train women in machine operation and electrical
maintenance, tasks that are traditionally done by men. A women manager in the
enterprise shared:

         Women are very hesitant to take on activities traditionally associated with men. It took
         us almost three years to get five women trained on the machine. They were very hesitant
         to do the work. They feel under-confident and also shy of what others might say to them
         for taking on men’s work.

Fourth, owing to lack of mobility, restriction on timing of work as well as dual
responsibility of women, women are unwilling to take higher-skilled tasks as those jobs
often require workers to take an additional work, stay longer at work or do night shifts.
As suggested by both workers and owners of the RMG cluster, women opt for
“regularity of work” rather than “career growth”.

The low presence of women in managerial and technical positions

There is poor presence of women in technical, managerial or strategy-related jobs – this
is attributed to their low mobility and lack of adequate skills83, 84. Women’s presence in
the workforce of the units visited across clusters is largely found in the category of
worker as opposed to mid-level management. Their presence in the mechanical,
technical or supervisory positions was either nil or less than 30%.

One of the reasons is that in small-sized units after the position of an owner and a few
managers there are not many supervisory roles. In all the 4 units visited in the RMG
cluster the main supervisory positions were held by men. In one of the relatively larger
units there was one woman supervisor working under the main supervisor.

Supervisor positions typically entail much more responsibility and longer hours of work.
Women, we were told, are disinclined to take on these roles owing to their dual
responsibilities issues of safety and lack of confidence of managing workers. As one of
the senior checkers in one of the units in pointed out:

         I am counted as a senior but one of the difficulties I face (in my work) is that I am not
         able to be strict enough. I cannot scold people easily. I like to stay peacefully. I need

         be stricter but I cannot be strict... Ladies listen more – men also listen but their ego
         gets hurt. Women are more understanding than men.

In the three small and medium enterprises in the FPI Cluster in Pune, apart from the
factory floor, women’s presence in the other sections was low. Only one of the units had
a woman manager for production who had risen through the ranks. This company had a
pro-women policy and had made a conscious effort to bring her to that position,
providing her the necessary skill sets on the job.

Another reason cited for the poor presence of women in managerial roles was that
women typically have short work tenures due to marriage or family responsibilities and
thus companies prefer to hire men; additionally because enterprises invest in the training
and specialization of their employees, they prefer to do so with people who are easier to
retain. As one of the women finance manager of the family-run, male-owned enterprise
explained:

         Our company promotes women. We would love to have more women in the lab. But
         what do we do? We can’t change the gender norms in our society. Typically when young
         unmarried women apply for these positions, within two years of their joining they get
         married. Once they marry they either have to move to their husband’s place of residence
         or give up working. We invest in them for two years and then we are left high and dry.
         Even married women prioritize their families. Despite our best efforts to retain her, a
         senior woman accountant ultimately left her job to look after her ailing son.

The only women managers we met were in two small and medium enterprises which
were owned by their families. One woman manager looked after finance and the other
managed production and procurement of machines for her company. This, according to
her, was an exception and despite being in this position for six years, people still remind
her that she is in a ‘man’s job’. Women were completely absent in the marketing and
sales division of these enterprises.

Another reason for the lower presence of women in mechanical positions, even at
supervisory levels, is because the worker level staff in such teams are usually men.
Having a woman supervisor for a male team is seen as a disadvantage. As one male
machine maintenance supervisor in Pune told us,

         Maintenance cannot have a woman supervisor because the work has to be done in a team – the
         supervisor has to substitute specific workers if they are absent. The supervisor should be able to
         do all the tasks required in the maintenance team. It is not enough to tell the workers what to
         do – he should be able to do them. What if all the workers go on strike?

In our analysis we find that gender-stereotyping of skills and gender norms equally
hamper women’s career opportunities, restricting them often to low-skill and low-ranked
job profiles.

Gender Stereo-typing of Jobs

The adverse impact of gender stereotyping of work on women’s labour force
participation in India has been widely acknowledged 85 . In our sample we found that
gender-stereotyping of work affects the jobs women get and also inhibits their growth
potential.

Not only do employers’ gender-stereotype job roles but women workers also internalize
these and hesitate from taking on different roles. Other than the social conditioning,
factors like physical ability to undertake heavy manual work also plays an important role.

For example, in the units of the RMG cluster there were no men in the ‘thread cutting’ in
any enterprise. Mostly less-educated, older women with less employment opportunities
are employed as thread-cutters. An entrepreneur explained that this task is considered
exclusively for women,

         Thread-cutting is an extremely mindless and unskilled job. Men will get irritated and
         annoyed because of its repetitive and mindless nature. Women keep chatting and
         cutting. Older women are more likely to take up this work and have no growth
         aspiration. Similarly the tedious task of coding cut material to communicate design
         specifications to stitches is better done by women because their nimble fingers allow them
         to work faster…

While men are considered to work on denims and heavy fabrics because it requires
physical strength; women are considered only for more work on cotton fabrics since it
was a lighter cloth to work with. The stereotyping of women as not being able to handle
heavier cloth exists despite the presence of women who do work on denims in the same
enterprise.

In some cases it is the lack of confidence among the women themselves that worked to
their disadvantage in moving to higher skilled jobs. Talking about her women workers, a
woman entrepreneur in the RMG industry told us,

       Their confidence level is very low; they get shaken up easily. If they feel they can’t handle
       the machine for two days they want to leave, they are disheartened.

                                                    and

       Women feel they cannot go up from thread cutting. I want to teach them to become
       operators – boys will come and ask for a chance. An old lady I can understand – I
       never tell them to learn. But even young girls are not ready. But some say ok if you say
       just try.

Women are also mostly absent in the designing, layering and cutting activities in the
enterprises. Layering and cutting are simultaneous tasks wherein tens of layers of cloth
are measured; placed continuously and cut in one go either by hand or using a semi-
mechanized process. Layering and cutting require strength and physical movement –
often the cutting master has to climb up and sit on tables. Enterprise owners and
supervisors perceive that women would not be comfortable doing this task because of its
physicality.

Women although fully capable of undertaking certain skilled tasks are excluded from
those because of continuing perception of men’s traditional roles. The most skilled job
of a pattern master, mainly done by men, does not rely on physical strength alone but
also in dexterity, a characteristic mostly associated with women. We were given to believe
that in the entire cluster there may only have been one or two women pattern masters.
Historically men have been associated with tailoring as it required them to be in public
spaces and dealing with customers that women were restricted from doing. Owing to this
tradition there is an instituted norm in the RMG sector that men and not women are
more suitable to be pattern masters. Excluding women from this skilled job also has
strategic advantage for the units. Pattern masters, cutters etc. are often required to put in
longer hours of work and late shifts as they have to get the material ready for sewing in
the morning shifts. Since women are unable to do these shifts owners prefer to have men
for these positions.

Similarly, women in the FPI are less likely to be hired for jobs requiring machine
operations as these are seen more suitable for men. Consequently, as units become
larger and more mechanized there is likely to be a reduction in the proportion of women
in the workforce.

         The machine operators also need to know some machine maintenance. That is why the persons
         working on the bigger machines are mostly men. We train them in the basics of machine
         maintenance so that if something goes wrong sometimes they can fix it themselves. It is not that
         women operators cannot learn this but so far no women have shown any initiative to learn
         machine maintenance. In my previous job there was one woman operator who had learned basic
         machine maintenance.

Essentialist ideas of women and their abilities often impair their prospects for better
employment opportunities. Women workers are perceived as being more conscientious
and less wasteful of work time, they are considered to be nimble, dexterous and patient
hence they are often given low-end, laborious manual jobs that men tend to be insincere
with and unwilling to do. Women’s restriction on mobility, time and the need to take on
dual responsibilities also influence decisions employers make on hiring for higher level
positions. These would be positions in sales and marketing where women are expected to
travel.

As discussed earlier in the context of the FPI units, the inevitability of marriage, the
possibility of women dropping out of the job market after marriage and the anticipated

to employers.



Terms of Employment

Types of recruitment vary across type of skills

The pattern of recruitment of workers may vary across micro, small and medium
enterprises. In the micro and small units, workers are recruited directly through an
informal process. Two RMG units in the sample were set up jointly with an
entrepreneur and a production supervisor. These supervisors came with good knowledge
of informal labour networks and experience in the industry.

Setting up units within physical clusters is advantageous to both entrepreneurs and
workers. In Ahmedabad, the concentration of a large number of garment units makes
for favourable employment for workers in that they have options to move between jobs.
An entrepreneur in Ahmedabad told us that she chose to open her enterprise in Narol
because it was close to residential areas for workers. The long association of Gujarat
with cloth production, milling, and spinning has contributed to the ease with which
women’s labour has moved into garment manufacturing. One entrepreneur explained to
us that

         It is in the culture of the place, there are a lot of garmenting units here, there are a lot
         of industrial set ups. Once you set up your unit people will come asking you if you need
         workers.

In the FPI and electronics manufacturing clusters recruitment was also done directly in
the micro and small units. Recruitment was mostly through word of mouth, through
informal networks and when workers come seeking employment. Occasionally, the
employers may do a background check through known sources. Workers were recruited
mostly through informal procedures and there were no differences reported in the
recruitment patterns of men or women.

Most of the labour supply in the small and medium units in the Ahmedabad and Pune
cluster was locally recruited. Contract labour was present only in one unit which was
medium-sized in the Pune cluster. The unit had expanded its operations exponentially in
a short span and met its labour supply indirectly through labour contractors.

Indirect recruitment of labour through contractors has implications on the kinds of
benefits and wages workers receive. They are referred to as contract labour and it is the
category of unskilled workers where owners do not have to provide any discretionary
benefits. Contract labour is cheaper and seasonal allowing employers to hire as per their
requirement with no obligation to retain them or regularize their contacts.86 Also as is

well noted women contract labour are often are underpaid, vulnerable to sexual
exploitation and are subject to inhumane living conditions.87

Women comprising the bulk of the unskilled labour are categorized as ‘casual
labour’

In a UN Women Policy Brief on Gender Issues in MSMEs 88 it is observed that typically
piece-rate workers are faced with low wages, inappropriate working conditions, an
absence of social security, maternity benefits and sexual harassment provisions, decline in
the number of work days available and conversion to casual and temporary status. These
were not evidenced in our sample of enterprises although the literature does point to the
adverse consequences of non-contract based employment.

Whether recruited directly or indirectly unskilled workers in the units across the clusters
we sampled have no contractual arrangement for employment. In fact the official
registration of an employee does not require a contract. Most workers on the shop floor
do not have contracts even if their employment is formalized in a registered enterprise.
Their becoming formal means that their names are entered into the factory register
which is proof of their employment. This is the register that compliance inspectors
would see to know the number of employees in an enterprise. If the name is not in the
register the worker is treated as a casual worker. Both types of workers can be paid on
daily wages which may be given weekly, monthly or fortnightly. Thus for those whose
names are not on the registers, despite having long tenures in the units where they work
they still get categorized as ‘wage’ or ‘casual’ labour.

In the RMG cluster, since most work done by women is on a piece-rate basis enterprises
do not count these workers as ‘permanent’. The skilled labour does not have contractual
arrangements. Their names are entered into a ‘register’ maintained by the units. Once
their names are entered into a register, they are considered ‘permanent’ or salaried
employees and are entitled to certain benefits of the company. A similar arrangement is
followed for the workers in the FPI units. Only the managerial and technical staff in the
FPI units are employed through formal processes and have contract-based employment.

Women, comprising the bulk of the unskilled labour and along with their low presence in
the managerial and technical staff, tend be employed under non-contractual
arrangements. Labelled as ‘casual labour’ these workers enjoy no benefits from the
companies.

Bengaluru was the exception where workers are provided contracts as permanent
employees of the unit. IT Hardware and Electronics Manufacturing represents a skill-
oriented and organized industry which translates into a wider safety net for its employees
as well. In our sample, employees either benefited from state employee insurance
schemes or their company provided medical insurance. Provisions for leave, bonuses,
and provident funds were also available for all employees.



Wage differential between men and women exists both among workers as well as
employees.

Wage discrimination is one of the key challenges faced by women workers.89 In the case
of the RMG industry for example, where piece rate payment is the norm, the wages per
piece paid to women and men making similar products is not different. However, wage
differential between men and women arises due to a mismatch of hours of factory work
and piece rate system in tailoring. Women workers cannot maximize their earnings in the
piece rate system because they cannot earn after usual work hours due to various socio-
cultural and legal constraints. Women’s safety is a concern both at the factory site and in
the commute from the workplace to their homes. Hence, women are mostly disallowed
from staying past 5:30-6:30 pm.90 This is a legally binding condition of work for women -
Section 66 of the Factory’s Act, 1948 prevents women from working in factories
between 7 pm and 6 am. The Convention does not apply to women holding positions of
a managerial or technical character or to women employed in health and welfare services
who are not ordinarily engaged in manual work. The amendment to the Factory’s Act in
2005 modifies these clauses but relaxes them only to an extent.91

In our sample across clusters we found that women workers and employees earned less
than their male counterparts for similar jobs. While in some cases differential wages were
paid for the same work, in others because women were largely employed in unskilled and
low skilled work and were unable to do extra shifts or late shifts, they tended to earn less
than their male counterparts.

Table 17 gives an overview of wages in the sample enterprises reported by workers and
employees in our sample enterprises across the three clusters. These wages have not been
disaggregated skill-wise because we were asked by several enterprise owners not to
collect this information from the workers. The range of salaries for women and men is
thus across various skill levels. Similarly, this range encompasses persons with different
conditions of work: wages for persons paid on a daily-wage basis, contract labour, and
salaried employees.

Table 17’s calculations have the same limitations of the data in Table 18 but nonetheless
is indicative of what we have noted elsewhere – the RMG sector employs skilled women
even though the classification and modes of skilling may be informal; the FVP cluster in
Pune the sample consisted of a majority of minimally skilled women; the ESDM cluster
had more educated women in general (senior secondary school) but they still comprised
the lower skilled production jobs.

In the FPI units since we met very few workers and employees were comfortable
discussing wages, the understanding of wage differences between men and women
workers were largely drawn from the owners. According to the owners, women are
employed in the unskilled and low skilled jobs they therefore tend to earn less than men.
Male workers even though categorized as unskilled are employed in tasks that require
much more physical exertion like machine operators and lifters and tend to be paid
more. For instance in a women-owned medium enterprise, the unskilled women workers
were paid Rs. 180/day and the men unskilled workers were paid Rs. 280/day. According
to the owner she paid men workers more not only because they did the “heavy work”
but also because men “need to be paid more”. She explained that: “in our culture it is only
appropriate that men be made more than women as they are the main providers of their household ”.
This view was echoed by two other entrepreneurs in the cluster as well as by some of the
other stakeholders in the cluster. As noted by one women entrepreneur, “Men think they
are worth more and women always have household problems”.

Terms of Employment and Working Conditions

Employed mostly as ‘casual labour’, women workers are not entitled to benefits

Across clusters the workers’ benefits were dependent on the terms of employment. The
technical and managerial staff enjoyed the maximum benefits and the casual labourers
the least. The ‘permanent’ workers were entitled to ESIC and Provident Fund. Women
comprising the bulk of the ‘casual labour’ in these units were not entitled to benefits; if
they did receive benefits it was at the discretion of the employers.

In the RMG industry, while casual labour received no benefits, owners on their part
seemed reluctant to provide the entitled benefits to ‘permanent workers’ as well. All
enterprises that are registered under the Factory’s Act, 1984 are mandated under the Act
to provide provident fund, social security and health insurance to their employees. They
are also mandated to provide at least three month maternity leave to women employees.
Labour laws however have induced inflexibility in the clothing industry and led to smaller
units to circumvent these laws.92 In our sample of RMG units, owners were reluctant to
register their units under the Factory’s Act. They stated that since most of their workers
were paid on a piece-rate basis, they were considered not as employees and thus were not
entitled to any benefits. Only one entrepreneur had instituted provident fund for workers
and had to convince the workers to contribute their share of the fund, as they were
reluctant to contribute from their income.

Three of the five FPI units visited were registered under the Factory’s Act but where
contractors were used to recruit labour owners were not mandated to provide them
benefits. Only the skilled workers and the managerial and technical staff were given
health insurance, maternity leave and provident fund.

Some progressive employers, like a unit in Pune that has a policy of promoting women’s
employment, provides most benefits informally. According to the owner, women are
allowed to take two or three month maternity leave with assurance of getting back their
jobs when they are ready to join. The enterprise also supports the women workers with
securing school admission for their children and health emergencies in the family. The
workers are also given three vegetables from the enterprise every day. Workers
interviewed in this unit also confirmed these benefits. The enterprise has recently started
a health insurance policy for their casual workers. All these benefits however are not part
of an entitlement since casual labour often is not covered by regulations. However it is
part of benefits that the company provides at its own discretion because of its pro-
women policy. This model illustrates how women workers can be retained through
means other than the usual worker safety nets of ESIC, PF.

Similarly, a garment entrepreneur in Ahmedabad underlines the importance of social
security benefits for workers.

Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                                  83 / 128
         We have always followed the PF rule. I would have done that even if no one had told
         me because I believe in worker benefits. Now no one refuses the deductions for their
         benefits like PF and ESI. My workers don’t have a choice. Anyone who works here
         has to be part of it.

Other entrepreneurs, however, keep such deductions voluntary and leave it to the
workers’ preference. In this kind of situation some workers prefer to take the entire
wage rather than have some deducted towards social security benefits.

Directly recruited casual labour in the FPI and RMG units may enjoy some
concessionary benefits from the employers, contract labour do not have the guarantee of
receiving their wages as they are paid directly to the contractors. As we learnt from one
of the medium to large enterprise that engages 400 contract labourers (50% or more of
which are women) the company does not deal with the labour directly on issues of wages
and benefits having no obligations to the workers.

Proximity, safety and working conditions are important considerations for women
in seeking and retaining jobs

It became apparent that women were more likely to stay in a job where the enterprise
owner was female, a comfortable social group (family members, husbands, friends),
constant work and a fair and safe commute. A worker in an RMG unit told us,

         In other enterprises you find more men working there. It is nice to work with other
         women – there is a safety in working here. If there are few women, men say things.
         There are men-women issues in other enterprises but here madam keeps an eye.

Men on the other hand were reported to easily change jobs prioritizing income and salary
over other concerns. The several workers we spoke to in the various units corroborated
these insights. Enterprise owners across clusters too reported that women were easier to
retain if they were given good working conditions, steady supply of work and hence
opportunity to earn.

Proximity to workplace is an important factor for women in the recruitment and
retention of women workers. Issues of safety and ease of getting home early to take care
of household chores is a priority for women making them prefer working close to home.

All units visited across clusters in Pune and Ahmedabad had fair working conditions for
women. All units with male and female staff had separate toilets for women, the work
spaces well ventilated and fairly spacious though ever they all lacked crèche facilities. The
Bengaluru enterprises had fair working conditions for women as well. Some enterprises
which were oriented towards more skill-based work (software programming with
hardware manufacture – as was the case in two of our sample enterprises) working
conditions were good. The Electronics City in Bengaluru, where one of our sample
enterprises was located, was the only clustering of industries to have a crèche facility (in
fact, it has more than one). In the industries without crèche facilities women workers

noted that family support (by way of extended families) was necessary to manage
childcare and wage work.

Most women-owned small and medium enterprises in the FPI cluster in Pune had a
sexual harassment policy in place. Women owners took extra caution to ensure the safety
of women. In the enterprise that endeavours to provide a women-friendly work
environment in Pune, they always did a background check before recruiting any worker,
whether man or woman to ensure that either the male workers or husbands of the female
workers did not have a reputation of being trouble makers.

Women workers preferred women-owned units as women owners tend to be more
empathetic towards their gendered needs at the workplace. In the RMG cluster in
particular the owners considered women workers to be more loyal as many of the
women workers had been long-time workers in their unit. Women workers in response
are willing to make extra efforts to retain their jobs in the enterprises. For example, even
though an RMG unit had recently relocated to an area at the outskirts of the Ahmedabad
city, a women worker who had been working there for 12 years, continued to commute
long distance in order to be able to be with this enterprise.

         It takes me 35-40 minutes to come here. If I miss the bus I come in a shuttle and
         have to pay more. Travelling here is a problem but we have worked here for many
         years and have good relationship with madam. Madam pays for my bus pass. So I do
         not need to find work elsewhere. There are many offers I get from nearby; it is not
         difficult to find work closer to home. But for years we have worked here. I will get
         more money there…(but) madam has kept us for so many years – no complains
         working here.

Additionally, we found that in women-owned micro and small units - because of their
size and scale of operation - are amenable to being more women-friendly and are willing
to provide working conditions that suit women. In the more medium and large
operations the management is dispersed and decentralized and women owners are
typically are unable to maintain either a close vigil or empathetic bonds with their women
workers. A sentiment that was echoed across units especially in the RMG and some units
in the Pune cluster, women workers preferred working in women-owned enterprises as
they found them more understanding of their needs and also with more beneficence.
Additionally, they felt safer in these units.

Skills are mostly are acquired on the job; options for upward mobility is limited

Factory floor workers, both men and women, across the two clusters either come with
previous work experience or learn their skills on the job. Formal skill training for the
worker category was not mandated nor institutionalized in the RMG and FPI clusters.
For the low and semi-skilled jobs, units across the two clusters preferred to train them
on the specific processes and operations of their units and therefore do not give much
weightage to their previous trainings.




Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                       85 / 128
While in the RMG clusters, the only training workers come with may be on the sewing
machine, in the FPI units we were given to believe that there is no formal training
available as every unit has their own distinct process of preparing the product and that
any previous training in any other unit does not count- be it hand work or machine work.
Thus a worker category is always considered as ‘unskilled’ notwithstanding the fact that
he or she may have several years of pervious work experience. Years of experience in a
particular task does not usually enable a person to move up within the production chain
or tasks of an enterprise. Only proactive workers with an aim to learn new skills may be
able to do so.

The impression we got from workers and owners especially in the RMG cluster is that
while women largely tend to remain in unskilled and semi-skilled jobs, men aspire and
acquire the required skill sets and move up the ranks to skilled jobs. The workers with
the highest skill (design master, sample master) in the RMG cluster we interviewed had
gained skills on the job as helpers and have over the years moved from being semi-skilled
to skilled. There were also instances of women helpers who had risen to the ranks of
sewing operators by learning the skills in their lunch hours. The skill up-gradation in this
case requires a worker to use his or her own time either after working hours or during
breaks in work time (like the lunch hour). In the IT Hardware and Electronics
Manufacturing cluster in Bengaluru the women we encountered were in the less skilled
jobs. While a small set wanted to change their job role with increased responsibility they
said they were constrained by their low educational qualifications.

Consequently, there are limited opportunities for technical work advancement for
women and they remain as low skilled workers. Due to social conditions and gender-
based constraints they are also not aspirational or ambitious to acquire these skills as it
might be with men. This implies that there is a dual disadvantage forcing women low-
skilled workers to remain in a low-level equilibrium trap of having a job and retaining it.

 Box 8: Gap Inc.’s Personal Advancement and Career Enhancement (P.A.C.E.) program
                          for women garment factory workers

      Globally the garment industry is one of the largest employers of low-skilled female workers.
      Despite their large numbers in the workforce, relatively few female line workers advance to
      positions of supervisors and managers, as they have few opportunities to enhance their managerial
      and life skills that would enable their professional and personal growth.

      In response to this need, Gap Inc. initiated the Gap Inc. P.A.C.E. (Personal Advancement &
      Career Enhancement) life learning program. Research, design and development began in late 2005
      and a pilot program was launched in 2007 in two garment factories in India. The program has
      since expanded to Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

      The Personal Advancement and Career Enhancement (P.A.C.E.) Program aims to empower and
      build educational and workplace skills of young women in Gap Inc.-contracted manufacturing
      facilities around the world. As a factory-based program, the main focus of the Gap Inc. P.A.C.E.
      program is to positively impact female garment workers (FGWs) by providing them with
      foundational skills and support that will help them advance in the workplace and in their personal
      lives, through life skills education and technical training. By creating a sustainable and scalable
      program Gap Inc. thus seeks to achieve both social and business goals – improve the lives of
      FGWs in a meaningful and measurable way and have a bottom line impact on the vendors’
      operations.

      The education and training focus on nine modules: communication, problem solving and

Dual responsibilities constrain women’s potential for income growth

Women’s care responsibilities have been recognized as one of the major impediments
affecting women’s participation in the workforce in India. This was clearly borne out for
the sampled workers. The fact that women have dual responsibilities and are constrained
for time, underlies several of the limitations or disadvantages that women face in
advancing at the work place, including those that are self-imposed.

Dual responsibilities and the constraints it places on women’s personal time often
stymies their growth potential. In the RMG units, for example, women workers are
unable to rise to the levels of pattern masters and cutting masters, the higher skilled
workers, as they are unable to give the extended time required to acquire the necessary
skills to become masters. Additionally these tasks entail more responsibility and longer
hours at work. Master cutters are required for longer hours when a firm has to deliver a
large order. Women workers, due to their household responsibilities, are unable to meet
these additional work time requirements. Even through women entrepreneurs appreciate
and acknowledge the fact that women are better karigars, more responsible and
hardworking, they are unable to depend on them entirely for key responsibilities in the
units. As one of the entrepreneurs stated,

         It’s hard to run a unit just with women workers, the unit owner will not be in a good
         position. Women are not career-oriented because they have so many other
         responsibilities like housework. Women work as income generators.

The constraints on time are perhaps one of the primary reason why women are seen to
be less aspirational. Among the RMG unit workers, women workers were split between
wanting to maintain a status quo in terms of their position, skills, income and wanting to
gain higher skills. Age is a determining factor in this regard. But there were more men
than women that wanted to increase their working speed to increase their income. While
men saw themselves as primary providers for the household; women perceived their
incomes as supplementary. They desired higher incomes and they seem to have ‘income
aspirations’ not ‘career aspirations’.

Safety and Security issue may limit women’s potential for growth

While women may have time constraints that prevent them from staying longer hours, it
is coupled with the reluctance of owners to keep women for evening or night hours due
to security concerns.

         Women workers are willing to stay back late if I stay back too. Their family members
         feel safe about their working late if they know that madam is also going to be there.
         This is not always possible for me. - Woman entrepreneur

Given the frequent need to stay back beyond regular hours to complete large or sudden
orders, workers who are able to give those extra hours are able to take on more

responsibilities. Clearly the woman entrepreneurs are affected by the same gender
socialization and constraints as the workers. The entrepreneurs acknowledge that women
had the potential to do any of the tasks if they had the aspiration and will power. But
structural factors of safety and gender expectations make the concerns more complex
beyond personal aspirations. Concerns around safety in public spaces were also aired by
women workers. Their choice of workplace was often decided on ease of access and
safety. Women workers in our sample stated that they mostly travelled in groups and
ensured that they did not have to stay late hours at work.

                    GENDER ANALYSIS OF TECHNOLOGY CENTRES

Introduction

The Central Tool Room and Training Center (CTTC), Bhubnaeswar, the Indo-German
Tool Room (IGTR), Ahmedabad and the Flavours and Fragrance Development Center
(FFDC), Kannauj were conceptualized in the late 80s and set up with donor funding in
1991, with all three becoming operational in the period of 1993-4. The tool rooms were
set up with the aim to make the Indian small enterprises sector competitive for global
markets as the sector had a history of being protected from global economic forces
through subsidies. As the General Manager of the IGTR explained the tool rooms were
set up to modernize the Indian small enterprise sector through mechanization, tooling
and technology.

The CTTC and IGTR have similar objectives, programs and functioning since they are
engaged with engineering industries; the FFDC caters to a different market segment and
hence has certain sector-specific objectives. The tool rooms have three aims: (i) to supply
skilled manpower to industry through training courses; (ii) to provide consultancy
services for MSMEs to improve product quality and productivity; (iii) to create tools,
dyes and moulds for MSMEs. The last objective is common to the CTTC and IGTR.
The FFDC provides training, consultancy services and product development assistance
for the entire value chain of the flavors and fragrance industry.

In this study we have also assessed the Technology Centres for MSMEs from a gender
lens to understand the differential constraints women face in the training and placements
offered and the policy implications of these.

TC and MSME linkage for employment and support locally is weak

Initially funded jointly by the Government of India and donor agencies (e.g. DANIDA),
in early 2000 all three technoloy centres (TC) became self-sustaining, autonomous bodies
registered under the Society’s Act. For technology centres, strategic decisions and the
management of affairs rests with a governing body which is headed by the Development
Commissioner (MSME), Govt of India. The TCs are mandated to act as common
facility centers for local micro, small and medium enterprises. Effectively, this depends
on the nature of industrial development of the area and state.

The CTTC, Bhubaneswar is not a common facility centre while the IGTR, Ahmedabad
is. The reason for this is based on the MSME scenario of the state of Odisha, which had
also posed as a threat to the financial viability and sustainability of the TC. Odisha mostly
has mineral processing industries and other than this there are some fabrication units for
plastics, non-metal casting, toy making, wood carving (home-based micro enterprises).
The GM of the CTTC explained that there were no industries to avail the resources of
the CTTC when it first began. Odisha had no engineering industries that required the
TC’s assistance. The CTTC had to reach out to industries like ISRO in Bangalore to
remain self-sustaining.

Small-scale enterprises approach the IGTR, Ahmedabad for creating moulds and tools.
The Head of Production explained that first-time entrepreneurs who have an idea of
what they want to create will ask for the TC’s consultancy services to produce an
economical product.

Kannauj hosts two clusters related to the FFDC – an itra and incense cluster – with the
latter being under the Ministry of MSME. The TC holds monthly meetings with
enterprise owners of the itra clusters and helps them with quality assessments and
product development. Since there is no local industry on flavours and fragrance in
Kannauj, FFDC is unable to provide any local support on this.

All three TCs however are mandated to assist MSMEs and report on MSME units
assisted annually. Fourty percent of entrepreneurs that visit FFDC do so to seek
technical support and solutions related to fragrance, flavors and aroma therapy while
twenty percent visit for product development. The table below briefly indicates the
performance of TCs with MSME units and other units. It is important to note that there
is no reporting on units (MSME or otherwise) being present in local economy.

TCs role and Entrepreneurship Development is not optimal

The TCs by design are not mandated to promote entrepreneurship development as
linked to their technical trainings. Consequently none of their institutionalized long-term
and short-term courses have modules focused on entrepreneurial skills development.
CTTC offers no Entrepreneurial Development Program; IGTR offered a one-time EDP
training. The long-term courses at FFDC also don’t include any component on
entrepreneurial skills. As per the faculty at FFDC, the centre has included EDP in the 3
months course on flavors and fragrance that they instituted this academic year. The
students however suggested that more than entrepreneurial skills, the course included
components on management and life-skills required for job-seeking.

Perhaps for the lack of focus on entrepreneurial skills not many trainees set up their own
enterprises. In CTTC, of female trainees met there, only three had thought about
starting their own enterprises. One trainee said she had proposed this idea to her father
who readily accepted, suggesting that she start a press tool making enterprise. Another
trainee expressed the difficulties involved in starting one’s own enterprise - not having
enough funds. Another said she felt underequipped to start her own business because
she did not know how to do marketing and take care of administrative issues.

       CTTC Female Student: Yes, I also want to start but it is difficult. We are young right now
       so we do not have any money. I am still a student and I don’t have money. We also don’t know
       how to do marketing and administration.

None of the girls in IGTR that we spoke to expressed any desire to start their own
enterprises. They want to work in large companies and have no hesitation working with
men on the shop floor.

In FFDC the absence of enterprise development skills or information is particularly
conspicuous for the sponsored program like that of NIESBUD or DRDA as they are
aimed at entrepreneurship development.



Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                             91 / 128
While the TCs do report on the number of short-term EDPs that take place during the
year, there is no reporting nor follow up on whether these programs lead to the
development of new enterprises. FFDC does provide informal, adhoc handholding and
information on the processes of setting up an enterprise to participants as and when they
seek it. It seems only one of the women trainees of the NIESBUD-supported training
had set up her own enterprise. The officials at the CTTC also provided similar
impressionistic information indicating that three of their trainees started their own
enterprises.



Training

In all three TCs training is one of the main products and primary source of revenue
generation. The mandate for TCs is to be a self-sustaining model and training is an
important strategy for this. Each tool room offers its own combination of courses of
varying durations. TCs have a few institutionalized and standardised long-term courses.
The short-term courses of varying duration have evolved over the years and are mostly
demand-driven by industry and students.

In the CTTC, the courses range in duration from one month to four years. The CTTC
offers popular four-year courses, one in tool and dye making and the second in
mechatronics. The four year courses take in students straight after high school offering
three years of classroom training and one year practical training in-house or in a
company of the student’s choice. The long-term courses can take in students after high
school or after graduation (See Table 21).

FFDC offers two long-term courses of one year each. The long-term courses were
introduced only four years ago in affiliation with Forest Research Institute (FRI) in
Dehradun and Mewar University in Rajasthan. The older training courses vary from six
months to three days and are customized as per needs of their clients which include the
government, non-government organisations, industry partners and MSME enterprises.
Trainings are held both on and off-site.

The strength of training offered by TCs comes from its orientation to teaching practical
skills that can immediately be put to use on the shop-floor. Hands-on training on
traditional and state of the art machinery is a strong factor in attracting students. In all
TCs the production activities of the trainings complement each other where the tool
room’s batch-production orders are fulfilled by supervisory staff and the student body.
In engineering-focused centres of Ahmedabad and Bhubaneswar students are exposed to
the working conditions on shop floors and the systems of standardization and
certification (ISO). The GM of the CTTC, Bhubaneswar explained that the tool room’s
production unit had three shifts comparable to any other working factory to ready
students for real life working conditions– including long working hours and the laborious
and strenuous nature of factory floor work.

*Data from Annual Reports of TCs 2012-13




In the following sections the analysis of gender outcomes of various trainings is
presented focusing on a few key areas- measures in place to ensure the participation of
women, the status of women’s participation, the existence of gendered preferenc e of
courses and the gender-responsive provisions and infrastructure of the TCs.

Incentives to ensure women’s participation are available only from government
sponsored programs

In all TCs visited there are no specific measures taken or incentives provided to attract
women candidates for long-term courses. All TCs advertise their standardized long-term
courses in local and national newspapers. Most trainees spoken to had applied for the
course through the newspaper advertisement, through word of mouth or former
students. CTTC and FFDC are well known in their fields and thus tend to have more
candidates soliciting information directly. Their shorter-term courses are largely
customized for the need of the clients, who sponsor their candidates in which case the
students come pre-selected for the courses. Neither the CTTC nor the IGTR have their
own scholarships for women students for any courses offered.

Provisions and incentives for women candidates, as a part of their larger policy on social
inclusion, are available through national and state-level government programs only. For
example in CTTC students from the North-East Region receive full concessions on fees,
costs of lodging and food from the Development Office of the North-East Region. In



Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                              93 / 128
IGTR government reimburses the fees and lodging cost for women trainees only if the
trainee gets placed in a job and is retained in a company for one year.

In FFDC no government sponsorship is available for their one year courses. In the
recent past FFDC has undertaken special government sponsored short-term trainings
targeting women. In 2013 District Rural Development Authority (DRDA) funded FFDC
to train several local women SHG groups on dhoop and agarbati making. In 2013-2014
NIESBUD funded FFDC to train 100 candidates (both men and women) on essential
oils and cosmetic making of which half were women participants. For government-
sponsored training programmes the TCs may recruit candidates locally or nationally
based on the criteria set by the government. In such training programs, as was the case in
the NIESBUD sponsored program, the 45 day training course was advertised in the local
colleges.




Women’s Participation in the training program is less than optimal

The TCs have seen different trends in the presence and participation of women; in all
three cases however the participation of women remains low.

Given that CTTC is much bigger and more robust than IGTR, the total number of
trainees in any given year is much higher compared to IGTR. In the year 2012-2013,
18,297 people were trained at CCTC of which it is estimated only 17% were women (see
Table 22). According to the GM, while the overall participation of women remains low,
there are certain courses where there is a higher concentration of women. For example,
in current batch (2013-14) for Structural Designing Software and Analysis course, out of
a total 150 trainees 60 are women. Although the participation of female trainee continues
to be low as compared to male trainees according to the CTTC Annual Report it been
increasingly incrementally and had gone up from 11% in 2008-9 to 18% in 2013.

IGTR maintains gender disaggregated data. As evident in Table 23, the participation of
women in the IGTR training courses has remained consistently low. It was expected
that numbers of female trainees would increase over the years since there has been an
increase in the numbers of girls opting for engineering colleges nationally but as the GM
of IGTR explained, women find it easier to get into the hospitality and retailing sectors
that require less training and are perceived as more attractive work places.

In FFDC the overall participation of women has shown an upward trend since 2008-9
(Table 24). They have only convened four batches for their Post-Graduate Diploma in
Aroma Technology held in-collaboration with FRI, Dehradun University. From among
10-12 students each year women’s participation has varied from 10-40%. While in the
last batch of twelve trainees there were four women, in the current batch of nine there is
only one woman. The bulk of women’s participation is made up of trainings provided to
farmers and some of the short-term sponsored courses on dhoop and agrabati mainly
aimed at women. In the estimates of the faculty at FFDC, in trainings other than those
targeted specifically at women, the participation ratio tends to be 19:81, including in the
off-site, customised trainings they conduct for their various clients.

Most government sponsored training courses are aimed at people from SCs and STs.
Participant data maintained by TCs is not gender-disaggregated. It is safe to assume that
much of the women participants in the government sponsored programs fall in the
socially marginal categories of SCs and STs. For example FFDC holds a number of
training program on producing low-grade herbal and aromatic cosmetic products and
dhoop and agarbati making for Below Poverty Line (BPL) groups which have a fair
participation of women. And as we know from national level enumeration, sizeable
component of the BPL group is comprised of SCs and STs.

Participation of women in the TCs is influenced by the gender-stereotyping of jobs and
the implications it has on employment opportunities, issues discussed later in the text.
Also the lack of targeting and disadvantageous location like in the case of FFDC may
deter women’s participation.



Gendered preference of training courses

In the engineering-focused TCs there seems to be a gendered preference for courses
trainees opt for. According to the faculty both in IGTR and CTTC, design-based courses
were most popular amongst female trainees. At CTTC Bhubaneswar, of the 35 long and
medium term courses (currently running) there is a presence of women in 16 courses in
varying numbers. Women are more concentrated in courses like, engineering design and
electronics and less in manufacturing and mechanical courses. There were no female
trainees in the courses on machine maintenance. As per the female trainees interviewed,
since machine maintenance requires physical strength and usually involves unclean



Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                              96 / 128
working conditions neither women prefer to taking this course nor the maintenance
department encourages women to take this course.

The gendered preferences of courses in engineering-focused TCs are also an outcome of
the gender-stereotyping of jobs that influences the prospects of placements. As we learn
later in the text, manufacturing firms (involving engineering products and processes)
prefer to hire men and not women. Women are preferred for lab-based or design jobs. In
FFDC too we find that women’s participation in the 3-6 months courses is inhibited by
the prevailing gender-based norms and beliefs. As explained by the GM,

         These courses are aimed at those who may want to set up their own production units.
         Women hesitate from setting up their own units as they are not confident about dealing
         with the market environment on their own. They feel the need for male support for
         marketing, accessing raw material etc. These men also get trained at FFDC.
         Therefore, the ratio changes automatically.

In FFDC there is some gendered preference for the short-term courses. According to
the GM, the most popular courses among women are three-day courses in essential oils,
perfumery, cosmetics and cream, and aroma therapy. Locally, the farmers training are
very popular with women. While the participation of women in their long-term courses
varies, the uptake of the 3-6 months courses on production of favours and fragrance is
also low among women.

Life skills training and gender sensitization are absent in training courses

Currently the IGTR does not have life-skills component in any of the courses it offers.
CTTC integrates various life-skill lessons as part of their teaching strategy e.g.
encouraging and teaching students how to speak with confidence, how to communicate
and interact with team members. FFDC provides some training on body language,
preparedness for interviews and resume writing for jobs in the course on Flavors and
Fragrance offered to foreigners. The trainees in the TCs however felt that training in life-
skills would be very valuable as many of the trainees come from small towns and cities
across the country and have little exposure.

This is especially important for women trainees who because of limited exposure and
opportunities often have poor communication skills making them feel under-confident
about taking up employment far from their hometowns. At FFDC a female student
doing an MPhil in Biotechnology from Kanpur University was at the TC for her project
work. She was extremely shy and mostly remained confined to her room after class. In
her interview with us it became apparent that she felt extremely under-confident about
interacting with other students and had declined several lucrative offers of employment
in Bengaluru.

Location and infrastructure may serve as an disincentive for women’s
participation

Institutes like FFDC that are located in remote geographical locations and have limited
facilities can be restrictive for women and serve as a disincentive for them to enrol.
There were two women trainees at the institute, both had been advised to dress
conservatively and had restricted mobility. In Kannauj it is not considered appropriate
for women to move around in the market unaccompanied. Hence even on the weekends
the women trainees remained confined to the campus. They often requested their male
colleagues to shop for them in the local markets. Also there were no recreational
activities for women in the campus while the male trainees often played football. As the
women suggested if it was not for the fact that FFDC was a specialized institute in their
area of interest, they would never opt to study there due to other gendered
considerations.

       PD sir [Principle Director] has told me to be careful about living here, he has told
       me to be careful about what I wear and about going out alone. He told me it isn’t like
       Dehradun where I’m from. I don’t go out for evening walks or to play. The roads and
       fields are not very safe to walk along because people look at girls very strangely.–
       Female Trainee, FFDC

Low representation of women in the faculty

In all three TCs the presence of women administrative staff and faculty was low to
minimal. FFDC has only one woman, a junior technical staff in the total staff strength
of 12, including technical and non-technical staff. FFDC at any point in time has not had
more than two women staff. In CTTC all 20 of the permanent staff were men. Of the 80
contract-based staff, 20 were women. In IGTR too there was only one women faculty
member.

The low presence of women faculty was explained by fairly gender-specific reasons.
Given that women opting for engineering courses are a more recent phenomenon, there
is less supply of qualified women candidates for recruitment. Also, when recruited
women staff tend to have shorter tenures. Unmarried women usually drop out of their
jobs after marriage as they tend to move where their marital homes are. Married women
may drop out if their husbands are transferred or in pursuit of better medical and
educational opportunities for their children. As one of the woman staff member shared
that she too now does not prefer recruiting unmarried women candidates as they leave
after marriage and the institutes’ investments on her tends to be wasted. In FFDC the
remoteness of the centre also serves as a disadvantage for women.

The few women faculty members interviewed at the TCs offered their perspective on
why women faculty in TCs tends to be low. According to one, the TCs especially in
remote locations tend to be dominated by men who also occupy most of the senior

positions in the faculty. Typically men in superior positions prefer male colleagues and
juniors as they can be more informal and can ask them for personal favours etc. which
they cannot ask of women colleagues and juniors. Also women are hesitant to undertake
field-based assignments which particularly relevant for some TCs like FFDC where the
staff is often required to take on ex-situ assignments. Women also don’t like to stay after
work for any additional or pending tasks as they have care responsibilities at home.

Placements

Placement of women trainees is limited

In all three TCs, job placements are offered only for long-term courses. The TCs do not
have the mandate for placing students enrolled in their short-term courses. The
placement rates of women trainees in the engineering-focused centres are low.

The IGTR data on recruitment and placement of trainees shows a significant difference
in the number of women trainees admitted in a year and the number of women being
placed (See Table 25). In CTTC the placement data was not available.

In FFDC there has been 100% placement of the trainees in the long-term courses but
some of the women candidates do not take up their placement offers for reasons
discussed in the later section.

Placement of women is affected by gender specific factors both on the demand
and supply side

The placement of women trainees by the TCs is influenced by gender-based factors that
operate at the level of the employers and at the level of the women trainees.

The gender-stereotyping of jobs in the engineering sector stymie the prospects of
placement of women trainees. First, as mentioned earlier, given the physicality involved
in the job, women are considered unsuitable for all manufacturing jobs. Second,
manufacturing companies require at least two to three shifts to optimize the productivity
of their machines. Since women employees are not expected to stay longer, they prefer to
hire men for most of their manufacturing divisions.

The Heads of Placement at both the CTTC and IGTR said that women are better suited
for designing work and less for factory-floor or machine-based work. They felt that
designing work can take place in an isolated or segregated room where they do not have
to deal with many male staff. Most companies prefer women for design work as they
feel women are more patient, can sit for long hours and can do more intricate work. Men
on the other hand are unable to show as much patience in designing work. Explaining
the job preference of women trainees, the head of placement at IGTR stated the
following,

         Girls find it hard to work on the shop-floor and to work on machines. They are better
         at making production schedules, planning work. This allows them to sit in a room
         with glass windows overlooking the shop floor to get an aerial view of how work is
         progressing. They aren’t required to go down to the shop floor.

This gender stereotyping was re-iterated by the Head of Placement, CTTC,
Bhubhaneshwar who said:

         Women are best placed to be designers in software/hardware. Designing work can take place in
         an isolated or segregated room where they do not have to deal with many male staff. Most
         companies prefer women for this job as they feel women are more patient, can sit for long hours,
         can do more intricate work. Men on the other hand have too much, too much adrenaline for
         designing work.

Not all women trainees however agree with this stereotyping. Many of female students in
the civil engineering department at CTTC complained that women are not given
important responsibilities in their jobs; they are offered only design jobs and not on-site
work in spite of graduating from civil engineering courses. As one of the trainee pointed
out,

         Companies say that they don’t want female students. They feel that girls don’t do hard
         work. None of the manufacturing companies prefer girls - if they have a choice they will
         take men.

On the supply side, women trainees are hesitant to take up placement offers in distant
places. The TCs are not required to place their students in the same state as the centre.

Odisha does not have a market for trained engineers in the manufacturing sector.
Consequently the trainees from CTTC are placed mostly outside of the state. The lack of
local placement serves as a disincentive for women trainees as their families are averse to
sending them away from home. The management of IGTR and CTTC pointed out that
while there are a few cases of out-of-state placement of women trainees they are more
the exception than rule.

         Students always prefer to stay in Orissa but they don’t get to exercise that choice. Mr Raut
         then gave us an example of a female trainee who was initially placed in CEAT tyres with a
         salary of 13,000 in Gujarat. Her parents called her back and to remain in Orissa she was
         ready to take a job at a smaller firm in Cuttack paying her only 7,000. Her father called
         [me] to help her get placed again at a better firm. –Head of Placement, CTTC,
         Bhubhaneshwar

In FFDC although the placement of the students in the long-term course is hundred
percent, several women candidate have declined the placement because it required them
to be placed outside of their home state, Uttarakhand. This was also the impression given
to us by the two women student we spoke to at the Centre.

Post-placement support to trainees is minimal

There is no institutional mandate for providing post-placement support to placed
students. While IGTR and CTTC offered no post-placement support, in FFDC the
support was provided informally. The students remain in direct touch with the staff and
use their support to problem-solve at the workplace. For example, students may call their
teachers to understand a new process or formulation they have been assigned to develop
in their companies.

TCs do not have a mandate to place trainees in MSME

The TCs do not have a mandate for placing their trainees in MSMEs. In fact, both
CTTC and IGTR management expressed that students would rather be placed in large
companies. Female students at both the CTTC and the IGTR also expressed the same.

According to the management of all three TCs, majority of students from their
respective TCs get placed in large companies. Larger companies also offer higher salaries
e.g. Ashok Leyland will pay a student with a diploma from CTTC Rs. 16,000 whereas
smaller companies would pay them Rs. 6,000. In the case of FFDC there are only few
industries that specialize in flavours and fragrance and currently most of their students
prefer to be placed in the three large multinationals present in India.

Women trainees have better options of employment in larger companies rather than
smaller companies. As the head of placement in CTTC explained, companies that recruit
women have to provide certain amenities like separate toilets, safe transport etc. for
them. While large enterprises are most likely to already have these provisions, smaller
enterprises, being financially unstable, requiring more effort to remain commercially

viable, are not able to provide these amenities at the outset and therefore prefer not to
recruit female staff.

       Smaller companies most likely have to make special provisions to take on female staff
       such as creating toilets for women, taking extra precautions for travel of their female
       employees, dealing with potential conflicts or harassment between male and female staff.
       Since small companies are quite financially unstable and are purely commercial driven it
       does make economic sense take on female staff. – Head of Placement, CTTC,
       Bhubhaneshwar

                        CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Gender Concerns

Our analysis highlights that gender issues forefront all the other challenges faced by
women entrepreneurs and women workers in the MSME sector. Gender norms and
stereotypes cut across many of the challenges that women entrepreneurs face, in starting
up and expanding their businesses. Multiple observations around gender concerns prevail
amongst women entrepreneurs, including: their own limitations in dealing with markets,
perception that men are better at interacting with markets, assumptions of vendors and
facilitating banking institutions that women are risk-averse and other assumptions like
women need to balance family roles and thus may not devote time to their businesses.
Even the growth rates of women’s enterprises are considered to be lower. All of these
concerns underscore the critical need to integrate gender training with entrepreneurial
training as well as gender sensitization of facilitation institutions and industry associations
at all levels.

The obvious policy implication is around gender mainstreaming but this also carries the
risk of trivializing gender i.e. through occasional trainings and gender friendly offices.
Instead, the need is to challenge all institutions (that promote women’s entrepreneurship)
including women themselves, to negotiate new boundaries in terms of women’s roles,
expectation from them, their leadership and management styles and the way they can
access credit, schemes and links with markets and business networks. This would allow
women to create their own mechanisms of transaction and negotiation that would be
different from male entrepreneurs and would be regarded as business savvy and
noteworthy as well. As a women entrepreneur put it:

         Don’t create a category of women entrepreneurs – let there be an entrepreneur who is a
         woman. When you continuously use the term ‘women entrepreneur’ – the men treat you very
         nicely, but they don’t take you seriously.

Women workers face multiple disadvantages both in the options open to them, the terms
of work at entry as well opportunities for their advancement. At each point along this
continuum, from options to opportunities, they are conditioned by gender roles and
expectations from families, employers and their peers. Women’s work is valued and
critical to the value-chain, but relegated to positions at low levels of skill and physicality.
Women do not have the wherewithal to challenge these systems as they are job-
dependent, especially because these jobs offer reasonable hours and convenient locations
to work form. Women still traverse risk in physical spaces to come to work and therefore
accept lower paying jobs closer to home which may give minimal scope for
advancement. Employers also do not create growth trajectories for job advancement
from low to high skill jobs, as these jobs are gender differentiated at the outset.
Challenging norms of what are gender appropriate tasks and why skills get downgraded

for certain tasks are concerns that women are not able to voice, often due to lack of
collective action and strength as well as inability to negotiate for themselves.

Challenges / Opportunities for Women Entrepreneurs

Low registration and Low visibility

We find that very low proportion of women entrepreneurs in the micro as well the small
and medium units register with any authority. There are several constraints that affect
women’s decisions to register their enterprises. First and foremost the size of the
enterprise itself is a barrier because of the resources and time requirements that
registration entails. Small-sized enterprises may also not be equipped or ready to comply
with the requirements mandated of registered enterprises. Entrepreneurs may also not
register in order to avoid tax and labour-related liabilities mandated for registered
units. The larger perception is that registration may involve unnecessary interference and
restrictions. Registration is also a complicated process and officials involved may demand
bribes, which women entrepreneurs are not comfortable with. Most of these enterprises
that choose not to register are distress-driven or survival activities where growth may not
be an immediate concern; registration becomes necessary for growth of an enterprise;
especially in terms of forging partnerships and availing government schemes and
resources.

Therefore, a majority of women-owned enterprises are stuck in the micro and home-
based units and for them the liabilities of registration outweigh the benefits. They are
likely to remain invisible from policy outreach and network connectedness.

Unregistered units by definition are not eligible for any government schemes and
policies. Since DICs also do not maintain any database of unregistered units, they
remain outside the purview of any donor-led interventions.

Registration of MSMEs have now been made voluntary. From the MSME census data
we know that very few enterprises choose to register. The reasons for not registering are
not entirely clear either in the literature or from the primary data. Speculatively, some of
the issues that seem to deter registration may include the scale of the operation, the
hesitation to deal with governments and the unwillingness to deal with compliances
entailed in registration especially at the start-up stage.


                                       RECOMMENDATIONS

       Incentivize registration with minimal compliances for micro and small
        enterprises
       Map gender disaggregated data on both registered and non-registered
        units

Physical clustering in the Cluster Development Approach (CDA)

There seems to be a policy imperative to develop clusters that target women for
incentivizing and promoting their enterprises. But respondents note that CDAs have
limitations because of a range of reasons- In Gujarat an expert noted that it because it
was not the right revenue model since women preferred to be home-based. Many experts
in field too argue women do not like to be relocated in physical clusters especially when
they are micro and small sized due to their preference for working from home. Yet in
Pune FP cluster, the CDA which reached out to a few women conferred clear benefits to
several women-owned micro units such as marketing linkages and branding.

It is difficult to discern in one stroke whether CDAs are effective or not as the
definitions and geographical boundaries of clusters change. While there are different
types of clustering such as physical, virtual, mini etc., that the government recognizes, the
interventions around cluster-based approaches need to be context specific. Therefore
CDAs need to be specified for diverse types and scale of clusters.

                                            RECOMMENDATIONS

      Cluster creation and approaches needs to be made context specific. While
       physical cluster may not be the best approach, virtual cluster for market
       linkages and need-specific training could be beneficial for women. The
       government’s increased flexibility in defining cluster in non-conventional
       ways is in the right direction.
      Cluster oversight and management would also need to be anchored in
       discrete institutions that would be visible and accountable through its
       monitoring, outreach and collection of gender disaggregated data.
      Mini-clusters, clusters for home-based units may enhance the outreach to
       women.
      Cluster specific needs of women enterprises should be informed by need to
       gender disaggregated database.




Low uptake of schemes

Although there are a plethora of schemes women entrepreneurs can avail of they seem to
have availed of only a few. Women are typically targeted for concessions within these
schemes; the schemes mostly focus on start-up capital and training. There is no explicit
targeting for women who are undergoing growth and expansion for their capital
requirements. Schemes inadvertently have a misplaced focus on medium-sized


Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                                105 / 128
enterprises as the provisions and concessions offered may not be utilized by a micro-
sized unit. Since a majority of women entrepreneurs are micro and home-based there is a
need for more relevant schemes for women entrepreneurs who are poised for growth
and lacking skills. Information about schemes is minimal and ad hoc and mostly is
accessed through linkages forged opportunistically. Low levels of membership in
associations’ compounds the problem of lack of awareness further.



                                            RECOMMENDATIONS

            Assess scheme outreach to women through analysis of disaggregated
             data on uptake of schemes.
            Based on assessment, re- design improvements in underutilized
             schemes.
            Monitor scheme use by at least registered women-owned MSMEs
            Introduce new schemes that incentivize growth and expansion of
             micro and home-based units.
            Create mechanisms for enabling better awareness among and
             outreach to women of schemes
            CDPs with a specific focus on women can help to enhance awareness
             and outreach of MSME sector schemes to women.




Lack of gender disaggregated data

It is difficult to assess the situation of women entrepreneurs in the absence of gender-
disaggregated data at most levels- national, state and district. The MSME census provides
aggregate data on women that does not help to assess the local situation. The DICs too
are not consistent in the way data on women is maintained. Programs and interventions
for women need to be informed by situational analysis and appropriate data in order to
make them more effective and context-specific. CDP approaches too could be more
gender responsive if the data was available to assess the situation adequately.

                                        RECOMMENDATIONS

          Create mechanisms to enable more systematic collection of gender-
           disaggregated data on the critical parameters informing the growth
           and development of the MSME sector.
          DIC, Pune has developed special software to collect gender-
           disaggregated data. This is could be improved and replicated across
           states.
          The Ministry of MSME could benefit from using this data to monitor a
           data-based situational analysis of women’s entrepreneurship in the
           sector.
          Maintain gender-budget statements across the sector at regular
           intervals and put out short, data-based status of women’s
           entrepreneurship.
          Gender budget statements across ministries that serve the MSME
           sector would be a useful tool to estimate the overall status of women
           entrepreneur in the sector.
          MSME census could provide a more detailed segment for women
           entrepreneurs and workers as a separate component.

Low uptake of training (entrepreneurship development programs) and need for
diversification

There is low uptake of training programs amongst women entrepreneurs. This is partly
because of lack of information amongst women about these courses, how to use them
and partly related to the content of the EDP. The mismatch in content results from the
fact that at the start-up phase an EDP may be relevant but many women may not have
the time or resources at this stage to take EDP training. They would consider taking
these types of training when they are beyond the start-up and in more of a growth phase.
At this stage the relevant training is managerial, leadership and marketing skills, which
EDPs do not typically include. The EDPs are also diverse and of varying tenure and
women entrepreneurs do not have the wherewithal or information of what is relevant for
them to access.


                                            RECOMMENDATIONS

              Gender trainings relevant to the sector must be included in all
               courses for male and female participants.
              Gender sensitization training of stakeholder institutions is
               recommended.
              EDPs could take the inputs of Associations in designing
               appropriate training as Associations have a key role in what kinds of
               training are offered and what is helpful to women..
              EDP should be offered along with technical training.
              EDPS should include leadership, market and finance relevant skills
               for women.
              Information portal can be set up–to even know who local BDS
               providers are.
              Providing periodic need-based sessions through micro associations
               can be useful. Need to assess whether such opportunities available

Membership of Associations and other Networks

There are few large industry associations with limited outreach to micro and small
enterprises. The fee bias and social exclusivity implies that women entrepreneurs may not
become members. Associations thus have medium and large-scale enterprises as its
membership and the kind of benefits it confers would cater to this size and leave out the
smaller units. There is typically a women’s wing that suffers from a similar neglect
because the association are dominated by male membership and cater to their
enterprises, which are larger in size.
There are immense benefits of associations as they do provide their members access to
information on loans, schemes, training, market linkages and new policies.


                                            RECOMMENDATIONS

              Associations need to cater to MSMEs where micro and unregistered
               units are the norm.
              District-level associations and not just industry-based associations
               need to be expanded to make their membership more women-
               inclusive.
              Smaller size associations are required at the local level.
              Incentivize industry associations to enhance membership of and
               services to women entrepreneurs.
              Encourage women entrepreneurs associations.

Easing Loan Access

The access to finance for women entrepreneurs is shaped by a perception that women-
run enterprises do not grow in size. As documented in secondary literature, banking
institutions tend to ask women entrepreneurs for collateral even when there are
government schemes that provide exemptions. Women entrepreneurs are unable to take
bigger loans (beyond the start-up phase) be it for diversification, innovation, market
research, because they often do not have assets for collateral. As one of the officials at
KASSIA, Bengaluru noted, bankers often act as gatekeepers and create their own system
of barriers which do not exist in policy. According to him “there is a mismatch between
how industrial policy is formed and how bankers see themselves as funders. Banks
should be partners in enterprise development.” The other problem is that women may
need different sized loans for different purposes for which they may not have the
established markets such as in the case of innovation or product diversification. The lack
of existence of differential financial product to meet the needs of women-owned micro
enterprises that are in the growth phase is also an additional concern.

                                            RECOMMENDATIONS

          Provide sensitization training on gender and credit related to financial
           institutions and staff to ease women’s access to finance through
           available government provisions.
          Cater loans to micro units, design the financial products to reach out to
           the smallest and least visible units be it through women’s banks or
           otherwise.
          Financial products need to be amenable to women’s limited resources
           and their scale of operation. Design loans for easy repayment cycle
           considering the limitations women with micro units will face. Some
           learning could be had from the Women’s Bank run by SEWA in
           Gujarat and Mandeshi in Maharashtra.
          There is need for more synergy between policies of the government
           and banks. The managers and other bank officials will need to be
           made aware of the policy provisions of the government for loans for the
           MSME sector.

Marketing Lacunae

A challenge identified explicitly by women entrepreneurs and other experts is that
women lack effective market knowledge and skills for marketing their products and
services. Additionally, as discussed, gender norms and gender-biased attitudes limit
women’s interface with the markets. While gender norms can only be transformed in the
longer terms there are certain facilitative steps that need to be undertaken to attenuate
women’s inhibitions and enhance their skills in marketing.

                                            RECOMMENDATIONS

          Undertake mapping of resources and stakeholders that can facilitate
           market linkages.
          Provide incentives to big private retail stores to also procure from small
           scale businesses.
          Marketing training and helping women get over their gendered barriers
           to deal with markets is essential.
          CDP should be mandated to proactively facilitate this process of
           women’s links with markets through well calibrated training, effective
           linkage and provision of information




Challenges / Opportunities for Women Workers

Type of work

Majority of women workers in the MSME sector enter jobs as first-time wage earners
without any prior skills or education. Women’s employment in this sector is shaped by
gender norms around appropriate work for women, the expectations from women in
terms of their family responsibilities, restrictions around their mobility, workplace biases
about women’s abilities and concerns about their safety. As a result, women seem to be
typecast in certain roles in the workplace and not surprisingly these are often the lower
skill and lower paid jobs. Higher skills job are often done by men and these are jobs are
deemed to be more physically demanding and require longer hours at work. Gender
biases permeate the human resource policies deeply as women and men in the same
skilled jobs have differential wages that are justified by beliefs that men are primary
earners and need to be paid more.

Terms of recruitment

Women workers are largely hired as casual labour. As casual or non-contract workers,
women get limited or no benefits. On the employer end, most of the jobs for women in


Gender Issues in the MSME Sector in India                                               111 / 128
this sector in unregistered enterprises that are not bound by any regulations around
contracts or benefits for its worker base.

Work conditions and benefits

Progressive women focused companies have a larger beneficence towards their
employees and create discretionary benefits. Workers in turn, commit loyalty to these
jobs, which interestingly may lower their ability to negotiate for higher wages. Women
who want to move to new roles or work may not be able to walk away with any
documents that testify the kinds of benefits they had been getting previously. This is
compounded by the fact that women also lack self-confidence and communication skills
to negotiate for more demanding work and higher wages. These factors serve to limit
women’s opportunities to advance and create boundaries around the options they can
explore.

Opportunities for Advancement

Women remain as low-skill workers due to the gender and structural factors that limit
their ability and opportunities to advance their skills and positions in their work.
Irrespective of the industry, the norm is to justify that men are in higher skilled jobs and
therefore are paid more. However, due to cultural and gender biases women are not able
to move easily into those jobs relegating them to lower paid jobs.
Advancement of low skill workers are not prioritized either by employers or even
through schemes that the government offers for on the job skill up-gradation for
different clusters.

                                            RECOMMENDATIONS


   Create pre-job skilling opportunity for minimal-skill jobs at the local and national
    level
   Provide life skills training to build their self-efficacy, negotiate gender constraints,
    improve their communication and comprehension to follow complex tasks and
    manage their time and problems effectively. This will both impact their work
    productivity and help them advance in their jobs.
   Incentivize businesses to enhance employment of women in diverse skilled jobs and
    provide basic amenities and benefits.
   Create regulatory and incentive-based frameworks for unregistered enterprises to
    enable them to provide benefits and basic amenities to workers. Once an enterprise
    has attained a certain level of growth, create motivating structures to register these
    enterprises.
   Introduce gender modules in all technical training and skilling for workers.
   Undertake gender audits and monitoring of workplace policies and benefits for
    workers across a range of industries in the MSME sector.

Challenges and Policy Implications for Technology Centres

Gender norms and biases tend to forefront most of the constraints women face in
participating in the MSME sector be it as employees, entrepreneurs or as workers.
Women either face gender-bias and stereotyping at the workplace or internalize
prevailing norms, and make consequent choices that reinforce these biases. To
strengthen gender outcomes structurally, certain measures have to be taken at the
institutional level, particularly TCs that essentially facilitate the competency and training
of human resources and can be considered as a foundation for skill enhancement for the
MSME sector.

In order to address these issues there need to be three areas of interventions: 1. greater
incentives to motivate women to come to TCs 2. additional and more comprehensive
trainings offered and 3. gender transformative placements that create a better supply of
jobs for women.



Incentives to motivate women to enrol in Technology Centres

    1. Role of scholarships for long terms courses at the TC is an important area
       for consideration: Currently the scholarships are linked to government-
       sponsored programs and participants. Many of the women who are coming to
       the TCs for courses in longer-term technical courses which tend to be more
       expensive like engineering are not eligible for these scholarships. In order to
       challenge gender norms of jobs and skills, incentives could be created for these
       technical courses for women as this would also influence the kinds of jobs
       women undertake later as well as challenge industry norms around appropriate
       jobs for women. Creating a more effective supply of technically trained women
       workforce will tend to push for changes in the recruitment and placement
       practices, which are currently also gender-biased.

    2. More gender responsive programs and infrastructure: Infrastructure and
       amenities from women need to be improved to enhance the participation of
       women in the residential courses especially the long-term ones.

    3. More specific and attractive advertisements of the courses for women need
       to be developed and targeted to many institutions of higher learning in
       different states of the country. Enrolment strategies could be linked with
       National Skill Development Council, universities, local colleges and civil society
       organizations working with young girls education and employability.

Comprehensive and Gender Sensitive Trainings



    1. Life and Gender Skills Training: It is important that trainees, both men and women,
       at the TC are trained and encouraged to challenge the existing gender-based
       boundaries and limits regarding work and workplaces. While women trainees may
       learn technical skills, they may lack in the knowledge and negotiation skills that
       are required for them to engage with the markets and institutions where they may
       face competition, unfamiliar cultures, gender biases and discrimination. This is
       similar to the findings coming from women entrepreneurs in this study. Life-
       skills training for job-preparedness will build women’s skills to compete with
       men for equal skilled jobs, negotiate gender boundaries at home and at work, and
       learn to seek rewards for their performance. Gender training should be
       mandatory in all centers to sensitize students. In addition, faculty as well need to
       be sensitized and therefore undergo gender sensitive training as they tend to
       reinforce biases and norms and it is not sufficient to only sensitize women
       participants in the TCs. In addition to having standalone gender modules, aspects
       of gender sensitization should be integrated into technical courses. This is critical
       because gender stereotyping and discrimination can occur in the more non-
       traditional skills training for women.

    2. Need for EDPs alongside technical training: Currently the TCs do not generally
       provide any EDPs. This is not part of their strategy and we found one instance
       where it was offered. Many young women seek training for jobs and accept
       gender biased placement but do not consider entrepreneurship as an option for
       themselves. The provision of EDPs alongside technical trainings could promote
       greater avenues for work for women trainees including entrepreneurship. It will
       also build leadership skills for jobs and for growth into higher roles. This would
       be especially beneficial for women trainees who will not be able to consider out-
       of-state placements and face shortages for effective jobs in their own states.


Gender Transformative Placement in MSMEs

    1. Incentivize companies for placement of women /create demand for women employees. Women
       trainees from TCs seem to be disadvantaged in terms of their job placement due
       to the reluctance of firms to hire women employees for certain positions.
       Companies are averse to employing women for several reasons. Due to gender
       stereotypes, women are considered unsuitable for certain jobs, coupled with the
       requirements of creating specific facilities like separate toilets for women workers
       as well the fear of losing them to marriage and motherhood. Incentives can be
       created to motivate firms to hire competitive women candidates in certain roles.
       The enactment of the Companies Act and available CSR mandate can be seen as
       opportunities that can be creatively used to enhance the participation of women
       in the workforce.

    2. Locate TC or mini –TCs in clusters to enhance the availability of better-matched jobs for locally
       trained women: The TCs in CTTC and Kannauj do not have local industrial
       clusters. The absence of local industrial clusters to absorb skilled workforce being
       developed by TC is one of the reasons women do not begin to work after their
       training is completed. Women are reluctant or are not encouraged by their
       families to take up placements outside of their home states. Linking TCs with
       local clusters that have the absorption capacity for skilled trained workers is an
       important strategy for more effective placement of women.

    3. Post-placement support for women: Currently the TCs do not offer any post-placement
       support. Women trainees are disinclined to take out-of-state placements. As is
       known from the literature, a part of the reason for women unwilling to take up
       jobs in new places is their lack of exposure and fear of adjusting to new settings
       and work culture. Post-placement support to ensure that women placed in their
       new jobs adjust to their jobs and living conditions would encourage women to
       take up placement offers in distant places.

    CIVIL SOCIETY INNOVATIONS FOR INCREASING WOMEN’S PARTICIPATION IN
                             MSMES IN INDIA



Interventions and innovations to increase women’s participation in MSMEs fall into two
broad categories. In the first category are interventions that have been made in MSME
clusters through the efforts of various Cluster Development Programs of UNIDO and
related organizations. The second set of innovations has been made by civil society
organizations to promote women’s participation in livelihood activities.

Innovations through cluster development programs have aimed to increase women’s
participation in the production process by up-grading skills of existing workers and
reaching out to more women to enter the workforce. Some of these efforts have
consciously aimed to empower women by organizing them into self-help groups so that

they begin to engage in savings and lending activities and by offering inputs on gender
sensitization to both women and men.

Innovations by civil society organizations (CSO) have aimed to promote women’s
economic enterprises both as individual home-based producers and as collectives of
women workers. Through these interventions women are offered a range of business
development services such a skill enhancement, business planning, costing, market
linkages etc. In some cases the CSO have gone a step further and promoted woman-
owned and managed enterprises.

The cluster development interventions have focused primarily on women workers in the
enterprises located in the cluster. The CSO interventions have mostly been outside
MSME clusters and have been at the level of the micro-entrepreneur and worker in
micro and small enterprises.

All the examples in this note indicate that the vision of the development intervention is
critical in shaping it. Where the vision is one of reducing poverty and empowering
women, interventions go beyond the economic objective and try and effect a change in
the position of women in the product’s value chain.

In Part A we describe a few innovations made in MSME clusters with a focus on
increasing women’s participation in MSME clusters and empowering them in the
process. In Part B we describe innovations aimed at promoting women’s enterprise in a
variety of settings outside of MSME clusters.

Part A

1. Chanderi Cluster, Madhya Pradesh


The intervention in this cluster occurred around 2000. A diagnostic study of the cluster
by UNIDO found two intertwined problems of poverty and limited competitiveness.
Women, contract workers and ethnic minorities were particularly affected by poverty.
Women were also affected by ‘powerlessness and disentitlement’, little exposure to the
outside world ad poor health and education. ‘…an unbalance of power was tangible
within the cluster between master weavers and waged workers, while inequality affected
the population along gender and ethnic lines.” UNIDO adopted an equity-based
development strategy, to enhance not only the cluster’s competitiveness but also social
imbalances.

Twenty per cent of the weavers had their own working capital but depended on the
master weavers for marketing. About 50% depended upon the master weavers for both
working capital and marketing. The remaining 30% were daily wage workers. Problems
included mediocre product quality, competition from power looms, lack of credit access
and poor trade related infrastructure.

Three strategies were adopted, viz. creation of weaver’s organizations, creation of groups
of other stakeholders and empowerment.

As a first step, weavers were organized into self-help groups to enhance their financial
situation by promoting savings and credit activities. Women’s participation in SHGs was
actively sought. The SHGs were given technical, design and business development
inputs and given exposure to various marketing avenues. Seven of the 40 SHGs
promoted federated into a new organization called the Bunkar Vikas Sansthan (BVS),
and started production and marketing of high end Chanderi products. Currently BVS
has 13 SHGs. The need for professional functioning also led to setting up of rules and
regulations for common raw material procurement, production, transparent quality
management systems, and costing, pricing and timely delivery of orders. Linkages were
established with various organizations for design inputs, marketing and credit such as
National Institute of Fashion Technology, National Institute of Design and Fab India.
They were assisted in this process by organizations like the National Minorities
Development Corporation.

There was a conscious effort to address issues around women’s empowerment. For
example, women weavers were provided specialized leadership training through the Self-
employed Women’s Association (SEWA), a leading women’s. About 80 women enrolled
in literacy classes and about 150 women constituted a forum, named ‘Hamari Duniya’
(our world), under the aegis of BVS. This is expected to serve as the platform for
women’s common issues. Men’s sensitization to gender issues was seen as critical and
joint workshops of women and men weavers were organized to discuss gender issues.

2. Ludhiana Knitwear Cluster
The knitwear industry in Ludhiana contributes 95% of the country’s woolen knitwear.
In the late 1990’s the cluster activity began to slow down due to a variety of reasons
including poor quality human resources. UNIDO’s intervention aimed at enhancing the
technical knowledge of workers and supervisors and also increasing the share of women
workers. The project-supported Apparel Exporters Association of Ludhiana (APPEAL)
created a core group of 3 manufacturer-exporters who, along with one shop floor
manager, listed the typical mistakes made by workers that led to productivity losses or
product rejection. Based on these inputs, five training modules were identified jointly by
the entrepreneurs. These included industrial stitching and tailoring, linking, cutting and
pattern making, designing and merchandising and overall supervisory skills. This process
of self-monitoring was supported by the project through visits to international (China)
and national (Tirupur) producers, with a special emphasis on involving women workers
at the shop floor.

To provide this demand-based training required space and a suitable environment that
would not discourage trainees, especially young women, who were not used to formal
training. For these reasons, the APPEAL team in collaboration with the project Cluster
Development Agent(CDA) contacted a local women’s college – Government
Polytechnic for Women (GPW).

Further, the CDA contacted local NGOs already operating in the field of gender
mainstreaming and sought their support in the identification of potential trainees.

In the absence of seed money for these new programmes, various types of innovative
fundraising efforts were made by the CDA. Discussions held with the Department of
Technical Education, Government of Punjab led to the provision of space for the
programme at no cost. The Department of Science & Technology provided financial
support for the women’s training programmes. At the same time, the private sector
agreed to cover 50 per cent of the cost incurred, sensing the likelihood of rapidly
acquiring much needed skilled workers. Capital investment was supported by the
industry: a Japanese machinery manufacturer of stitching equipment agreed to provide 13
machines for a value of 22,000 USD and another 20 machines were provided by the local
entrepreneurs.

The training programme was constantly monitored and changes were made in the course
content as well as in its duration: for example, the programme for women was initially
thought of a one-month duration, but it later had to be stretched to three months so that
the trainees did not have to come to class every day (thus having more time for their
household activities) but also to increase the syllabus. After 3 runs of such programme
were held, a cluster firm requested re-training of all its 65 workers. This resulted in a
further revision of the course methodology.

The success of the women’s training programme led to three more initiatives in related
technical fields (linking, cutting and pattern making, designing and

merchandising).Furthermore, re-training of supervisors was entrusted with the
Government Institute of Textile Chemistry and Knitting Technology. Here again, all the
training course material was finalized in consultation with APPEAL. After the first run
of such course, and in order to accommodate the needs of the supervisors, the venue of
the programme was shifted to an industrial unit itself. The number of participants
doubled as a result.

The women’s training programme, which was introduced in the last quarter of 1999, has
so far trained around 350 women, 90% of whom obtained paid employment after the
end of the course. Besides breaking a long-established prejudice against women workers
in the cluster, this training also had a positive impact on poverty reduction as many of
the trained women came from poor backgrounds. Moreover, over 80 supervisors
improved their level of technical knowledge and 75 firms benefited through these
training programmes.



3. Empowerment of women weavers in Barpalli, Odisha
In the handloom cluster of Barpalli, India, women were confined to their houses and had
no control over household income despite their substantial participation in pre-loom
activities. In order to promote the participation of women in the economic life of the
cluster and help them gain recognition vis-à-vis their male partners, the UNIDO project
promoted the establishment of a federation of women. As a first step in building their
self-confidence and overcoming the reluctance of men to allow women step out of the
houses, UNIDO promoted the organization of social activities such as sanitation and
literacy camps. Once their confidence increased, UNIDO facilitated their engagement in
economic activities. On the one hand, the members of the federation have started saving
and inter-lending activities to help members in financial distress and prevent borrowing
from informal moneylenders. Additionally, the federation organized capacity-building
inputs for its members especially in the areas of self-management, leadership
development and financial management. At a later stage, the women started jointly to
undertake weaving activities while the federation provided them with support services
such as joint training in design, market exposure and assistance for new product
development.

4. Sindhudurg Cluster Development Project
In the cluster of Sindhudurg, Maharashtra, the Cluster Development Project decided to
work with fruit processing SHGs that were concentrated in three localities (namely the
Talawade village, Kirlos and Mangaon) which counted on already operating NGOs. The
cashew and fruit processing cluster of Sindhudurg was chosen because over 90% of the
workers and Self-help group representatives were women. Three already existing NGOs,
the Talawade Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society (TPACS), the Krishi Vigyan
Kendra (KVK), and the Hegdewar Smriti Sewa Prakalp (HSSP), were provided with
training in order to increase their gender awareness. Various gender sensitization
programmes were organized, and interaction with gender specialists and access to gender
related information provided. The gender component was integrated into the Cluster

Development Program as a conscious decision as the vision for cluster development
included women’s empowerment.

5. Initiatives by SIDBI
Along with UNIDO, other institutions have also been involved in cluster development
programs, including the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). Based on
our conversations with a senior official at SIDBI, we learned about some of the cluster
development initiatives which we briefly describe here.

SIDBI’s intervention in the leather cluster in Kanpur was successful in raising the
marketability and income of women who made products with leather scrap. Prior to the
intervention, women would gather scraps and make whips which had a very limited
market. Interventions through the industry association resulted in producers being more
careful about the shape of the waste product, which was then used to make goods with
higher marketing potential. The women were trained to make gift items with uniform
pieces of waste leather, leading to a significant increase in their income from Rs. 20 a day
to Rs. 100.

Another intervention in the coir yarn making industry reduced the drudgery of women
yarn makers. The trick was to introduce the technological change in a phased manner so
that it became acceptable to the workers, despite initial resistance.

SIDBI also found that enterprises needed business development services to improve
their productivity, particularly inputs for marketing and skill development. Their
initiatives therefore focused on creating a pool of business development service
providers to support enterprises in the MSME sector.



Part B

In this section we briefly describe four cases of innovations that have promoted women’s
participation in micro and small enterprises.



1. Promoting Women’s Enterprises
The JEEVIKA project has been successful in forming the state’s first women-owned,
women-operated chili processing unit. The objective of this project was to position
women in Sawai Madhopur engaged in Chili cultivation to own and manage
microenterprises around value-added post-harvest processes. The women-owned and
operated post-harvest processing plants ensure better returns to the women through
more value addition to the farm produce. During one year more than 500 women were
organized into 32 Self Help Groups (SHGs) and one SHG federation.The
Ranthambhore Mahila AajivikaSangh (RMAS) was set-up to link the women’s groups
directly to the markets. It is hoped that the Chili processing plant will be developed as a
spice hub in future years. (This initiative was supported by the Hilary Clinton Women’s
Empowerment Initiative)

2. Udyogini
Udyogini decided to leverage the traditional embroidery skill of women in Western
Rajasthan and provided interventions at two levels – one at the level of the job worker
and the second for to promote entrepreneurship among the women in the area. The
intervention aimed at women who were doing embroidery aimed improving efficiencies
for the existing market through improved quality, productivity, benchmarking and
systems for the existing range of products and designs to enable greater standardization.

Along with skill training, Udyogini organized an intervention aimed at promoting
entrepreneurship among women. Udyogini organized Grassroots Management Trainings
(GMTs) for select women who were identified based on their risk-taking abilities. These
trainings helped women understand the product manufacturing process as well as costing
and pricing. These women provided business development services such as helping to
link producers to markets. They gradually started working on a commission basis and
became proficient in expanding their reach of markets. Each of these entrepreneurs
gradually became in-charge of a cluster of villages where production was occurring.



3. Self-employed Women’s Association (SEWA)
SEWA has been a pioneering institution in the promotion of women’s livelihoods, and
has a unique strategy for promoting women as workers and entrepreneurs. The first step
in all SEWA’s interventions for enterprise promotion has been organizing the women
workers and producers to build collective strength and bargaining power. Inputs such as
credit, skill up-gradation, market linkages etc. are provided to enhance the earning
potential of women workers. Social security like insurance and pension, and human
development services in the areas of health, nutrition and education are also provided.
SEWA believes that only if women are provided with this composite package can they
engage in productive and sustainable income generation activities.

One of the many initiatives at SEWA has been the setting up of the SEWA Trade
Facilitation Center (STFC) in 2003, in response to the demand for creating sustainable
livelihood strategies for poor women producers. The vision of STFC is to ensure that
craftswomen in the informal sector have socio-economic security and full employment,
by building a grassroots’ business enterprise of artisans. STFC achieves this by providing
skill training and design input to women workers and linking these to mainstream
national and global markets. Currently STFC has 3500 artisan shareholders in 80
villages across 3 Districts in Gujarat. The product range produced by shareholders of
STFC and marketed by STFC includes apparel, home furnishing and accessories.

A second example of SEWA’s intervention has been the promotion of Rudi Multi
Trading Company Limited. The objective is to provide a sustained market to small
farmers by collectivizing and developing a distribution network. Farm producers in each
district are organized into rural producer groups. Farm produce is purchased from each
small producer and processed at the district processing center where grading, processing

and packaging of commodities is done. The packaged products are sold both in the
villages and in urban retail outlets by saleswomen. This model thus provides
employment to farmers and creates entrepreneurs by selling through saleswomen from
the community.



4. Pradan
Pradan carried out this intervention in the state of Jharkhand. The area where the
intervention was introduced has limited employment opportunities for women and the
majority there are landless and marginal farmers. One of the steps in the production of
tasar silk is the spinning of tasar yarn, the bulk of which is imported into India. Pradan
trained the women to become yarn producers, thus adding a new set of actors in the
tasar value chain.

The intervention started with promotion of women’s self-help groups for initiating
savings and credit activities. While not all the women opted to become yarn producers,
those who did were organized into a yarn producers’ organization at the village level
which was registered as a mutual benefit trust. A group of these trusts together formed
the Masuta Producers’ Company. The company is owned by 2,037 women yarn
producers.

Women who become members of the company have to progress through five stages –
viz. acquisition of technical skills, development of individual business sense,
development of primary business groups, leadership of the primary group and finally
leadership for the company.

The company is owned by the women members and governed by their representatives
and a small number of professionals.

                               productive and create decent work is to build around three crucial
                               and mutually reinforcing elements: creating the right conditions for
                               sustainable enterprises to thrive and create jobs; stimulating
                               entrepreneurs to fulfill their ambitions to build businesses; and

                               improved working conditions and industrial relations.

                               In 2013, ILO spent approximately $1.1 million on MSME
                               development. Till 2017, ILO will invest approximately $2.3 million on

                               employment and entrepreneurship. They are particularly known for
                               their work in African countries. The ILO’s Women’s
                               Entrepreneurship Development programme (ILO-WED) is part of
                               the Small Enterprise Development Programme (SEED).

                               ILO-WED works on enhancing economic opportunities for women
                               by carrying out affirmative actions in support of women starting,
                               formalizing and growing their enterprises, and by mainstreaming
                               gender equality issues into the ILO's work in enterprise development.
                               This approach to WED is highlighted in the ILO WED Strategy that
                               was adopted by the Governing Body in March, 2008 (ILO website)

Main activities of             UNIDO is a specialized agency in the United Nation System. The
Donor Agency                   organization’s primary objective is the promotion and acceleration of

                               economies in transition as well as the promotion of international
                               industrial cooperation.

Main MSME activities           Fostered the cluster development approach in India part of the
                               organization’s mandate to reduce poverty through productive activity
                               i.e. with a focus on MDG 1:eradicate extreme poverty and hunger

                               The aim of the UNIDO Cluster Development Programme (CDP) in
                               India is to contribute to the overall performance and collective
                               efficiency of the small and medium enterprise clusters for sustainable
                               development by assisting selected local communities of firms and
                               associated institutions in the clusters with assistance to central and
                               local institutions in their programmes of cluster modernization and
                               restructuring.

                               At the policy level, the primary purpose of UNIDO’s intervention is
                               to customize its methodology to the Indian settings so that it can be
                               shared with the partner institutions for replication. UNIDO strives
                               to act as a catalyst bringing about the necessary qualitative changes at
                               the cluster level.

Gender focus of                A gender responsive need to cluster development was pioneered in
MSME activities                2002 through the launch of an action-research project whose pilot
                               activities were undertaken in two clusters in India - of Chanderi and
                               the fruit-processing cluster of Sindhudurg.

                               The activities implemented in India revealed that a rethinking of the
                               cluster development methodology is necessary in order to ensure the
                               effectiveness of a gender aware cluster development initiative. The
                               integration of a gender sensitive focus starts from the selection of the
                               cluster and spans over all the stages of the project from the
                               diagnostic study, through action planning to monitoring and
                               evaluation. It calls for, or at least also involves, the targeting and
                               tuning of cluster development activities to the specific needs and
                               circumstances experienced by women, in order to counter the
                               discrimination they often suffer. A variety of steps can be taken to
                               facilitate women integration in the cluster life. Among them this
                               paper explores Self Help Group formation, micro finance schemes,
                               exposure visits and skill development.
