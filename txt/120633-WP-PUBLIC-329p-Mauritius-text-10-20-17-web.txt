Key Messages
The focus of this book is on the big picture and on a few key sectors.
The book aims at assessing the overall potential of the Ocean Economy (OE) to contribute to Mauritius’ develop-
ment, at identifying key sectoral and cross-cutting challenges to be overcome in order to seize that potential;
and at evaluating ways to ensure the OE’s longer-term sustainability, addressing in particular environmental and
climate change concerns. While the book discusses specific projects in selected sectors, this is intended only to
illustrate opportunities and challenges (including in terms of resource mobilization); an appraisal of the technical
and financial feasibility of individual projects would go beyond the scope of this work and would have to be
conducted as part of separate follow-on activities. This book reflects data and information available as of March
31, 2017.

Doubling Mauritius’ ocean economy is possible and worthwhile, but it will take time.
Based on a macroeconomic modeling of the country developed in partnership with the Government of Mauritius,
the book finds that doubling the GDP share of the OE (the “O2” strategy) is possible; but achieving such a target is
likely to take to at least 15 years. Attempts to pursue the O2 target over a shorter period may well result in undesir-
able economic outcomes, such as diseconomies of scale, price increases, excessive use of natural resources, and
fiscal imbalances.

The required investments are large but achievable.
Over the next 10 years, with investments on the order of US$580 million per year, the O2 strategy can yield con-
siderable growth results, including an increase in the OE GDP of 62 percent in absolute terms and 38 percent
in terms of its share of the national total (rising from 12.6 percent to 17.5 percent). Such an extra investment
push would be large, being equivalent, on average, to an additional 1.6 percent of GDP going every year toward
investment (compared with the last 10 years’ average of investment as a share of GDP). While large, such an
increase would not be unconceivable, since it would mean lifting total investment back to the levels observed
in the early 2000s. Full achievement of the O2 target in the longer term is estimated to require investments of
around US$8.2 billion.

Key Messages (continued)
Investing in the OE sector could support inclusive growth, with the right enabling factors in place.
Compared to a plausible alternative scenario, which involves distributing the additional investment of US $580 mil-
lion per year across the economy in proportion to the historical sector shares (rather than concentrating them in
the OE sectors), the O2 strategy would boost returns on investment by 20 percent; improve diversification of the
OE away from tourism (a 20 percent increase in diversification); create 36 percent more jobs; improve the trade
balance by 60 percent; reduce poverty and inequality; and strengthen the government’s finances (a 2 percent
reduction in the debt/GDP ratio). Successful pursuit of the O2 strategy requires key enabling conditions, including
stable macroeconomic and exchange rate policies (to encourage investment inflows), investment in human cap-
acity (to avoid mismatch between demand and supply of skilled and semi-skilled labor); and conservation of the
high-quality natural capital on which the OE depends.
    To complement the top-down analysis of the OE expansion as a whole, the book assesses opportunities and
constraints for OE development from the individual perspective of four sectors, representing the OE’s established
sectors (fisheries, ports), as well as the emerging ones (marine energy and marine information and communica-
tions technology or ICT). The book also highlights a number of innovative strategies, to be further studied, to foster
OE strategic development. These include: (i) developing a Maritime Digitization Platform (which could leverage
big data and decision analytics) to turn Mauritius into a maritime knowledge hub; and (ii) turning Mauritius into a
decoupling point in the global supply chain/logistics corridor for Africa.

Fisheries: Reduce over-exploitation and carefully manage underused resources.
Enabling the sector to meet its true potential would require a reduction in over-exploitation and environmental
stresses in the lagoons and coastal fisheries; careful management in the development of underused resources such
as the Banks fisheries; and an enhanced investment climate for expansion of aquaculture and the seafood hub.
Additional investments of US$331 million over 10 years could increase the sector’s revenues by US$380 million per
year and generate an additional 3,500 jobs. The benefit/cost ratios vary across the components of the development
scenarios, ranging from 1.2 for aquaculture to over 3.6 for the Banks fisheries. Similarly, the investment cost per
permanent job created varies between US$32,000 per job for the Banks fisheries to $170,000 per job for aquaculture.
    A range of cross-cutting measures are needed to backstop sustainable investments, ensure their long-term
economic viability and effective social inclusion, and restore the environmental health of marine and coastal
resources. Fisheries sector audits have criticized the poor implementation of previous plans. The existing plans will
require updating and the inclusion of financing modalities and monitoring of key milestones (both of which are
often lacking).

Port: Attract investment to boost transshipment.
Strategically located at the crossroads of Asian and African sea routes, Mauritius’ seaport has the potential to play
a key role in OE development, primarily through the expansion of Mauritius’ role as a hub of global trade flows,
including container transshipment, re-exported petroleum products, and the transshipment of fish. The book
evaluates two development scenarios, the first including various projects identified by the recent Port Master Plan
that are already under active discussion, requiring just under US$1.1 billion of investment (conservative scenario),
and the second requiring an additional US$0.24 billion of investment for other projects that might be undertaken
in the next 10 years or beyond (optimistic scenario). The economic modelling shows these projects to have a
positive net value added in aggregate, which is even larger once multiplier effects are accounted for. However, the
financial feasibility of some projects—such as the Island Container Terminal and the oil terminal at Albion—needs
to be further investigated, including the option of undertaking them as public-private partnerships. The Mauritius
Port Authority (MPA) has a central role to play in the efforts of “Mauritius Inc.” to attract inward investment, but it
needs further capacity building in the areas of marketing, customer relationship management, project appraisal,
and ICT. The additional human resource needs are small, but the key personnel need to be carefully selected and
given customized, on-the-job training.

Key Messages (continued)
Marine energy: Pursue deep ocean water applications and position Mauritius as a future leader in off-
shore wind and wave energy.
An integrated assessment of the longer-term potential of ocean-renewable energy technology (O-RET) in the
context of Mauritius’s overall energy system finds that currently Deep Ocean Water Cooling holds the greatest
economic potential, and offshore wind shows extensive potential with concessional finance (such as carbon finan-
cing). Wave energy, on the other hand, would require higher levels of supporting finance. The modelling suggests
that expansion scenarios are technically feasible and are likely to generate sizable economywide benefits, with
benefit-cost ratios well in excess of 2. In addition, expanding the use of marine energy can reduce the country’s
dependence on fossil fuels (especially coal) and lower its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—with potential import
reductions of 3 to19 percent and GHG emissions reductions of 3 to18 percent through O-RET deployment. For
large deployment of O-RET to happen, there will need to be a combination of clear longer-term vision, human
capacity development, standards adoption, comprehensive tariffs, and targeted opportunities to attract private
investment.

ICT: Improve cable connectivity and promote innovative ocean solutions to data storage and off-shore
communication.
There are strong two-way synergies between the OE and the ICT sector: ocean resources enable the ICT sector
to function and expand (through undersea cables, the provision of cooling services for offshore data centers, and
new market opportunities in the area of offshore communications services to mariners). Conversely, ICT applica-
tions can also be a key ingredient in the development of many ocean activities, especially in terms of enhancing
the future competitiveness of Mauritius. Investment of some US $300 million (for additional cable capacity, a
deep water data storage pilot, better management of spectrum to allow more offshore mobile communication,
and downstream ICT applications in selected OE clusters) could deliver a considerable benefit/cost ratio for the
economy as a whole (in excess of 3.6) and the potential to create some 3,500 permanent jobs. Investments in this
area generate significant spillovers into the wider economy, as confirmed by the lower values of the benefit/cost
ratio at the project level.

Make the ocean economy last...
Any OE expansion is likely to entail larger pressure on the environment, including pollution of water and coastlines,
in turn affecting coral reefs, lagoon habitats, and biodiversity; and higher exposure to the risks posed by current
climate variability and future change.

… through marine spatial planning (MSP) ...
Mauritius has recently initiated an MSP process as a key instrument to reconcile multiple ecological, economic, and
social objectives in the use of coastal and ocean resources. An overarching, strategic decision to be made early in
the process concerns the level of ambition of the MSP. Two options can be envisaged: Either (i) develop a high-level
strategic framework for management of marine resources, with zoning to be defined only after an initial pilot phase
of some five years; or, alternatively, (ii) develop a decision-making framework and comprehensive zoning design
simultaneously or sequentially, but without a period of adaptation prior to implementing the complete MSP. Either
way, the MSP process will need to address key challenges in the areas of inter-institutional coordination; upgrading
of the legal and regulatory framework; definition of how the planning process would engage with Rodrigues and
the outer islands; engagement with Seychelles, if the MSP includes the Joint Management Area; and coordination
with Indian Ocean countries and associations or commissions (in relation to international pelagic resources).

... and by addressing risks of large shocks to the economy from climate change.
Climate change is being increasingly recognized as a threat to the development potential of the OE in Mauritius.
The country has made important progress on the understanding of impacts, including sea-level rise, coastal ero-
sion, tropical storm intensification, intensified rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and ocean acidification); it

                                                                                                  (continued on next page)

Key Messages (continued)
has also made progress on practical adaptation responses, such as guidelines for coastal setback, formulated in
anticipation of sea level rise risks to coastal assets. However, more can be done to better understand and mitigate
the increased risks that climate change may pose to the entire OE and, in fact, to the economy as a whole. In
particular, we find that under certain climate change scenarios, the risk of large GDP losses from tropical cyclones
could significantly increase: for example, a cyclone or a series of cyclones causing a long-term GDP loss of 7.5
percent (over a 40-year horizon) has a 10 percent probability of occurring under current climate conditions; under
climate change, this probability increases to 30 percent on average.

Strengthening the ocean economy governance.
The current OE governance system, based on a dedicated ministry and a consultative body (the National Ocean
Council or NOC), has been instrumental in promoting the OE agenda over the last few years. To fully turn the OE’s
potential into reality, there is a need to strengthen it, both in terms of technical capacity and in terms of deci-
sion-making mechanisms. Mauritius could consider establishing a highly qualified Ocean Economy Unit (OEU),
staffed with full-time top professionals in the different OE clusters, to be housed at the Ministry of Ocean Economy
to strengthen the ministry’s capacity; or alternatively, at the Office of the Prime Minister to provide the unit with
stronger clout across sectors. At the institutional and political level, the work of the OEU would be vetted and valid-
ated by the National Ocean Council, the Minister of Ocean Economy, or other ministries. For decisions of particular
strategic significance, the formation of an Ocean Inter-Ministerial Committee could also be considered.

Recommendations
In addition to the establishment of the Ocean Economy Unit, Mauritius could consider the following actions for the
short term (6 to 18 months). (A longer list of recommendations is provided at the end of this Overview).

•	   Prepare a draft National Ocean Policy paper, including an action plan with short- and medium- term targets
•	   Prepare a draft unified regulatory framework, gradually expanding to cover the different OE sectors
•	   Develop a comprehensive training action plan to develop technical capacity in selected priority OE areas
•	   Develop a governance and legal framework for the next steps of the MSP process
•	   Develop a financial protection strategy against climate disasters, based on a diagnostic of economic and fiscal
     impact of disaster shocks
•	   Formulate a high-level policy commitment on lagoon rehabilitation
•	   Develop a three-year business plan for Banks fisheries development
•	   Establish an integrated energy planning process through an inter-sectoral coordination panel
•	   Develop a more ambitious cable program, looking eastward (toward Asia) and northward (to Europe and the
     Gulf ); and
•	   Strengthen the commercial functions of the Mauritius Port Authority through suitable capacity building.




                         A New Role for the Ocean Economy in Mauritius
                         Mauritius is an upper-middle-income country, with a successful record
                         of sustained growth, a stable macroeconomic environment, and solid
                         institutions. The country boasts abundant ocean resources and natural
                         capital, has a vast exclusive economic zone (EEZ) under its manage-
                         ment (or jurisdiction), and is reliant on a healthy ocean for a host of
                         socioeconomic activities. Thanks to forward-looking policies with the
                         right mix of private-sector orientation and promotion of social inclu-
                                                                 Overview   5


sion, the country has evolved over a few decades from a land-based,
mono-cropped, inward-looking economy into an export-oriented and
diversified economy, producing textiles and services in tourism, finance,
and ICT.
   The recent economic history of Mauritius starts with a colonial leg-
acy characterized by specialization in agricultural production and lim-
ited processing of sugar. This single commodity dependence accentu-
ated the vulnerability of a small island economy, with a limited popula-
tion and land base and exposure to many sorts of outside shocks. Yet, in
spite of the many unfavorable factors, Mauritius has achieved a remark-
able economic performance since its independence in 1968, with high
and consistent growth rates—ranging from a high in excess of 6 percent
during boom years to lows of still above 3 percent during recent years,
against the backdrop of sluggish global growth. Its performance has
included an exemplary transition path from commodity dependence to
a diversified industrial and, more recently, service-based economy that
is highly productive and fully integrated in global value chains. Between
1980 and 2007, total factor productivity (TFP) grew over 1 percent a
year, including a faster spell (in excess of 1.3 percent a year) between
1980 and 1990. This solid performance was achieved thanks to the fol-
lowing key factors: strong democratic institutions, a well-crafted eco-
nomic strategy, careful macroeconomic governance, and international
negotiating ability.
   However, as the country aspires to rapidly achieve and maintain
high-income status, it faces a number of important challenges. These
include its reliance on foreign capital and technology, the relative
decline of its traditional sectors (such as the sugar and textile indus-
tries), concerns as to the sustainability of recent growth drivers like
tourism and high-end real estate development, and a degradation of
both the land and ocean environment. Shortages of highly skilled labor
and job mismatches are also the consequence of the country’s ongoing
structural transformation to a modern service economy and the employ-
ment structure of the declining textile industry, which is mostly based
on low-skilled and difficult-to-retrain workers. More recently, following
the global economic recession that affected most of its export markets,
Mauritius also experienced lower growth (at 3 to 4 percent, down from
the historical averages of 5 to 6 percent), falling saving and investment
rates, and pressures on government finances from a combination of cap-
ital import dependence and low domestic taxation.
   Against this backdrop, the various governments that have held office
since the release of The Ocean Economy: A Roadmap for Mauritius
(PMO 2013), hereafter referred to simply as the Roadmap, have
identified the OE as a key development opportunity for the coming
6   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


    decades and endorsed the goal of rapidly increasing the overall eco-
    nomic importance of the OE. The Roadmap sets a target of doubling
    the OE’s share of GDP over a 12-year time horizon (2013–2025), cre-
    ating some 35,000 jobs in the process. The government created a new
    Ministry of Ocean Economy, Fisheries, Marine Resources and Outer
    Islands in 2015, aimed at consolidating the several different entities
    that existed with stronger coordination mechanism as well as promot-
    ing a stronger ownership and accountability. Mauritius has also commit-
    ted to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the Convention
    of Biological Diversity targets, and the UN Framework Convention on
    Climate Change to improve ocean management, strengthen marine
    protected areas, and make its development less carbon-intensive and
    more climate-resilient.
       In articulating its commitment to OE expansion, the government has
    adopted a cluster approach, whereby selected OE sectors have been
    identified as having the highest potential to achieve and contribute
    to overall growth. These sectors include both some traditional sectors
    (such as fisheries and marine transportation services), as well as some
    new sectors and inter-sectorial projects (such as maritime digitization,
    big data and logistics, sea bed explorations, and ocean based energy) that
    appear to hold the potential for leapfrogging development.
       Currently, the OE contributes about 10 percent to GDP (Table 1),
    but the contribution is likely to be larger when the full range of dir-
    ect and indirect interactions with the rest of the economy are properly
    taken into account.


    Objectives, Structure, and Limitations of the Book
    The Ocean Economy in Mauritius has the following objectives: (i) assess-
    ing the overall potential of the OE to contribute to Mauritius’s develop-
    ment (in terms of economic growth and diversification, trade balance,
    reduction of poverty and inequality, and effects on the government’s
    finances); (ii) identifying key sectoral and cross-cutting challenges to be
    overcome in order to seize that potential; and (iii) evaluating the pros-
    pects to ensure the OE’s longer-term sustainability, especially in terms
    of conservation of the environment and of the risks posed by climate
    change.
       The approach taken combines a top-down analysis of a doubling
    of the OE’s share of GDP in the medium to longer term, with a bot-
    tom-up analysis consisting of four deep dives in specific sectors that are
    representative of the OE’s traditional sectors (fisheries and ports), and
    emerging ones (marine energy and marine ICT). The book is organ-
    ized in three parts, as visualized in Figure 1. Part A, “The Big Picture,”

rently being used by Statistics Mauritius. However, there are a number of new sectors that are too small to be
accounted for at present, but are considered in the rest of the book, in particular in the CGE model (these include,
among others, several ICT subsectors and ocean energy). (b) Includes aquaculture, fishing other than aquaculture,

provides an evaluation of the ability of the OE as a whole to contribute
to the country’s overall development. Part B, “Making It Happen,” con-
tains deep dives into selected OE sectors. Part C, “Making It Last,” is a
discussion of two key issues related to the OE’s long-term sustainabil-
ity: the options for developing marine spatial planning (MSP), which is
key to ensuring the conservation of the natural capital on which the OE
depends; and the significance of the threats posed by climate change to
several OE sectors.
   While the top-down analysis in Part A covers the OE as a whole,
the book does not analyze the development prospects of all OE sec-
tors. Notably, tourism is not included, since it is a mature and relatively
large sector and thus likely to run into diminishing returns as it expands,
as confirmed by the economywide analysis. As a result, an important
part of the impulse for the longer-term growth of the OE can argu-
ably be expected to come from emerging OE sectors, or from smaller
traditional ones, which are less likely to be affected by diseconomies of
scale. Seabed mining of minerals and hydrocarbons is also not analyzed;

    in this case, the reason for the omission is that there are currently few
    hard facts on that sector’s potential.
       An important caveat is that the book is intended to provide a big-pic-
    ture, strategic assessment of the OE; specific investment opportunities
    at the individual project level are discussed in Part B of the book (the
    bottom-up analysis), mostly to exemplify opportunities and challenges,
    and to assess the order of magnitude of investment resources required
    to promote the growth of the OE. Any appraisal of the technical and
    financial feasibility of individual projects would go beyond the scope
    of the book and will have be conducted as part of separate follow-on
    activities.


    The Big Picture: Doubling the Ocean Economy
    While there is no shortage of examples of investment opportunities
    related to the OE that have generated economic benefits in other coun-
    tries and also appear promising in Mauritius, to date there has been
    no systematic assessment of the OE’s ability to become a fundamental
    driver of the country’s economy for the foreseeable future.

  Box 1. Tools for Analyzing Economywide Effects of Developing the Ocean Economy

  The social accounting matrix (SAM) is a system of national/regional/sub-regional
  accounts represented in a matrix format (Stone, 1962, 1981). It includes the inter-in-
  dustry linkages through transactions typically found in the input-output accounts
  and the transactions and transfers of income between different types of economic
  agents (such as households, government, firms, and external institutional sectors)
  from national accounts and other statistical sources. A typical computable general
  equilibrium (CGE) model is able to generate solutions that are consistent with a SAM.
  The model can thus be calibrated using a SAM for a base year or a set of base years.
  For Mauritius, the SAM estimated for 2015 was used to calibrate the CGE model so
  that the CGE solution reproduces the 2015 data as a baseline reference; and to rep-
  licate the actual performance of the Mauritius economy during the period 2006–14.
      The SAM built for Mauritius aims to represent a coherent, integrated, and struc-
  tured framework that accounts for the economic potential of marine natural resour-
  ces and uses or activities (such as ship routes and energy sources from the oceans).
  It distinguishes between ocean-based and non-ocean-based activities, as well as
  “blue” (marine ecosystems) and “green” (terrestrial ecosystems) natural resources.
  The critical ocean-based activities are sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, renew-
  able marine energy, marine bio-prospecting, maritime transport and infrastructure,
  and marine and coastal tourism. Water treatment and decontamination activities
  are also considered, while the coastal activities represent a critical interface between
  the blue and green economies.
      CGE models use actual economic data to represent the functioning of an entire
  economy and estimate how it might react to changes in policy, technology, or other
  external factors. The model developed for Mauritius is a dynamic recursive one.
  Dynamic models trace each variable through time, often at annual intervals (unlike
  static models, which look at the reactions of the economy at only one point in time).
  Dynamic models assume that behavior depends only on current and past states of
  the economy. CGE models always contain more variables than equations, so some
  variables (known as exogenous variables) must be set outside the model, a process
  known as closure. They also typically assume as exogenous important drivers of
  socioeconomic change, such as global economic growth and global trade, climate
  changes, and other major factors. For our purposes, we have used a closure rule
  based on the hypothesis that the official exchange rate is fixed and that investment
  financing in excess of domestic savings can be secured by foreign capital inflow.




   To assess the OE potential and evaluate the volume of investment
required to seize it, it is necessary to represent in a rigorous and coher-
ent way the functioning of Mauritius’ economy. The study team has
therefore developed a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE)
model, which is based on a social accounting matrix (SAM) estimated
in full partnership with Mauritius government institutions (in par-
ticular, Statistics Mauritius and the Ministry of the Ocean Economy).
These tools (Box 1) have made it possible to reliably reproduce the

Box 2. Ensuring the Accuracy of the Model

The CGE model was calibrated to replicate the actual performance of the Mauritius economy during the
period 2006–14. The results show that the model is able to achieve a close representation of the econ-
omy. In the case of the rate of GDP growth, the model’s simulation does not deviate more than 5 percent
from the historical data, as shown in Figure 2, Panel A. In the case of value added, the historical data are
perfectly replicated by the model for the last six years, with only a slight underestimate for the first three
years (Panel B).

                              Mauritius, the following key questions:

                              •	    Is the doubling of the OE achievable?
                              •	    If so, over what time horizon?
                              •	    How much would it cost?
                              •	    Is such a doubling desirable?
                              •	    What structural obstacles would need to be overcome?

                                 The approach used to answer those questions included the follow-
                              ing steps:

                              1.	Define and evaluate a future scenario where the size of the OE (as a
                                 share of GDP) doubles over the next decade or two—what we call
                                 the O2 scenario—including the quantification of the investment that
                                                                    Overview    11


   would need to be channeled to key sectors that depend (directly or
   indirectly) on ocean resources.
2.	Define and evaluate an alternative scenario, where the same invest-
   ment resources required in the O2 scenario are not concentrated on
   the OE but instead are distributed across sectors according to the same
   pattern observed in recent years. This alternative scenario is called the
   counterfactual scenario, and its purpose is to provide a reference against
   which the relative merits of investing in the OE can be evaluated.
3.	Compare the O2 scenario to the counterfactual scenario to quantify
   the merits of the former, in terms of outcomes such as growth, return
   on investment, income distribution, job creation, balance of trade,
   and fiscal balance.

Doubling the OE is possible, but will take time…
The analysis suggests that doubling the GDP share of the OE is possible;
but achieving such a target is likely to take at least between 15 and 18
years. Attempts to pursue the O2 target over a shorter period of time
may well result in undesirable economic outcomes, such as diseconomies
of scale, price increases, excessive use of natural resources, and fiscal
imbalances. Nevertheless, already within the first 10 years, the O2 strategy
can yield considerable growth results (Table 2), including a 62 percent
increase of the OE GDP, in absolute terms, and an increase of 38 percent
in OE’s share in the national total (from 12.6 percent to 17.5 percent).

... it will require a major boost in investment …
The total additional investment required to set the country on the O2
trajectory is estimated to be on the order of US$8.2 billion. Specifically,
over the next 10 years (where the model produces more detailed
results), the average annual investment is estimated to be on the order
of US$580 million/year. This is equivalent to an increase in investment
of 1.6 percentage points of GDP over and above the share of GDP
going to fixed investment over the decade 2005–15 (Table 3).
    This increase in investment is feasible and is in line with a reasonable
objective of a 30 percent GDP share going toward fixed capital forma-
tion, in order to finance the OE as a major contributor to Mauritius’
transformation into a high-income economy. It would, however, require
a reversal of the recent declining trend in both private and public
investment, and it could only be achieved by increasing productivity
and competitiveness throughout the Mauritius economy.

… and will result in an expansion of non-traditional sectors.
At the sub-sectoral level, the results point to the less than proportional
expansion of some of the traditional sectors (like coastal hotels and restau-

investment indicated will be directed to the OE2 sectors, unlike in the case of the counterfactual scenario; part of the investment (about 2.63% of
GDP on average) would substitute for investment that would be undertaken by other sectors. The estimated investment is indicative, as the full
dynamic trajectory of growth has been estimated only for the years 1–10 of the simulation. (c) Historical figures are at current prices, which may

rants), and the more than proportional growth of both some of the trad-
itional activities with high expected project returns and wider economic
complementarities (like fishery and sea food processing, and the services
allied to marine transport), as well as the emerging OE subsectors.
    This result reflects several factors. First, while it is expected to
remain a pillar of the economy, tourism is now already a mature sec-
tor, with relatively lower rates of return to incremental capital. Second,
because of the already large proportion of the OE economy that it
accounts for, tourism is affected by diseconomies of scale to a lar-
ger extent than other sectors starting from a smaller sector base.
Third, tourism is still characterized by a value chain largely reliant on
imported intermediary goods, hence with limited spillover benefits on
the rest of the domestic economy. Fourth, while tourism is a labor-in-
tensive sector and an important source of jobs, its ability to drive fur-
ther sustained high-quality job growth is challenged by seasonality.
These considerations suggest that investment in tourism should be
aimed more at improving the quality and the performance of the sec-
tor than at increasing its size.

Investing in the OE is preferable to plausible alternatives …
The analysis also shows (Table 2) that compared to the alternative
scenario (the counterfactual), the O2 strategy will achieve returns
on investment (the ratio between incremental GDP and incremental
investment) of 1.49 (a 20 percent gain compared to the ratio of 1.23
estimated in the counterfactual); improve diversification of the OE
away from tourism (a 20 percent gain in diversification); create more
jobs (a 36 percent gain); improve the trade balance in net present value
(NPV) terms (a 60 percent gain); reduce poverty and inequality; and
strengthen the government’s finances (a 2 percent reduction in the
debt/ GDP ratio).

… and it will only deliver if supported by adequate conditions in
terms of financing, labor productivity, and environmental quality.
Additional investments are necessary but not sufficient for the OE to
fulfill its promises. Three areas should be considered as key prerequi-
sites for solid OE performance.
   First, macroeconomic policies need to remain prudent and foreign
exchange rates need to be stable in real terms. Otherwise, there might
be an overall slowing down of foreign capital inflows, which could lead
to a suboptimal performance of the OE. If the capital supply were to
become more rigid (for example, with a one-third reduction of supply
elasticity), the model estimates that the contribution to growth would
decline by 42 percent, from 3.17 percent to 1.83 percent.
14   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


         Second, the O2 strategy requires an ample supply of skilled and semi-
     skilled labor —especially in the new sectors of ICT, energy, and port and
     allied transportation services. At the moment, there is already evidence
     of a significant skill mismatch between demand and supply, in part
     because of the low-skill labor freed-up by the contraction of the tex-
     tile industry. This is resulting in imported labor at the lower and higher
     ends of the skill distribution. A skill mismatch, simulated in the model
     through a sharp decrease (from 1 to 0.1) in the elasticity of skilled labor
     supply to wage, would result in curtailing the potential contribution to
     growth of the O2 scenario by more than half, bringing that contribution
     down from 3.17 to 1.77; and would lead to a mere 1 percent cumulative
     return on investment over the 10-year period considered (as opposed to
     the 49 percent estimated in the absence of a skill mismatch).
         Third, conservation of high-quality natural capital is a necessity for
     the expansion of the OE. Indeed, increases in the investment require-
     ment in natural resources (proxied by their non-remunerated contri-
     bution to value added) are significant in absolute terms, at more than
     US$21 million in the 10th year of the simulation, and some 20 percent
     larger in the O2 than in the counterfactual scenario (Table 2). A deteri-
     orating environmental quality of the marine ecosystem, resulting from
     insufficient public and private investment in conserving natural resour-
     ces (in particular ocean, blue water, green water, and wetlands), is cap-
     tured in the model by a lower elasticity of supply: that is, less natural
     capital is mobilized for any given increase in its marginal return.
         If the elasticity were to become very small (about 1 percent of the
     baseline value), resource use could be expanded only by depleting the
     resources available, effectively leading to a gradual demise of the OE. In
     that case, the model simulation shows that the OE’s overall contribu-
     tion to growth would fall to 2.75 percent (compared to 3.17 percent in
     the base case of the O2 scenario) and cumulative returns to investment
     to 26 percent. Because the use of blue natural resources is more inten-
     sive in O2 and indeed is a condition necessary for its success, the afore-
     mentioned model simulation is also the only case where the counter-
     factual appears to outperform the O2 scenario, although only in terms
     of average contribution to growth.
         In summary, and simply put, the accelerated development of the OE
     would occur not in isolation but as part of a wider policy framework,
     one that maintains a conducive macroeconomic backdrop for invest-
     ment and growth and avoids potential bottlenecks, crucially including
     labor and skills. Finally, placing the OE at the forefront of Mauritius’
     development strategy only makes long-term sense if strong emphasis is
     placed on conserving the natural assets underlying increased economic
     activity in Mauritius’ marine environment.

Making It Happen: Sectoral Deep Dives

The top-down analysis in this book shows that a substantial expansion
of the OE is possible and desirable, and that it will require scaled-up
public and private investment, a conducive environment for investment,
adequate policies for obtaining the needed skills, and support for nat-
ural resource conservation. To complement these big-picture insights,
the book assesses opportunities and constraints for OE development
from the individual perspective of four sectors, representing the OE’s
established sectors (fisheries, ports), as well the emerging ones (marine
energy and marine ICT).
   The analysis defines investment scenarios based on projects currently
under discussion in Mauritius, but does not seek to assess their technical
or financial feasibility. Instead, the objective is to evaluate, from a bot-
tom-up perspective, the order of magnitude of the investment financing
required; to test the use of the CGE model to evaluate the merits of
investment (from both an individual project- and an economywide per-
spective); and identify policy or capacity bottlenecks to be overcome.
   In terms of the quantitative evaluation, the analysis has been con-
ducted by estimating each project component in terms of capital and
operational costs, as well as foreseeable revenues and proceeds from
market-related activities. This information has further been analyzed
through the CGE model and ultimately led to two sets of indicators of
investment worthiness (including NPVs and benefit-cost ratios).
   The first set (project-level measures) reflects the point of view of a
likely stakeholder (that is, a private party undertaking the project in full
or in part with government assistance). The second set (economywide
measures, EWMs) aims to address, however imperfectly, the broader
question of the social and economic desirability of projects from the
point of view of the Mauritius economy as a whole. Economywide
measures take into account the input-output structure of the Mauritius
economy and track any given expenditure through its direct and
indirect impact along value chains that are active in the economy. The
economywide measures of project worth are not directly comparable
with the project-level measures, but are presented as a complementary
set of indicators that may be useful to evaluate project outcomes from
a “big picture” economy point of view.

Traditional Ocean Sectors: Fisheries and Aquaculture

ture—is a critical part of the Mauritius economy (Table 4). It represents
about 1.5 percent of GDP and employs up to 22,000 people, including

                               lion). Currently, fishing and maritime transport are the only significant
                               marine economic activities in Mauritian jurisdictional waters, which
                               cover 1,400 times the land area of Mauritius. The reef and lagoon
                               environment and coastal fisheries make a vital social and economic
                               contribution (particularly in Rodrigues) by not only providing incomes
                               and food security but also supporting tourism and livelihoods. The tuna
                               cannery is the single largest employer in Mauritius, and Port Louis is the
                               port of choice for many industrial fleets fishing in the region because
                               of its relative efficiency and availability of services. Offshore banks and
                               seamounts offer untapped fishing potential, while an infant aquaculture
                               industry has attracted investor interest.
                                  However, in recent decades, the lagoons, coral reefs, and associated
                               coastal habitat (especially around Mauritius island) have been progres-
                               sively degraded and damaged, threatening the long-term viability of
                               fisheries in Mauritius. While some of the loss of ecosystem function may
                               be attributed to natural causes, the study team considers anthropogenic
                               stresses, such as overfishing and agricultural runoff and urban pollution,
                               to be the primary causes. Moreover, coastal and fishing communities are
                               in the front line of climate change, threatened by cyclones, coastal ero-
                               sion, and sea-level rise.
                                  Enabling the sector to meet its true potential will require a reduc-
                               tion of over-exploitation and environmental stresses in the lagoons and
                               coastal fisheries; carefully managed development of underused resour-
                               ces such as the Banks fisheries; and an enhanced investment climate for
                               expansion of aquaculture and the seafood hub. The book identifies four
                               investment scenarios (Table 5) to revitalize and develop the sector in

Lagoon Rehabilitation
Restoring the declining health of the lagoons and reefs is a “no-re-
grets” investment, creating significant sustainable benefits for coastal
fisheries, for the tourist industry, and by mitigating coastal erosion.
Healthy reefs and lagoons are a vital coastal defense against typhoons
and coastal erosion. They protect the coral sand beaches essential to
the tourist industry, support sustainable small-scale fishing, tourist
diving, and sport fishing—and are emblematic of Mauritius’ repu-
tation as an environmentally responsible and pristine tourist destin-
ation. Rehabilitation and conservation of the lagoons will require a
combination of marine spatial planning, mitigation of land-based
sources of pollution, and attention to the social issues arising from
reduced fishing effort in the lagoons. Rodrigues Island offers some
lessons in lagoon restoration and spatial management. Lessons from
the management of the Rodrigues octopus fishery are already being
applied in Mauritius Island.

                              Offshore Banks
                              The offshore Banks include the vast Mascarene underwater plateau
                              and several undersea ridges, which are about 50 times the size of
                              Mauritius’ land area. Part of the extended continental shelf is shared
                              with the Seychelles. Production from the high-value deep water Banks
                              fisheries has been declining, partly as a result of an aging fleet and
                              regulatory changes. The way forward requires investment in a modern
                              Banks fishing fleet, backed by a management regime of access to fish-
                              eries founded on sound economic principles, as typically these remote
                              deep-water fisheries suffer from economic overfishing long before the
                              resource is biologically depleted. Economic performance will depend
                              on improved fishing technologies and cooperation between operators in
                              terms of safety-at-sea, logistics, and export marketing. Increased mari-
                              time surveillance will reduce suspected illegal foreign fishing and assert
                              Mauritius’ jurisdiction over these remote fishing areas.

                              Aquaculture
                              This industry can expand significantly through farming of invertebrates
                              (like oysters, crabs, or sea cucumbers) and the cage culture of finfish. But
                              expansion will hinge on demonstrated profitability and mitigation of the
                              high risks associated with aquaculture, along with public investment to
                              create a more robust enabling environment for private investors and to
                              attract finance. Limited space within the lagoons means that expansion
                              will require some farms to be located in more exposed sites outside the
                              reefs. While these technologies exist, the risks and the capital and operat-
                              ing costs are likely to be significantly higher and financing more difficult.
                              Offshore farm size and investment tend to be high, in order to achieve
                                                                   Overview    19


the economies of scale needed to justify establishment of hatcheries and
shore infrastructure. Expansion of aquaculture may be the most chal-
lenging development scenario due to competition for inshore space, the
weak economic performance of the existing large-scale farms, and the
risks and financing difficulties offshore. Planned offshore site surveys and
expedited approval processes may provide needed incentives.

Seafood Hub
Less than 10 percent of the tuna landed or transshipped in Port Louis
is caught in Mauritian waters. In particular, the important canning and
loining activities rely on imports. This underscores the importance of
regional cooperation on tuna, not only for resource management but in
support of value added processing of the region’s raw material. In this
regard, the experiences of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement in the
Western Central Pacific provides a useful model that can be adapted to
the needs of the region’s coastal states, while local industry-led fisheries
improvement projects can complement public initiatives. Investments
aimed at improving the productivity of existing port and fisheries
infrastructure can improve the comparative advantage of Mauritius as a
regional seafood hub. Existing regional fleets could increase their use of
the port, increase landings of raw materials for processing, and expand
purchases of services and supplies. The Mauritius-based longline fleet
is also expanding to take advantage of markets for fresh tuna and the
efficient air services to Asian and European markets.

Economic Assessment
An analysis of the four investment scenarios using the CGE model shows
that additional investments of US$331 million over 10 years could
increase the sector’s revenues by US$380 million per year and generate
an additional 3,500 jobs (Table 6). The benefit/cost ratios vary across the
components of the development scenarios, ranging from 1.2 for aquacul-
ture to over 3.6 for the Banks fisheries. Similarly, the investment cost per
permanent job created varies between US$32,000/job for the Banks fish-
eries to $170,000/job for aquaculture. In addition to creating new jobs,
the investments also contribute to retention of existing ones, particularly
in coastal fisheries, seafood processing, and indirectly in tourism.
   A range of cross-cutting measures are needed to backstop sustain-
able investments, ensure their long-term economic viability and effect-
ive social inclusion, and restore the environmental health of marine and
coastal resources. Fisheries sector audits have criticized the poor imple-
mentation of previous plans. The existing plans will require updating
and the inclusion of financing modalities and key milestones (both of
which are often lacking). Other needed measures include these:
20   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


     •	   Performance-based realignment of staff, budgets, and institutions to
          help meet changing priorities;
     •	   Improved fisheries governance informed by a modern fisheries infor-
          mation management system;
     •	   Expanded monitoring of reef and lagoon health to: (i) clearly identify
          the impact of different stressors; (ii) justify remedial actions upon
          which a comprehensive lagoon rehabilitation program can be based;
          and (iii) develop synergies with investment in climate action, tour-
          ism, and MSP;
     •	   Public support for private business initiatives to draw on the lessons
          of previous loan and grant schemes in fisheries; and
     •	   At the international level, continued effort by Mauritius to sustain-
          ably manage the tuna resources for the benefit of the region, lead
          blue economy innovation and development, and press for resources
          for a proposed Africa Ocean Economy Platform.

        Consolidating and sustaining these diverse initiatives suggests that
     a robust public information strategy can increase public support and
     understanding. Preparation of regular state of the fisheries or state of
     the OE reports can inform public opinion and the political processes
     at national and local levels. Universities and nongovernmental organiz-
     ations (fisher and industry associations) will all have a role to play in
     informing and supporting these initiatives.

     Traditional Ocean Sectors: Ports
     Strategically located at the crossroads of Asian and African sea routes,
     Port Louis, the main seaport of Mauritius, handles 99 percent of the
     country’s external trade and has become an important hub for the trans-
     shipment of containers moving between other countries. Port-related
     activities account for around 2 percent of the country’s GDP (Table 1)
     and around 9,000 jobs.
        Over the past two decades, major investments have transformed Port
     Louis into an efficient, modern seaport. The government is now plan-
     ning to reposition the port as a regional trade hub, with the focus on
     boosting transshipment activities, including containers (Figure 3) and
     petroleum products, as well as seafood processing, bunkering, and cruise
     activities. This is intended to bring in substantial additional income
     from outside of Mauritius, as well as serving the needs of an expanding
     domestic economy.
        Responsibility for the provision of port infrastructure and servi-
     ces rests primarily with two state-owned organizations: Mauritius Port
     Authority (MPA), which is the main body responsible for port planning,
     infrastructure investment, pilotage and towage, and port administration;

and the Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd (CHCL), which is responsible
for cargo handling, mainly of containers. Some private companies own
or lease their own dedicated facilities within the port and provide their
own handling services for specific bulk cargoes, such as wheat.
   Port traffic reached 8.4 million tons in 2016 and is dominated by
containers (52 percent), but there are also sizeable movements of dry
and liquid bulk cargo (22 percent and 24 percent, respectively), and
smaller movements of general cargo and fish. Frequent, competitively
priced container services to multiple destinations are an important plus
point in attracting footloose foreign investment, and they have allowed
Mauritius to expand and diversify its economy by seeking export oppor-
tunities overseas. In 2015, imports of goods and services were equiva-
lent to 59 percent of GDP, while exports of goods and services were
equivalent to 49 percent of GDP.
   However, Mauritius-based trade (both imports to and exports from
the country) accounts for only 60 percent of port throughput. The rest
comes from facilitating global trade between third countries, made up
of container transshipment (27 percent), re-exported petroleum prod-
ucts such as bunkers and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (12 percent),
and the transshipment of fish (2 percent).
   The key question for Mauritius is how it can further increase the
external component of port traffic. Two scenarios have been identified
(Table 7):

•	              Conservative scenario: This scenario would require just under
                US$1.1 billion of investment and is based on projects actively under
22   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


          discussion. The projects include a new gate complex for the existing
          container terminal, a second oil jetty at Fort George, a breakwater
          with a new “island” container terminal on its shore side, a cruise ter-
          minal, a new oil jetty and tank farm at Albion, and a small breakwater
          in the Caudan area to provide shelter for marine-type activities.
     •	   Optimistic scenario: This scenario would require an extra US$0.24
          billion of investment, and is based on additional projects that might
          be undertaken in the next 10 years or beyond. The projects include
          a further extension of the Albion tank farm, the reconstruction of
          Quay 1 for dry bulk cargo, a marina, fishing harbor facilities, and a
          third ship-repair yard.

        Some of the projects, such as the gate complex, breakwaters, and
     fishing harbor, are not directly revenue-generating but are required to
     improve operational performance and support other port activities. In
     other cases, such as the oil jetties at Albion and Fort George, the finan-
     cial returns on public investment will be relatively low because of pub-
     lic sector pricing policies. However, these facilities are expected to draw
     in significant amounts of private investment, which would not other-
     wise have come to Mauritius.
        The CGE modeling work shows these projects to have a positive net
     value added in aggregate, which is even larger once multiplier effects are
     accounted for. However, the financial feasibility of some projects—such
     as the island container terminal and the oil terminal at Albion—needs to
     be further investigated, including the option of undertaking them as pub-
     lic-private partnerships. In addition, the public sector may have to make
     investments in the port that do not show a positive financial return in
     order to attract the necessary private investment. Thus, the port expan-
     sion projects needed to reposition Port Louis in the market warrant
     further investigation to validate the result of this preliminary analysis
     regarding their worth from the point of view of the economy as a whole.
        Because many of these projects rely on capturing mobile third-
     party business in a globally competitive market, rather than servicing
     the needs of a captive domestic economy, they are relatively high risk.
     Several of the larger projects are also capital-intensive, with relatively
     few linkages to other sectors of the Mauritius economy. This explains
     why the ports sector is shown in Figure 8 as generating a lower benefit/
     cost ratio and fewer jobs per $1.0 million of investment than some of
     the other sectors of the OE.
        Whether or not to go ahead with the projects in the two scenarios
     will depend on the creation of a more favorable environment for private
     investment in port-related infrastructure; and on the implementation
     of a series of measures to “make it happen.” The OE investments being

planned for the future are larger and more complex than those under-
taken in the past; also, these planned investments seek to attract invest-
ors and customers from outside of Mauritius rather than within. Thus,
a more pro-active approach to project development will be required,
with the joint development of comprehensive investment packages by
MPA and other government bodies such as the ministries of Finance and
Ocean Economy and the Board of Investment.
   The MPA has a central role to play in the efforts of “Mauritius Inc.”
to attract inward investment, but it needs further capacity building in
the areas of marketing, customer relationship management, project
appraisal, and IT. The additional human resource needs are small, but
the key personnel need to be carefully selected and given customized,
on-the-job training. Key issues to be addressed include these:

•	   Helping existing customers to grow and, if needed, prioritizing
     long-term economic considerations over MPA’s short-term financial
     objectives. Possible measures include continuous research into the
     needs of the port’s main users, strategic planning meetings with cus-
     tomers, expansion of government-funded training schemes for port
     service providers, and government procurement policies that favor
     local suppliers.
•	   Actively seeking out new customers overseas. OE objectives should
     lie at the center of any future port marketing strategy, with the
     provision of suitable incentives for private investors in the port that
     have forward and backward linkages to the rest of the economy. The
     impact of new investments on established (potentially competing)
     businesses should also be considered.
•	   Measures to expand port services, such as bunkering, ship repairing,
     crew changes, and ships’ supplies. These are low-profile port services
     that require further investigation.

                               Although this is not the direct responsibility of MPA, it could
                               become an important center for port-related distribution activities,

                               omy (Table 8).

                               processing of new proposals while ensuring that they still provide
                               value for money, especially in respect of public sector investment.
                          •	   Design of tariff structures, leases, and concession agreements to keep
                               as many of the benefits of new projects as possible within Mauritius.
                          •	   Improved monitoring of port performance, including better statistics
                               integrated into a Port Management Information System (PMIS) and
                               further upgrades to the Port Community IT system to reduce trans-
                               action costs and allow big-data analysis of cargo flows through the port.

                             For the ports sector, the future holds a mixture of opportunities
                          and challenges. Seizing the former and addressing the latter can turn
                          Mauritius into the Singapore of the South West Indian Ocean. In par-
                          ticular, there will be an increasing need to be well-informed about port
                          and shipping developments elsewhere in the world, and for MPA to
                          expand its role from that of a landlord port authority into a facilitator of
                          economic development with a leadership role within a cluster of broad-
                          ly-based port-related activities—as is currently happening in progressive
                          European ports such as Rotterdam.

                          Emerging Ocean Sectors: Energy
                          As Mauritius looks for ways to meet its commitments to the UN
                          Sustainable Development Goals and national targets for renewable
                          energy, encouraging the use of renewable and clean energy to reduce
                          the country’s dependence on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas
                          (GHG) emissions, ocean-renewable energy technology (O-RET) is
                          being explored as a promising option. The country has a total area of
                          close to 2 million square kilometers of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
                                                                     Overview    25


and is geographically well positioned to harness ocean energy, in the
form of offshore wind, ocean wave, ocean current, ocean thermal, and
ocean saline energy. Currently, the Mauritian energy sector is carbon
intensive and dependent upon imports such as oil and coal. Nationally,
the power sector fuel input is split between 20 percent renewable
bagasse, 26 percent oil, and 54 percent coal. Just over 5 percent of
generation is from hydro, and small quantities of electricity are gener-
ated by wind and waste (CEB 2014; World Bank 2015). Coal is cheap,
imported, and GHG-intensive. It is the lowest-cost option for further
expansion of the power system (OECD 2015).
   The potential expansion of the energy system is split into conven-
tional land-based and new ocean-based options. Recent national analy-
ses indicated that the renewable options—which include bagasse, wind,
solar, and hydro power, but not O-RET—might contribute as much
as 35 percent by 2030 (Dhununjoy and Ramparsad 2015; Soonarane
2016)). Wind and solar energy are expected to play an increasingly
important role, but they are intermittent and will require other power
plants to “balance” the system, the grid to be strengthened, and market
rules to change. Globally, the use of offshore wind power is growing—
with one recent study noting that in 2015 the European Union (EU)
represented 14 percent of the total wind power installations, up 4 per-
cent from the previous year; by 2020, present capacity is expected to
grow threefold (Khoodaruth et al. 2017).
   Ocean renewable energy technology, or O-RET, is an emerging tech-
nology and could make a significant contribution to reducing depend-
ency on imported fuels. How much of a role can O-RET play in sup-
plying energy in Mauritius? At this point, the newly launched Mauritius
Renewable Energy Agency (MARENA) is actively coordinating and
promoting investment to harness the potential of O-RET, and activities
are accelerating (Box 3).
   This analysis assesses the medium to longer-term potential of O-RET
using the cost minimizing Open Source energy Modelling System
(OSeMOSYS) and considering different assumptions of key exogenous
variables such as carbon pricing and efficiency gains driven by techno-
logical progress. Of the options available to Mauritius, three stand out,
as follows:

•	   Deep water ocean cooling. This is a cost competitive technology,
     with current application focused on buildings with central chiller
     systems, close to deep water. A pilot in Port Louis is being considered
     that might reduce electricity demand by 2 to 4 percent. The process
     involves extracting deep cold ocean water and using it to chill water
     that, in turn, cools air in modified central air-chillers. Note, however,
              26    The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last




Box 3. A Snapshot of Government Steps to Support Renewable Energy

A renewable energy agency. Under the Ministry of Energy (MOE), the Mauritius Renewable Energy
Agency (MARENA) is synthesizing analysis to inform national renewable energy technologies targets, grid
integration, and the role of the ocean. To assist integration, a document setting up norms and standards for
the importation, installation, maintenance, and recycling of RET devices has been drafted.

Promotion of renewables. Recent efforts include funding photovoltaic farm deployment (such as a 15 MW
facility in 2014), net-metering, and deployment of subsidies for photovoltaic under green energy schemes
(Mauritius 2017). Seed funding for wave based mini-grid generation has been attracted. Green Climate Fund
support for the operationalization of MARENA and improving the readiness of the electricity grid to receive
greater quantities of distributed renewable energy generation has also been secured (GCF, n.d.).

Bilateral wave energy collaboration. Collaboration with Australia on wave energy development is
expected to yield an actionable wave sector development roadmap. For wind, a call for an expression of
interest in a 10–20 MW offshore farm is being drafted. Given growth potential in wind, wave, and deep
ocean water applications (DOWAs), an ocean technology incubator has been identified as a facility to be
jointly developed with the Central Electricity Board (CEB).

A regional wave database. The Mauritius Oceanography Institute (MOI) has developed a referential
wave database for the entire Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) region. It has collaboratively deployed wave
observation buoys and undertaken extensive satellite-based assessments. Being situated in a location with
limited coral barrier, it intends to demonstrate wave potential with a small, low-cost pilot plant during 2017.
It has also been the recipient of requests for information on water temperature profiles by potential ocean
thermal energy conversion (OTEC) project developers.




                        that access to a cold water stream has multiple potential uses—such
                        as for the cooling of surface ICT data-centers and improving the
                        efficiency of industrial freezing, aquaculture (like abalone farm-
                        ing) thalasso, bottling, and others. These non-air-conditioning uses
                        may increase the revenue and provide a space for new product
                        development. It is assumed that with dynamic expansion, as much
                        as 4 percent1 of power demand may be reduced by taking advantage
                        of DOWA. Related options not included, which may hold future
                        potential, include deep water pumped storage (Economist 2016) and
                        OTEC electricity generation.



                    1 This is expert judgment, based on an assessment that at least 15 percent of
                    the island’s commercial and industrial energy is used for cooling (AFD 2012)
                    and assuming that as much as 30 percent might be captured by DOWA. The
                    percentage cooling is likely to rise with increased air-conditioning and process-
                    ing requirements. Clearly, however, a deeper analysis would need to be made
                    around the potential spatial evolution of cooling demand. For example, if low
                    cost district cooling were available, it would likely attract activities with high
                    cooling requirements.

•	   Offshore wind. At present this is not cost-competitive compared to
     producing electricity from coal or even land-based wind (although
     the latter is restricted by limited siting space). But it could become
     competitive if costs were to drop; or if reduction of emissions were
     to be incentivized through a carbon market. One possible technology
     is fixed turbines, which are cheaper (per kW) but require shallow
     water, which exists in and around the lagoon. If this technology were
     adopted, careful marine spatial planning (MSP) would be required
     to trade off social, environmental, and economic considerations. The
     other possible technology is floating turbines, which can be situated
     further from land; however, they are expensive and the technology is
     immature (Martin n.d.).
•	   Wave. The potential for wave appears high, although it is not eco-
     nomic at present. However, it has advantages. The electricity that
     this technology provides is not as intermittent as wind.2 In addition,
     while the technology is immature, its costs are decreasing, and it is
     subject to aggressive learning. Wave could become economic if paired
     with carbon finance. Some companies are developing pilot sites
     internationally—and Mauritius may be an excellent site for a highly
     subsidized pilot (CWE 2016).

   O-RET technologies that were not analyzed in the model scenarios,
but are worth noting, include: (i) use of algae-based biofuel; this appears
to hold potential, but recent estimates indicate important uncertainties
concerning its economic potential (IRENA 2016a); (ii) electricity gen-
eration from OTEC; the technology is still in its infancy and expensive,
and existing demonstration projects are small3; and (iii) desalination of


2 The consistency of wave energy results from the ability of waves to travel
long distances with little loss of energy. This means that many sites for wave
farms will be receiving significant swell waves created by winds out to sea, even
when there is little or no local wind. This extra persistence of swell waves gives
wave energy a significant advantage over wind energy. Wave energy is also more
forecastable than wind energy, allowing for easier integration into power grids.
Typically, wave sizes can be accurately forecast three to five days in advance
(McArthur and Brekken 2010).
3 By 2016, the largest was a 0.1 MW plant in Honolulu, which was built at a

reported cost of more than $5 million, about 50 percent higher than the cur-
rent cost of wave energy (Vyawahare 2015). At this point, leading organizations
like the International Energy Agency do not yet include current or projected
costs of OTEC power generation in their reference cost projection publication
(IEA 2016), but costs may fall quickly as deployment increases. China is build-
ing a 10 MW machine on Hainan island, and the associated scale and learning
may lead to significant cost decreases (Power Technology n.d.). A watching
brief should be kept on the technology and its potential in Mauritian waters.

                             city that can be switched on and off to match the intermittency of vari-
                             able RET (including O-RET), and demand for it is increasing.
                                Combining these with other options available for energy sector
                             expansion, the analysis describes two development scenarios. One
                             reflects options for O-RET development already identified; and the
                             second one (“additional development options”) focuses on a plausible
                             upper end of expansion (Table 9).
                                Our results show that currently DOWA holds the greatest economic
                             potential, already being explored for air conditioning in Port Louis. Next,
                             offshore wind shows extensive potential with appropriate concessional
                             finance (such as carbon financing), which would likely only need to be
                             modest thanks to rapid cost and performance improvement. Wave energy,
                             on the other hand, would require higher levels of supporting finance. The
                             modeling suggests that both scenarios are technically feasible and are
                             likely to generate sizable economywide benefits, with benefit-cost ratios
                             well in excess of 2 (Table 10). The more ambitious scenario also has a
                             high pay-off in terms of employment generated per unit of investment.
                             This is due in part to the prevalence of the higher labor intensity sec-
                             tors (wind and wave) and in part to the fact that the optimistic addition-
                             al-development-options scenario is more intensive in construction work.
                                In addition to the growth and employment benefits, expanding the
                             use of marine energy can reduce the country’s dependence on fossil
                             fuels (especially coal) and lower its GHG emissions—with potential
                             import reductions of 3 to 19 percent and GHG emissions reductions of
                             3 to 18 percent through O-RET deployment (Figure 4). These benefits
                             will also assist Mauritius in meeting commitments made under the UN
                             Sustainable Development Goals and other agreements.
                                In sum, the proposed DOWA project should be started, pursuing at
                             the same time an audit of the costs (and benefits) and further develop-
                             ment of the appropriate supporting policy. And it would make eco-

Notes: (a) The merits of the development scenarios are assessed only from the point of view of the economy as a whole. At the project level,
the projects are viable to the extent that an adequate rate of remuneration of capital is built into system of electricity tariffs. (b) Job creation is

attract external co-financing from developers and others.
   For large deployment of O-RET to happen, there will need to be a
combination of clear longer-term vision, human capacity development,
standards adoption, comprehensive tariffs, and targeted opportunities to
attract private investment and realize the sector’s potential. This would

        In the short term, a pragmatic master plan might involve a limited
     set of pilot demonstration projects that might later be scaled up. Those
     chosen should show positive benefit-cost ratios, or high potential of
     longer-term benefits. Offshore wind and wave pilots should be con-
     sidered on a case-by-case basis, following negotiations with suppliers
     and a full assessment of the integration, supplementary revenues, and
     in-kind contributions associated with setting up demonstration projects.

     Emerging Ocean Sectors: ICT
     The ICT sector now contributes some 5.6 percent of national GDP, of
     which perhaps just under 10 percent is related in some way to the OE.
     But there are strong synergies between the OE and the ICT sector that,
     if properly exploited, can contribute to both growing the ICT sector
     as a whole and to reinforcing its ocean component. These complemen-
     tarities go in both directions. On the one hand, ocean resources enable
     the ICT sector to function and offer opportunities for ICT market
     expansion (Box 4) through undersea cables, the provision of cooling
     services for off-shore data centers, and new market opportunities in the
     area of off-shore communications services to mariners (mainly leisure
     users, but also coastal fisheries). On the other hand, ICT applications
     can also be a key ingredient in the development of many ocean activities
     (Table 11), especially in terms of enhancing the future competitiveness
     of Mauritius.
        At the moment, there are investment and policy constraints that pre-
     vent Mauritius from fully taking advantage of the potential synergies.
     For example, limits to competition in the access to international band-
     width received through a submarine cable results in relatively poor
     internet experience for Mauritian consumers (Table 12). Specifically,
                                                                                  Overview     31




  Box 4. How the Ocean Supports ICT Development

  The ocean supports the ICT sector in three main ways, all of which are based on investing in infrastructure
  directly in the ICT sector and using Mauritius’s island location to generate revenue and future growth.
      The first linkage is through the global network of undersea cables, which provide the “first mile” of the
  internet to a majority of the world’s population. Mauritius was an early beneficiary of such a global network
  when the Cable and Wireless Trans Indian Ocean cable reached Mauritius (from Durban) and Rodrigues
  (from Zanzibar) in 1901. In more recent times, the first fiber optic cable (SAFE) arrived in 2002, and a second
  landing came in 2009 (LION), although these cables are now limited by capacity and competitive con-
  straints. Two further cables are planned, and Mauritius is open to further investment, but there is perhaps
  a need for greater ambition.
      A second potentially important linkage comes from the use of offshore data centers. Several companies
  already have data centers on oceangoing ships, such as the Google Barges,a and now Microsoft has gone
  a step further by experimenting in Project Natickb with an undersea data center, at a depth of 30 meters in
  trials. The logic is to reduce costs for space rental and cooling, both of which make up a significant part of
  the budget for a data center. Mauritius, with its abundance of cold, deep water close to shore, is an obvious
  candidate to host such floating and underwater data centers.
      Thirdly, cellular mobile services, which constitute the largest segment of the ICT sector worldwide,
  can be extended offshore to provide services to mariners, mainly leisure users but also coastal fisheries.
  Mauritius’s success in being one of the first countries in Africa to complete the digital switchover from
  analogue TV broadcasting has released a large swathe of valuable spectrum (below 1 GHz), much of which
  is earmarked for mobile cellular use. The future allocation of this spectrum, which is particularly useful for
  offshore services because of its long range and low attenuation, could generate significant income, espe-
  cially if allocated using market mechanisms (such as auctions).

international bandwidth is not being converted to higher speeds for
users because of a low level of competitive efficiency compared to other
countries using the same cables.
   This book identifies illustrative scenarios of investment to strengthen
both ends of the OE/ ICT synergistic relationship, focusing on expan-
sion of the capacity of submarine cables, on the development of off-
shore data storage, on the market for off-shore mobile services, and on
selected marine ICT applications. The scope of the assessment is limited
to development options where sufficient information could be obtained
during the timeframe of the study.
   The main opportunity lies in the expansion of Mauritius’s network of
international undersea communications cables. There are great benefits
in having a coastline for access to fiber-optic submarine cables. In Africa,
the average price per megabit per second (Mbit/s) of bandwidth per
month is more than US$200 cheaper in coastal countries than in land-
locked countries. Mauritius is currently served by two undersea cables

•	   SAFE cable (South Africa – Far East). This was one of the first fiber
     optic networks to serve Africa when it was launched in April 2002.
     It joins South Africa with the SAT-3 cable, of the same vintage, that
     links to West Africa and Europe. It is a “club cable”—that is, owned
     by a consortium of some 30 telecom operators, of which Mauritius
     Telecom, is one—but it is not an “open access” cable, in the sense
     that capacity can only be sold through its members, which restricts
     scope for price competition. Furthermore, it represents the technol-
     ogy of its day, carrying only 2 lit (that is, usable) fiber pairs with a
     maximum capacity of 440 Gbit/s. It cannot easily be upgraded, and
     it is approaching the end of its expected lifespan.
•	   LION-1 cable (Lower Indian Ocean Network). This is a more recent
     cable (in service since November 2009) with a much greater poten-
     tial capacity, 1,280 Gbit/s, though as of mid-2016 only 20 Gbit/s (1.6
     percent) is actually lit. It is effectively a proprietary owner’s cable,
     belonging to Orange (formerly France Telecom), though the owner-
     ship is formally divided with its subsidiaries, Telecom Mauritius and
     Orange Madagascar. LION-1 connects to the LION-2 cable, from a
     branching unit off the coast of Madagascar, and from there to Mayotte
     and Nairobi, where it links with four other cables. The LION-1 cable
     has landfall in Terre Rouge, in the north of the island. Thus, the only
     connection between the SAFE and LION-1 cables is via Telecom
     Mauritius’s domestic network, enabling Mauritius Telecom to main-
     tain its stranglehold over prices. Furthermore, even though EMTEL
     (Mauritius’s second operator) has purchased capacity on LION-1,
     the terms of its license prevent it from increasing that capacity. Thus,
     LION-1 is not a true open-access cable and it brings very little price
     competition to Mauritius.

   As for internet bandwidth, Mauritius ranks third in Sub-Saharan
Africa (after Ghana and Malawi) for having the lowest prices. However,
its US$26.09 per Mbit/s monthly price is still much higher than inter-
national competitors for OE activities, especially when expressed in
terms of purchasing power parities (US$46.77). By contrast, econ-
omies such as Hong Kong (a shipping and port competitor) offer rates
as low as US$1.06 per Mbit/s per month, and the Bahamas (a tourism
competitor) offer rates of US$3.92—while even Vietnam (a fisheries
and seafood competitor) is able to offer rates at around US$26.06 per
month, or just over half the price of Mauritius.
   The challenge to Mauritius is to develop a new generation of under-
sea cables that will service its aspirations to be a global player in the
information society. This requires a global rather than a purely regional
perspective.

     Box 5. Using Big Data to Support Trade Logistics

     An informal working group formed by the experts of the Ministry of Ocean
     Economy, Ministry of Finance, and Statistics Mauritius has been consulting
     on the design of a major program on Big Data and Maritime Digitization. This
     appears to be a promising initiative, and the government may wish to formal-
     ize the arrangement and further develop the program, which would help the
     transition from a mere industrialization to an innovation policy centered on
     the OE. The program would include activities on: (i) ocean-going research- and
     marine-security vessels; (ii) satellite remote sensing, communications, and global
     positioning; (iii) submersible and fixed platforms and systems; (iv) in-situ sensors;
     (v) modelling and computational infrastructure; and (vi) “big data” storage and
     management. It would generate ocean monitoring, security, and surveillance
     components, encompassing a mix of diverse sectorial infrastructures that serve
     a variety of purposes.
         The program could cover a range of modern services that can be digitized to
     support global trading, which is constantly expanding—such as the application of
     big data in the digitalization of international trade and supply chain data in Africa
     (emerging continent) and the China/Asia sourcing region for the trading/business
     community worldwide and locally. It could also expand to digitalization of the
     remaining ocean clusters’ scientific and technical data to better understand their
     challenges and opportunities.




excess of 3.6) and the potential to create some 3,500 permanent jobs.
The benefits of the investment are larger from the economy-wide per-
spective than from the project level one (which exhibits a benefit/cost
ratio below 2). This is due to several reasons:

•	   The ICT projects all include public good components in the form of
     infrastructure that can be shared by virtually all sectors and economic
     agents (such as the submarine cables).
•	   The construction activities activate several other sectors through
     their linkages with the rest of the economy.
•	   The telecommunications sector, the ultimate destination of the
     investment, has multiple important linkages with most service activ-
     ities, especially financial services and tourism.

   A constrained availability of skilled labor may be particularly import-
ant for the ICT sector. A sensitivity analysis conducted under an
assumption of lower elasticity of labor supply to wage suggests that the
investment program identified would still be worth pursuing from the
point of view of the economy as a whole, but it would deliver lower
economic returns and fewer jobs.

or a substantial amount of skilled labor will have to be imported (or both).




                                 In summary, ICT could play a much bigger role in transforming
                              the Mauritian economy, but for that to happen, there will need to be
                              a well thought out strategy of stepped-up investments and progres-
                              sive policy reforms. A top priority is boosting investment in submarine
                              cables, while rethinking their geopolitical orientations—that is, whether
                              the focus should be regional (the current case) or global in ambition.
                              Mauritius also needs to invest more in its domestic backbone network
                              (by expanding domestic fiber optic capacity on an open access basis
                              and ensuring the existing Internet Exchange Point is better utilized) to
                              ensure greater connectivity—and explore new areas like hosting float-
                              ing and underwater data centers.
                                 But new investments must be backed by policy reforms, led by ICTA
                              (the ICT regulatory agency), to improve the sector’s competitiveness—
                              ranging from privatizing the government’s majority share in Mauritius
                              Telecom to encouraging measures (like local loop unbundling) to
                              deliver high-speed internet services at an affordable price.

                              OE? Any OE expansion is likely to entail larger pressure on the environ-
                              ment, including pollution of water and coastlines, in turn affecting coral
                              reefs, lagoon habitats, and biodiversity. Coastal erosion resulting from
                              land use change and climate variability and change is also increasing. A
                              more active use of the OE requires technical and institutional mechan-
                              isms to reconcile, across sectors and time, competing claims over ocean
                              resources; and to increase the resilience of ocean and coastal resources
                              to climate variability and change.

Marine Spatial Planning
As Mauritius weighs how to balance OE development with conserving
the very ocean on which that development depends, a relatively new
management tool—marine spatial planning (MSP)—stands out as espe-
cially promising to address the challenge. The expansion of the OE will
necessarily require improved management of the coastal and marine
environment, reduced pressures on key natural resources, and ensuring
long-term sustainability of natural capital or ecosystem services
   In recognition of this need, the Prime Minister’s Office announced in
December 2016 the intention to develop an MSP for the country’s EEZ,
to address increasing demand for marine space, in particular, fisheries and
aquaculture, tourism, and leisure. Since the MSP process is in its early
stages, there is an opportunity to build on international experiences to
inform the next steps, including definition of objectives, the geographic
boundary of the plan, expected timeline of results, data to be gathered,
modalities of stakeholder involvement, and implementation.
   An MSP is different from the usual way that decisions are made in
the marine environment in that it is an integrated process to reconcile
multiple ecological, economic, and social objectives. UNESCO defines
it as “a practical way to create and establish a more rational organiza-
tion of the use of marine space and the interactions between its uses,
to balance demands for development with the need to protect marine
ecosystems, and to achieve social and economic objectives in an open
participatory and planned way.”( Ehler and Douvere, 2009). MSP is
usually specified through a political process and involves stakeholder
participation.
   Globally, 22 countries have completed, approved, or implemented
MSPs, and plans are under way in 12 more countries. These plans range
from unregulated MSPs that provide policy direction to regulated ones
that are supported by legislation or regulations. One of the key les-
sons learned over the last 10 years is that there are tangible benefits
to multi-objective, integrated MSPs over single-sector management
plans. Benefits include reduced permitting times for new develop-
ment; increased coordination between government agencies, resulting
in reduced time for decision-making; and improved stakeholder buy-in
for new marine protected areas and management reforms.
   In Mauritius, the benefits of a comprehensive approach are particu-
larly evident, where several drivers of pressure on the marine environ-
ment will need to be addressed and managed with strict policies and
regulations to ensure that the financial investment in the OE is sup-
ported by a healthy ocean. Of greatest importance are restoring coral
reefs to ensure adequate coastal protection from cyclones and to sup-
port lagoon fisheries; restoring mangroves and addressing shoreline

                           hardening to control beach erosion; improving water quality by con-
                           trolling pollution of the marine environment from wastewater and agri-
                           cultural run-off; and ensuring lasting results by using robust stakeholder
                           engagement processes to site new marine uses like aquaculture, renew-
                           able energy, and deep sea mining to avoid or minimize conflicts with
                           existing uses.
                              Mauritius is well positioned to get the MPS process going. A recent
                           high-level analysis of the feasibility of creating one for Mauritius finds
                           that eight of nine key enabling conditions are present to some degree
                           (Table 14).
                              Indeed, the country’s preparedness is relatively strong in that there
                           are relevant legal instruments that may apply to an MSP, spatial data
                           and scientific institutions that can develop or create new data, and gov-
                           ernment champions. There is also an urgency in the need to address
                           land-based sources of pollution, protect the coastal areas from erosion,
                           and allocate space for new activities—against a backdrop of overlapping
                           authorities that manage the coastal area.
                              What is the best way for Mauritius to proceed with planning and
                           implementing an MSP? An overarching, strategic decision to be made

early in the process concerns the level of ambition of the MSP—
for example, what will be accomplished, and how long will it take?
Answering these questions is critical to the success of the process
and will require careful selection of priority objectives, a governance
framework for making decisions and receiving stakeholder input, and
deciding upon the plan outputs. All of this needs to be considered
within the context of available funding and capacity. There are two
main options that can be considered with respect to these considera-
tions, as follows.

Option 1: First, develop a high-level strategic framework for deci-
sion-making and management of marine economic sectors. The
framework will guide development and future marine investments,
identify the top environmental issues that need to be addressed, and
identify future development that is likely to create spatial conflicts
with existing uses. Next, implement and monitor the strategic plan
for five years, revise and adapt where necessary, and then develop a
spatial plan with zones and management considerations. During the
five-year monitoring period, spatial data would be gathered, system-
atic conservation planning and other analyses would be undertaken
to identify high priority conservation areas, stakeholder engagement
would be organized and funded, and governance structures would be
developed. Such an approach is similar to the one that Norway used
to develop a comprehensive MSP. It has the advantage of ensuring that
the decision-making framework is robust, tested, and adapted based
on government and stakeholder feedback before the spatial planning
begins. It also has the advantage that more spatial data are likely to be
available in the second phase. It has the disadvantage that allocation
of space for new activities might not occur for up to 10 years and the
urgency of an MSP may be lost.

Option 2: Develop a decision-making framework and comprehensive
zoning design simultaneously or sequentially, but without a period of
adaptation prior to implementing the complete MSP. This approach has
the advantage of planning for future activities within the next six years,
planning for increased marine protection to meet the UN Convention
of Biological Diversity 10 percent by 2020 goal, immediately starting
to address climate change impacts, generating momentum with stake-
holders without any disruptions, and completing the whole plan before
undertaking monitoring and a five-year review. It has the disadvantage
that spatial data may not be available for all decisions, and it may
exceed resources available in the short-term (that is, more time might
be needed for fundraising).

     Challenges
     Whichever option is chosen (and there are other possibilities as well),
     there are at least five challenges that should be tackled as the MSP pro-
     cess progresses in Mauritius.

     Defining the role and responsibilities of each institution. There are a
     multiplicity of public sector agencies that are actively engaged in the
     marine space and that will need to find ways to cooperate effectively to
     advance the MSP process and ensure successful implementation. These
     include the Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry of Environment and
     Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Ocean Economy, MOI, the
     National Ocean Council (NOC), the University of Mauritius (UoM),
     and the Mauritius Research Council (MRC).

     Upgrading the legal and regulatory framework. Despite the existence
     of no fewer than 25 Acts or other legal instruments in Mauritius that
     are relevant to MSP, there are key gaps that should be addressed in
     order to implement an MSP. These include the absence of a proper
     mechanism to resolve conflict among users of marine resources; the
     unclear definition in the 2007 Fisheries and Marine Resources Act
     of the characteristics a particular area requires to have the status of a
     Marine Protected Area; and the framework for integrating coastal zone
     management.

     Coordination with Rodrigues. This relates to the fact that back in 2007,
     Rodrigues took the steps to protect its marine ecosystem through the
     creation of four marine reserves (no-take zones) in the north of the
     island, and it has been engaged in multi-sector marine planning.

     Joint Management Area with Seychelles on the Mascarene Plateau.
     There are ongoing discussions by Seychelles and Mauritius for a polit-
     ical and strategic framework for decision-making and management of
     the Joint Management Area (JMA).4 While this is a distinct institutional
     and political planning process from either the Mauritius or Seychelles
     MSP, it will be important to figure out effective coordination mechan-
     isms and planning objectives, because of crucial information that may
     influence the location of zones adjacent to the JMA and allowable
     activities within the national EEZs.

International pelagic resources. Several pelagic resources (notably tuna)
are managed jointly with international bodies and also require regional
coordination (for example, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission).
Pelagic resources require careful consideration in terms of an MSP
process because additional stakeholders may need to be involved in
discussions about objectives, conservation targets, zone locations, and
allowable uses, and the timeline for those discussions may be affected
by other agreements.

   Making an MSP happen in Mauritius will involve deciding on the
process structure (options 1 and 2 above) and then developing a budget,
and identifying financial and staff resources. An MSP can be thought of
as occurring in several phases, each with approximate timelines, such
that it can take 4 to 10 years for a complete MSP. The timing depends
on whether phases are done sequentially or simultaneously:

•	   Pre-planning: identify need, authority, financial support, and spatial
     boundary—1 to 2 years.
•	   Phase 1: MSP as a framework for decision-making—2 to 3 years.
•	   Phase 2: MSP as a zoning design and approved legislation—3 to 5
     years.

   One of the lessons learned from other MSP processes is the need
to carefully think through implementation plans, including applicable
regulations, financing, timing, and governance structures, and building
these into the work plan from day one.
   In sum, an integrated and comprehensive MSP is an important strat-
egy for expanding the OE in Mauritius in an orderly fashion, including
proper siting of new activities and addressing environmental pressures
from traditional marine sectors. An MSP should result in clear guide-
lines for developing across space emerging sectors (like marine renew-
able energy and aquaculture), thus providing the business certainty
needed to attract investors to these industries and developing endur-
ing mechanisms to resolve conflicts amongst users. Finally, an MSP pro-
cess will necessarily engage stakeholders, bringing local knowledge and
contributed information about social values into the design of the plan,
which will increase buy-in and ownership of the plan for successful
implementation of OE investments.


Climate Change
Climate change is likely to endanger much of the development poten-
tial of the OE in Mauritius. Important climate-related stressors include
42   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


     sea-level rise (including increases in coastal erosion), tropical storm
     intensification (including storm surges and changes in wave dynamics),
     intensified rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and ocean acidifi-
     cation (which can affect fishery resources). Table 15 lists the OE clus-
     ters and the climate change shocks and stressors most likely to pose a
     significant risk.
        Building up a growing body of studies (Box 6), the Government of
     Mauritius has taken important steps already to interpret the relevant
     climate science for the island and the South West Indian Ocean region.
     In many cases, it has used this knowledge to better understand key
     physical effects, such as ocean acidification and the impact of sea tem-
     perature changes on fisheries resources. In a few cases, it has quantified
     and monetized these impacts. For example, Mauritius’ Second National
     Communication states that over the last decade, 18,500 square meters
     of beach have eroded in Mauritius, land with a rental value conserva-
     tively estimated at MUR 1.2 million and an ecosystem and protection
     value of potentially millions of rupees more.
        However, significant work remains to be done to gain a more com-
     prehensive understanding of the full range of possible climate change
     impacts and to identify priority actions to buffer the OE from climate
     stressors and shocks.
        This book contributes to a fuller understanding in two ways:
     (i) reviewing the latest projections on changes in temperature, precipi-
     tation, and intensity/frequency of extreme events such as intense storm
     rainfall and tropical cyclones; (ii) assessing, for the first time, the incre-
     mental economic impact of tropical cyclones, compared to historical
     climate patterns, using the CGE model developed for this book.

     Latest projections. An analysis of the latest climate change scenarios
     shows that maximum daily temperatures in Mauritius are expected
     to rise significantly by mid-century—with the median changes in
     maximum daily temperatures under RCP4.5 (a high greenhouse gas
     mitigation effort scenario) and RCP8.5 (a low greenhouse gas miti-
     gation effort scenario) reaching 1.3 and 1.7 degrees C, respectively.
     Localized precipitation projections through the year 2050 are highly
     variable, ranging from a decline of more than 25 percent to an
     increase of more than 25 percent, compared to historical rainfall.
     This variability results from uncertainties in global efforts to mitigate
     carbon emissions and in climate science. This stressor may be critically
     important to Mauritius, given that more intense rainfall could greatly
     exacerbate inland flood risks.
        Moreover, a Mauritius-specific storm simulation modeling conducted
     for this book shows that climate change could also substantially increase
                                                                                   Overview     43




  Box 6. Existing Studies on Climate Change Impacts in Mauritius

  The impacts of climate change on the OE clusters have been previously studied in Mauritius and other
  similar contexts, and while several clusters are predicted to see large impacts of climate change with high
  confidence, impacts on other clusters require more research (Nurse et al. 2014).
       Fishing, seafood processing, and aquaculture are vulnerable to: (i) coral bleaching leading to reduced
  fisheries production (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014); (ii) ocean acidification affecting mollusk shell formation
  and the oyster and pearl industry (De Silva and Soto 2009); (iii) severe weather, erosion, and storm surge
  infrastructure damage (De Silva and Soto 2009); and (iv) changing species distribution induced by rising
  ocean temperatures (Nurse et al. 2014).
       Threats to seaport related activities include damage to port infrastructure, change in navigability of
  access channels, and interruptions in business activities and movements (World Bank 2016). More frequent
  extreme weather events may disrupt complex supply chains, while sediment from coastal erosion may
  increase dredging costs (UNCTAD 2008). Thus, integrated investment, planning, and operation will be
  needed for ports to adapt (Becker et al. 2013).
       The tourism sector may be impacted by water shortages exacerbated by rising temperatures and more
  variable rainfall (Mauritius 2012). Altered seasonality could impact the tourism industry via heat stress for
  tourists, increased cooling costs, changes in wildlife populations, and infectious diseases (MAIFS et al. 2012).
  And beach erosion is also a concern.
       Other sectors of the economy, while potentially vulnerable to climate change, lack the needed histor-
  ical evidence of impacts and research support. For example, while the most significant ocean warming has
  been observed at surface levels, deep ocean waters (700 to 2,000 meters) are also experiencing similar, yet
  less significant changes (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014). However, the impact of climate change on deep
  sea environments is difficult to observe because of access issues and lack of long-term data (Smith, Jr. et
  al., 2009).




the rainfall (Figure 5), wind speed, and landfall patterns associated with
tropical cyclones. As a result, we estimate that total tropical cyclone
damage (from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding) in the worst-case
climate scenario could increase by about a factor of two.
   Virtually all storms would be stronger with climate change, and
the frequency overall would also increase. An important result from
this analysis is that the once-in-100-year storm, with climate change,
could be characterized by peak wind speeds 30 km/hour higher than
the historical baseline. For reference, Cyclone Hollanda, which struck
Mauritius in 1994, was roughly a once-in-100-year storm—climate
change would make that storm much more damaging.
   As a “deep-dive” illustration of just one impact of climate change, the
economic effects of changes in cyclone strikes on Mauritius are shown
to reduce the cumulative GDP (in present value terms) by more than
10 percent by the end of a 40-year simulation period, relative to a scen-

were to occur in the next 10 years, the effect would be to cause GDP to
shrink for a time, and to reduce GDP growth rates by about 2 percent-
age points for at least the following five years. This simulation is based
on the same CGE model used in Part A of this book to assess the OE’s
potential for boosting GDP for the entire Mauritius economy (Box 7).
   The CGE simulations also show that while average annual losses to
be expected under climate change are larger than the historic baseline,
a potentially more significant change will be seen in the risk of rare
but large-scale losses. For example, under current climate conditions, a
storm or a combination of storms causing a loss of 7.5 percent of GDP
(that is, a reduction of GDP compared to what would have happened
with no cyclones) has, on average, a 10 percent probability of occur-
ring; under climate change, this probability increases to 30 percent on
average (Figure 6). This is because of the higher destructive power of
cyclones with any given return period and/or because for any given
intensity of impacts, cyclones are expected to happen more frequently.




  Box 7. How the CGE Model Simulates the Impact of Climate Change

  The CGE model incorporates storm damages as a fraction of the capital assets destroyed in a particular
  sector as a result of storm strike. Among the extreme meteorological events, tropical cyclones were singled
  out as the most likely events to be affected by climate change in a major way. In order to simulate their
  economic impact, we focused on four future scenarios:

  •	 No tropical cyclones;
  •	 Tropical cyclone frequency and severity consistent with historical patterns;
  •	 Tropical cyclones expected under a high-impact climate scenario; and
  •	 Tropical cyclones expected under a low-impact climate scenario.


      Storm damage input to the CGE is identified using two probability distributions based on a Mauritius-
  specific storm simulation (MSS) modelling conducted for this book. These distributions are: (i) a Poisson
  distribution of storm frequency as defined by the parameters projected in the MSS model; and (ii) a gamma
  function of storm damage defined by output produced and maximum wind speed.
      For each year from 2020 to 2060, the CGE model randomly selects the number of events from the Poisson
  distribution, and then assigns damages of each selected event from the gamma damage distribution. The
  damages associated with tropical cyclones under both historical and future climate conditions are identified
  in five categories of loss: residential, commercial, infrastructure, industrial, and public. Each type of loss is
  attributed to the 112 sectors by category. The model enters the “reconstruction mode” once hit with an
  extreme event, where the expected damages enter the CGE as a shock to capital in the designated sector(s).
  For a set number of years following the event or events, a defined proportion of GDP is directed to restore
  the damaged capital in a manner that maximizes a national welfare function, which weighs exponentially the
  incomes of the different households in inverse proportion to their levels. This process is repeated for the high
  impact climate scenario, the low-impact climate scenario, and the historical climate scenario.

     Note: the chart represents the relationship between the deciles of the distribution of the model simulation’s results
     (vertical axis), and, on the horizontal axis, the corresponding present value of GDP loss (expressed as percentage of
     GDP in the no-cyclone scenario) over a 40 years-time horizon. For each decile, the value of loss shown in the chart
     is an average across a distribution of intra-decile values. Further details are available in Appendix 5.




        In a comparison of direct damage with the projected climatic con-
     ditions in the South-West Indian Ocean, a 100-year storm will cause
     almost double the damage as a storm with the same return period in
     the baseline. This effect is seen across a variety of return periods, and it
     is even more pronounced in relatively frequently occurring storms, with
     5-year storm damage nearly tripling.
        To further illustrate the effects of climate change on GDP, compared
     to both a no-cyclone scenario and a scenario of cyclone occurrence but
     without the additional strength induced by climate change, the team
     assessed the situation where a once-in-100-years cyclone occurs in the
     middle of a 10-year simulation (Figure 7).
        Over the 10-year period, the net present value of the GDP loss due
     to a climate-change-amplified event is about 6.2 percent, relative to
     the no-event baseline, or 3.3 percentage points more than the histor-
     ical event scenario. As Figure 7 shows, this total loss would be equiva-
     lent to losing more than 2 percentage points on average of GDP growth
     per year in the climate change scenario (the difference between the
     green and red lines in the figure, after the event occurs in year 4 of the
     simulation).
        Already, Mauritius has taken steps to address climate change vulner-
     ability, both at the policy level (for example, the 2012 National Climate
     Change Adaptation Policy Framework) and at a more operational level

(through the 2016 guideline for coastal setback, formulated in antici-
pation of sea-level rise risks to coastal assets). Our book highlights that
more can be done to better understand and mitigate the increased
risks that climate change may pose to the entire OE and in fact to the
economy as a whole. The possibility that high-impact cyclones could
become more frequent and intense is very real. To mitigate the resulting
social and economic impacts, there is a need to consider both

•	             Structural responses – such as a review of building codes to assess
               the resilience to stronger cyclones. In the port sector, it is important
               to fully integrate climate change projections in the design of the
               breakwater project to ensure its ability to withstand the additional
               stress from waves and wind caused by climate change; and
•	             Disaster risk financing options, such as the sovereign insur-
               ance scheme developed by Africa Risk Capacity, the World Bank
               Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO) or the Green
               Climate Fund—under which Mauritius is particularly well positioned
               to prepare an application for adaptation investments as a member of
               the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) group, which represents a
               preferred class of potential Green Climate Fund grant recipients.

        Other climate change impacts that would need to be looked at more
     closely to identify adequate responses include those on fisheries and
     aquaculture and those affecting coastal erosion.


     Good Governance
     This book has found that, overall, making the OE a larger driver of
     growth is both possible (in the medium to longer term) and desirable—
     and that there is no shortage of specific project ideas to turn the OE’s
     potential into reality, certainly in the four sectors analyzed in detail and
     most likely in other sectors as well (Box 5). But achieving the objective
     will be no small feat, particularly considering the sizable volume of
     investment resources required and the fact that the OE spans across
     multiple areas of institutional responsibility.
        The question then arises: Who will actually move the overall agenda
     forward? Developing the OE entails assessing investment opportun-
     ities across sectors and using different evaluation criteria. To illustrate,
     Figure 8 summarizes the findings of the sectorial analysis, mapping the
     development scenarios identified in Part B of this book along the two
     dimensions of the benefit/cost ratio (for the economy as a whole) and
     of the ability of investments to create permanent jobs; the size of each
     bubble in the figure is proportional to the corresponding investment
     cost.
        While all scenarios are found to be worth pursuing from the econ-
     omy-wide perspective (their benefit/cost ratio exceeds 1 in all cases),
     some scenarios have higher payoffs in terms of employment genera-
     tion per unit of investment, and some have higher opportunity costs in
     terms of scarce public and private investment resources that will need
     to mobilized.
        Of course, there are a number of other evaluation criteria that can
     be considered. One example is that some investments might have posi-
     tive externalities that would add to their economic benefits—such as
     the breakwater, which will help protect the port (and, indirectly, other
     sectors, too) from the negative effects of climate variability and change.
     Another example is that marine energy may be able to deliver addi-
     tional benefits not illustrated in the diagram, such as energy security.
     Even in the case of the two criteria utilized to build the diagram (bene-
     fit/cost ratio and employment generation), the results should be con-
     sidered as purely indicative, and subject to various caveats, as further
     discussed in the full book.
        As a result, Figure 8 has no ambition to serve as a prescriptive tool for
     recommending any particular investment decision. Instead, it purports
     to underscore a key challenge that Mauritius will face as it pursues the

ambitious objective of making the OE a pillar of its future economic
development—that is, the need to orient a major program of invest-
ment (some US$580 million per year, according to this analysis) that
will, by necessity, entail choices and trade-offs across sectors and across
time. Simply summing the investment needs identified for the projects
discussed in the Deep Dive section of this book adds up to about US$3
billion, or 50 percent of the total investment required for the O2 scen-
ario; whereas currently these four sectors account for less than 30 per-
cent of the OE GDP.
   Clearly, it will not be possible to finance them all, especially given
that in some cases, different projects may compete for the same scarce
inputs, such as private capital and skilled labor. In other words, devel-
oping the OE will require not only the ability to develop good projects
in different sectors; but also the ability to evaluate them across sec-
tors, and select the best ones based on clear evaluation criteria. In addi-
tion to supporting OE development through individual sectoral invest-
ments, there is a need to address a number of key cross-sectoral aspects
(Box 8) that are essential to ensure both that the country offers an
attractive business environment for domestic and foreign investors and
that development remains inclusive and friendly to natural resources.
   This brings us to a key area, namely of the institutional model
required for addressing this challenge. The current OE governance
system is based on a ministry, recently entrusted with a special man-
date (the Ministry of Ocean Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries
and Shipping) but with limited technical capacity beyond its original
              50     The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last




Box 8. Cross-sectoral Policies to Support the OE Strategy

The OE sector cluster approach illustrated above needs to be complemented by several cross-cutting poli-
cies. These policies are necessary to ensure that the country offers an attractive business environment for
domestic and foreign investors and, at the same time, that development remains inclusive and friendly to
natural resources.
    First, complementary reforms and investments are needed to address bottlenecks and improve the
quality and capacity of infrastructure in Energy, Transport and Water and Sanitation. These policies are
important to ensure a level of basic services commensurate to Mauritius’ economic development status
and ambitions. They are also crucial to provide an adequate background of basic services to enhance the
attractiveness of the business environment and the efficiency of production from the newly formed capital.
    Second, education requires special attention, both in terms of resources and institutional enhance-
ments, to address the emerging skills gap and improve productivity and innovation capacity. These
policies should focus on strengthening primary education and improving quality and access to Technical,
Vocational, Education and Training (TVET) and Tertiary education, as well as research capacity in science
and technology.
    Third, environmental policies become ever more necessary as there are clear signs of stress both on
land and water resources. Sewage and water treatment, as a primary form of infrastructure, should be
expanded in line with the growth of population and economic activity. Forward-looking forms of land use
planning and conservation policies for natural resources and biodiversity should also be adopted.
    Fourth, boosting productivity should be a key policy objective at the core of the economic growth
and competitiveness agenda. Achieving this goal depends critically on the speed of technology adoption
and further improvements in the business environment. Two important sets of actions and policies in this
respect concern logistics and marine digitalization.
    Improving logistics may be the most effective way to increase productivity, since, as a small island highly
dependent on international trade, Mauritius’ national economy is critically affected by all forms of transport.
Better logistics requires the development of a series of smart services, such as precision delivery, manage-
ment of materials, services and information, and integrating technology and innovation capabilities. It goes
hand in hand with the development of Mauritius as an important maritime and shipping hub with dynamic
port-related industries including seafood, cruises, etc.
    Fifth, investments in big data and digital technologies also appear to be a very promising line of action
to increase total factor productivity. For the OE, Mauritius could play an important role as a big data hub for
B2B transactions including products, services and marketing and generating valuable information to know
the contribution of different companies in the relevant value added chains.




                     area of competence (fisheries); and a consultative body (the National
                     Ocean Council or NOC), established “administratively” (and thus with
                     no autonomous legal status and no political decision-making power) to
                     carry out various duties.
                        NOC’s duties include formulating a National Ocean Policy Paper,
                     including a unified regulatory framework and a National Ocean
                     Authority; promoting the development of the various OE clusters; and
                     formulating action plans in specific areas such as shipping industry, ship
                     financing, and ICT. NOC is formed by representatives of several gov-
                     ernment departments and the Joint Economic Council on behalf of the
                                                                    Overview   51


private sector. While it receives organizational and administrative sup-
port from the Ministry of Ocean Economy, it has no dedicated budget,
and thus it has no dedicated technical staff to prepare its deliberations.
   While instrumental to get the process started over the last few years,
the current model is likely to require considerable strengthening, both
in terms of technical capacity and in terms of decision making mech-
anisms. The emerging international experience (Box 9) suggests that
achieving progress on the OE agenda requires a clearly defined strategy,
stakeholder engagement, a comprehensive regulatory framework, seed
funding to leverage private resources, business intelligence, and policies
and investment for long-term environmental sustainability and climate
change resilience. Several of these ingredients are being put in place in
Mauritius.
   To accelerate progress, Mauritius could consider establishing a highly
qualified Ocean Economy Unit (OEU), staffed with full-time top pro-
fessionals in the different OE clusters, to be housed at the Ministry of
Ocean Economy (to strengthen the ministry’s capacity); or alterna-
tively, at the Prime Minister’s Office (to provide the unit with stronger
cross-sectoral clout). The OEU would be responsible for all the tech-
nical work required to rapidly move the OE agenda forward, and to
prepare and inform decisions to be made at the political level. Its dut-
ies could include these:

•	   Prepare, in consultation with NOC, a draft National Ocean Policy
     Paper, including an action plan with short and medium term
     OE-wide targets (such as contribution to GDP and employment
     generation), based on sound economic analysis and using quantitative
     tools such as those developed for this book, suitably expanded and
     regularly updated (Box 10).
•	   Prepare a draft unified regulatory framework for the OE for dis-
     cussion by NOC and adoption by the Cabinet (and submission to
     Parliament, as appropriate).
•	   Coordinate investment initiatives/projects promoted by different
     government departments to achieve OE development objectives—
     rigorously evaluating their contribution to achieving the action plan’s
     targets and making recommendations for financing to the Ministry of
     Finance.
•	   Interact with national and international private sector representatives
     to identify and promote innovative business opportunities.
•	   Prepare an annual “State of the Ocean Economy” report to document
     progress made in developing the OE, and organize a high-level event
     where the book would be presented to stakeholders, including cur-
     rent and prospective investors.

Box 9. Key Aspects of Ocean Governance: The International Experience

A review of selected country and regional experiences in Ocean governance (including the European
Union, Grenada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) points to a
number of key conditions for making progress on the Ocean agenda (see Appendix 6 for further discussion).
     Successful ocean economies have developed clearly articulated strategies and governance approaches
that assure that the relevant sectors have visibility, are fully engaged in the governance process, and have
access to support and seed funding, in particular during early development stages. Science, innovation and
conservation are critical components of these strategies.
     However, while the public sector acts as facilitator, investment decisions are ultimately taken by private
business, and funding beyond the early technology stage is provided through existing commercial and
other avenues in the normal way. Successful ocean economies tend to also have a range of other sup-
porting institutional features, including experienced bureaucracies, established public-private partnership
mechanisms, deep capital markets and longer-term planning horizons.
     Sector choices and priorities reflect broader societal choices, reflecting for instance the shift from extrac-
tion to a renewable and circular economy. Whilst coastal tourism will remain in many places a large com-
ponent of ocean sector revenues, it will critically depend both on protection of the marine biodiversity and
development of sustainable coastal infrastructure, while traditional activities such as fishing and shipping
will require help with the transition to long-term sustainability.
     Ocean energy will take time and significant investment before it becomes a larger part of the energy
mix, while ocean data and ocean biotech are still small but offer exciting growth opportunities, provided
they can be embedded into a supportive science and innovation technology policy framework.
     Successful open economies with clear regulatory structures, government strategies and support mech-
anisms for innovation are also likely to have successful marine sectors that make an important contribution
to sustaining livelihoods, diversifying economic activity, and managing environmental resources, even if the
contribution to output is small in the context of the overall economy.
     A strategic emphasis in the form of a national ocean plan (e.g., as in Ireland), supported by a dedicated
Minister for the Sea (e.g., Portugal), targeted support for and investment in marine innovation (e.g., Norway),
funding support for research and infrastructure (e.g., European Union), including at regional and local levels
(e.g., Canada), and a comprehensive analysis of the specific future challenges (e.g., New Zealand) are iden-
tified here as key components for sustainable blue growth.




                     •	   Provide specialized advisory services on the preparation and finan-
                          cing of selected strategic OE projects.
                     •	   Evaluate and assess key programs and projects at critical junctures
                          in their lifecycle, ensuring that they are worth realizing and, once
                          selected, can progress successfully to the various stages of start-up
                          and implementation.

                        At the institutional and political level, the work of the OEU would
                     be vetted and validated, depending on the case, by the National Ocean
                     Council, the Minister of Ocean Economy, or other ministries. For deci-
                     sions of particular strategic significance, the formation of an Ocean
                     Inter-Ministerial Committee could also be considered.
                                                                                  Overview     53




  Box 10. Further Use of the CGE Model Developed in This Book

  One tool that could help policy makers craft measures to invest in human and natural capital would be
  the dynamic CGE model developed for this book, which could be further refined to answer specific policy
  questions.
      From the point of view of the underlying accounting system and as a statistical tool, the model has
  already been instrumental in prompting a fruitful dialog between the World Bank team and a local team
  composed of several Mauritius statisticians and economists from the Central Statistical Office, the Ministry of
  Ocean Economy, the Ministry of Finance and the University of Mauritius. Both the input-output and the SAM
  accounts have been developed as a joint product with the local team and can be the basis for a systematic
  data collection and systematization effort in the future.
      The CGE model can also be updated and extended, as the O2 strategy and other government policies
  are deployed, with improved estimates of the model parameters. Behavioral and technical equations could
  be revised to reflect new data, including data on and costs and benefits of specific projects. The model can
  also be used for training and can contribute to empower the government’s statisticians and economists, who
  have already produced an exemplary set of methodologies, statistics, and economic accounts for the country.




Recommendations
What are the overall recommendations for Mauritius to move forward
now on enabling the OE to play a bigger role in the country’s future
development? Table 16 summarizes short-term recommendations on
governance (based on the above discussion) and other cross-cutting
issues. Table 17 summarizes selected sector-specific recommendations,
with the full list (including for the longer term) provided in the rest of
the book. In both cases, the identification of actors is purely indicative,
and subject to further discussion with the Government of Mauritius, to
better realign action areas to the comparative advantages and attribu-
tions of the different institutions.

Key Messages
•	 As Mauritius looks for ways to spur growth and move into the high-income category, it is increasingly focusing
   on its ocean economy (OE) as a new frontier for development.
•	 Currently, the OE contributes about 10 percent to GDP, although the contribution is likely to be larger when the
   full range of direct and indirect interactions with the rest of the economy is properly taken into account. Back
   in 2013, the Government of Mauritius announced the goal of doubling the OE’s share of GDP share in 12 years
   and creating 35,000 jobs in the process.
•	 The government has made considerable progress in defining a governance framework for the OE, in particu-
   lar through the establishment of a dedicated ministry and a high-level National Ocean Council. Important
   challenges still remain, however, particularly in terms of intersectorial coordination and technical capacity for
   investment planning, implementation, and monitoring
•	 This book aims to assess the overall potential of the OE to contribute to Mauritius’s development (in terms
   of economic growth and diversification, trade balance, reduction of poverty and inequality, effects on the
   government’s finances); to identify the challenges to be overcome to seize that potential; and to evaluate the
   prospects of ensuring the longer- term sustainability of the OE, in particular from the environmental point of
   view and taking into account the risks posed by climate change.
•	 The approach used combines a top-down analysis of a doubling of the OE’s GDP in 10 years with four bot-
   tom-up deep dives in specific sectors representative of both the OE’s traditional sectors (fisheries, ports) and
   its emerging ones (marine renewable energy and marine information and communications technology [ICT]).
•	 The analysis is intended to provide a big-picture strategic assessment of the OE. Specific investment opportunities
   at the individual project level are discussed in the second part of the book (the bottom-up analysis), mostly to
   exemplify opportunities and challenges and to assess the order of magnitude of investment resources required
   to promote the growth of the OE. Appraisals of the technical and financial feasibility of individual projects would
   go beyond the scope of this book and will have to be conducted as part of separate follow-on activities.

62   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last



     Introduction
     Since the launch of its first National Dialogue on the Ocean Economy
     (OE) and subsequent launch of its Roadmap in July 2013, Mauritius
     has been a fertile laboratory—a testing ground in the Indian Ocean
     articulating a vision that promotes the OE as one of the main pillars
     of a country’s economic development. Although it is a Small Island
     Developing State in terms of land mass, Mauritius stands among a hand-
     ful of countries that have exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of at least
     2 million square kilometers.
         The Government of Mauritius demonstrated greater stewardship of the
     complex OE agenda when in 2015 it dedicated a new Ministry of Ocean
     Economy, Fisheries, Marine Resources, Shipping and Outer Islands (the
     Shipping and Outer Islands mandates were moved to other ministries in
     2017). The government’s initial vision was to pool all ocean-related activ-
     ities under one roof and consolidate mandates, create deeper coordination,
     set clearer directions, and have greater ownership and accountability. In
     2015, this ministry established a National Ocean Council (NOC), which
     was expected to be the driving force for the ministry and be at the heart
     of all ocean-related projects and development (See Box 1.1). Some of
     the immediate objectives of the NOC have been to formulate a National
     Ocean Policy Paper (defining clearly the short-, medium-, and longer-term
     strategy for the new ministry) and to create a white paper for the setting
     up of a National Ocean Act and an National Ocean Authority.
         What exactly does an “ocean economy” mean? The concept involves
     taking a new perspective on sources of sustainable economic growth
     and has made a recent contribution to the debate on the desirable char-
     acteristics of global development policies. While the basic definition
     centers on identifying the set of activities whose inputs depend on the
     ocean, its interpretation by international institutions hinges on oppor-
     tunities to identify and pursue a strategy of green, inclusive growth. As
     UNCTAD (2014) puts it:

          …The concept of the oceans economy, also referred to as the
          blue economy, is one that simultaneously promotes economic
          growth, environmental sustainability, social inclusion and the
          strengthening of oceans ecosystems.

       It embraces the same desired outcomes as the Rio+20 green econ-
     omy initiative:

          [achieving] improved human well-being and social equity,
          while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological
                                                          Setting the Stage   63


      scarcities. In its simplest expression, a green economy can be
      thought of as one which is low carbon, resource efficient, and
      socially inclusive. (UNEP 2015).

   Thus, an OE, from the point of view of its definition and concerns,
appears to have a distinctive dual nature, reflecting both a new atten-
tion to the potential contribution of ocean resources to economic
growth and the perception of the ocean as an endangered ecosystem.
For example, technological advances and greater capacity and scope for
deep-water marine research have led to increased awareness of greater
opportunities for undertaking commercial extraction of deep-water liv-
ing and non-living resources. But the same advances have also shed a
new light on the fragility of deep-water systems. The very potential
for commercial use of the deep seas, in turn, has both furthered con-
cern about eco-systemic vulnerability and advanced the development of
marine research technologies.
   In its 2013 Roadmap, Mauritius spelled out how it hopes to take
advantage of the economic, social, and environmental potential of its
oceans and defined as targets doubling the OE share of GDP in 12 years
and creating 35,000 jobs in the process. The strategy involves harness-
ing the untapped value of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) by ensur-
ing sustainable and coordinated use of living and non-living resources.
Business opportunities are also expected to develop in four key clusters:

•	   marine services (marine tourism and marine pharmaceuticals);
•	   petroleum, minerals and ocean energies;
•	   fisheries and aquaculture; and
•	   seaport-related activities.

   Moreover, the plan for deep ocean water applications (DOWAs)
includes pumping cold water of about 5° C from depths of around
1,000 meters to the surface to cool buildings. This emphasis on the OE
is further enshrined in the country’s Vision 2030, launched in 2015,
which calls for fundamentally transforming the economy from an
upper-middle-income one to a high-income one.


The Ocean as a New Frontier
The economic history of Mauritius starts with a colonial legacy char-
acterized by specialization in agricultural production and the limited
processing of sugar. This single-commodity dependence accentuated
the vulnerability of a small island economy with its limited population
and land base and exposure to many sorts of outside shocks. Yet, despite
64   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


     so many unfavorable factors, Mauritius has achieved a remarkable
     economic performance since its independence in 1968, with high and
     consistent growth rates, ranging from a high in excess of 6 percent dur-
     ing boom years to lows of more than 3 percent during the latest years
     of world recession. Its performance included an almost ideal transition
     path from commodity dependence to a diversified industrial and, more
     lately, service-based economy, highly productive and fully integrated
     into the global value chain. Between 1980 and 2007, total factor pro-
     ductivity (TFP) grew by more than 1 percent a year, and in excess of
     1.3 percent a year between 1980 and 1990. This solid performance was
     due to the four main factors discussed in turn next.

     Strong Democratic Institutions
     The country enjoyed a somewhat unique and favorable institutional
     set-up, with an open and democratic political system that has thrived
     since independence along with stable and robust institutions in the
     parliamentary, executive, and judicial branches. This set-up helped
     unify civil society behind a national project that was outward oriented,
     economically ambitious, and appropriately inclusive. Successive govern-
     ments placed strong emphasis on education for all, health programs, and
     freedom of the press, religion, and expression.

     A Well-Crafted Economic Strategy
     The economic strategy centered on export-led growth supported by the
     creation of “export processing zones” (EPZs), which ensured a favorable
     fiscal and regulatory treatment of export industries and their value
     chains. The creation of EPZs was combined with targeted development
     of key industries, which helped diversify the economy out of its original
     dependence on the sugar sector. This was accomplished by first devel-
     oping the apparel industry and then several areas of the service sector,
     such as the tourism cluster and, more recently, a range of specialized
     activities that have made the island an international hub of offshore
     financial and banking services.
        Export growth and industrial policies went hand in hand with a fiscal
     policy of low taxation on capital and low or zero tariffs on intermediate
     imports, although this was combined with high import protection for
     consumption goods. Together with a friendly system of regulations for
     business (Mauritius ranks no. 1 in Africa and no. 49 overall in the World
     Bank Ease of Doing Business index) and a liberal and efficient financial
     environment, this helped create attractive conditions for foreign invest-
     ment. Moreover, throughout various economic development phases,
     important structural reforms were undertaken to engender self-sustain-
     ing growth. A major reform modernized the sugar sector by phasing
                                                            Setting the Stage   65


out part of the labor force and concentrating investment in the sugar
mills. The EPZ was another major innovation, entailing several reforms
to meet changing market conditions. It provided a package of fiscal con-
cessions and other benefits to attract industries to locate their labor-in-
tensive activities. More recently, legal and regulatory reforms have been
undertaken in education, financial reporting, corporate governance, the
insolvency regime, the tax structure, and public debt management.

Careful Macroeconomic Governance
Macroeconomic governance was based on a wise combination of mon-
etary and fiscal policies, cautiously conservative in the boom periods
and moderately expansive during recessions. This resulted in low infla-
tion rates (below 3 percent), and was supported by clever exchange rate
management with limited floating, which kept the economy competi-
tive and helped to reconcile stability and growth.

International Negotiating Ability
Mauritius’ governments proved to be both skillful and forward-looking
in negotiating mutually beneficial trade agreements with other countries,
paving the way for long-term partnerships and concrete advantages in
strategic sectors of the local economy. Successful negotiations included
preferential quotas for exporting sugar to the European Economic
Community, which not only secured a large and stable market but also
allowed Mauritius to achieve prices that were three to four times above
world prices. A similarly advantageous deal was reached for textiles in
the Multi-Fiber Agreement, resulting in a spectacular expansion of the
industry and further diversification of the economy.
   In sum, Mauritius’ success in recent decades seems to have depended
on policy foresight, social cohesion, and structural causes—notably, the
capacity to innovate, increase productivity, and respond to development
challenges by pursuing growth and equity targets within a well-func-
tioning democratic system.
   In 2018, Mauritius will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of its
independence. As a still young nation-state, it has much to celebrate. But
there are important challenges the country now faces. These stem from
structural imbalances that reflect a pattern of growth heavily reliant on
foreign capital and technology, as well as difficulties in facing the demise
of some traditional sectors (such as the sugar industry and textile manu-
facturing) and the stagnation of other sectors, like tourism. Shortages of
highly skilled labor and job mismatches are also the consequence of the
country’s ongoing structural transformation to a modern service economy
and the employment structure of the declining textile industry, which
is mostly based on low-skilled and difficult-to-retrain workers. More
66   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


     recently, following the global economic recession, which affected most of
     its export markets, Mauritius has also experienced lower growth (3 per-
     cent, down from the historical averages of 5 to 6 percent), falling rates
     of saving and investment, and pressures on government finances from a
     combination of capital import dependence and low domestic taxation.
        Against this backdrop, the government has identified the OE as a key
     development opportunity for the coming decades. While the complex-
     ities of the sector and its potential for growth are a novel venture for
     policy making, the government’s move is in line with the historical rec-
     ord of the country in pursuit of new opportunities with foresight and
     resolve. In fact, the OE appears to open the possibility of a new fron-
     tier of development that could boost the country’s comparative advan-
     tage and growth, spurred by Mauritius’ unique position as a small island
     with the widest ocean platform, a plurality of ocean-dependent activ-
     ities, and a well-established record of successful industrial policies.
     Other critical factors include the country’s natural resource base; its
     experience in key sectors such as marine tourism, ancillary services to
     sea transport, infrastructure, and cross-purpose technologies (like ICT
     and renewable energy); and its intention of becoming an international
     hub for advanced service activities, based on innovative technologies,
     smart infrastructure, ICT, logistics, and finance.


     Getting a Handle on the Ocean Economy
     The boundaries of the OE can be defined with reference to both the
     international literature (Table 1.1) and Mauritius’ own strategy docu-
     ments, such as the Office of the Prime Minister’s 2013 publication of
     The Ocean Economy: A Roadmap for Mauritius (PMO 2013). The OE
     includes a large number of promising sectors where current activities
     can expand and new activities can be created, depending on ongoing and
     future innovation in technologies and modes of production. Industrial
     organization, competition, and trade are also likely to evolve in response
     to the expansion of the ocean sectors and the innovation engendered by
     many emerging technologies and investment opportunities.
        How large is the OE in Mauritius? According to official statistics1
     updated to 2015, the OE accounts for more than 10 percent of GDP,
     with tourism and marine leisure together accounting for more than 70
     percent of that amount (Table 1.2). It is quite possible that the true
     contribution of the oceans to Mauritius’s economy is in fact larger:

based on an analysis of the country’s Social Accounting Matrix (SAM),
once the full range of indirect effects of the ocean sectors on the rest of
the economy are properly taken into account, the GDP contribution of
the OE is close to 20 percent of the total.
  Another way to capture the importance of the ocean sectors is
by looking at their linkages with the other sectors—a proxy of the
OE’s potential to mobilize the rest of the economy and, in turn, spur

                                 overall development. These characteristics can be measured by using
                                 two indexes derived from an estimate of a Social Accounting Matrix for
                                 2015 (see Chapter 2 and the Appendix for details) and a disaggregated
                                 representation of national accounts. The two indexes refer, respectively,
                                 to the backward and forward multipliers.
                                    The backward multiplier depends on the activation process caused by
                                 the spillover effects and is a function of the length and depth of the value
                                 chains activated by OE expansion. It indicates the increase in the value
                                                            Setting the Stage   69


produced by all sectors in response to a unit increase of expenditure of
the ocean industries in a specific sector of the rest of the economy.
   The forward multiplier measures the increase in the value created by
each sector, in response to a unit increase in expenditure in all sectors of
the OE. This expresses the degree of participation each sector has in the
activation process caused by OE expansion, and it depends on the inputs
that each sector contributes to the different value chains activated by OE
growth. It is thus a function of both the number of value chains activated
by this growth and the capacity of each sector to contribute to them.
   Table 1.3 presents the measures of forward and backward linkages
(or multipliers) of the total of all OE sectors with respect to other sec-
tors of the economy. A forward multiplier measures the extent to which
OE benefits from a boost in the demand of another sector, which in turn
depends on the OE linkages with sectors that buy its services, including
domestic consumers. For each sector of the economy, backward multi-
pliers, following an increase in OE demand for that particular sector,
measure the extent and the depth of the sector’s response as a component
of a supply chain. For instance, the telecommunication (TLC) sector has
an average multiplier of 0.435, suggesting that a 10 percent increase in OE
demand for TLC induces a 4.35 percent increase in the demand for inter-
mediate inputs directly and indirectly linked to the TLC supply chain.
   Because of forward linkages, in fact, OE expansion requires the
growth of each sector as a supplier of intermediate goods in propor-
tion to its forward linkage strength (the amount of its supplies and the
number of different supply chains to which it contributes). Thus, for
example, an increase of $1 billion in a single OE sector tends to activate
production in all sectors for an average of $435 million through back-
ward linkages of related value chains. On the other hand, an increase of
$1 billion in all OE sectors demands production increases of intermedi-
ate inputs for an average of about $246 million per sector.


Government’s Policies to Support the Ocean Economy
The Government of Mauritius has demonstrated continued leader-
ship and stewardship in the development of the OE and in sustainable
development generally over the last few years. From the “Maurice Ile
Durable Commission” to the National Dialogue on the OE in 2013 and its
first Roadmap, Mauritius has spearheaded efforts to make the OE a reality.
    At the international level, Mauritius has been among the strongest
stewards of the sustainable OE and has been steadfast in championing
this blue economy concept in international forums and key processes.
These have included the African Union Decade of Seas and Oceans;
Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development; the Barbados Programme

conference entitled, Towards COP22: African Ministerial Conference
on Ocean Economies and Climate Change, where a ten-point action
plan high-level “Mauritius Communique” was agreed by countries.2
This African ocean economy and climate action agenda was brought
forward to the ‘Oceans Day’ at the COP22 in Marrakesh, Morocco.
    At the domestic level, in 2015 the Government of Mauritius created
a dedicated Ministry of Ocean Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries,
Shipping and Outer Islands (hereafter referred to simply as the Ministry
of Ocean Economy), and it later appointed a Senior CEO as the apex
official of the ministry. In 2017, the portfolio of Outer Islands was moved
to another ministry. A consultative body (the NOC) was also established,
“administratively” (and thus with no autonomous legal status, and no pol-
itical decision-making power) to carry out various duties (Box 1.1).

                    Budget (Box 1.2).
                       The emerging international experience (Box 1.3 and Appendix 6)
                    suggests that achieving progress on the OE agenda requires a clearly
                    defined strategy, stakeholder engagement, a comprehensive regula-
                    tory framework, seed funding to leverage private resources, business

  Box 1.3.  Key Aspects of Ocean Governance: The International Experience

  A review of selected country and regional experiences in ocean governance (including European Union,
  Grenada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) points to a number
  of key conditions for making progress on the ocean agenda (see Appendix 6 for further discussion).
       Successful ocean economies have developed clearly articulated strategies and governance approaches
  that ensure that the relevant sectors have visibility, are fully engaged in the governance process, and have
  access to support and seed funding, in particular during early development stages. Science, innovation, and
  conservation are critical components of these strategies.
       However, while the public sector acts as facilitator, investment decisions are ultimately taken by private
  business, and funding beyond the early technology stage is provided through existing commercial and
  other avenues in the normal way. Successful ocean economies also tend to have a range of other sup-
  porting institutional features, including experienced bureaucracies, established public-private partnership
  mechanisms, deep capital markets, and longer-term planning horizons.
       Sector choices and priorities reflect broader societal choices, reflecting for instance the shift from
  extraction to a renewable and circular economy. While coastal tourism will remain in many places a large
  component of ocean sector revenues, it will critically depend both on protection of marine biodiversity and
  the development of sustainable coastal infrastructure; traditional activities such as fishing and shipping will
  require help with the transition to long-term sustainability.
       Ocean energy will take time and significant investment before it becomes a larger part of the energy
  mix, while ocean data and ocean biotech are still small but offer exciting growth opportunities provided
  they can be embedded into a supportive science and innovation technology policy. Government and the
  public sector will need to continue to offer a supportive infrastructure, while it will in the end depend on
  the private sector to build a resilient economy.
       Successful open economies with clear regulatory structures, government strategies, and support mech-
  anisms for innovation are also likely to have successful marine sectors, but these may be small in the context
  of the overall economy.
       A strategic emphasis in the form of a national ocean plan (e.g., Ireland), supported by a dedicated
  Minister for the Sea (e.g., Portugal), targeted support and investment in marine innovation (e.g., Norway),
  funding support for research and infrastructure (e.g., European Union), including at regional and local levels
  (e.g., Canada), and a comprehensive analysis of the specific future challenges (e.g., New Zealand) are iden-
  tified here as key components for sustainable blue growth.




intelligence, and policies and investment for long-term environmental
sustainability and climate change resilience. Several of these ingredients
are in place in Mauritius; but there are important areas where further
progress is needed.
   In particular, the Ministry of Ocean Economy has in-house exper-
tise on fisheries, but more limited capacity in areas such as aquacul-
ture, shipping, marine resources, and outer islands. In addition, other
key OE areas, such as energy, tourism, environment, disaster risk reduc-
tion, beach erosion, sustainable development at large, education, and
ports, are outside the mandate and jurisdiction of the Ministry of Ocean
Economy. There is no clear mechanism for interministerial coordination
76   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


     at the day-to-day administrative level, beyond what a consultative body
     like the NOC could facilitate.
        The NOC faces significant challenges, too. The council can boast
     high-level expertise across the full spectrum of the OE areas; its mem-
     bers often play key roles in national debates on policy priorities and eco-
     nomic opportunities. However, while the NOC receives organizational
     and administrative support from the Ministry of Ocean Economy, it has
     no dedicated budget and thus no dedicated technical staff to prepare its
     deliberations. Perhaps more importantly, it does not have a mandate for
     making policy decisions or recommending them formally to Cabinet.
        Finally, there are other key pillars of ocean governance that have been
     envisaged in different occasions by the NOC and the government but
     are not yet in place. These include:

     •	   Developing a unified regulatory framework for the OE
     •	   Preparing a National Ocean Policy Paper
     •	   Preparing a National Oceans Bill/Act, and
     •	   Establishing a National Ocean Authority.


     Objectives, Structure, and Limitations of this Book
     This book aims at assessing the overall potential of the OE to contribute
     to Mauritius’s development (in terms of economic growth and diversifi-
     cation, trade balance, reduction of poverty and inequality, effects on the
     government’s finances); at identifying the challenges to be overcome to
     seize that potential; and at evaluating the prospects to ensure the longer
     term sustainability of the OE, in particular from the environmental
     point of view and taking into account the risks posed by climate change.
        The approach used here combines a top-down analysis of a doub-
     ling of the OE’s GDP in 10 years with four bottom-up deep dives in
     specific sectors representative of both the OE’s traditional sectors (fish-
     eries, ports) and its emerging ones (marine energy and marine ICT). The
     book is organized in three parts, as visualized in Figure 1.1.
        The first part of the book, “Promoting the Ocean Economy: The Big
     Picture,” offers a top-down analysis of a doubling of the OE’s GDP in 10
     years (the O2 scenario) by using a dynamic computable general equi-
     librium (CGE) model based on a highly disaggregated social account-
     ing matrix (SAM) for 2015, which was developed by the task team
     in collaboration with Statistics Mauritius and the Ministry for Ocean
     Economy.
        This part of the book evaluates the ability of the OE, taken in its
     entirety, to contribute to the growth of the rest of the national economy.
     It first identifies the amount of investment required to double the size
                                                                               Setting the Stage   77

of the OE over ten years (a reasonable proxy of the overall goal of the
2013 roadmap), and then it assess the merits of investing those resour-
ces into the OE, as opposed to investing them in a plausible alternative
scenario. While this part of the analysis does not evaluate investment
priorities across OE components, it does assess the ability of the OE to
serve as an overall engine of growth; and it identifies cross-cutting con-
straints to be addressed in the process. These include in particular the
need to build adequate human capital, to ensure the conservation of
the natural capital on which the OE depends; and to create favorable
conditions to attract the resource flows required to finance the expan-
sion of the OE.
   Part B of the book, “Making It Happen: Deep Dives into Selected
Sectors,” consists of a bottom-up analysis of four sectors (fisheries, ports,
marine energy, and marine ICT) to assess their financing needs (from
public and private sources), revenue generating potential, and institu-
tional or capacity bottlenecks to be overcome to fulfill the promises
of the OE. This part of the book includes estimates of the merits of
investing in the selected sectors, both from the project-level perspec-
tive and from the point of view of the economy as a whole. Given the
78   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


     study’s time and budget constraints, the analysis does not intend to be
     comprehensive, but rather illustrative of the opportunities and challen-
     ges of expanding traditional OE sectors (e.g., fisheries, ports), as well as
     emerging ones (marine energy, marine ICT).
        Part C of the book, “Making It Last,” asks what needs to happen to
     ensure the longer-term sustainability of the OE. Any OE expansion
     would also entail the need to cope with environmental threats com-
     ing from a combination of anthropogenic influences and the effects of
     climate change. Damage to the local biotopes and biodiversity from
     climate change is already significant, as is damage to coral reefs and
     lagoon habitats from water pollution. Coastal erosion and vulnerabil-
     ity to weather extreme events are both increasing. A more active use
     of the OE requires technical and institutional mechanisms to recon-
     cile, across sectors and time, competing claims over ocean and coastal
     resources. This is the reason why at the end of 2016 Mauritius has
     embarked on the process of developing a Marine Spatial Plan (MSP).
     The book outlines options that could be considered in the next stages of
     the MSP preparation. The analysis is based on a review of international
     MSP experiences and takes into account Mauritius-specific issues and
     challenges, in terms of both the current legislative framework and the
     sources of environmental pressure to be mitigated.
        Another key aspect of longer-term sustainability of the OE is climate
     change. The final chapter of the book reviews climate risks, both those
     that are well known and those that are less well known; and illustrates
     how the CGE model developed by the study team for Mauritius could
     be used to quantify the socioeconomic risks (notably, in terms of growth
     and jobs) of climate change, focusing on a particular class of climate
     shocks, namely tropical cyclones. This can help in assessing the merits
     of investing in preventive adaptation measures.
        One important caveat is that the analysis is intended to provide a
     big-picture, strategic assessment of the OE. Specific investment oppor-
     tunities at the individual project level are discussed in Part B of the book
     (in the bottom-up analysis), mostly to exemplify opportunities and
     challenges and to assess the order of magnitude of investment resour-
     ces required to promote OE growth. However, an appraisal of the tech-
     nical and financial feasibility of individual projects would go beyond the
     scope of this book and will have be conducted as part of separate fol-
     low-on activities.
        While the top-down analysis in part A covers the OE as a whole,
     the book does not analyze the development prospects of all OE sec-
     tors. Notably, tourism is not included, since it is a mature and relatively
     large sector and thus likely to run into diminishing returns as it expands,
     as confirmed by the economywide analysis. As a result, an important
                                                            Setting the Stage   79


part of the impulse for the longer-term growth of the OE can arguably
be expected to come from emerging OE sectors or from smaller trad-
itional ones, which are less likely to be affected by diseconomies of scale.
Seabed mining of minerals and hydrocarbons is not analyzed either; in
this case, the reason for the omission is that there are currently few hard
facts on the sector’s potential.
   Most of the chapters contain specific recommendations for seiz-
ing the opportunities afforded by the OE and for ensuring that these
opportunities last over time. A summary of the top recommenda-
tions, focused on the shorter term (6–18 months), is included in the
Overview to this book.

Key Messages
•	 Based on a model of Mauritius’ economy developed in partnership with Statistics Mauritius and the Ministry of
   Ocean Economy, Fisheries, Marine Resources, Shipping and Outer Islands (referred to hereafter as the Ministry of
   Ocean Economy), this book finds that it is a smart decision for Mauritius to invest in doubling the gross domestic
   product (GDP) share of its OE as a way of moving up the economic development ladder, and in an inclusive,
   sustainable manner. We call this the O2 strategy.
•	 While it is unlikely that the doubling target can be achieved in less than 18 years, already within 10 years the O2
   strategy can yield considerable growth results, including a 62 percent increase of the OE GDP in absolute terms,
   and an increase of 38 percent in its share of the national total (from 12.6 percent to 17.5 percent).
•	 The analysis also shows that, compared to a plausible counterfactual, such a strategy will boost returns on
   investment (a 20 percent gain), diversify the OE so it no longer relies on tourism alone (a 20 percent increase
   in diversification), create more jobs (36 percent more in O2 than in the counterfactual), improve the trade
   balance, reduce poverty and inequality, and strengthen the government’s finances (2 percent reduction in
   debt/GDP ratio).
•	 However, this investment will need to be complemented by a joint public-private sector effort to boost labor
   productivity, ensure adequate inflow of financing, and invest in training and education.
•	 Also vital will be additional investment (an extra 19 percent compared to the counterfactual) to conserve and
   improve the natural resources of the ocean and coastal areas, given that additional pressure is expected to be
   placed on these resources as the O2 strategy is implemented if it is to be sustained over time.

82   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last



     Introduction
     So far, this book has introduced the concept of an ocean economy
     (OE) and discussed why Mauritius is increasingly interested in it as a
     new frontier for development. While there is no shortage of examples
     of investment opportunities related to the ocean that have generated
     economic benefits in other countries and appear promising in Mauritius
     too, until now there has been no systematic assessment of the ocean’s
     ability to become a fundamental driver of the country’s economy for
     the foreseeable future.
        This chapter illustrates how economic modeling techniques can be
     used to fill that knowledge gap. It takes a big picture perspective, focus-
     ing on the government’s goal to make the OE a driving force of the
     economy as a whole. Here, the key questions are: Is the doubling of the
     OE in as little as 10 years achievable? Is it desirable? What does it take
     to make it happen? These questions are then asked in subsequent chap-
     ters from the individual perspectives of four critical sectors of the OE:
     fisheries and aquaculture, ICT, energy, and ports.
        Our basic approach to assess the overall prospects of the OE is as
     follows:

     •	   Define a scenario where the size of the OE (in GDP terms) doubles
          over the next decade—the O2 scenario—by quantifying the invest-
          ment that would needed to be channeled to key sectors that depend
          (directly or indirectly) on ocean resources;
     •	   Evaluate an alternative scenario where the same investment
          resources required in the O2 scenario are not concentrated on the
          OE but are instead distributed across sectors according to the same
          pattern observed in recent years. This alternative scenario uses a
          counterfactual to assess the relative merits of investing in the OE;
          and, finally,
     •	   Compare O2 and the counterfactual to assess the merits of the
          former, in terms of outcomes such as growth, return on invest-
          ment, income distribution, job creation, balance of trade, and fiscal
          balance.

        The results of the analyses show that investing in doubling the size of
     the Mauritian OE could be a powerful way to transform the economic
     fundamentals of the country and could do so in an inclusive, sustain-
     able manner. But this will only occur if Mauritius also adopts comple-
     mentary policies to boost labor productivity, consolidate government
     finances, further enhance the investment climate, invest in training and
     education, and restore and conserve the ocean’s natural resources. What

this means in more specific terms is examined in detail in the four sec-
tor-level “deep dive” chapters that follow.

A Guide to the Economywide Approach
The approach adopted to study Mauritius’ OE relies on two main
analytical tools: a social accounting matrix (SAM) and a computable
general equilibrium model (CGE). Both were developed in full part-
nership with Mauritius government institutions (in particular, Statistics
Mauritius and the Ministry of the Ocean Economy). These tools are
a way of linking Mauritius’ national accounts to investment scenarios
and policy changes in order to estimate their impacts on growth, jobs,
incomes, exports, and other key economic and social indicators that
help inform decisions. More specifically:

•	   The CGE is one of the most rigorous, cutting-edge quantitative
     methods to evaluate the impact of economic and policy shocks—
     especially policy reforms—on the economy as a whole. It can be cali-
     brated using a SAM, which is a consistent and complete data system
     that captures interdependencies that exists within a socioeconomic
     system; and
•	   The SAM includes transaction estimates across all sets of economic
     agents, which are grouped into producing sectors (activities), prod-
     ucts and services, factors of production (such as labor by skill, capital
     of various forms, and natural resources), and institutions (govern-
     ment, households, and firms).

   Both the SAM and the CGE are economic tools that are useful for
systematizing and interpreting aggregate and sector statistics from a var-
iety of sources in the framework of national accounts and for simulat-
ing the impact of alternative strategies of growth on the economy for a
given year and over time (see Box 2.1). The dynamic CGE model aims
to capture some of the relevant features of the Mauritius economy today
and their potential evolution over time. As Figure 2.1 shows, our CGE
model of Mauritius does a good job of tracking the past performance
of the economy in terms of aggregate economic values such as GDP
growth, value added, and household consumption. (However, as a simu-
lation tool, there are important limits to what it can do, which should be
carefully taken into account in the interpretation of the results).
   Using the approach described above, the analysis carried out for
this book has identified a plausible scenario—the O2 scenario—of
a government-led doubling of the OE’s share of GDP, based on a
highly disaggregated model of Mauritius’ economy. This model for
the first time quantifies the investment resources required to achieve

Box 2.1.  SAM and CGE Models for Mauritius

According to the United Nations, the OE is an economy that simultaneously promotes economic growth,
environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and the strengthening of oceans ecosystems (UNCTAD
2014). The social accounting matrix (SAM) built for Mauritius aims to represent a coherent, integrated, and
structured framework that accounts for the economic potential of marine natural resources (such as ship
routes and energy sources from the oceans). It distinguishes between ocean-based and non-ocean-based
activities, as well as blue (marine ecosystems) and green (terrestrial ecosystems) natural resources. The
critical ocean-based activities are sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, renewable marine energy, marine
bio-prospecting, maritime transport and infrastructure, and marine and coastal tourism. Water treatment
and decontamination activities are also considered, while the coastal activities represent a critical interface
between the blue and green economies.
    The SAM is a system of national/regional/sub-regional accounts represented in a matrix format (Stone
and Brown 1962; Stone 1981). It includes the inter-industry linkages through transactions typically found
in the input-output accounts and the transactions and transfers of income between different types of
economic agents (such as households, government, firms, and external institutional sectors). A typical com-
putable general equilibrium (CGE) model is calibrated using a SAM. For Mauritius, the SAM estimated for
2015 was used to calibrate the CGE model so that the CGE solution reproduces the 2015 data as a baseline
reference.
    The CGE model is a dynamic recursive one. Dynamic models trace each variable through time, often at
annual intervals (unlike static models, which look at the reactions of the economy at only one point in time).
Dynamic recursive models are those that can be solved sequentially (one period at a time). They assume
that behavior depends only on current and past states of the economy. CGE models always contain more
variables than equations, so some variables must be set outside the model (known as exogenous), a pro-
cess known as closure. These models also typically assume that the outside framework of the model (for
example, global growth, climate changes, and other major events) are exogenous. For our purposes, we
have used a closure rule based on the hypothesis that the official exchange rate is fixed and that investment
financing in excess of domestic savings can be secured by foreign capital inflow.
    CGE models are useful as simulation tools to explore the implications of alternative economic policies
and other exogenous events on an integrated economic system, taking into account the market structure
and the income formation mechanisms. They have important limitations, however, since they are based on
the assumption that markets are capable with maintaining or restore equilibrium between demand and
supply and that they can do that efficiently and without transactions costs.




                    that target and explicitly accounts for the macroeconomic and struc-
                    tural constraints to growing the OE sectors. The analysis identifies a
                    reasonable trajectory of growth of the OE that leads to the achieve-
                    ment of the O2 target over the longer term (15–18 years). It also sug-
                    gests that attempts to pursue the O2 target over a shorter period are
                    likely to result in undesirable economic outcomes, such as disecon-
                    omies of scale, price increases, excessive use of natural resources, and
                    fiscal imbalances.
                       To provide insights into the features and merits of the O2 scenario
                    over a time horizon of greater relevance for policy making purposes,
                    the rest of this chapter focuses on a shorter snapshot (10 years) of the

path leading to the doubling of the OE. Even over such a time horizon,
which falls short of the time needed to meet the doubling target, the
importance of the OE nevertheless grows considerably, due to both the
increase in overall OE output (+88 percent) and the increase in output
of nonconventional OE sectors (+131 percent). It is also important to
note that the measurement of the OE growth is sensitive to the share
of certain sectors attributed to the ocean. For example, a broader def-
inition of ocean-related ICT, energy, and water treatment sectors would
lead along the growth path identified by the model to an even faster
doubling of the OE share (that is, over a 10-year period).

How greater OE investment would affect the Mauritian economy.
To shed light on how greater OE investment would affect the whole
economy, we first asked what would happen if the government took
steps to double the size of the OE over a suitable period. This objective
could conceivably be achieved with different trajectories, ranging from
a “big bang” attempt concentrated in a small number of years to more
gradual investment paths distributed over a longer period. A first round
of simulations showed that “big bang” solutions, where investment was
concentrated over a small number of years, tended to be nonsustain-
able because of their macroeconomic imbalance and to be ultimately
ineffective because of diseconomies of scale. We thus ran the model
under alternative, gradual paths of resource and finance deployments,
using as criterion of choice the maximization of the present value of
cumulative consumption by households over the simulation period,

Note: The additional investment is calculated as the minimum autonomous (that is, government-planned) investment dedicated to the sectors
of the OE economy over the 10-year period that would result, over a longer time horizon (15–18 years), in a doubling of the OE’s GDP share. The
O2 strategy is the one leading to a longer-term doubling of the OE. The counterfactual scenario is one in which the same investment resources
required under O2 (about $5.8 billion) are allocated to sectors in the same proportions observed in the recent past. NPV = net present value.

                                The results (summarized in Table 2.1) indicate that with a cumu-
                             lative investment of $5.8 billion over 10 years, the OE share of GDP
                             increases by almost 40 percent (rising from 12.6 percent to 17.5 per-
                             cent total GDP), and by over 60 percent in absolute value. The invest-

                             US$25 million, or 2.37 percent of total investment, to US$2.5 billion,
                             or about 39 percent of the total in the 10th year of the simulation. The

20 percent, because of the expansion of the rest of the economy, which
proceeds at an average rate of about 3.2 percent. The impact on GDP
growth of the simulated investment is high and increasing over time,
with very little inflation. Foreign exchange (Table 2.1) and government
balances (Table 2.2) also appear to be positively affected, and although
these effects are not large, they are significant and steady.
   The O2 scenario can be compared (Table 2.1) with a counterfactual2
that assumes a continuation of the historical pattern of investment in
Mauritius. In the counterfactual scenario, the same amount of investment
resources required to double the OE are mobilized, but they are distrib-
uted across sectors in the same proportions observed in recent years.
   The O2 scenario appears to outperform the counterfactual over all
the macro indicators considered, with differences tending to increase
over time. The average contribution to growth of the O2 scenario is sig-
nificantly higher (3.17 percent) than the counterfactual scenario (2.93
percent), and the cumulative return, as measured by the ratio of the
present value of additional GDP and investment, is more than twice
as large under the O2 scenario (49 percent) as it is under the counter-
factual (23 percent). In other words, there is a 20 percent gain from



2 The results of the counterfactual “business as usual” scenario are not based
on an optimization, but are simply taken to represent the likely results of
the possible and maximum crowding-out of resources that could follow the
implementation of the O2 strategy. The amount of such crowding out, in turn,
is assumed to be given by the most likely allocation of the same resources and
along the same trajectory, according to the pattern of distribution across sec-
tors realized historically. The counterfactual scenario represents the most likely
trajectory of resource commitment under an alternative and completely decen-
tralized equilibrium, without rational expectations on the part of the planner.

     higher for O2 than for the counterfactual (Table 2.4). Because of its
     reliance on ocean resources, even though its pressure on the small land
     area of Mauritius is low, the O2 strategy is likely to result in sizable
     environmental costs.
        These costs are not easy to measure, but the model is able to gener-
     ate estimates that can be considered as reasonable proxies. In particu-
     lar, the model estimates the contribution to value added (and value
     added increases) of different factors of production (such as unskilled
     and skilled labor and capital). It also estimates the share of value added
     that is not attributable to the conventional factor of production, and the
     way in which this residual portion of value added can be attributed to
     different forms of natural capital, in particular blue water, green water,
     wetlands, and oceans.
        It is reasonable to argue that as the contribution of natural capital to
     value added increases, so will the need to allocate resources to conserv-
     ative and/or defensive expenditures to prevent the degradation of nat-
     ural capital and the decrease in its ability to contribute to value added
     creation. The model results indicate that toward the end of the simula-
     tion period, the contribution of natural capital to value added is 20 per-
     cent higher in the O2 scenario compared to the counterfactual. While
     this result cannot directly be used to quantify the amount of investment
     required to conserve environmental quality, it points clearly to the fact

Notes: The statistical definition of the OE used in this table differs from the official definition, because it includes an estimate of marine ICT (mainly
the economic value of the traffic generated by the submarine cable) and part of the sewage and water treatment sector. As a consequence, the
weight of the tourism sector is lower than in the official figures. The index of diversification is given by one minus the Gini coefficient.




that investment is likely to be higher in the O2 than in the counterfac-
tual scenario, other things being equal.
   At the subsectoral level, the results point to the less than propor-
tional expansion of some of the traditional sectors (like coastal hotels
and restaurants) and the more than proportional growth of both some
of the traditional activities (like fisheries, sea food processing, and the
services allied to marine transport) and relatively new activities, such as
ICT and ocean energy (Table 2.6).
   This result depends on several factors. First, tourism is a relatively
mature sector, with recently declining demand and relative low rates
of return for incremental capital. Second, because of the already large
proportion of the OE economy that it accounts for, tourism is affected
by diseconomies of scale to a larger extent than other sectors that start
from a smaller sector base. Third, tourism is still characterized by a
value chain largely relying on imported intermediates, especially for the
key sectors. Fourth, although tourism is a labor-intensive sector with a
high capacity for job creation, it is also plagued by seasonality and low
productivity of labor and capital. Thus, investment in tourism should
aim more at improving the quality and the performance of the sec-
tor than at increasing its size. Overall, the O2 strategy results in a more
92   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


     diversified OE, with an increase of some 13 percent of the selected
     index of diversification (one minus the Gini coefficient).

     Conditions for Success
     The dynamic simulation results suggest that the O2 strategy may be
     beneficial to economic growth on several fronts, including diversifi-
     cation, productivity increases, job creation, and income distribution.
     These effects also persist if comparison is made with an equivalent
     counterfactual scenario reflecting historical growth. However, doubling
     OE may create several tensions on three main fronts: foreign exchange
     provision, labor skill availability, and natural resource deterioration. This
     section aims to assess the conditions that could interfere with seizing
     the full potential of the O2 strategy and, in some cases, make O2 less
     desirable than the counterfactual scenario.

     Foreign exchange provision. Foreign exchange has generally been avail-
     able for Mauritius at good conditions to fill the gap caused by a declining
     saving rate (which fell from 25 to 15 percent of GDP between 2000 and
     2013) and a stable investment rate (at 25 percent of GDP). Deteriorating
     external conditions and a widening foreign exchange account could make
     it more costly to obtain foreign capital to finance growth. The simulation
     is based on the hypothesis that foreign capital may become less readily
     available (see the technical appendix for details). Yet it still indicates that
     the O2 strategy would be able to increase the OE share of total produc-
     tion to almost twice its initial level and would yield better results than
     the counterfactual scenario (Table 2.7). In absolute terms, however, the
     O2 results would be considerably lower than the main scenario explored
     before, with an average contribution to growth of only 1.83 percentage
     points and a cumulative rate of return of only 32 percent.

     Labor skill availability. The OE2 strategy—especially in the new sectors
     of ICT, energy, and port and allied transportation services—requires

Note: This scenario assumes elasticities of only about 10 percent for the supply of medium- and high-skilled labor
(secondary education and above). This means that an increase in wages of 10 percent is met with only 1 percent
increase in labor supply.




an ample supply of skilled and semiskilled labor (Table 2.5). At the
moment, there is already evidence of imported labor at both the lower
and higher ends of the skill distribution, and there is evidence of signifi-
cant skill mismatch because of the low skill and difficult-to-train labor
liberated by the contraction of the textile industry. So what would hap-
pen with a significant skills mismatch, that is, when the supply of labor
would not be responsive to increased demand and wages due to the lack
of availability of skilled human capital? As Table 2.8 shows, the effect
of what amounts to a constraint on labor supply would be to curtail
the potential contribution to growth of the O2 strategy by more than
half, bringing it from 3.17 (Table 2.4) to 1.77, for a mere 10 percent
cumulative return on investment over the 10-year period considered.
Compared to the growth scenario without a labor constraint (Table
2.8), this would amount to a loss of almost US$2 billion, which suggests
that investment in education would indeed be not only profitable but
also necessary.

Natural resource deterioration. High-quality natural resources are a
major ingredient for the expansion of the OE. Indeed, increases in
the natural resource investment requirement (proxied by their non-
remunerated contribution to value added) are significant in absolute
terms, at more than US$21 million in the 10th year of the simulation,
and some 20 percent larger in the O2 than in the counterfactual scen-
ario. These amounts are likely to reflect loss of efficiency to the extent
that resource costs are not internalized by the economic agents who
exploit them, which in turn would result in underinvestment in nat-
ural capital. Resource uses unmatched by adequate maintenance and
renewal activities are likely to cause resource deterioration—in the form

                               Deterioration in the environmental quality of the marine ecosystem,
                            resulting from insufficient public and private investment in conserving
                            natural resources (in particular ocean, blue water, green water, and wet-
                            lands), is captured in the model by a lower elasticity of supply; that is,
                            less natural capital is mobilized for any given increase in its marginal
                            return. If the elasticity were to become very small (about 1 percent of
                            the baseline value), resource use could be expanded only by deplet-
                            ing the resources available, effectively leading to a gradual demise of
                            the OE. In this case, the model simulation shows that the OE’s overall
                            contribution to growth would fall to 2.75 percent (compared to 3.17
                            percent in the base case of the O2 scenario) and cumulative returns to
                            investment to 26 percent. Because “blue” natural resource use is more
                            intensive in O2 and is a condition necessary for its success, the afore-
                            mentioned model simulation is also the only case where the counter-
                            factual appears to outperform the O2 scenario, although only in terms
                            of average contribution to growth.
                               The bottom line is that a movement away from the base case of O2
                            expansion to less favorable conditions shows no clear tendency for O2
                            to become less attractive than the counterfactual, except for natural
                            resources (Table 2.10).

                            Benefits of Taking a Big-Picture View
                            As Mauritius looks into ways to foster a new phase of inclusive growth,
                            the idea of centering its investment strategy on the OE appears to be
                            a good one for several reasons. To begin with, many small island econ-
                            omies depend on the ocean and the related system of inland waters
                            as key natural resources for crucial sectors (such as the tourism value
                            chain, fisheries, and numerous marine transportation and related servi-
                            ces). In addition, there is the sheer size of Mauritius’ seabed platform

and its potential for catalyzing development and technological progress
in the areas of ICT, renewable energy, fisheries, marine biotechnology
and many accessory activities based on ocean resources. Further, many
of these subsectors appear to offer a way to combine productivity and
employment growth, with positive effects on inclusiveness, poverty
reduction, and income distribution.
   For that reason, this book developed the dynamic CGE model dis-
cussed in this chapter, to test what would happen if Mauritius under-
took a near doubling of the OE over a 10-year time horizon (the O2
strategy). The above findings are the result of comparing this set of
CGE simulations with a counterfactual strategy based on the same
amount of government-led investment allocated across sectors accord-
ing to historical investment shares.
   By most accounts, the O2 strategy appears to perform better than the
counterfactual. In particular, the simulations suggest that, given a fixed
amount of investment over 10 years, the O2 strategy, compared to the
counterfactual, has the potential to (i) deliver a higher return on invest-
ment (and in the process diversify the OE away from tourism); (ii) gen-
erate more jobs; (iii) improve the net trade balance; (iv) reduce poverty;
(v) improve income distribution; and (vi) improve the fiscal balance.
   However, the simulations also suggest a number of caveats to these
promising conclusions, underscoring the need for complementary
policy measures to ensure better results—a task that could be informed
by a deeper analysis of the programs needed for human and natural cap-
ital development (Box 2.2) and institutional reform.

Boost productivity. The average rate of growth achieved with the O2
strategy, at about 3.2 percent even under the best external conditions
and no crowding-out of alternative investments, would fall short of real-
izing the 5 percent target rate of sustained growth that Mauritius can
aspire to achieve on the basis of its past success and reasonable ambi-

        Box 2.2. Next Steps for Mauritius’ Dynamic CGE Model

        The dynamic CGE model can help policy makers craft measures to invest in human
        and natural capital, and it can be tuned to answer specific policy questions as
        required by Mauritius. In fact, it already has been instrumental in prompting a
        constructive dialog between the World Bank team, Mauritian experts, and statisti-
        cians and economists from the Central Statistical Office, the Ministry of the Ocean
        Economy, the university, and business leaders. Both the input-output and the SAM
        accounts have been developed as a joint product with the local team, and they
        have formed a solid basis for future systematic data collection and analysis.
            Mauritius could update and extend the CGE model to evaluate different scen-
        arios as the OE strategy and other government policies are deployed. Mauritius’
        understanding of the relationships between key parameters—for example, invest-
        ment and income distribution—could be improved upon by collecting new data
        to better analyze the costs and benefits of specific projects. The model can also be
        used for training to further empower the government’s statisticians and economists,
        who have already produced an exemplary set of methodologies, national statistics,
        and economic accounts.




     tions for the future. Thus, once again, the country will need to signifi-
     cantly increase its average rate of total factor productivity growth—this
     time, by about 1.8 percent under the O2 strategy, which is a relatively
     large amount, even though less than the 2.7 percent under the counter-
     factual strategy.
        Total factor productivity increases are largely exogenous in the
     model, since they depend on several factors that go beyond the scope
     of general equilibrium simulations. These factors include successful
     adoption of technological innovation, research and development, and
     adequate investment in human capital that depend on external condi-
     tions, such as technological progress and increases in knowledge.

     Strengthen the fiscal picture. The simulations show that the O2 trajec-
     tory would rely heavily on foreign capital, given the country’s low-tax
     internal environment and a relatively low and falling domestic saving
     rate. The worry is that less favorable financial conditions—that is, higher
     interest rates—would turn this financial picture into a vulnerability.
     Thus, some fiscal consolidation, with somewhat higher saving rates,
     lower government expenditure, and higher reliance on private domestic
     investment, appears to be necessary to secure a firmer base for growth.

     Invest in education and training. While O2 promises a high degree
     of job creation, its reliance on new and technologically more sophis-
     ticated sectors also threatens to worsen the skills mismatch that already
                                     Prospects for Doubling the Ocean Economy   97


plagues the economy. At present, for example, the country is suffering
from the problem of industrial conversion, with a surplus of low-level
labor coming from the shrinking textile industry and a lack of skilled
labor in the more highly technological sectors. Thus, there is an urgent
need for investments in training and education and other policies that
encourage the accumulation in human capital if Mauritius is to increase
labor productivity and avoid having employment opportunities turn
into bottlenecks. The public sector should lead the way by focusing on
improving the school system and reforming vocational education. But
the private sector can help by facilitating retraining and special skill
transfers through privately financed programs.

Conserve and improve natural resources. Even though the O2 strategy
lessens some of the pressure on land-based activities that rely on natural
resources, the simulations show that its end use of ocean and internal
waters turns out to be much more intensive than the counterfactual.
Moreover, much of the country’s natural resources are now being
exploited at no charge, maintenance and renewal activities are low,
and pollution and other forms of degradation appear to be a concern.
Thus, investments in ocean environmental goods are essential. This
means replacing the current model of rent exploitation with significant
investment in the conservation and improvement of natural resources.
Possible solutions include marine spatial planning and lagoon rehabili-
tation, improved sanitation and water treatment, and a scaling-up of
appropriate environmental regulations.

       Making It Happen: Deep Dives
               into Selected Sectors

This part of the book consists of a bottom-up analysis of four sectors
(fisheries, ports, marine energy, and marine ICT) to assess the financing
needs (from public and private sources), revenue generating potential,
and institutional or capacity bottlenecks to be overcome to fulfill the
promises of the ocean economy (OE). These chapters include estimates
of the merits of investing in the selected sectors, both from the pro-
ject-level perspective and from the point of view of the economy as a
whole. Given the study’s time and budget constraints, the analysis does
not intend to be comprehensive, but rather illustrative of the opportun-
ities and challenges of expanding traditional OE sectors (e.g., fisheries,
ports), as well as emerging ones (marine energy, marine ICT).
   The projects examined are those currently under discussion in
Mauritius, which in many cases are still far from offering the infor-
mation necessary to establish their feasibility. Thus, their evaluation is
based on very preliminary hypotheses as to their market reach, time
profiles, and foreseeable benefits and costs. In an attempt to combine
project level and economywide evaluation, and to generate estimates of
investment worth consistent across sectors, the projects selected have
been analyzed according to a three step procedure.
   In the first step, the main project components have been estimated
in terms of capital and operational costs, as well as foreseeable revenues
and proceeds from market-related activities. Estimates of operating
costs include labor, imports, and intermediate local inputs by sector of
expenditure, while estimates of construction costs include approximate
time scales for construction work and the deployment of the newly
acquired productive capacity.


                                                                             99
100   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


         In the second step, these estimates have been used to perform a sum-
      mary financial analysis of the projects from the point of view of a likely
      stakeholder (a private party undertaking the project in all or in part
      with government assistance) and to compute indicators of net present
      values and benefit-cost ratios for different investment scenarios. For
      purposes of comparison with the economywide measures of project
      worth, these project-level measures of economic worth are provided in
      terms of value added (that is, returns to human and non-human capital
      used in the project). Because the analysis focuses on value added rather
      than commercial profitability or total economic benefits of all kinds,
      further financial and economic evaluation work will be needed before
      taking a decision about whether individual projects should go ahead.
         In the third step, the economic impact of the project is evaluated,
      using the CGE model. For this purpose, the project is broken down into
      two separate sets of inputs. In the construction period, the inputs are
      the components of capital costs by factor (labor and capital) and sector
      of supply of intermediate capital goods (domestic and imported) used
      to build the new structures and the productive capacity characterizing
      the project. In the operational period, the additional capital stock cre-
      ated by the project is credited to the proprietary sectors, whose produc-
      tivity (in terms of production and value added) is potentially boosted
      by the increased capacity and the wider substitution possibilities pro-
      vided by the new capital.
         The above inputs allow the model to generate an estimate of
      the economywide impact of the projects based on estimates of the
      input-output structure of the Mauritius economy and the simulation of
      the decentralized behavior of the different economic agents involved.
      Given the inputs for the construction stage, the model generates a series
      of effects due to the direct and indirect impact of expenditures through
      the value chains that are active in the economy. These effects depend
      on a process of diffusion through the interdependencies across sectors,
      spurred by linkages at different levels of the value chains (backward and
      forward multipliers) and by consumption-income linkages.
         For the operational period, the dynamic CGE model generates
      increases in production and all factor components of value added, as
      well as operational costs, in all sectors directly and indirectly (through
      backward and forward linkages), driven by the increase in productive
      capacity arising from the projects.
         Because the CGE model reproduces a moving market equilibrium,
      the economywide effects include simulated price and income levels for
      factors of production and goods and services. This means that the esti-
      mates obtained include price effects, as well as consumer and produ-
      cer surplus increases, under the hypothesis of optimizing behavior on
                             Making It Happen: Deep Dives into Selected Sectors   101


the part of firms and consumers. The economywide measures of pro-
ject worth are not directly comparable with the project-level measures,
but they are presented as a complementary set of indicators that may
be useful to evaluate project outcomes from the point of view of a “big
picture” of the economy.
   More specifically, the project-level measures of project worth
are intended to provide initial indications of attractiveness for pri-
vate or public stakeholders, based on present market prices and with-
out accounting for economywide effects or externalities. Unlike pro-
ject-level measures, the economywide measures aim to address, how-
ever imperfectly, the broader question of the social and economic desir-
ability of projects from the point of view of the Mauritius economy and
the many stakeholders that may be involved in their implementation
and their economic consequences.

Key Messages
•	 An additional investment of US$330 million over 10 years in fisheries and aquaculture could increase the sec-
   tor’s revenues by US$380 million per year and generate an additional 3,500 jobs. Bringing the sector up to its
   true potential will require a combination of reducing overexploitation in some areas and overcoming under-
   utilization in others.
•	 In the coastal fisheries, restoring the declining health of the lagoons and reefs is a “no regrets” investment,
   creating significant sustainable benefits for coastal fisheries, for the tourist industry, and through mitigating
   coastal erosion.
•	 In the offshore Banks and deep-water fisheries, catches of high-value fish have been declining, necessitating
   investment in a modern Banks fishing fleet, a fisheries management regime founded on sound economic prin-
   ciples, and an increased maritime presence in this remote but important area of Mauritius’ maritime jurisdiction.
•	 Aquaculture can expand significantly through farming of invertebrates (like oysters, crabs, or sea cucumbers)
   and the cage culture of finfish. Expansion will hinge on demonstrated profitability and mitigation of the high
   risks associated with aquaculture, along with public investment to create a more robust enabling environment
   for private investment.
•	 Investments aimed at improving the productivity of existing port and fisheries infrastructure can improve the
   comparative advantage of Mauritius as a regional seafood hub. Existing regional fleets could increase their use
   of the port to deliver raw materials for processing and purchasing services.
•	 A range of cross-cutting measures are needed to backstop sustainable investments, ensure their economic
   viability and effective social inclusion, and monitor the environmental health of marine and coastal resources.
   These needed measures include improved governance, investment in human resources, targeted environmental
   management, and public support for viable private-sector initiatives. Some emerging investment opportunities,
   such as the development of marine biotechnology and health-care products, are not covered in the analyses here.

104   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last



      Introduction
      The fisheries and aquaculture sector are a critical part of the Mauritius
      economy, representing about 1.5 percent of GDP and employing up to
      22,000 people, including in fish processing and services to the fisheries
      sector.1 The coastal fisheries also have a vital social dimension (par-
      ticularly in Rodrigues), not only providing incomes and food security
      but supporting tourism and livelihoods. The tuna cannery is the single
      largest employer in Mauritius, and Port Louis is the port of choice for
      many industrial fleets fishing in the region. Offshore banks and sea-
      mounts offer untapped fishing potential, while an infant aquaculture is
      attracting investors.
         In recent decades, however, the lagoons, coral reefs, and associated
      coastal habitat (especially around Mauritius island) have been progres-
      sively degraded.2 While some of the loss of ecosystem function may be
      attributed to natural causes and climate change, manmade stresses, par-
      ticularly overfishing and agricultural and urban pollution, are primary
      causes. Moreover, coastal and fishing communities are in the front line of
      climate change, threatened by cyclones, coastal erosion,3 and sea-level rise.
         Against this backdrop, what will it take to boost the potential of
      this sector to contribute to Mauritius’ OE and the country’s overall
      development in a sustainable manner? This chapter addresses this ques-
      tion by providing a quantitative basis for exploring various fisheries
      and aquaculture opportunities, specifically the four areas prioritized by
      Mauritius: (i) the coastal fisheries and the lagoon environment; (ii) the
      high-value bottom fisheries on the remote offshore banks, known as the
      “Banks fisheries”; (iii) aquaculture; and (iv) the Seafood Hub, a com-
      plex of port facilities and fish processing and handling in Port Louis. The
      chapter also explores the linkages between fisheries and other dimen-
      sions of the OE, such as marine leisure and tourism, ocean knowledge,
      the Mauritius port economy, regional cooperation, trade, food security,
      and adaptation to climate change.


      1 Some employment may be seasonal or part-time, including non-Mauritian
      employment on fishing vessels and in processing. The employment and GDP
      estimates are from the Ministry of Energy (MOE) and National Ocean Council
      (NOC) and may not be consistent with values from Statistics Mauritius
      because of differences in sector definition.
      2 There are no definitive assessments of the state of the reefs, lagoons, or coastal

      fisheries for Mauritius island, but multiple sources attest to different aspects
      of degradation, and there is broad consensus among stakeholders that urgent
      action is required to restore these critical ecosystems. See, e.g., http://www.
      veynoulagon.com/.
      3 The coral reef and lagoon ecosystems—vital coastal defenses—are eroding

      through ocean acidification and other stresses.

   A key finding is that additional investments of US$330 million over
10 years could increase the sector’s revenues by US$380 million per
year and generate an additional 3,500 jobs. Enabling the fisheries and
aquaculture sector to meet its true potential will require reduction in
over-exploitation and environmental stresses in the lagoons and coastal
fisheries; effective management and development of underused resour-
ces in others, such as the Banks fisheries; and an enhanced investment
climate for expansion of aquaculture and the Seafood Hub. A range of
cross-cutting measures are needed to backstop sustainable investments,
ensure their economic viability and effective social inclusion, and mon-
itor the environmental health of marine and coastal resources. These
include improved fisheries governance, investment in the human resour-
ces for fisheries and in marine environmental information systems, tar-
geted environmental management, adaption of institutions to meet OE
challenges, and public support for viable private sector initiatives.
   This chapter provides a brief overview of the fisheries and marine
environment, presents a summary of the development scenarios, and
recommends approaches, including recommendations on complement-
ary cross-cutting investments required to develop and sustain the OE
in this sector. Appendix 2 provides supplementary background analysis
and further details of the scenarios and their rationale.


State of the Fisheries and Marine Environment
Mauritius’ maritime jurisdiction, including the Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ) and Extended Continental Shelf (ECS),4 is over 1,400 times larger
than the land area of Mauritius. Currently, the only significant economic
activities in this vast area are fishing and maritime transport.
   The total value of fisheries production is just over US$580 million
per year. Exports are valued at US$400 million (about 22 percent of
total exports by value), and the sector employs approximately 22,000
people, including in post-harvest activities. Total direct value added is
US$157 million, and the sector contributes an estimated 1.4 to 1.5 per-
cent of GDP.5 The tuna post-harvest segment is the most important
contributor in value terms. Total annual public expenditure is US$15
million6 and annual receipts from the sale of fishing rights and licenses


4 The ECS is shared with Seychelles under a Joint Management Agreement.

6 Over 90 percent is for recurrent expenditure and over 80 percent is for sal-

aries and allowances. The allocations are considered to have a historical basis,
rather than a strong relationship to performance or tasks.
106   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      is just over US$2 million. Several economic activities attributable to
      fisheries are not fully reflected in these estimates. These include the
      sale of port services to the region’s tuna fleets; expenditures on mari-
      time surveillance; and expenditures on marine leisure activities, such
      as diving, which form part of the “tourism GDP.” Small-scale fisheries
      and the associated commerce provide an important source of livelihood
      and food for many coastal communities, particularly for Rodrigues. The
      value of Mauritius’ marine ecosystems has been estimated at US$8.6
      billion, excluding their role in maintaining genetic diversity (see
      Appendix 2) (Cesar et al. 2000).
         Despite the country’s vast maritime jurisdiction, Mauritius’ fisheries
      production is relatively low, for several reasons. The main tuna fishing
      grounds lie outside7 Mauritius’ waters; the coastal fisheries are confined
      to the relatively narrow coastal shelf; and the coral reef and lagoon fish-
      eries are substantially overfished, particularly around Mauritius island.
      The offshore banks have potential for increased catches, but the dis-
      tance to these fishing grounds means high production costs. Mauritius’
      total recorded annual fish production8 is just over 16,000 tons, of
      which almost 10,000 tons are caught by Mauritius-flag tuna purse sein-
      ers who land the fish in Seychelles (Table 3.1). With a per capita con-
      sumption of 24.3 kilograms, Mauritius imports about 20,000 tons of
      fish for domestic consumption, including canned fish and bycatch from
      the tuna fleets.
         There has been a progressive degradation of the costal marine
      environment, with a loss of about 50 percent of the coral reefs9 and
      increasing coastal erosion despite some recovery of the mangrove areas.
      The degradation is attributable to a combination of man-made and
      natural stresses, including overfishing, agricultural runoff, sedimenta-
      tion from erosion, tourism, and pollution from wastewater and indus-
      try. Coral bleaching events, increased ocean temperatures, and ocean

      9 Long-term monitoring of coral reefs has been ongoing since the 1990s. Data

      on the status of coral reefs, water quality and the benthic ecosystem are col-
      lected at selected sites and sent to the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network
      (SWIO Node). These data show that a gradual decrease in the percentage of
      live coral cover. However, the time series and coverage are deficient and they
      are not adequate to attribute the relative impacts of the natural and anthropo-
      genic stresses reducing coral cover. The 50 percent estimate given above is
      from senior technical officers in the fisheries and environment administrations.
      Mauritius is at the margin of the more serious coral bleaching events in the
      SWIO region.

acidification are among the natural stressors. At the same time, the
resources of the extensive offshore banks, sea mounts, and deeper ocean
appear healthy.
   Mauritius has a modest but growing marine science capacity, and
monitoring and assessment of the marine resources (other than tuna)
remain intermittent. The legislative framework10 is modern and
development and management plans exist for all major fisheries and
for aquaculture. However, implementation of management measures
and development plans has been less than effective for several rea-
sons: (i) a deficient fisheries information system; (ii) entrenched insti-
tutional arrangements with a lack of performance-driven accountabil-
ity; (iii) development and management plans that often lack the cor-
responding timetables, budgets, milestones and effective tracking; and
(iv) political pressures.
   A notable exception is the tuna fishing and processing industry, for
which international management measures and export requirements
are effectively applied. Measures to manage the Rodrigues lagoon and
octopus fishery have also met with success, whereas catch, effort, and
other key management indicators for the Mauritius island coastal fish-
eries are deficient and do not reflect the actual state of the coastal fish-
eries. The lack of accurate information contributes to weak fisheries
management and the decline of the Mauritius island coastal fisheries.

                                                   recorded coastal fisheries catch11 is about 3,500 tons, of which over

                                                   cies. Reliable detailed species-by-species catch records are not available, since

2,000 tons is from Rodrigues. However, the recorded catches under-
estimate the real production, since auto-consumption and unrecorded
catches may contribute up to an additional 7,000 tons per year. The
estimated value of coastal fisheries production is between US$27 mil-
lion and US$44 million a year.12 The catch comprises a wide variety of
lagoon and reef species, important octopus catches in Rodrigues, and
catches of tuna and demersal (bottom) fish from outside the fringing
reefs. Other than for the octopus fishery there are no stock assessments,
and bias in the species-level catch reporting does not permit robust
scientific analysis of trends in catches. Catch and effort records for the
off-reef fish-aggregating devices (FADs) fishery for tunas, jacks, and
pelagic species have not been compiled.
   Fisher incomes are stable but remain low, with declining catches off-
set by reduced fishing effort, rising prices, and social subsidy.13 Some
fishing takes place outside the lagoons, but the profitability of these
operations is fragile and repayment of development bank loans for
FAD fishing has not met expectations. The estimated employment14 in
the coastal fisheries is 11,000, including those workers engaged in pro-
cessing and distribution. Catches from amateur fishers—unregulated
non-commercial fishers who fish for home consumption, exchange, or
sale—are not recorded. However, Mauritian experts consider that it
may even exceed the recorded catch.
   Mauritius’ lagoon and coral reef ecosystems have been progres-
sively degraded in recent decades, partly due to overfishing. There has
been a loss of ecosystem resilience, low and declining coral cover,15 and
increasing erosion16 and loss of beaches, since almost all fine white sand



landings and sales are highly dispersed. Octopus is one of the most important
species, particularly in Rodrigues.

auto-consumption, and prices.

15 A JICA report indicates that about half of the coral cover was lost between

1998 and 2010, with the disappearance of seagrass beds in some areas.
16 Comprehensive estimates of erosion and the cost of erosion are lacking as

attention has tended to focused on specific erosion problems without consider-
ation of an island-level erosion prevention and mitigation strategy. For example,
the recommendations of a 2003 (Baird) report appear to have been only
partly implemented. A JICA study focused on engineering solutions to erosion
at numerous locations and suggested that loss of coral cover attributable to

      is produced by corals. Although specific estimates for Mauritius are
      lacking, based on studies from similar countries17 the contributions of
      healthy reef and lagoon ecosystems to coastal protection and tourism
      are considered to far outweigh their contribution to fisheries. Initiatives
      to reduce fishing effort and to introduce a marine spatial plan (MSP)
      for sustainable use of the reefs and lagoon have been largely successful
      in Rodrigues. In Mauritius, efforts to reduce fishing effort18 and estab-
      lish marine protected areas may have had a stabilizing influence, but as
      of 2016 they do not appear to have been sufficient to achieve recovery
      of fish stocks or of these ecosystems.
         While there is an awareness that there will be substantial loss of loss
      of coral reefs due to warming seas and ocean acidification, the economic
      consequences of this loss do not appear to be fully appreciated. Because
      these losses transcend political horizons, mitigating measures are not
      afforded the policy attention and budgetary resources required to estab-
      lish a comprehensive reef and lagoon conservation program. Additional
      details on the coastal fisheries are provided in Appendix 2.
         Rodrigues Island is a microcosm of the OE. The island provides sev-
      eral lessons for a blue economy, including its handling of lagoon rehabili-
      tation, octopus fishery management, and alternative livelihoods for fishers


      anthropogenic environmental change was a major factor contributing to ero-
      sion “[t]he causes of decline seem to be eutrophication in lagoons, inflow of
      terrestrial sediment into lagoons, fishing activities, marine sports and human
      impacts.” However, several erosion prevention projects have been considered
      and some implemented. Measures for mangrove rehabilitation and restrictions
      on removal of beach sand (for construction) have proved successful. Some
      hotels replace beach sand regularly. In general, the costs of erosion protection
      are high and can be unaffordable unless protecting high value assets.

      18 It is too early to assess the impact of a new octopus regulation (Fisheries and

      Marine Resources [Fishing of Octopus] Regulations 2016), which is based on
      the Rodrigues experience.

development of a “sensitive” tourism model. The island demonstrates the
important synergies between sectors—fisheries, tourism, transport, water,
energy, horticulture, livestock, and transport to and from markets. The pro-
cess undertaken in Rodrigues illustrates how social, economic and environ-
mental issues can be balanced through stakeholder dialogue and consensus.
However, the social contract achieved in Rodrigues will also require con-
tinued monitoring and support to maintain the benefits secured.

The Offshore Banks and Deepwater Bottom Fisheries
Mauritius’ offshore banks and seamounts cover an area about 50 times
the land area of Mauritius and are a signature feature of Mauritius’
ocean domain. The largest of the offshore banks, the Saya de Malha
Bank, is home to the Indian Ocean’s largest seagrass beds. These beds
are a major carbon sink, capturing some US$17 million worth of car-
bon annually.19 The Banks are remote—Nazareth Bank (see Map 3.1)
is about the same distance from Port Louis as Rodrigues (over 600 km).
For safety and economic reasons, the smaller Banks fishing vessels tend
to fish the more southerly banks and seamounts. Fishing is mainly done
by handline from smaller iceboats and larger freezer vessels. By reflag-
ging to Comoros to avoid restrictions on carriage of outboard fuel, some
dory/mothership operations have continued.
   Currently, the demersal or bottom fisheries on the offshore banks
and seamounts annually catch about 1,500 tons of high-value emperor,
snapper, and grouper worth some US$6.75 million and employ about
200 people. Catches of these high-value fish resources have been in
decline for several reasons, including regulatory changes, shortages of
skilled labor, high operating costs, and a decline in catch rates (see
Table 3.1 and Appendix 2).
   The maximum sustainable biological yield (MSY) has been estimated
at 5,367 tons (including the banks and all deep-water demersal) with
a potential maximum economic yield (MEY)20 on the order of 3,550
tons, suggesting considerable scope for expansion of these fisheries.


19 Based on seagrass at 138 gm C per m2 covering 80 percent of 40,808 km2,
a carbon price of US$7/ton and a 50 percent share of the revenues as per
the Treaty. Although a large part of the Saya de Malha lies in the Extended
Continental Shelf (ECS), the Parties have rights over the benthic resources
(although not to the “mobile” fish resources). The seagrass beds also extend to
the Nazareth and other banks (not included in the estimates, however, because
the percentage of seagrass cover is not available).
20 The MEY depends not only on healthy fish stocks, but also on the level of

fishing effort, the cost of harvesting, and market conditions. The objective of
MEY is to maximize profitability rather than production.

                            However, while some fishing grounds are located near Mauritius and
                            Rodrigues islands, the more extensive fishing grounds are located over
                            600 kilometers from the fishing ports. Consequently, risks and costs
                            of production are relatively high and attention to safety at sea is vital,
                            particularly for vessels under 20 meters. Due to stricter application of
                            Merchant Shipping regulations, one fleet segment (dory/mothership)21
                            is obsolete, so new investments in fleet and technology are required for
                            a modern profitable fishery.
                                There is evidence that catch rates have declined, possibly due to
                            illegal foreign fishing on these remote and rarely patrolled fishing


                            21 These freezer motherships fish for several months at a time, using a fleet of

                            small outboard-powered dories operating from the mothership. Application of
                            safety regulations regarding the carriage of outboard fuel on board the mothership
                            have resulted in suspension of these operations for Mauritius-flag vessels. Shortage
                            of Mauritian crew willing to work in the difficult and high-risk conditions also
                            contributed to the decline and an increase in non-Mauritian fishing crew.

grounds ( See Appendix 2).22 It is important to note that about half
the Mauritius Banks catch is taken from the Saya de Malha Bank,
which is part of the ECS shared with Seychelles. This means that nei-
ther Mauritius nor Seychelles have exclusive rights over these fish-
eries, which are managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries
Agreement (SIOFA), in force since June 2012. Although SIOFA has
adopted interim management measures,23 it is still in an early stage of
development. Mauritian Banks fishing operations outside the country’s
EEZ (e.g., on most of the Saya de Malha Bank) will need to be compli-
ant with SIOFA measures.
   The key to building a profitable and sustainable fishery involves
a combination of new technologies and cooperative export brand-
ing and marketing. This needs to be backed by a robust management
regime with strict limits on effort and increased surveillance of the fish-
ing grounds to eliminate any unauthorized fishing, as described in the
development scenario. In the medium to longer term, a more detailed
analysis of the target stocks may be advisable, for example to establish



22 The reasons for the perceived decline are unclear and require further analy-

sis, e.g. the unit of effort (fisherman/day) may not be fully comparable across
years given the decline of the dory/mothership operations.
23 ECS rights pertain only to mineral and sedentary living resources; thus,

the Letherinid, Lutjanid and grouper species targeted by the Banks fishery
are excluded and can be exploited without authorization from Mauritius or
Seychelles (SIOFA 2016, 2017).

      if the fishery is targeting single stocks or multiple stocks and if some
      stocks are shared with Seychelles.

      Aquaculture
      Farming of invertebrates (such as oysters, crabs, or sea cucumbers)
      and the cage culture of finfish all have potential. Progress in marine
      aquaculture development has been slow, and the industry currently
      employs fewer than 150 people (Appendix 2). Aquaculture has grad-
      ually expanded (Table 3.1), effectively due to the production of a single
      industrial-scale fish farm, Ferme Marine de Mahébourg (FMM).24 FMM
      produces about 750 tons of red drum, sea bass, and sea bream, of which
      about 70 percent is exported fresh; most of the balance supplies local
      hotels. After more than 10 years, FMM expects to become profitable
      in 2017, when expanded production will deliver economies of scale.
      Despite public support, little progress has occurred in small-scale pro-
      duction. Less than five tons of freshwater prawn, mangrove crab, and
      fish are produced by small-scale fish farmers (Appendix 2, Table 6).
         However, aquaculture can expand significantly given a favorable
      business climate and access to medium to long-term finance based
      on sound business plans.25 The Mauritius Aquaculture Development
      Plan26 has identified 21 suitable farm sites, including six offshore sites,
      and has proposed an ambitious long-term production target of 39,000
      tons with creation of 5,000 jobs. However, these targets refer essentially
      to the spatial potential of farm sites, rather than being based on any
      techno-economic appraisal of specific farm projects. As such, the targets
      need to be treated with a degree of caution given the economic chal-
      lenges faced by FMM. Nevertheless, FMM has been a leader, enabling
      future investors to benefit from an improved aquaculture investment
      regime. Aquaculture expansion is spatially limited by multiple use of
      the restricted lagoon areas. This will require some future finfish farms
      to be located in the more exposed and higher-risk sites27 identified



      24 See: http://www.fmm.mu/.
      25 The Fisheries and Marine Resources (Fish Farming) Regulations 2014
      require substantial upgrading. Aqua-farm authorization, environmental and
      local government approval, and other regulatory clearances need to be more
      coherent, coordinated, and streamlined. Current work on long-term aqua-farm
      leases will facilitate securing finance.
      26 See BOI and IDEE 2007, a study for implementing the aquaculture master

      plan.
      27 Sites have already been designated under the National Aquaculture Plan,

      but the designation has not included a process of formal approval by other
      concerned ministries (for example, the Ministry of Environment).
                                   Fisheries and Aquaculture and the Ocean Economy    115


outside the reefs (see Appendix 2). Aquaculture development will be
an important consideration in any MSP exercise.
   Several investment proposals are in the pipeline, although in recent
years a number of proposals have not materialized, partly due to a chal-
lenging investment climate. These challenges include competition for
limited space in the lagoons; limited availability of land for shoreside
facilities; an onerous approvals processes; and access to finance for an
infant industry that has significant perceived risks. Supply of fish seeds
and feeds and capacity to combat disease are among the barriers to
small-scale entrepreneurs.28 Public policy reforms are required to cre-
ate a more robust enabling environment with fast-track approvals (such
as an environmental impact assessment harmonized across institutions),
security of tenure for aquaculture concessions, and facilitated access to
sites for shore facilities.
   Smallholder outgrower schemes could be envisaged when large-scale
farms become viable and can provide essential inputs, expertise, and
economies of scale. Although aquaculture competes with tourism and
other lagoon and coastal activities, it can be not only compatible but
complementary to tourism. For example, pearl culture, giant clam cul-
ture, and caged fish can all be attractions for divers, while seaweed cul-
ture can contribute to a tourist health and skin-care attraction.29 This is
where an MSP can guide the optimum use of lagoon and coastal space
and help avoid conflicts.

The Seafood Hub
The complex of port facilities, fish processing, and fleet servicing activ-
ities in Port Louis is collectively termed the Seafood Hub. Port Louis
is a major regional fishing port with almost 1,000 vessel calls per year
(Poseidon 2016). Most of these calls are by tuna vessels, including large
refrigerated carriers (reefers), which unload tuna supplied (mainly
from the Seychelles) to the processing plants. Vessels fishing in the
Antarctic fisheries also use Port Louis. Canned and frozen fish products
are exported by container or transshipped to reefers. There is a growing
trade in fresh tuna exported to markets in Asia and Europe. Although
the contribution of fisheries to the revenues of the Mauritius Port


28 Local production of feeds and seeds is contingent on achieving economies of

scale to enable local feed mills to manufacture separate lines of fish feeds. Fish
feed composition is substantially different from chicken or pig feed, and often
several different types are needed for different stages of the fish life cycle. FMM
initially imported its fish seed.
29 Tahiti, Fiji, Indonesia, Philippines, and other countries include these and

other attractions in their marine tourism programs.

      Authority (MPA) are modest, purchases of goods and services by the
      vessel operators is estimated at over US$57 million per year. Purchases
      include bunkering, victualing, vessel repair, crew transfer, and cargo
      handling.
         The Seafood Hub includes two major tuna processors30 (cans,
      loins, pouches) and several smaller fish processing companies31 hand-
      ling fresh and frozen tuna and other fish both for the export market
      and for domestic sales (e.g., tuna bycatch). Several fishing companies,
      engaged in tuna longline and banks fishing, are based in Port Louis,
      and several ships agents serve Asian (longline) and purse-seine (mainly
      EU) transshipment, reefer charter, and fishing vessel supply services.
      MPA’s commercial quays, freezer container facility, and storage areas
      are complemented by privately owned quays and cold stores, a ship-
      yard, and a range of services for vessel and equipment repair and main-
      tenance. Many of these companies have long-standing relationships
      with foreign tuna operators and fishing vessel construction companies.
         Under the MPA master plan, a designated quay area will be pro-
      vided for fishing vessels and expansion of cold storage, a sheltered
      anchorage established to relieve pressure on quay space, and an area set
      aside for a second shipyard (see Chapter 6 for additional details). The
      Mauritius tuna processing industry, which employs some 3,000 people,
      imports well over 90 percent of its raw material. The total annual tuna
      “traffic” is over 140,000 tons, with a steady increase in longline vessel
      calls since 2008 (Table 3.4). This is because the main fishing grounds
      for the purse seine fleet, which supply the canneries and loining plants,
      are outside Mauritius’ waters (Appendix Figure 2A.3). Tuna and other
      highly migratory fish are the South West Indian Ocean’s most econom-
      ically important fisheries resources and are managed through regional
      arrangements.32 The stocks of skipjack, bigeye, and albacore remain
      healthy, but stocks of yellowfin (a species of major economic import-
      ance to Mauritius) and stocks of some marlin species are overfished.
         In the short term, investments to improve the productivity of exist-
      ing port and fisheries infrastructure can improve the comparative
      advantage of Mauritius as a regional seafood hub. This can lead to an
      increase in the number of vessels permanently based in or calling at Port

      30 Princes Tuna and Thon des Mascareignes (joint operation). A dedicated com-

      pany converts processing waste into fish meal.
      31 Mer des Mascareignes is an example. IBL is a major conglomerate heavily

      engaged in the sector, while more than 25 companies import or export fish
      products.

the supply of raw material for an expanded processing industry and fish
for domestic consumption.

posed public and private investments in port infrastructure and vessel
repair services (see Chapter 6 on ports).


Development Scenarios
How much could the fisheries and aquaculture sector contribute to a
larger OE and thus a more diversified and stronger national economy?
This analysis focuses on the four fisheries and marine environmental
activities that the MOE selected33 for an in-depth assessment: (i) the
coastal fisheries and health of the lagoon ecosystems; (ii) the offshore
banks fisheries; (iii) aquaculture; and (iv) the Seafood Hub. Scenarios
were developed for each activity based on its current status and trends,
current investment proposals, and potential for development. This
section describes each scenario in terms of its targets, investments, eco-
nomic, social, and environmental returns, and underlying assumptions.
Further details on the scenarios are provided in Appendix 2. The scenar-
ios do not constitute an integrated plan of action for the fisheries sector
but, rather, inputs to a model of the OE. The scenarios are essentially
separate stand-alone exercises and, while the synergies between them
are limited, they jointly contribute to improved fisheries governance,
knowledge management, financing of ocean enterprises, and economies
of scale in port and other services. The scenarios are based on the best
available information on investment costs and returns, but they do not
constitute project proposals, which would require specific feasibility
studies.
   The investments can also catalyze development of the other OE clus-
ters. These include marine science, environmental management, marine
IT, and marine finance and insurance, as well as regional cooperation on


 Other areas of potential, such as marine biotechnology and production of
33

marine-based medicines or health-care products, have not been assessed.

Box 3.1. Assumptions Underlying the Scenarios

The main external assumptions for the offshore banks fisheries, aquaculture, and Seafood Hub
scenarios are as follows:
    The Mauritius economy remains relatively stable such that Mauritius remains the regional port of choice
for fisheries logistics.
    Global supply and demand for fish products remains relatively stable, in particular for tuna.
    Global fuel prices remain relatively stable.
    There will be no major change in the fish import tariff regime of the EU (that is, ASEAN, or non-ACP
producers will not get significant additional tariff quotas).
    The main internal assumptions are as follows:
    Significant institutional reforms will take place leading to reallocation and more effective use of public
resources—including staff and greater synergies between ministries (like MOE)—although it is recognized
that there could be significant delays in any public service reforms.
    The proposed investments will be profitable, in particular the offshore banks (medium confidence) and
aquaculture (low confidence) investments. The recent relatively poor FFM statement of accounts means
that the aquaculture scenario is quite optimistic.
    Private-sector finance will be available at favorable rates (for example, for aquaculture, where tens of
millions are required) (low confidence).
    The government will address the issue of private-sector access to finance and risk reduction in an effect-
ive manner (medium to low confidence).
    Stakeholders (public and private), particularly those in the Seafood Hub, will collaborate effectively to
achieve medium/longer-term benefits (medium/high confidence).

                    Scenario 1: Restoring the Health of the Coastal Fisheries and
                    Ecosystems
                    The coastal fisheries are overexploited34 and the lagoon and coral reef
                    ecosystems upon which they depend are substantially degraded. To an
                    extent, past economic growth in Mauritius has come at the expense of
                    a loss of part of the natural capital represented by the reefs and lagoons.
                    Although not currently quantified, this is reflected by growing concern
                    over loss of beaches and sea walls. Recorded fish catches are slowly
                    declining (on Mauritius Island) and fisher incomes are maintained by a
                    combination of rising fish prices, a gradual reduction in fishing effort,


                    34 As some of the coastal fisheries in Rodrigues have recovered, the recovery
                    scenario refers primarily to Mauritius island. However, continued support
                    for the successful conservation and management efforts in Rodrigues will be
                    important.

and various government subsidies.35 Efforts to move fishers “off-lagoon”
have had mixed success, as some grant-financed vessels have not been
viable36 and the blasting of reef passages to access the open sea may
have had negative impacts37 on the lagoon ecosystems.

Rationale. Restoring the health of the lagoons and reefs is a “no regrets”
investment that will create significant sustainable benefits for coastal
fisheries, for the tourist industry, and by mitigating coastal erosion.
The initial investments necessary are largely institutional. They require
strong political will to drive initiatives that will establish a framework
for reduction of environmental stresses38 and optimize the economic
and social use of the lagoons, while also sustaining the environmental
integrity of the ecosystems.
   This task is considerably broader than managing the fisheries. The nat-
ural stressors—ocean warming, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and
coral bleaching—cannot be remedied by local actions and are likely to
cause irreversible and progressive loss of the reefs and the natural coastal
defenses. This makes reduction of the man-made stressors vital. These
include overfishing, overuse by tourism, waste-water discharges, agricul-
tural runoff, and other forms of pollution. Overfishing has social, economic,
and political dimensions. Solutions are likely to require a social contract
with reduction in commercial fishers’ effort offset by opening alterna-
tive economic opportunities. Restrictions on “amateur” fishing,39 which
account for a significant proportion of the catch, may also be required.

Approach. This scenario represents the first phase of a longer-term
process to address these stresses. The proposed activities will build the
framework to guide and prioritizes future actions. The scenario pro-
poses two institutional investments and several sector investments.
   The first investment is to establish a robust and permanent scheme
to monitor the state of the coastal environment and the fisheries. The


35 These include the Bad Weather Allowance, grants for vessels, and the persis-

tence of unpaid loans.
36 Discussions with fisher groups and the Mauritius Development Bank.
37 Creation of reef passages may allow flushing of sand required for beach for-

mation and seagrass beds (personal communication with R. Kallee).
38 For example, by reviewing and updating the EIA Guideline for Proposed

Coastal Hotel Projects (Ministry of Environment 2004). The guidelines refer
mainly to the construction phase and could possibly be extended to codes of
practice for use of the lagoons by the tourists and operators of sail and dive
boats.

This is a traditional unregulated activity.
120   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      current efforts are sporadic, insufficient, and largely unstructured or, in
      the case of fisheries, outdated.40 The scheme will enable improved attri-
      bution of the causes of ecosystem degradation and provide a sound basis
      for mitigation measures. Existing institutions41 will establish perma-
      nent schemes to monitor the physical and biological state of the reef,
      lagoon and coastal ecosystems to enable attribution of the environ-
      mental degradation to specific stresses and recommendation of remed-
      ial actions.
         The second institutional investment is to develop an MSP42 to
      optimize the multiple use of the lagoons, coral reefs and other prior-
      ity areas. This exercise will address not only the physical use of areas,
      but the administrative and legal frameworks governing their use
      and approaches to resolve conflicts through dialogue and analysis. It
      will need to be integrated with broader coastal zone and watershed
      management and climate change adaptation initiatives. The MSP will
      establish a framework for sustainable investments and development
      across sectors, including tourism, aquaculture, coastal transport, and
      offshore energy. A detailed description of the MSP process is provided
      in Chapter 7).
         Specific fisheries sector investments focus on the reduction of fish-
      ing effort, “moving offshore”43 and effective management of selected
      fisheries, such as the octopus fishery.44 Regulation of amateur fish-
      ing will be needed following public dialogue on the measures with a
      view to reduction of fishing effort by amateur fishers. Existing initia-
      tives for reduction of nets45 and to move fishers off-lagoon to the FAD
      or other fisheries will be evaluated and enhanced. The rationale for

      island.
      45 The buy-back of the lagoon seine nets is expected to be completed. The

      grant scheme will need to be subject to more rigorous cost/benefit analysis of
      investments and assistance to small-scale investors in this regard. The grants for
      fishing vessels will need to be complemented by improved awareness of loan
      and grant conditions, fisher training or assistance for budgeting, accounting and
      seasonal planning of loan repayments.

subsidies, such as the Bad Weather Allowance, will need to be reviewed
and redirected to more productive ends or recognized purely as a social
subsidy and de-linked from fishing effort. These measures will be sup-
plemented by support to communities for creation of non-fisheries
economic opportunities, such as marine leisure activities. The detailed
design of these schemes is expected to be developed in parallel and
through the MSP process, which will aim to balance the interests of the
stakeholders and address the political sensitivities of change. The key to
this process is the recognition that all stakeholders will need to change
behaviors while making every effort to maintain livelihoods dependent
on the reefs and lagoons. The outcomes are likely to involve efforts to
expand marine protected areas.
   The scenario takes note of the ongoing investments in waste water
management and efforts to reduce agricultural runoff but does not
include additional investments in these areas, since they lie outside the
scope of the current exercise. The scientific assessment of the stresses on
the coastal marine ecosystems is likely to indicate that significant addi-
tional public and private investments will be required, for example in
urban waste water treatment, to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesti-
cides in the cane fields or gardens and to reduce sediment loads in the
coastal waters by buffering erosion inland. The MSP process is expected
to gradually foster a “ridge to reef” approach that would progressively
address these stresses and expand marine parks and protected areas
through a consultation process.

Costs and returns. The estimated cost of the investments over the
initial 10-year period is US$24 million, and the operating costs aver-
age US$1.7 million per year (Table 3.5). The returns accrue primarily
outside the fisheries sector: to tourism and marine leisure, through
reduction in the costs of coastal erosion, through reduction in damage
caused by cyclones, but also through recovery of selected fisheries and
continuity of some jobs in the coastal fisheries.46 The estimated annual
returns by year 10 are on the order of US$12 million per year, assuming
that actions to reduce the stresses on the ecosystems are undertaken in
a timely and comprehensive manner. There will be a net gain of 250
jobs. Employment in lagoon fisheries will be reduced but will be com-
pensated by an increase in jobs in marine leisure, in tourism, in offshore


46 With effective management, fisheries for octopus and lobster have high

recovery potential. The amateur fishery is likely to require regulation (for
example, limited hours at weekends only). Effective regulation of the lagoon
fisheries will require strong political will and leadership to address the social
challenges involved.

                                 It is important to note that the investments do not include actions
                              to reduce wastewater discharge or agricultural runoff, which are major
                              stressors. The investment will, however, enable a quantification of these
                              stresses and inform a program of action to reduce them. It is empha-
                              sized that recovery of the lagoon ecosystems is likely to be contingent
                              on strong action to reduce these latter two stressors; because of the cur-
                              rent state of knowledge, the costs of these actions are not included in
                              the development scenario.48
                                 If the health of the lagoon and reef ecosystems is not restored, the
                              costs to the economy are likely to progressively increase: coastal ero-
                              sion will increase, including the loss of sand to hotel beaches; cyclone
                              damage will increase; subsidies to stressed fisheries will cause further
                              declines in catches; and the potential for coastal aquaculture will be
                              undermined. In the medium to long-term, these losses are likely to
                              exceed the costs of remedial investments by orders of magnitude.


                              47 Job creation in coastal offshore fisheries depends on the viability of FAD and

                              dropline fisheries around Mauritius island.
                              48 A suitable model for the suite of actions is the Australia/Queensland scheme

                              to protect the Great Barrier Reef, since Northern Queensland has an important
                              sugar cane industry.

Scenario 2: The Banks and Offshore Demersal Fishery
For the purposes of the scenario, all deepwater fisheries, including
those on the Saya De Malha Bank,49 Nazareth Bank, St. Brandon
Banks, around Rodrigues, and on the seamounts and continental slopes
around Mauritius are considered as a single fishery—the “Banks” fish-
ery. Recorded production has declined from more than 3,500 tons to
1,500 tons per year, for several reasons, and it is currently well below
the estimated MSY. The technology used by the aging fleet of dory/
mothership freezer vessels no longer meets maritime safety require-
ments, and the fleet is being phased out.50 The current fleet is domin-
ated by 15-to-25-meter vessels using ice—chill-fish vessels. Vertically
integrated companies with chill-fish vessels appear to be cost-effective,
while smaller operators without strong market links face challenges.
In addition, the presence of foreign fishing vessels is reported, which
may contribute to a decline in the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) (see
Appendix 2).51

Approach. The scenario envisages investment in new chill-fish vessels
based on commercial assessment of the optimum size and design. The
current dropline fishing will be supplemented with passive gears: bot-
tom longlines and traps. This will be done through closely monitored
charter arrangements for different vessels operating on a commercial
basis but providing the required information on technical performance,
costs, and returns. This approach avoids initial commitment of capital
to untested harvesting arrangements.
   Support for a stakeholder association would be provided. Its tasks
would be to help match supply with demand (avoid gluts and ensure



49 Note that coastal states do not have exclusive rights over the finfish resour-
ces of the Extended Continental Shelf. A large proportion of the Saya de Malha
Bank lies in the ECS.
50 See Merchant Shipping Act, Merchant Shipping (Bank fishing Dories)

Regulations 2000 GN No. 127 of 2000. The dory/mothership vessels operated
under an exemption from the Merchant Shipping safety regulations for sev-
eral years, and the remaining vessels have reflagged to Comoros to avoid the
restrictions.
51 It should be noted that part of the Banks fishing area lies outside jurisdic-

tional waters for the purposes of fishing non-sedentary species, such as those
targeted by the Banks fleet. Consequently, the entire fishery is not subject to
enforcement actions by the coastal states.
52 The likely target market is for fresh emperor (Letherinidae) and snapper

(Lutjanidae) by air to Dubai. Stable and regular supply of a sustainably branded
product will require collaboration by producers on product standards, orders
and prices.

      stable supplies); penetrate export markets53 with a sustainable Banks-
      brand fresh-fish product; and collaborate on safety at sea. Public sup-
      port will be directed at improving the technology, facilitating access to
      finance for modern vessels, and training the Mauritian crew.
         An individual transferable quota (ITQ) management scheme53 will
      be established to ensure biological and economic sustainability and,
      if required, a fishing grounds rotation54 scheme will be introduced.
      Applied scientific research, fisheries monitoring, and expanded mari-
      time surveillance would complement the private sector activities.
      Studies would be undertaken at St. Brandon and Agalega leading to the
      establishment of logistics bases for scientific and enforcement activities.
      This could also lead to an expansion of the small, but exclusive, sport
      fish fishery for bonefish and jacks. A feasibility study on “blue carbon”
      sequestration by the Saya de Malha seagrass beds will determine how
      carbon funds can be accessed to support the conservation of the Banks.
         Maintaining a profitable Banks fishery means expanded fisheries sur-
      veillance. While a certain level of presence at sea by the National Coast
      Guard is essential, the area is ideal for deployment of modern cost-ef-
      fective remote sensing technologies—including buoyed hydrophones
      and underwater drones55 equipped with hydrophones to triangulate
      noise signals from vessels. This information can be overlaid with an
      obligatory vessel monitoring system reporting from licensed vessels to
      help identify any nonreporting vessel activity on the Banks, provide esti-
      mates of any illegal fishing, and help plan Coast Guard patrols.

      Costs and returns. The estimated investment is US$27 million, of
      which about half is private investment, mainly for up to 16 modern
      fishing vessels. The public operating costs are US$0.75 million per
      year. The annual gross returns are estimated to be US$24 million from
      the Banks fisheries and a further US$4.2 million from the blue carbon



      53 The Banks fishery appears ideal for such a scheme for several reasons. It is

      a developing fishery so the quota can be precautionary, quota allocation does
      not require reduction in vessel numbers or effort (as catches are substantially
      below the estimated MSY), all landings will be in Port Louis, enabling good
      control, and any overfishing is likely to affect the economic performance of the
      fishery long before the fish stocks are threatened, because high catch rates and
      marketable fish sizes are required to offset the high costs and risk involved in
      the remote fishing operations.
      54 This is done in other similar fisheries to avoid depletion of closer grounds

      while more distant or less-productive fishing grounds remain “under-exploita-
      tion.”

scheme. Without investment, employment is likely to decline gradually.
The investments anticipate the maintenance of 200 existing jobs56 and
an increase of 400 jobs in fishing and post-harvest handling. In the event
of a blue carbon initiative, additional jobs at sea and in marine science
would be created (Table 3.6). The scenario also contributes to the asser-
tion of Mauritius’ maritime control over these isolated resources.
   The critical assumption is that the technical and management innov-
ations will create a profitable fishery. Other key assumptions are that
the commercial operators will effectively collaborate to supply high-
end export markets with a branded product (possibly as a condition
of licensing); that an ITQ or similar effort management system will be
effectively implemented enforced; and that an effective maritime sur-
veillance presence on the Banks is provided. Thus, the keys to develop-
ment of a sustainable Banks fishery are financing effective technical
innovation on the fishing grounds, limiting the fleet size and fishing
effort to maintain profitability, cooperation among the fishers on the
fishing grounds and in export marketing, and enhanced monitoring and
surveillance.

Scenario 3: Aquaculture Expansion
Approach. The aquaculture scenario builds on the recent issue of con-
cessions and ongoing work to characterize the designated aquaculture
sites. The scenario is based on an additional five farms in the inshore and
lagoon area and two farms in the offshore area. Some farms will be for
invertebrates (such as oysters or sea cucumbers), as the space available
for cages within the lagoons is limited. The inshore farms would have
approximately the same scale of investment and production as the exist-

      ing Ferme Marine de Mahebourg (FMM)57—that is, FMM is used as a
      template for the inshore scenario, although it is recognized that some
      inshore farms could be for invertebrates. The two offshore finfish cage
      farms have a profile equivalent to that set out in the Growfish58 pro-
      posal. Small-scale aquaculture is not part of the scenario, although out-
      grower schemes could be envisaged once the industry is well established.
         The scenario provides for public support for aquaculture site base-
      line studies, facilitating private applied research and innovation, mon-
      itoring of diseases, and robust environmental impacts (Ministry of
      Environment and NDU 2009). Capacity building will need to be inte-
      grated with broader human resource development planning. Issues aris-
      ing in relation to aquaculture legislation and investment fast-tracking
      will need to take account of the MSP initiative. A progressive aquacul-
      ture will require a significantly improved regulatory base, not only in
      relation to a streamlined inter-ministerial approvals process and long-
      term site leases, but also for disease control, green certification, and
      product traceability for exports and for the import of seeds and related
      biosafety considerations.59 The Fisheries Division and the Board of
      Investment (BOI) have identified a number of aquaculture develop-
      ment activities that can be undertaken. It is advisable that these be
      undertaken as a partnership with private investors to ensure that the
      innovations can be rapidly applied at the farm level.
         In designing any public support for aquaculture, Mauritius can
      look to Norway, Vietnam, and Israel for examples. Within the region,
      Madagascar has useful experience of community-based beche-de-mer
      farming. In addition to a robust legislative and investment framework
      and investment in human resources, public support is generally focused
      on governance issues related to seeds, feeds, and disease60 and on the
      innovations required to adapt fish culture systems to the local condi-
      tions. Mauritius’ aquaculture expansion will remain entirely reliant on
      private investment, which must be nourished as an infant industry in
      the medium term until Mauritius achieves economies of scale to allow

      58 See: http://www.growfish.biz/index.html.
      59 Markets are also increasingly demanding product certification, which may

      require traceability of feed ingredients, rules on animal welfare (e.g. fish slaugh-
      ter). Other regulations may be required in relation to impact on biodiversity
      from escapees or use of fertile invertebrate seed, on GMOs, and on capture of
      seed from the wild.
      60 Norway has been particularly active in breeding programs for salmonids and,

      in combination with applied research on feeds, has cut the feed conversion ratio
      to 1:1.3 (or less). Growth rates for salmon, tilapia, shrimp, scallops, and other
      species have improved by orders of magnitude as a result of some programs.

the growth of support services on seeds, feeds, and disease monitoring
and control. Until that time, investors and public support will need to
share the burden of the support services and investments in feed61 and
seed production or import. Importantly also, Mauritius might want to
consider having a robust citizen engagement plan, within an inclusive
marine spatial plan, as it starts to expand aquaculture.

Costs and returns. The total investment is US$245 million over 10
years—based on a unit cost62 of US$17 million for the FMM-type inshore
investments (whether for finfish, or invertebrates) and US$40 million for
the offshore investments (including shore facilities). Gross incremental
returns are estimated at almost US$290 million per year, with an increase
of about 1,500 in jobs (Table 3.7). Over 90 percent of the production
would be exported, and up to half of the inputs would be imported.
   The key assumptions are that (i) appropriate financing will be avail-
able; (ii) the approval process can be fast-tracked; and (iii) the produc-
tion systems will be technically and economically sustainable. There is an
assumed rate of return of 25 percent—which is at the margin for access
to loan finance or risk capital (that is, finance is unlikely to be available
unless a high rate of return can be demonstrated).63 Some investors have
experienced difficulty in sourcing finance. The financing issue highlights
the need for public support and facilitation through secure tenure over


61 Aquafeeds are significantly different from other animal feeds, since fish

require a different balance of nutrients and some ingredients in regular animal
feeds may even impede growth. A key ingredient of aquafeeds is fish meal and
fish oil, for which there is a limited local supply from the tuna processing indus-
try. In addition, seed fish (fingerlings) may need a different feed composition
from growing fish and from those being prepared for market. Feed costs can be
in excess of 60 percent of total costs for finfish cage farms, while invertebrates,
such as oysters and sea cucumbers, do not require artificial feed.
62 These values are drawn from existing investment proposals and may not

reflect actual investments. However, a relatively large investment is generally
required to achieve economies of scale.

      Scenario 4. Development of the Seafood Hub
      The Seafood Hub scenario includes all the Port Louis activities associ-
      ated with the industrial fisheries and fish processing. It does not include
      the expansion of the port fisheries and related infrastructure, which are
      covered in the port development scenario—notably, additional quay
      and fish handling space, a protected mooring for (mainly longline)
      vessels, and prospective private investment in repair (drydock/slipway)
      facilities (see Chapter 6) (Royal Haskoning DHV 2016). Details of the
      Seafood Hub infrastructure are not provided here and reference should
      be made to the relevant sections of the Port Louis port master plan.

      Rationale. This scenario focuses largely on: (i) institutional develop-
      ment to increase the use of the existing port facilities to increase sales
      of services and supply fish to existing processing plants and for domestic
      consumption; (ii) selected private investments in longline vessels64 and
      in fresh fish handling and cold storage; and (iii) complementary support
      at the regional level to secure sustainable economic benefits from the
      tuna fisheries. These activities can be coordinated under a Seafood Hub
      development plan to include optimizing the efficiency of, and returns
      from, expanded port services, enabling private investment in fleet, cold
      storage, fish handling, and vessel repair.

      Approach. The institutional investments include the upgrading of the
      Port State Measures Unit (IT and training) and resolving institutional
      issues in the Competent Authority (sanitary controls). Restrictions on
      sale of bycatch will be removed. An upgraded public-private partner-
      ship between MPA, ships agents, seafood processors, vessel operators,
      and other key stakeholders will be tasked with streamlining the logistics
      of the fisheries activities to improve productivity for all. A dedicated
      fisheries productivity unit in MPA will provide day-to-day coordina-
      tion and logistics planning for fishing vessel berthing to maximize use
      of both public and private quays.65 The public-private partnership
      will engage in discussions with the various foreign fleets operating in


      64 In 2016 Mauritius operated seven purse seiners and four longliners with a

      total catch of 9,774 tons. Most of the purse seine fishing took place outside
      Mauritius waters and landings were mostly in the Seychelles, whereas the long-
      line fleet operates mostly from Mauritius.
      65 Online advance schedules on vessel arrivals, transshipment, and deliveries to

      processors will allow all parties to plan and optimize logistics.

the region with a view to establishing a permanent base in Port Louis
through a mutually beneficial development of services, improved
investment climate, and collaborative commercial framework.
   The private investments include current and proposed projects to
develop the fresh tuna export industry. These vessels may fish sea-
sonally in regional non-Mauritian waters. The private sector will also
expand the cold chain capacity. Regional initiatives, including the
Fisheries Improvement Project66 and agreements on harmonized min-
imum terms and conditions of access and MCS, will be progressed, as
will engagement with other global initiatives.67 Joint actions in sup-
port of tariff preferences for Africa-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) and
small-island developing states will be further advanced through dia-
logue (for example, with the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) in the
Pacific Islands).68 Subject to feasibility studies, an online fish trading
hub could be envisaged for both fresh and frozen longline catches. Over
time this could be linked to guaranteed space and tariff rates for air and
sea containers, giving economies of scale for fresh-fish packing materi-
als. Further analysis of the banking arrangements related to the move-
ment of fish may uncover opportunities for financial services, savings on
exchange rates, and regional financial cooperation on tuna trade.

Costs and returns. The scenario envisages investment costs on the order
of US$35 million, mainly for longline vessels, cold storage, and chill fish
handling (Table 3.8). The benefits will accrue in several ways: (i) an
increase of more than 330 vessel calls per year and the corresponding
sale of services; (ii) an increase of up to 25,000 tons of fish landings; and
(iii) productivity gains from regional economic cooperation on tuna,
including by reducing the risk of tariff preference erosion and ecolabel-
ing of products. Annual sale of additional port and other services are esti-
mated at over US$16 million, and additional annual landings of fish at

67 For example, the Fisheries Industries Transparency Initiative, for which a

standard is under development.
68 A group of Pacific Islands countries (Nauru Group) operate a joint access

regime for purse seine vessels where a limited number of fishing days are
sold based on a combination of minimum prices, a bidding/auction scheme
and preferential allocation for vessels with economic links to the country, e.g.
delivering fish to processing plants, engaging local crew, registered in/paying
taxes in the country. Through joint efforts, certain high seas areas between their
EEZs have effectively been closed to fishing. The non-FAD skipjack purse seine
fishery has also achieved MSC certification giving premium prices to the fish.
Coordinated regional efforts can draw on these lessons to increase the value of
the region’s tuna fisheries.

                              jobs. Key assumptions include stability in tuna markets and fuel prices,
                              along with full engagement of the MPA, industry stakeholders, and other
                              actors in making Port Louis the fisheries port of choice in the region.

                              Summary of the Scenarios
                              So what do these four sub-sector scenarios add up to for the sector as
                              a whole? Table 3.9 summarizes the scenarios, providing a snapshot of
                              the existing economic characteristics of the scenario targets (baseline).
                              Two types of new investment are included: (i) the planned investments,
                              or those already under way (existing sector development plans); and
                              (ii) the investments and estimated results of the scenarios described
                              above. In addition to the actual (not-discounted) values, the values for
                              investments and revenues discounted at 5 percent are also presented.
                              Further quantitative details of the scenarios are provided in Appendix 1.
                                  The overall results show that private investment constitutes over
                              85 percent of the total investment, highlighting the need for a robust
                              investment climate, including measures to reduce risk for aquaculture
                              and Banks fishing. Public investment in the Banks fishery includes sub-
                              stantial private sector support for fishing technology development and
                              safety at sea, making up almost 50 percent of the public investment.
                              The coastal fisheries and ecosystem restoration scenario does not pro-
                              vide for private investments. However, the outcome of lagoon health
                              assessments may require hotels or households to invest in improved
                              waste water treatment, or cane farmers to review pest control practi-
                              ces. Aquaculture is seen as essentially private investment with public
                              support provided through existing channels and facilities. And public
                              investment in the Seafood Hub is considered to be catalytic in opening
                              opportunities for increased private investment.

   Another way to view these results is by looking at the measures of
scenario worth at both the economywide and the project level, as cal-
culated by the model. Benefit-cost (B/C) ratios are equivalent to invest-
ment present-value multipliers (present value of GDP increases divided
by present value of investment). The B/C ratios are larger for the econ-
omywide measures, except for aquaculture. This is probably because
aquaculture relies on private investment, imports significant factors of
production, and does not have a major public good component in the
form of infrastructure. However, according to the model, it would lead
to considerable job creation. Value added B/C ratios from economy-
wide spillover effects are estimated to be especially high for investment
in coastal ecosystem and lagoon rehabilitation, which has a high pub-
lic component. The Banks fishery and Seafood Hub also appear to gen-
erate comparatively high economy-wide benefits, probably due to pur-
chase of services and employment creation.
   As for production multiplier effects, they are moderate for the entire
fishery investment program and concentrated in the private service sec-
tor (Table 3.10). The multipliers for the non-service sectors are low,
because currently the fisheries do not have an extended value chain
relying predominantly on local production, even though development
of the scenarios should result in a richer set of domestic suppliers and
related linkages.
   The scenarios provide a quantitative basis for discussions on policy
and investment planning. The actual trajectory of each fishery or scen-
ario is particularly dependent on (i) implementation of policy decisions

      technologies (Banks fishery and aquaculture); and (iii) solidarity in
      stakeholder and regional collaboration (Seafood Hub).


      Making It Happen
      While the specific activities under each scenario are described above,
      a range of cross-cutting actions are required to “make it happen.” The
      relative importance of these measures is indicated in Table 3.11. For
      example, private sector finance is vital for the Banks fisheries and for
      aquaculture; public policy and support is fundamental to rehabilitation
      of the lagoons and the coastal fisheries; while an improved business
      climate underpins aquaculture investment.

      Strengthen Existing Governmental Plans
      Mauritius has already set out a vision for the OE (Prime Minister’s
      Office 2013). For each of the clusters, a detailed strategic plan is
      required, but much of the groundwork has already been laid. In the
      case of the fisheries, a fisheries and aquaculture master plan with
      fishery-by-fishery development and management plans will provide
      a working framework. Many fishery plans have already been drafted.
      These plans can be revised and updated through technical and stake-
      holder consultation, complemented by financing plans and key mile-
      stones. Within this planning framework the scenarios can be converted
      to investment projects following validation, prioritization, and adaption
      to the changing dynamics of the fisheries.

   When considered in the broader context of the OE, some investments
may straddle OE clusters, for example for support to small and medium-
size enterprises (SMEs) in applied marine research and in knowledge
management or human resource development. Segments of the scenar-
ios may be fast-tracked, such as environmentally sustainable marine lei-
sure, creation of formal tenure instruments for the vacant aquaculture
sites, or development of an ITQ scheme for the Banks fisheries.

Improve Implementation of Policies and Plans
Particular attention can be directed to the 2012 analysis by the Director
of Audit69 indicating a poor performance in the implementation of
fisheries sector plans. Some of this poor performance is attributable to
a lack of outcome tasking, public service inertia, and neglect of detailed
costing of and responsibility for activities and results. This can be
addressed through a public expenditure review and associated redirec-
tion of human, institutional, and financial resources to time-bound tar-
gets and outcomes, a breakup of silos and assignment of responsibilities
for outcomes, combined with an improved response to private sector
demand for services. Results-based tasking of budgets and staff will
ideally involve a substantial reform of the public service, its promo-
tion, bonus payment and staff evaluation processes. Within the public
service, outcome-directed tasking of staff and departments linked to
budget allocations, staff performance and the planning milestones will
mean re-tasking and re-training of some staff. A more structured means
of engaging the private sector in these processes will also be of value.

69 According to a June 2012 report from the Director of Audit, the plans,

which should include, among other things, projects to be undertaken, object-
ives of the projects, tasks to be performed, people assigned, milestones and
deliverables, must be prepared on a short-term basis, medium-term basis, and
long-term basis. (Director of Audit 2012).

      Develop Human Resources and Knowledge Management
      In the public domain, institutional strengthening and human resources
      development can drive productivity and investment. Specific institutional
      investments are embedded in the scenarios and focus on broader reforms
      and investments in policy development, human and institutional capacity,
      knowledge systems, and access to finance. At a technical level, upgraded
      and integrated information systems will facilitate economic analyses,
      tracking of ecosystem health, mapping of coastal ecosystems, and EEZ
      resources. At a policy level, the institutional architecture for MSP and inte-
      grated coastal zone planning will need transparent consultations and insti-
      tutionalized coordination between stakeholders. A review of legislation
      will need to resolve overlapping jurisdiction, particularly in the near-shore
      and foreshore areas. Networking between Mauritius’ leading educational
      institutions and collaborating international centers of excellence will help
      transfer technologies and skills relevant to the OE (Patil et al. 2016).
         Knowledge management requirements include substantial invest-
      ment in a fisheries information management system (FIMS). This would
      cover all the value chains described in the above scenarios, with par-
      ticular attention to the tuna fisheries and Mauritius’ international obli-
      gations with respect to tuna management. The MSP initiative will
      require a suite of additional databases and decision tools. These would
      be populated with oceanographic data, data on water quality, data on
      coral reef health, and calibration of the stresses on the reefs and lagoons.
      Information from numerous stakeholders will need to be integrated and
      selectively shared between research institutes, customs, the coast guard,
      the MPA, the tourist industry, the fishing associations, and companies
      and agencies active in the sector.

      Encourage More Private Investment
      This will require a more pro-active “Doing Business” climate, particu-
      larly for infant industries and higher-risk investments. Specific invest-
      ment guidelines can be built on lessons from Mauritius’ past experien-
      ces and by drawing on international best practices. Tasks will include,
      for example, assessment of Mauritius Development Bank (MDB) loans
      to fishers and analysis of the reasons why previous aquaculture invest-
      ment proposals failed to advance. In particular, aquaculture ideally
      requires a one-stop, fast-track approval process, with parallel rather than
      sequential processing (BOI 2016). This could involve a time-bound
      “no objections” process once the basic requirements (for example, EIA,
      stakeholder consultations, and zoning) are met, coupled with measures
      to grant long-term concessions with secure tenure. Investments will be
      needed to build skills at all levels, so that new employment opportun-
      ities are not simply filled by non-Mauritians.
                               Fisheries and Aquaculture and the Ocean Economy   135


   Financing, particularly for the relatively high-risk Banks and aqua-
culture scenarios, will require secure long-term concessions to pro-
vide “natural capital” and equity to leverage venture finance and secure
loans. Tax concessions are already in place. At the SME level, the design
of grant finance will need assessment of previous grant-financed invest-
ments, realistic cost-benefit analyses; training of fishers in basic finan-
cial management; awareness by loan officers of the seasonal nature of
fisheries risk and repayment; and advisory support for investors who
encounter difficulties. Fisheries administration staff will need to play an
active role, not only with regard to resource sustainability but also with
regard to the economic viability of the investments.

Make Public Policies and Expenditure More Effective
Outcome and performance-based assessment of recurrent public
finance will uncover savings that can be redirected. Similar analysis
of the public investment portfolio will identify savings through syner-
gies and scheduling. Dialogue with development partners on the OE
investment portfolio will leverage concessional loan and grant finance
at both regional and national levels. Policies supporting sustainable pri-
vate investment will help access impact investment finance to couple
economic and financial performance with social and environmental
outcomes and risk management.


Making It Last
How can Mauritius maintain a sustainable OE growth trajectory?
A renewed commitment to the ocean dimension of “Maurice Isle
Durable,” monitoring the performance of the OE, and regional cooper-
ation are among the key actions.

Promote Environmental Sustainability
Sustainability is a core value of the Mauritius Ocean Economy initia-
tive. Environmental and natural resource sustainability are embedded
in each of the scenarios and are fundamental principles of responsible
fisheries management and aquaculture development. The scientific
knowledge to secure environmental sustainability is readily available,
nationally, regionally, or through international centers of excellence.
Many of the instruments already exist in Mauritius: environmental
impact assessments (EIAs) and fisheries management plans. Others,
such as MSP and ridge-to-reef environmental plans, will be developed.
Benchmarking critical environmental and fisheries indicators will be a
cornerstone of a knowledge base for sustainability. A permanent scheme
to monitor these indictors, linked to regular national reports on the
136   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      state of the marine environment, will build public awareness and drive
      responses to current and emerging threats. In accordance with best
      aquaculture practices, strict precautionary carrying capacity limits will
      need to be established as part of the EIAs for the farm sites.
         Mauritius’ prominent international role in fisheries—notably in the
      Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the South West Indian Ocean
      Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC), and the Indian Ocean Commission
      (IOC)—will need to be continued and expanded. Similarly, Mauritius
      will continue to play a leading role in molding environmental actions
      through the Nairobi Convention and through the African Union, Small-
      Island Developing States, ACP and other fora.

      Strengthen Economic Performance
      Weaknesses in tracking the economic performance of the fisheries
      sector have constrained the current analysis. A more robust fisheries
      information management system will enable more comprehensive and
      accurate assessments. Reporting on the economic performance of fleet
      segments and the post-harvest activities will be part of such efforts.
      Weakening economic indicators often serve as early warnings as eco-
      nomic overfishing tends to occur in advance of biological overfishing.
      Maintaining fisheries at an MEY, or at least well above MSY levels, will
      avoid economic crises and ensuing environmental and social pressures
      and political demands.
         Making it last requires long-term political commitment to restoring
      the health of the marine coastal ecosystems. Some actions are likely to
      reduce the traditional economic opportunities of coastal fishing com-
      munities. Finding alternatives will require extended community dia-
      logue and support to design and apply a suite of remedies.
         Effective regional economic cooperation on tuna70, as has been done
      in the Pacific Islands,71 offers opportunities to add value to a large pro-
      portion of the region’s catch, which is currently exported in unpro-
      cessed form and competes with the processed products from Mauritius.
      Preservation of the EU tariff preferences will also be essential to the
      economic survival of the tuna processing. The private sector will benefit
      from public commitments to develop the Seafood Hub and related fish-
      eries infrastructure and fast-tracking of selected investments. Smaller
      businesses will benefit from a review of the performance of the fisheries



      70 The recent development of a SWIO regional framework agreement on eco-
      nomic cooperation on tuna and development of minimum terms and condi-
      tions of access is an important demonstration of this cooperation.

grant schemes and a technical and financial advice facility72 to address
difficulties in loan repayments.

Monitor Social Impacts
As with agriculture in middle income countries, as Mauritius moves
toward the future, employment in small-scale coastal fisheries will
decline. Given finite coastal fisheries resources and increasingly effi-
cient technologies, either the technology or the level of effort must be
constrained. The solution is to gradually exert control over all fishing
activities (commercial, “amateur” and recreational). The more efficient
solution is to restrict commercial fishing to licensed fishers and vessels
and establish clear tenure or fishing rights. Tenure can be vested in
individuals, cooperatives or associations to buffer potential exclusion of
some fishers.
   Mauritius has already begun to address some of the social issues in
the coastal fisheries by ‘buyout’ schemes for seine net fishing, grants to
move fishing offshore, and support for the FADs fishery and small-scale
aquaculture. These schemes require monitoring and assessment of per-
formance. Without additional investment in human resource develop-
ment, expansion of employment in the Banks fishery, in aquaculture, or
in the Seafood Hub may result in the import of foreign skilled labor.
Close consultation with the private sector can define the skills require-
ments and design apprenticeship and on-the-job training schemes.

Enhance Resilience to Climate Change
Climate change presents a very real threat to the Mauritius marine
ecosystems, the fisheries economy, and coastal livelihoods. All of the
four scenarios described here take account of potential climate change
impacts. The key is to establish economically viable sustainable fish-
eries, as these fisheries are more resilience to climate change, while
their economic viability enables adaptation, including development of
alternative economic opportunities. In particular, the coastal fisheries
and ecosystem scenario directly addresses the rebuilding of the reef and
lagoon ecosystem health, which provides the natural barriers to erosion
and significantly mitigates damage caused by cyclones. Additional dam-
age caused by extreme events resulting from the degradation of these
natural barriers has not been estimated in the scenario.
   Awareness of the pending loss of the coral reefs is low, and the
scale of this threat is significantly underestimated. Natural causes
beyond Mauritius’ control—in particular, ocean acidification and sea

72Existing schemes can have a specific focus on fisheries. See: https://www.
smeda.mu/.
138   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      temperature rise—will cause major loss of coral reefs over the next dec-
      ades. Reducing local stresses (pollution and fishing) will only slow this
      process, though this might allow time for the corals to adapt.
         The resilience of coastal fishing communities to climate change
      means that the fisheries must be more healthy and resilient, fish stocks
      need to recover, and fishing effort must be maintained at a level that
      provides incomes that keep pace with economic expectations. Mauritius
      will need to remain fully engaged in climate-related initiatives, includ-
      ing in climate finance and emerging opportunities (such as the poten-
      tial for “blue carbon” credits).

      Stay on Track
      Reports on the state of the OE, including stakeholder feedback, will
      be an important instrument in securing broad based political support.
      Regular assessments of the performance of cluster plans will help iden-
      tify and address constraints. Dissemination updates on the state of the
      marine environment will foster dialogue, invite external support, and
      establish Mauritius as a center of transparency and emerging excellence
      in marine knowledge.


      Recommendations
      In summary, Mauritius will need to move from a broad vision for
      the OE to defined metrics and appraisal of how existing institutional
      arrangements and public expenditures align with this vision in terms of
      delivering jobs and growth. Public policy can establish detailed plans
      with associated feasibility assessments and closely monitor perform-
      ance. Private sector growth will require an active search for investment
      finance and new investors with proven technical know-how, coupled
      with backstopping of the traditional Seafood Hub activities.
         A range of cross-cutting measures will be required to backstop sus-
      tainable investments, to ensure their economic viability and social inclu-
      sion, and to monitor the environmental health of Mauritius’ marine and
      coastal resources. These measures will include investment in human
      resources, in governance, and in catalytic public support for private sec-
      tor initiatives. A first step is to assess the effectiveness of existing public
      expenditures and policies. Analyses of priorities, synergies and sequen-
      cing in the investment portfolio can direct existing public resources more
      effectively. Retraining and re-tasking of less productive human resour-
      ces can also deliver public services more efficiently, particularly when
      reinforced with modern fisheries information management systems.
         Despite Mauritius’s favorable Doing Business rating, projects in the
      sector have been constrained by a difficult investment climate, for
                              Fisheries and Aquaculture and the Ocean Economy   139


example with respect to aquaculture permits. Offshore fishing and
aquaculture are perceived as high-risk ventures requiring substantial
capital and lacking conventional security. Large, small, and medium-size
investors will benefit from improved access to affordable financing and
schemes to reduce risks through more secure tenure.
   Enhanced regional cooperation and solidarity will be important to
maintain trade preferences, to capture a greater share of the sustain-
able benefits from the tuna resources, to enforce the tuna management
measures, and to maintain maritime security. Marine science and human
capacity building can benefit from strengthened regional cooperation
and knowledge sharing.
   At the national level, Mauritius can build political awareness and
support for adaptation and reduce the local stresses of overfishing,
agricultural pollution, and urban pollution. At the international level,
Mauritius can continue and enhance its efforts to mitigate climate
change through regional and global fora.73
   Table 3.12 illustrates shorter-term and longer-term recommended
actions, by scenario.

Human and Institutional Capital
At the institutional level, increased cooperation and policy coherence
can be ensured through MoUs between key actors to jointly implement
plans (for example, MOE, Coast Guard, Ministry of Environment,
the university, BOI, and private sector associations). The MoUs would
set out clear targets and specific commitments on funding, staffing,
regulatory, enforcement and other relevant actions. At a higher level,
constraints to OE development will benefit from periodic inter-minis-
terial reviews to improve the effectiveness of the physical planning and
investment. The establishment of an investment-focused geographic
information system (GIS) for planned public and private projects can
enable effective synergies, prioritization, sequencing of investments,
EIAs, and assessment of cumulative environmental and spatial stresses
in the coastal and marine areas.

Business Promotion
An improved business climate can be facilitated by an OE fisheries
business promotion facility, preferably building on existing arrange-
ments and designed through dialogue with Business Mauritius, BOI,
banks, and SME support services. The facility could: (i) review business

      performance and challenges, including performance of grant-financed
      fisheries (e.g. FAD fishery grants); (ii) identify financing and risk reduc-
      tion modalities, delivery of financial services, and fast-tracking of stra-
      tegic/priority investments; (iii) arrange specific assistance on selected
      investments, including to SMEs on technical and financial management
      of loans; (iv) leverage resources potentially available through the Africa
      Ocean Economy Platform, climate funds, impact investing and other
      sources; and (v) facilitate means to close skills gaps and replace foreign
      with Mauritian workers.

      Knowledge Platform
      A knowledge platform (key ministries, technical institutions and univer-
      sities) will ideally establish an OE monitoring and evaluation scheme
      and an economic performance monitoring unit (or regular process) to
      track OE investments. Key outputs would include: (i) regular reports on
      the state of the OE, based on the knowledge and monitoring scheme
      and formal stakeholder consultations (led by MOE and the Prime
      Minister’s office); (ii) raised public awareness of the OE opportunities
      and threats at all levels, including through the school curriculum, to
      fortify broad public consensus on development and management of
      the OE; (iii) enhanced ability to anticipate and respond to internal and
      external threats on a timely basis; and (iv) progressive improvement
      of natural capital accounting for oceans (Bureau of Statistics). The
      platform would contribute to and draw on regional and international
      organizations (for example, the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), the
      United Nations Division of Oceans and Law of the Sea (UNDOLOS),
      the United National Environment Programme (UNEP) and IOTC).

Key Messages
•	 The information, communications, and technology (ICT) sector now contributes 5.6 percent of national GDP,
   just under 10 percent of which is related in some way to the ocean economy (OE).
•	 ICT could play a much bigger role in transforming the Mauritian economy, but for that to happen there needs
   to be a well-thought-out strategy of stepped-up investments and progressive policy reforms.
•	 A capital investment of an additional US$150 million over a 10-year period could generate a benefit-cost ratio
   of 2.1 at the project level, with the ratio increasing to 3.6 when the full range of economywide effects is con-
   sidered. Plus, an estimated 3,500 jobs would be created.
•	 A top priority is boosting investment in submarine cables while rethinking their geopolitical orientations—that
   is, whether the focus should be regional (the current case) or global in ambition.
•	 Mauritius also needs to invest more in its domestic backbone network (including domestic fiber-optic capacity
   and the building of an Internet Exchange Point) to ensure greater connectivity—and explore new areas like
   hosting floating and underwater data centers.
•	 However, new investments must be backed by policy reforms, led by the ICT regulatory agency, to improve
   the sector’s competitiveness—ranging from privatizing the government’s majority share in Mauritius Telecom
   to encouraging measures (like local loop unbundling) to deliver high-speed internet services at an affordable
   price.

156   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last



      Introduction
      As Mauritius looks for ways to transition from being a middle-income
      to a high-income country, the information and communications tech-
      nology (ICT) sector and the OE stand out as two of the best hopes for
      future economic growth:
         In 2000, just before the arrival of the first submarine fiber-op-
      tic cable, Mauritius identified itself as a “cyber island” (International
      Telecommunication Union, 2004), and the ICT sector is now recog-
      nized as one of the pillars of the economy, after sugar, tourism, textiles,
      and financial services. In the 2016–17 budget speech, “moving towards
      a fully-fledged digital society” was recognized as one of the coun-
      try’s 10 key strategies for a new era of development. ICT contributed
      some 5.6 percent of national GDP in 2014, and the sector accounts for
      around 15,000 jobs, or 4 to 5 percent of the total workforce (Statistics
      Mauritius 2016).
         In its Roadmap of the Ocean Economy (Mauritius 2013), the gov-
      ernment developed a plan to significantly increase the size of the OE,
      which in 2012 contributed about 10.8 percent of GDP. This contribu-
      tion comes mainly from three sectors: coastal tourism and leisure, sea-
      port activities, and seafood-related activities. The Roadmap identified
      seven clusters as the focus for this expansion. Marine ICT contributes
      directly to the marine services cluster, and ICT contributes indirectly to
      all seven clusters.
         Thus, the interface between ICT and OE activities is critical for
      Mauritius’ economic trajectory. The big question is exactly how, and
      by how much, this sector can better contribute to diversification and
      competitiveness. This chapter tackles that question by exploring how
      ICTs play a growing part in the marine economy and then setting out
      the scope for an economic analysis of the potential of ICTs in the OE.
      It finds that the ICT sector holds great potential for reinvigorating the
      Mauritian economy and facilitating sustainable development. But to
      make that happen, there will need to be stepped-up investment (in sub-
      marine cables and the domestic backbone network) and greater explor-
      ation of new areas (like hosting floating and underwater data centers),
      accompanied by policy reforms that encourage greater competition and
      address the needs of end users.
         It should be borne in mind that this chapter does not discuss the
      ICT sector as a whole in Mauritius, only those aspects that are part of
      the OE. For example, although mobile communications are the big-
      gest component of the ICT sector, they are only discussed here inso-
      far as they are part of the OE (for instance, used by tourists on ocean
      liners).

Linkages Between ICT and the Ocean Economy
In what ways can the ICT sector be considered a part of the OE?
Certainly, the adoption of ICT in other OE activities can boost competi-
tiveness, whether through its adoption in industrial processes, such as
GPS tracking of fishing boats, or in services, such as ocean monitoring,
control and surveillance, “smart” port services, and ship registration.
However, in terms of contribution to GDP per capita, this is tiny by
comparison to the major drivers. Instead, ICT drives the OE in three
main ways, all based on investing in infrastructure directly in the ICT
sector and using Mauritius’ island location to generate revenue and
future growth (Table 4.1).
   The primary linkage is through the global network of undersea cables,
which provide the “first mile” of the internet to a majority of the world’s
population. Since the first undersea telegraph cables were laid in the
mid-1800s, the global network has expanded to cover virtually every
coastal nation, with constantly increasing capacity. Mauritius was an
early beneficiary when the Cable and Wireless Trans Indian Ocean cable
reached Mauritius Island (from Durban) and Rodrigues Island (from
Zanzibar) in 1901. The first fiber-optic cable (SAFE) arrived in 2002,
and a second landing came in 2009 (LION), although these cables are
now limited by capacity and competitive constraints. Two further cables
are planned, and Mauritius is open to further investment, but there is
perhaps a need for greater ambition.
   A second potentially important linkage comes from the use of off-
shore data centers. Several companies already have data centers on
oceangoing ships, such as the Google Barges,1 and now Microsoft has
gone a step further by experimenting in Project Natick2 with an under-
sea data center, working at a depth of 30 meters in trials. The logic is to
reduce costs for space rental and cooling, both of which make up a sig-
nificant part of the budget for a data center. Mauritius, with its abun-
dance of cold, deep water close to shore, is an obvious candidate to host
such floating and underwater datacenters.
   Thirdly, cellular mobile services, which constitute the largest seg-
ment of the ICT sector worldwide, can be extended offshore to pro-
vide services to mariners, mainly leisure users but also coastal fisheries.
Mauritius’s success in being one of the first countries in Africa to com-
plete the digital switchover from analogue TV broadcasting has released
a large swathe of valuable spectrum (below 1 GHz), much of which is

ICT Applications in the Ocean Economy
Although the ICT sector is relatively important to Mauritius in its own
right, its major significance lies in its role in enabling innovative applica-
tions and productivity in the rest of the economy. In the context of this
book, there are a number of different ways in which the major segments
of the OE—principally tourism and leisure, port services, and seafood
and fisheries—are becoming more intensive in their ICT use, which
may be seen as a downstream use. This is particularly relevant for devel-
oping the OE’s dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model.
   These downstream ICT applications can be split into two types of
innovation activities: (i) ICT adoption in industrial processes (such
as GPS tracking of fishing boats and use of internet for hotel book-
ing); and (ii) ICT adoption in services (such as ocean monitoring, con-
trol, and surveillance; “smart” port services; ship registration; and inter-
net services in hotel rooms). As shown in Table 4.2, specific technol-
ogies may be involved—for example, digital services, analytics and big
data,3 apps, content and mobility, cloud services, financial technology
(fintech),4 and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).5 This will require
short-term investment (the construction period), but it should produce
a medium- and longer-term impact, with these technologies gradually
substituting for the traditional technologies, facilitating OE expansion,
and increasing the overall productivity of the economic system. Over
time, all of these activities are likely to become more information-in-
tensive, thereby displacing labor (for example, self-steering boats, which
are a logical extension of self-driving cars).

Submarine Cables Serving Mauritius
The 2016 World Development Report,6 demonstrates how digital tech-
nologies underlie the competitiveness of modern economies, with ICTs
being significant not only as an important sector in their own right
but also as an important factor in productivity growth in the rest of
the economy. The analysis in the report shows the benefits of having
a coastline for access to fiber-optic submarine cables. For Africa, the
average price per megabit per second (Mbit/s) of bandwidth per month
is more than US$200 cheaper in coastal countries than in landlocked

                                                          Mauritius and the Indian Ocean region would manage a large amount

                        countries. Mauritius is currently served by two undersea cables: the
                        South Africa-Far East (or SAFE) cable and the Lower Indian Ocean
                        Network (LION-1) cable (Map 4.1), and it hosts many meetings of
                        international cable consortia, notably Seacom and Liquid Telecom. But
                        the existing cables suffer from drawbacks and constraints, hampering
                        Mauritius’s ability to fulfill its true potential either as an international
                        connectivity hub for the southern Indian Ocean or as an exporter of
                        ICT-based services, such as in business process outsourcing (BPO).

                        SAFE cable. This was one of the first fiber-optic networks to serve
                        Africa when it was launched in April 2002. It joins South Africa with
                        the SAT-3 cable, of the same vintage, that links to West Africa and
                        Europe. It is a “club cable”—that is, owned by a consortium of some 30
                        telecom operators, of which Mauritius Telecom, is one—but it is not an
                        “open access” cable, in the sense that capacity can only be sold through
                        its members, which restricts scope for price competition. Furthermore,
                        it represents the technology of its day, carrying only two “lit” (that is,
                        usable) fiber pairs with a maximum capacity of 440 Gbit/s. It cannot
                        easily be upgraded, and it is approaching the end of its expected life-
                        span. By contrast, a modern cable, like AEC (in service since January

                                              is believed that the available capacity on SAFE is close to exhaustion.

                                              LION-1 cable. This is a more recent cable (in service since November
                                              2009) with a much greater potential capacity, 1,280 Gbit/s, although as

                                              purchased capacity on LION-1, the terms of its license prevent it from
               Information, Communications, and Technology in the Ocean Economy   163


increasing that capacity. Thus, although EMTEL was interested in pur-
chasing capacity on the World Bank-financed FLY/LION-3, which
would have given it a direct link via Mayotte to the Eastern Africa
Submarine Cable System (EASSy) in Moroni, it decided not to do so
because it would have been unable to upgrade its capacity on LION-1
and LION-2. Thus LION-1 is not a true open-access cable and brings
very little price competition to Mauritius.
   As for internet bandwidth, Mauritius ranks third in Sub-Saharan
Africa (after Ghana and Malawi) for having the lowest prices (Map
4.2). However, its US$26.09 per Mbit/s monthly price is still much
higher than international competitors for OE activities, especially when
expressed in terms of purchasing power parities (US$46.77). By con-
trast, economies such as Hong Kong (a shipping and port competi-
tor) offer rates as low as US$1.06 per Mbit/s per month and Bahamas
(a tourism competitor) offer rates of US$3.92—while even Vietnam
(a fisheries and seafood competitor) is able to offer rates at around
US$26.06 per month, or just over half the price of Mauritius. Although
wholesale prices have come down since the liberalization of open access
to international landing stations in Mauritius in 2013 (Kelly, Minges and
Donovan 2013), other constraints to competition are preventing further
price reductions (notably, the monopolistic practices of Orange).
   Mauritius’ lit international bandwidth has grown at a reasonable
rate, from around 7 Gbit/s in 2011 to more than 40 Gbit/s in 2015
(Figure 4.1). But the rate of growth is slowing, from a peak of over 200
percent in 2010 to around 25 percent in 2015. Of course, a reduction
in the rate of growth is to be expected as the base grows in scale, but
the precipitous slowdown in the rate of price reductions in the case of
Mauritius suggests that capacity is constrained.
   One way to “test” the hypothesis of constrained growth is through
benchmarking with other countries, especially those that may be con-
sidered direct competitors, in the region and in the BPO market.
Table 4.3 shows how Mauritius compares with Kenya, India, and South
Africa. At first view, the picture looks bright for Mauritius, as its 41
Gbit/s of lit international bandwidth gives it the highest level of band-
width per capita in the list—three times higher than South Africa, six
times higher than Kenya, and more than 10 times higher than India.
However, its average speeds (as measured by user experience) are lower
than in Kenya or South Africa, and only barely higher than in India.
   By dividing each country’s average speed by its bandwidth per person
(and dividing by 1,000) it is possible to get an aggregate measure of com-
petitive efficiency, or the country’s ability to convert additional inter-
national bandwidth into higher user speeds and therefore improved user
experience. This exercise shows that Mauritius’ competitive efficiency

                            index, at just 0.17, is the lowest in the country group. What then is going
                            on? There are a number of possible explanations, but the most likely one
                            is that consumers in Mauritius are choosing broadband packages with
                            lower speeds than in the other countries, either because the prices are
                            too high or because higher speeds are simply not available.
                               The liberalization of the market for international bandwidth in 2013
                            has proved beneficial for the Mauritius market in terms of price com-
                            petition. It allowed owners of spare capacity on the SAFE cable, notably
                            Belgacom, to market bandwidth to those mobile operators and internet
                            service providers (ISPs) in Mauritius that are not aligned with Orange.
                            Plus, the price of a gigabit (Gb) per month of mobile data, which was
                            US$20.82 in October 2011, had dropped to US$9.97 by mid-2015 (or
                            US$17.88 in purchasing power parity terms). But the liberalization had
                            no effect on the LION cable, since that is monopolized by Orange, and
                            the beneficial effects were somewhat mitigated by the lack of scope for
                            expansion on SAFE, along with its high initial construction costs.

Offshore Data Storage
A second potentially significant area of overlap between the ICT sector
and the OE comes with the development of Mauritius as a hub for
offshore data storage. Its geographical position, midway between Asia
and Africa, as well as its neutral status and favorable regime for data
protection, means that it is in a good position to do this. Mauritius has
already been successful in developing its BPO capabilities, facilitated by
ICT (ICT/BPO) through investments in infrastructure, intelligence, and
innovation. With some 700 ICT/BPO-based enterprises, the country
appears to offer the promise of becoming one of the richest technology
ecosystems in Africa that thrives on innovation and collaboration across
sectors.7 The move into offering commercial offshore data storage is a
logical extension of this.
   Of particular interest is the emergence of deep ocean water applica-
tions (DOWAs) that have particular relevance for data storage. The first
of these proposes the use of floating data centers, which both generate
renewable electricity (from wave and wind power) and provide cool-
ing by drawing on deep ocean water. Google has applied for a patent
for this technology and has reportedly experimented with tethered bar-
ges on the West Coast of the United States. The second goes one step


7 According to the Mauritius Board of Investment, global players such as
Accenture, Ceridian, Huawei, Orange Business Services, and Infosys, amongst
others, have established their operations in Mauritius. The sector has developed
distinctive strengths in Telecoms, BFSI, IT application development, as well as
maintenance support. Business opportunities exist in the following segments,
among others: BPO voice—call centers; BPO nonvoice—back office; payroll,
finance, and accounting outsourcing; legal process outsourcing; information
technology outsourcing; software development; mobile apps development; web
development; e-commerce; multimedia; IT services—data centers; disaster recov-
ery (for data center resilience); training and consultancy for data centers; digital
content for e-commerce and e-payment; digital content production; applications
for e-learning and online training systems; animation; and mobile games.
166   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      further by putting the data underwater, where it is less vulnerable to
      intrusion and has easier access to cold water for cooling. Microsoft has
      successfully piloted the use of underwater data storage in a self-con-
      tained module that carried out data processing and storage functions at
      a depth of around 30 meters off the coast of Seattle.
         For the ICT sector, the development of “green data centers” is some-
      thing of a holy grail, to offset the industry’s “bad boy” image as a con-
      tributor to global warming rather than a solution. Already ICT contrib-
      utes around 3 percent of global greenhouses gas emissions, due to elec-
      tricity consumption, and this is projected to get worse as the world
      shifts toward ever more powerful broadband networks and always-on
      devices (Adolph and Kelly 2008). Data centers are a particularly egre-
      gious contributor to global warming. In the United States, they con-
      sume the energy output equivalent to 35 coal-burning power stations,
      with usage split more or less evenly between running the computers
      and cooling them down. As networks become faster and more reliable,
      the actual location of data becomes largely irrelevant, and already data
      center owners have been gravitating toward low-cost renewable energy
      locations (such as next to hydro-power plants) or in cool locations (such
      as Iceland).
         Modern data centers require minimal, if any, human intervention,
      so the next logical step is to move them to the oceans. This has the
      added advantage that space rental can be effectively free. But the big-
      gest advantage of all could be that putting data under the ocean takes
      it away from prying eyes, whether it be industrial espionage or more
      likely from government surveillance. In the same way that pirate radio
      stations in the 1960s, like Radio Caroline, took to the high seas to
      evade legal jurisdiction, some data owners may also prefer to take their
      data offshore to avoid possible future exposure to lawsuits. Examples
      include blockchain technologies, like bitcoin, which currently operate
      in a legal gray zone in many countries, or content delivery services, like
      The Pirate’s Bay, which may lead to allegations of intellectual property
      infringement. Beyond that, and for services that have hitherto been fully
      legal—such as the harvesting of personal data and purchasing habits
      from social media and eCommerce sites—there may be an incentive to
      seek out legal regimes that are more liberal on privacy and data protec-
      tion. Thus, to misquote Jules Verne, “20,000 Terrabytes under the sea”
      is not such a far-fetched vision.

      Offshore Cellular Radio
      A third type of infrastructure investment that Mauritius should con-
      sider would be extending cellular services to cover coastal waters.
      Already, radio antennae that serve inland areas close to the coast overlap
               Information, Communications, and Technology in the Ocean Economy   167


with maritime zones, which is particularly useful for docks and ports.
But until now, there has not been a deliberate attempt to extend cover-
age further, largely due to insufficient demand and a lack of alternative
technologies (such as ship-to-shore HF radio, or satellite) for most
commercial ships for their communication needs. But these technol-
ogies are expensive and do not necessarily provide the high capacity
bandwidth to support data. Rather, they are optimized for safety-of-life
and navigation services that use minimal bandwidth. However, modern
oceangoing ships (like cruise liners) are increasingly data- intensive, and
there is considerable scope for extending land-based technologies (like
mobile phones and tablets) for use at sea.
   With the release of digital dividends spectrum (below 1 GHz), there
is scope for a concerted effort to provide coverage up to a range of
about 50 miles from shore. This would encompass the needs of most
leisure-based maritime users, as well as cruise liners and big game fish-
ing boats. These are exactly the sort of users that Mauritius is trying
to attract through its OE program, specifically the marine-based tour-
ism and leisure cluster. Although there is no viable market yet for off-
shore internet and entertainment services, it behooves Mauritius to plan
ahead if it wishes to grow this segment of the market. Furthermore,
in addition to commercial use, offshore cellular mobile can be used
to assure safety-of-life services to “amateur” marine tourists (such as
sea kayakers, sea-karters, wind and kite surfers, and big game anglers).
Licenses for big game anglers were projected to increase from 76 in
2013 to 120 in 2015.
   The most likely users of offshore cellular mobile services are pas-
sengers on cruise liners. With the planned construction of a cruise liner
terminal, and the medium term target of 50,000 passengers per year,
the potential market for offshore cellular services could become highly
profitable—especially given a likely increase in passengers from the Far
East who might be reluctant to travel without guaranteed access to high
speed internet.


Three Development Scenarios: Description
In line with the general approach adopted for other OE sectors in the
book, we envision three possible scenarios—business as usual, conserva-
tive, and optimistic—for use in modelling the CGE model for Mauritius.
The two key factors that distinguish these scenarios are:

•   The degree of investment in first-mile technologies, particularly
    submarine cables, and the geopolitical orientation of the cables
    (regional or global); and

the indicator fall, as under the business-as-usual scenario. On the other
hand, under an optimistic scenario, a sustained commitment to invest in
new cables, leveraging primarily private-sector funds with a modicum
of public sector seed money, together with progressive policy reforms,
could see the indicator rise, toward 10 percent—around the kind of lev-
els enjoyed by Estonia and Ireland—and perhaps even as high as the
16 percent achieved by Israel. Tables 4.4 and 4.5 lay out a comparative
analysis of the advantages and likely outcomes for major ICT develop-
ments under these three alternative scenarios, as well as the investment
assumptions required under each.

Development Scenarios: A Computable General Equilibrium
Analysis
Focusing on the optimistic scenario, as Table 4.7 shows, the key results
of the computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis indicate a much
higher impact of the ICT investment in terms of economywide effects
than for project-specific returns (a benefit/cost ratio of almost 3.6
instead of 2). This is due to several reasons:

•   The ICT projects all include public good components in the form of
    infrastructure that can be shared by virtually all sectors and economic
    agents (e.g., the submarine cables);

Note: Results of the simulation are still preliminary, but they do show that the economywide impact of the investment becomes closer to the
project-specific impact, if the model simulations are run under the hypothesis of skilled labor shortages—which can also be interpreted as equiva-
lent to investment costs in human capital not explicitly considered in the ICT projects. (a) Job creation is defined as the number of labor income
streams that would support a worker for 20 years. (b) The simulation of this scenario is based on the hypothesis that the elasticity of supply of
workers with more than secondary and with tertiary education are, respectively, 1 percent and 0.1 percent in the short term, so that either an
important increase in the education budget will have to be undertaken or a substantial amount of skilled labor will have to be imported (or both).

Making It Happen
It has been seven years since the last cable investment in Mauritius,
which is an eternity in the fast-moving ICT world, although two other
cables have been in the planning stages for many years and recently
were endorsed in the 2016–17 budget speech.

“Rodrigues” cable
This “third” cable, in which the African Development Bank and the
European Investment Bank were at one time interested in investing,8
is now expected to cover its costs from the Universal service
fund—largely funded from a tax on incoming international calls and
revenue from international mobile roaming. A market-sounding call
for expressions of interest was issued by the government in November
2015 for a “third international gateway” to link Mauritius Island with
Rodrigues,9 a dependency of 40,000 people around 600 kilometers to
the east of Mauritius Island. In the 2016–17 budget speech (para 146),
it was announced that Mauritius Telecom will undertake the project.
The government commitment will take the form of a guaranteed pur-
chase of bandwidth by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly over a 10-year

      indefeasible right of use. However, the fact that, in the same budget
      speech, the government announced an upgrade in satellite capacity
      from 200 to 500 Mbit/s by 2018 (para 286) suggests that it does not
      expect the cable to be completed soon.
          Why the delay? One reason is that Mauritius Telecom apparently
      wants to extend the cable from Rodrigues to link with a branching unit
      on the SEACOM cable, off the coast of East Africa. This may make
      sense commercially, because it would provide Mauritius Telecom (and
      Rodrigues) with redundancy and an alternative international exit. But
      looking at a map, one sees that Rodrigues and the SEACOM cable
      are in completely different directions. Furthermore, the distance from
      Rodrigues to the SEACOM branching unit would more than double the
      length (and therefore the cost) of the cable. Mauritius Telecom says it
      is seeking other partners to cofinance the cable. This may be an attempt
      by the telecom to kill the Rodrigues cable project (by slowing it down
      or making it too expensive), or else the telecom may be using the guar-
      anteed government subsidy plus Universal Service Funds to cross-sub-
      sidize a cable from the Mauritian mainland to SEACOM that it was
      planning to do anyway.

      Regional MeTISS Cable
      The MeTISS (Melting Pot Indianoceanic Submarine System) cable,
      which was proposed by the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), is likely
      to stretch from Mauritius Island to Reunion and Madagascar, and then
      onwards to South Africa. So far, the consortium of companies that
      have signed up include Emtel, the second Mauritian mobile operator;
      Telma, the incumbent operator from Madagascar; Altice and Canal +
      Telecom (from Reunion); and ISPs Blueline (Madagascar) and Zeop
      (Reunion). The main issue is the absence of Mauritius Telecom and
      any other Orange partners. This seems to have been a deliberate policy
      on behalf of the consultant hired by IOC to avoid domination of the
      consortium by Orange. The IOC claims to have secured some funding
      from the EU and African Development Bank, and states that the cable
      will cost around 75 million euros and should be completed by 2018.
      However, details such as the shares among the different members, or
      where MeTISS will interface with other cables in the region (and where
      it would land in South Africa), are hazy.

      A More Ambitious Cable Expansion Program
      Both the Rodrigues and the MeTISS cable are limited in their ambition,
      and both might be described as “socially driven” and regional rather
      than “commercially driven” and global cables. Specifically, they propose
      to link relatively small populations together, none of which are major
               Information, Communications, and Technology in the Ocean Economy   173


sources of internet content. For construction, both are drawing upon
subsidized sources of funding—in the case of Rodrigues, the Universal
Service Fund, and in the case of MeTISS, the EU 11th European
Development Funds (FED) program. But there is no guarantee of cov-
ering their operations and maintenance costs. In the event of multiple
cable cuts, which are quite common in the region, it is uncertain that
the owners would be willing to cover the cost of repairs. In the case of
Rodrigues, the local population is unlikely to benefit unless there is a
parallel investment in local terrestrial infrastructure.
   A further reason for skepticism is that both projects have been on
the books in one form or another for several years. An initial study for
the Rodrigues cable was carried out in 2012, and a feasibility study
was done in 2015, while the origins of IOC’s plans for MeTISS lie in
SEGAcom, a proposal for a regional network that dates from 2009.
Given that neither cable currently has either an identified cable con-
structor or a construction and maintenance agreement signed between
operators, it is unlikely that either will proceed quickly. As a general
rule of thumb, there are at least five cables on paper for each fiber-optic
cable constructed. Furthermore, such “paper cables” damage the viabil-
ity of cables with real funding behind them, such as the World Bank
financed FLY-LION3, because they create a climate of uncertainty and
doubt.
   Nevertheless, the most serious problem with the two proposed cables
is that they lack ambition. Neither cable is likely to have a significant
impact on reducing prices or stimulating economic growth, and both
are unlikely to significantly improve the level of quality of service. A
more ambitious cable project would need to meet a number of criteria:
   A new cable needs to look further east (to Asia), and north (to the
Gulf and Europe), not solely within the Indian Ocean region. That is
“where the data is”—in the sense of sources of content, both local gener-
ated (especially in India, where Bollywood films are very popular), and
cached (from the United States). Asia is also where future growth, espe-
cially tourism, will come from, given its large population mass.
   A new cable needs to break away from the control of a single propri-
ety player (Orange) or a club of network operators (SAFE) and instead
be an open-access cable, from which any company can purchase cap-
acity. In that sense, a cable funded by investors that do not have a direct
stake in the market, or by content owners (such as Google or Facebook),
would be ideal.
   A new cable would need to be self-sustaining and not funded by
one-time donor funds that cannot sustain the risks of future cable cuts.
Again, this would favor an eastward-looking investment cable, based on
a sound business plan, rather than a socially driven regional cable.
174   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


         Since the liberalization of the landing station market in Mauritius,
      the country is officially open for business and would welcome the
      arrival of cable proposals, irrespective of their source. There are a num-
      ber of potentially interesting cable plans that look westwards and north-
      wards. Following are three of them.

      Australia West Express (AWE) cable. This would link Perth in Western
      Australia with Djibouti, and from there onwards to Europe.10 AWE
      could elicit interest from the U.S. military and may land in Diego
      Garcia. Even if AWE does not land directly in Mauritius, if a branching
      unit could be added, then a spur from a future Rodrigues cable could
      be of commercial interest.

      BRICS cable. This is a potentially more interesting cable that would
      link the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa),
      which are industrial powerhouses. The projected route would see it pass
      through (or at least very near) Mauritius, making it a logical replace-
      ment (or upgrade) for SAFE (Map 4.3). The initiative for the BRICS
      cable came after the Edward Snowden affair, when it was revealed that
      U.S. state intelligence was listening in to all traffic that passed through
      U.S. territory. Brazil, for instance, has initiated cable links directly to
      Europe and Africa to bypass the United States.11 But even without this
      motivation, the BRICS cable makes a lot of commercial sense and fits
      well with the desire of the BRICS nations for closer economic and pol-
      itical integration. It is planned to be 34,000 kilometers in length, with
      12 terrabits per second (Tbit/s) capacity (that is, 300 times greater than
      SAFE) and would interconnect with the SEACOM, EASSy, WACS, and
      SAFE cables, among others. It would make an ideal funding vehicle for
      entities like the newly established Asian Infrastructure Bank. Because
      of Mauritius’ midway position and its neutral status among the BRICS
      economies, it would be in an ideal position to make this happen.

      Mauritius IOC cable.12 A Mauritius IOC cable has been proposed by a
      SEACOM spinoff, which suggests a new cable from Mauritius to India.
      What distinguishes this proposal is that it would be an open access “car-
      riers’ carrier” cable, not a “club” cable, in which owners are also users.
      This holds the prospect of lower prices and more competition.

Greater Domestic Connectivity
A significant increase in Mauritius’s international submarine fiber-op-
tic capacity is fully justified and fits well with the future plans for
the OE. But it only makes sense if twinned with parallel investment
in Mauritius’s domestic backbone network, so that the advantages in
terms of cheaper and faster international bandwidth actually reach
the customer. To do this would require both fresh investment and
policy reform. It is useful to consider the OE aspect of the investment
as equivalent to the first mile in a chain for which policy reforms are
required at each stage (Figure 4.2). While this book focuses on the
first-mile investments in increased submarine capacity that are needed
to achieve true digital dividends (World Bank 2016), it is also necessary
for Mauritius to address policy reforms in the “middle mile,” where the
internet passes through the country, in the “last mile,” which delivers
the internet directly to end users, and in the “invisible mile,” which
addresses policy bottlenecks in the less visible parts of the network,
such as the spectrum of cybersecurity.
   As a general-purpose technology, ICT can enhance the productivity
of many sectors, and especially some of those related to fostering and
expanding the scope for OE innovation. But being a general-purpose

      technology also means ICT’s diffusion through existing and new final
      and intermediate products may require costly infrastructural changes,
      such as laying new submarine cables. This is because new forms of pro-
      ductive capacity will have to be created in terms of physical, human, and
      social capital. At the middle-mile level, policy initiatives that would help
      in converting first mile investments into last-mile gains would include a
      series of investments, policy changes, and other actions, described next.

      Increasing the Level of Investment in Domestic Fiber-Optic
      Capacity
      Plans are afoot to increase investment in domestic fiber-optic cap-
      acity, as reflected in the budget speech commitment to accelerate the
      deployment of fiber-to-the-home technology to reach every town and
      village by December 2017 (Mauritius 2016, para 146 iii). Significantly,
      the budget speech makes a commitment that this should be done spe-
               Information, Communications, and Technology in the Ocean Economy   177


cifically by Mauritius Telecom, to the neglect of other market players,
such as Bharat Telecom, Emtel, or the Central Electricity Board (CEB),
suggesting a lack of neutrality in the government’s position.

Encouraging the Usage of Alternative Infrastructure
The issue here is the proposed market entry of the CEB, a state-owned
electricity generation and distribution entity. CEB already possesses a
fiber-optic network running alongside its electricity distribution net-
work, which it uses for its own network management purposes. The
government has committed (again in the 2016–17 budget speech), to
spending an additional MUR 200 million to extend the CEB network to
ISPs (Mauritius 2016, para 146 iv). It should be relatively simple to sell
spare capacity on this network to the commercial market, most likely to
wholesale bandwidth providers competing against Mauritius Telecom
(such as Emtel or Bharat Telecom), as well as to ISPs. This would make
a second route available for interconnection between the cable landing
stations for SAFE and the future Rodrigues cable (Baie Jacotet) and
LION (Terre Rouge), currently monopolized by Mauritius Telecom.
The technology to make use of the network for electricity generation,
known as Optical Fibre Ground Wire, is now being used by some elec-
tricity distributors in Africa to enter the telecom market (such as Eskom
in Malawi, in partnership with Huawei, an equipment manufacturer).

Enforcing Open Access Rules for Backbone Capacity
For the moment, when competing telecom infrastructure providers
wish to make use of Mauritius Telecom’s network, they must purchase
it at the same retail price as any other customer. That means that to
compete effectively with Mauritius Telecom, they are obliged to con-
struct their own parallel infrastructures, which is both costly and time
consuming. The government should consider enforcing open-access
rules on Mauritius Telecom’s network to allow competitors to purchase
capacity (in the form of leased lines that can be connected at one or
both ends, or IRUs) from Mauritius Telecom at retail rates. This will
allow competitive infrastructure providers to make a rational build-or-
buy decision. The same principles could be applied to the CEB network,
given that both the CEB and Mauritius Telecom networks were con-
structed with a high degree of state involvement.

Empowering the Internet Exchange Point (IXP)
This would be an important step toward ensuring competition in the
middle mile, and reducing costs, particularly for second-tier operators,
as it would facilitate local peering and exchange of traffic. Mauritius has
had an Internet exchange point (IXP) for a number of years, but there
178   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      is scope for formalizing the management structure of the IXP to ensure
      that no single operator becomes dominant.

      Privatizing the Remaining Government Shareholding in Mauritius
      Telecom
      There have been recent moves to reduce the government’s sharehold-
      ing from 60 percent to closer to 50 percent, while still retaining a
      controlling share. Retaining a significant government shareholding in
      Mauritius Telecom is both unnecessary and market-distorting. Emtel
      has complained, with some justification, that the government favors
      Mauritius Telecom in its award of contracts and in its regulatory deci-
      sions. The budget speech statements on FTTH and the Rodrigues cable,
      which specifically mention the Mauritius Telecom role, tend to confirm
      this. Even if the government is not ready to reduce its shareholding in
      Mauritius Telecom, it should announce its policy and perhaps a time-
      table for review to provide greater certainty to the private sector.

      Investing in Data Storage
      Mauritius is particularly well positioned to benefit from DOWA tech-
      nologies, and DOWA is identified as one of seven clusters in the govern-
      ment’s Roadmap of the Ocean Economy. The sea around Mauritius falls
      to a temperature of around 5 C at a depth of 1,000 meters, although
      it is not necessary to go so deep to derive benefits. Potential DOWA
      applications include aquaculture, thalassotherapy, and manufacture of
      pharmaceuticals, but it is the use of deep ocean water for cooling that
      is of most interest here. Mauritius has licensed two zones for DOWA
      applications, around Port-Louis where there is a pilot program for urban
      cooling, and around Mahebourg, close to the airport, where is it planned
      to develop cooling applications for data centers. Indeed, Mauritius has
      the capacity to become a market leader in this field.

      Developing Marine Apps
      Mauritius could potentially host a thematic mobile application lab
      aimed at developing a center of excellence in the marine ICT field. As
      a similar example, Tanzania has developed a “flying labs” tech hub for
      drone apps. Marine apps could be developed for various types of usage
      including navigation, shipping, early warnings, or ports.


      Making It Last
      The next step is to tackle the last mile and the invisible mile. For
      Mauritius, like most low- and middle-income countries, the primary
      network for reaching the customer is the mobile network. The country
               Information, Communications, and Technology in the Ocean Economy   179


is fortunate to have a competitive mobile sector, with market share div-
ided between Mauritius Telecom (just over 50 percent), Emtel (around
35 percent), and MTML (which has risen recently to 15 percent). All
three mobile carriers now offer 4G LTE services, as well as older 2G
and 3G coverage. But there is scope for encouraging further last-mile
competition, for instance by pursuing the following approaches.

Encouraging Market Entry by Mobile Virtual Network Operators
Mobile virtual network operators resell mobile capacity and add value
by targeting specific services (such as mobile money) or market seg-
ments (such as maritime users). Encouraging them may require a more
flexible approach to spectrum management, such as by allowing sec-
ondary spectrum trading and resale.

Facilitating the Use of Alternative Technologies
Recently, a raft of new technologies have become available that may be par-
ticularly appropriate for thinly populated rural areas or Mauritius’s outer
islands. These include WiMAX, broadband wireless access, line-of-sight
technologies, nanosats (very small satellites in near-earth orbit), balloons
(such as Google’s Project Loon), and drones. Facebook, for instance, is
experimenting with the use of solar-powered drones that can stay aloft for
months at a time and provide wide area coverage of high-capacity internet
service. ICTA, the Mauritius ICT regulatory agency, should take a pro-
active approach to licensing the use of alternative last-mile technologies.

Encouraging Local Loop Unbundling (LLU)
Ultimately, to deliver high speed internet services at an affordable price
direct to end users may require a fixed line rather than a mobile net-
work. The preferred approach to ensuring last-mile broadband connec-
tivity in most of the world is through LLU. This obliges the incumbent
to offer capacity to competitors at a wholesale price, by renting them
the use of the copper that links the customer to the local exchange at a
price which is below retail prices. As part of such deals, the incumbent
operator must publish a reference interconnect offer, which is available
to other licensed operators. LLU would bring greater price competition
into the local-access market and is a long overdue policy step.

Addressing the Demand Side of the Local Access Market
The 2016–17 budget speech includes a number of measures to address
the demand side of the local access market, including a commitment to
create an additional 250 public WiFi hotspots to bring the total to 600
(Mauritius 2016, para 144) and to promote greater digital literacy (para
145)—for example, by distributing tablets to students in grades 1 and 2.
180   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


         Finally, Mauritius must also remove bottlenecks in the invisible mile,
      which may be delaying the development of a more level competitive
      playing field.

      Liberalizing Spectrum Management
      Spectrum management could be liberalized through systematic use of
      market mechanisms (such as auctions) for spectrum assignment. The facili-
      tation of spectrum trading and resale would help to promote innovative
      new uses of spectrum, especially in niche segments, such as marine ICT.

      Allocating Digital Dividend Spectrum
      An early engagement in allocation of the “digital dividend” spectrum,
      released through the analogue TV switchoff, would be welcome, as
      would an early start to the allocation process for the 5G mobile spec-
      trum. This would provide more certainty for investors. It is expected
      that 5G spectrum would be particularly appropriate for IoT applica-
      tions, which could include many technologies relevant to the OE, such
      as 15-sensor networks for environmental monitoring or telemetry net-
      works for offshore meteorological networks.

      Protecting Data and Users
      There is a growing need for the development of regulations regarding
      data protection, cybersecurity, privacy, legal intercept, and the use of big
      data. These are particularly relevant if Mauritius wishes to position itself
      as a hub for offshore data storage. If Mauritius wants to position itself as a
      global leader in this area, it must first become a global leader in the enabling
      environment for cybersecurity, data protection, and the use of big data.

      Recommendations
      In terms of policy, recommendations focus on reforms to infrastructure
      policy and to data privacy, protection, and cybersecurity (Table 4.9).
      Mauritius should position itself as a best- practice country in terms of
      telecom policy, and this needs attention to issues such as alternative
      infrastructures, unbundling the local loop, and paying more attention
      to cybersecurity.
         In terms of investment, the Government of Mauritius may need to
      play a more active role in shaping future undersea cable initiatives.
      Although the investment may come from the private sector, more
      ambitious programs are needed than those currently on the table.
      Similarly, for DOWA applications to data centers, the government can
      play a demonstration role, perhaps as an anchor tenant.
         Finally, for capacity building, there is scope for creating a more focused
      kind of tech hub to explore the potential for marine ICT applications.

Key Messages
•	 The potential for ocean-renewable energy technology (O-RET) deployment is increasingly improving as an
   option for Mauritius to generate more renewable and clean energy.
•	 Seizing that potential may reduce the country’s dependence on fossil fuels (especially coal) and lower its
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—with potential import reductions of 3 to 19 percent and GHG emissions
   reductions of 3 to 18 percent through O-RET deployment.
•	 Key potential exists for deep ocean water applications (DOWA)—notably, for air conditioning and cooling in
   Port Louis—underscoring the need for plans to be audited, and supporting policy (including pricing arrange-
   ments) to be investigated and put in place.
•	 Offshore wind energy shows potential provided there is appropriate concessional finance (such as carbon
   financing), which would likely only need to be modest, unlike wave energy, which would require higher levels
   of supporting finance. Mauritius could be a demonstration site for both, attracting external co-financing from
   developers and others.
•	 For large deployment of O-RET to happen, there will need to be a combination of clear longer-term vision,
   human capacity development, standards, comprehensive tariffs, and targeted opportunities to attract private
   investment and realize the sector’s potential.

184   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last



      Introduction
      Affordable access to essential services underpins development. Energy
      fuels almost all such services, with electricity supplying most of those
      needed for a modern economy. The “energy-system” harnesses resources
      and transforms them into energy carriers that are used in appliances and
      machinery to provide those services. This energy system may impact
      and interact with the economy, the environment (including other
      physical resource or commodity systems), and society, and the effects of
      this impact and interaction should be sustainably managed for current
      and future generations (Howells and Roehrl 2012).
         As Mauritius looks for ways to encourage the use of renewable and
      clean energy to reduce the country’s dependence on fossil fuels and
      decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ocean-renewable energy
      technology (O-RET) is being explored as a possible alternative. The
      country has a total area of close to 2 million square kilometers of
      Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and is geographically well positioned
      to harness ocean energy, in the form of offshore wind, ocean wave,
      ocean current, ocean thermal, and ocean saline energy. Currently, the
      Mauritian energy sector is carbon-intensive and dominated by imported
      fuel. The power sector fuel input is split between 20 percent renewable
      bagasse, 26 percent oil, and 54 percent coal. Just over 5 percent of gen-
      eration is from hydro, and small quantities of electricity are generated
      by wind and waste (CEB 2014; World Bank 2015). Although coal is
      imported, it is the lowest cost option for further expansion of the power
      system (OECD 2015). However, coal is GHG-intensive.
         Other potential expansion of the system is split into conventional land-
      based and new ocean-based options. Recent national analysis indicates
      that the renewable options—which include bagasse, wind, solar, and hydro
      power, but not yet O-RET—might contribute as much as 35 percent by
      2030 (Dhununjoy and Ramparsad 2015; Soonarane 2016). Wind and solar
      are expected to play an increasingly important role, but they are intermit-
      tent and will require that other power plants balance the system, that the
      grid be strengthened, and that market rules change. Globally, the use of off-
      shore wind power is growing—with one recent study noting that in 2015
      the European Union (EU) represented 14 percent of the world’s total wind
      power installations, up 4 percent from the previous year; by 2020, the EU’s
      present capacity is expected to grow threefold (Khoodaruth et al. 2017).
         How much of a role can O-RET play in supplying energy in
      Mauritius? At this point, the newly launched Mauritius Renewable
      Energy Agency (MARENA) is actively coordinating and promot-
      ing investment to harness the potential of O-RET. The government is
      deploying measuring devices to assess wave potential (TET, n.d.), and it

is funding photovoltaic solar farm deployment, net-metering, and sub-
sidies for photovoltaic under green energy schemes (Mauritius 2017).
   This chapter explores the possibilities, beginning with a review of
technology options, followed by quantitative modeling to determine the
optimal investment strategy and production mix of various technologies
and fuels needed to satisfy electricity demand, while simultaneously
accounting for capacity shortfalls from the decommissioning of exist-
ing power plants. To ensure that the scenarios are internally consistent
and that basic techno-economic constraints are obeyed, a medium- to
long-term systems model is employed. The model is developed from
a Climate-, Land-, Energy- and Water (CLEW) model of the island
(UNDESA 2016) that was generated by the Open Source Energy
Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) (Howells et al. 2011).
   Our results show that currently DOWA holds the greatest economic
potential, already being explored for air conditioning in Port Louis.
Next offshore wind shows extensive potential with appropriate con-
cessional finance (such as carbon financing), which would likely only
need to be modest, thanks to rapid cost and performance improvement,
unlike wave energy, which would require higher levels of supporting
finance. Thus, it would make sense for Mauritius to position itself as
an excellent location for pilot demonstration projects for offshore wind
and wave technologies, which could later be scaled up, as these would
attract external cofinancing from developers and others.


Snapshot of Technology Options
What are the new power plant options? Our development scenarios
focus on fossil fuels and land- and ocean-based renewable energy.1

Fossil Fuel Options
The three fossil fuel options for power generation in Mauritius are
coal, oil, and liquified natural gas (LNG). Coal-fired generation takes



1 Basic data used were taken from the most recent national planning docu-
ments, including the National Integrated Energy Plan (CEB 2014) and recent
power sector analysis (World Bank 2015). Other data were taken from
UNDESA (2016), and all technology cost and performance data were updated
with recent International Energy Agency data (OECD 2015). Long-term oil
and coal outlooks were taken from the World Bank commodity price outlooks
(World Bank 2015). Wind and wave performance data were taken from Duke
(2016). Figures for DOWA, due to this technology’s nature, were taken from
Mauritian developer estimates (Personal communication with SOTRAVIC
CEO Emmanuel Andre, 2016).

      the form of super-critical steam power plants. They are the cheapest
      option available to the island. Coal would be purchased at international
      prices. Oil- fired-generation, which provides low-capital-cost generating
      capacity, has relatively expensive running costs; its low-cost capacity can
      be useful when a generating reserve that is not expected to run at high
      load factors is required. LNG power generation, which is more expen-
      sive than coal though less expensive than oil, would require building a
      re-gasification terminal to import LNG to the island.

      Land-based Renewable Energy Options
      The land-based renewable energy options include wind, solar photo-
      voltaic, and bagasse. Wind currently provides 9 megawatts (MW) and
      has untapped potential, although it is limited by technical potentials
      and acceptability constraints. Solar photovoltaic currently exists in both
      rooftop and solar-farm configurations on the island, including a recently
      completed 15 MW solar farm (CEB 2014).
         Note that future bagasse based generation is limited (Welsch et al.
      2014), due to the stagnation of sugarcane growing. Similarly, most
      potential hydro power sites have been exhausted, and thus their expan-
      sion is not considered.

      O-RET Options
      Deep ocean water applications (DOWA). This is cost-competitive, but
      the focus of the current application is limited to buildings with central
      chiller systems located close to deep water. A pilot in Port Louis is being
      considered that might reduce electricity demand by 2 to 4 percent. The
      process involves extracting deep cold ocean water and using it to chill
      water that in turn cools air in modified central air-chillers. Note how-
      ever, that access to a cold seawater stream has multiple potential uses,
      such as for cooling surface ICT data-centers, improving the efficiency
      of industrial freezing, aquaculture (like abalone farming), thalasso, bot-
      tling, and others. These non-air-conditioning uses may increase the rev-
      enue and provide a space for new product development. It is assumed
      that with dynamic expansion, as much as 4 percent2 of demand may be



      2 This is an expert judgment, based on an assessment that at least 15 percent of
      the island’s commercial and industrial energy is used for cooling (AFD 2012)
      and assuming that as much as 30 percent might be captured by DOWA. The
      percentage cooling is likely to rise with increased air-conditioning and pro-
      cessing requirements. Clearly however, deeper analysis would need to be done
      concerning the potential spatial evolution of cooling demand. For example, if
      low-cost district cooling were available, it would likely attract activities with
      high cooling requirements.

reduced by taking advantage of DOWA. Options not included in this
analysis but that may hold future potential include deep-water pumped
storage (Economist 2016).

Offshore wind energy. At present, offshore wind energy production is
not cost-competitive compared with producing electricity from coal
or even land-based wind turbines, although the latter are restricted by
limited siting space. But it could become competitive if costs were to
drop or the mitigated emissions were to be subsidized through a car-
bon-credit market. One possible technology is fixed turbines, which are
cheaper (per kW) than turbines based on floating platforms but require
shallow water, such as exists in and around the lagoon. If this technology
were adopted, careful marine spatial planning (MSP) would be required
to trade off social, environmental, and economic deployment. (This
will be important to ensure the overlap of environmentally, socially and
techno-economically3 optimal sites.) The other possible technology is
floating turbines, which can be situated further from land; their draw-
back is that they are expensive and their technology is still immature
(Martin n.d.).

Wave energy. The potential for wave energy appears high, although it
is not economic at present. However, it has several advantages. One is
that the electricity that this technology provides is not as intermittent as
wind energy.4 Another is that while the technology is immature, its costs
are declining and they are subject to aggressive learning. Wave energy
could become economical if paired with carbon-credit finance. Some
companies are developing pilot sites internationally, and Mauritius may
be an excellent site for a highly subsidized pilot (CWE 2016).

Other. Not analyzed in the model scenarios, but worth noting, are two
other technologies. One of these is the role of LNG and oil for bun-


3 For example, Port Luis and (offshore) its surrounding are protected from
the southeast trade winds by the Moka Mountain range and, according recent
studies, wind turbine for power generation is not recommended in this part of
the country.
4 The consistency of wave energy is a result of the ability of waves to travel

long distances with little loss of energy. This means that many sites for wave
farms will be receiving significant swell waves created by winds out to sea, even
when there is little or no local wind. This extra persistence of swell waves gives
wave energy a significant advantage over wind energy. Wave energy is also more
forecastable than wind energy, allowing for easier integration into power grids.
Typically, wave sizes can be accurately forecast three to five days in advance
(McArthur and Brekken 2010).

      kering5 and the associated combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power
      plant. CCGT, which would initially use light oil, is more efficient
      than coal and has lower carbon emissions; but if oil prices rise, so will
      electricity prices, and once the LNG is introduced, this type of power
      plant will be run continuously, introducing inflexibility into the power
      system and possibly crowding-out other lower-carbon renewable energy
      investments.6 A second technology is the use of algae-based biofuel.
      This appears to hold potential, but recent estimates indicate important
      uncertainties associated with its economic potential (IRENA 2016a).
      A third technology is electricity generation from ocean thermal energy
      conversion (OTEC), a technology that is still in its infancy and expen-
      sive, and for which existing demonstration projects are small.7 Finally,
      a fourth technology is the desalination of ocean water: this is becoming
      increasingly important as a use of electricity that can be switched on
      and off to match the intermittency of intermittent renewable energy
      technology (RET), including O-RET, and demand for it is increasing.


      Economics of Future Options
      To understand the economics of future investment, it is helpful to begin
      with the cost picture for an average power plant, as shown in Table 5.1.
      In general, RET, including O-RET, is characterized by higher capital
      costs. However, since it relies on free renewable resources, its “fuel” costs
      are low, although running costs associated with maintenance are rela-
      tively high. The next step is to use these costs to calculate the levelized
      cost of electricity (LCOE) generation for O-RET and competing fossil

      5 Note that LNG for power generation only and the use of CCGTs are mod-
      elled (see the section on “Fossil Fuel Options” considered); however, they
      are not modelled as part of, and together with, a large integrated LNG bun-
      kering package and associated infrastructure. Further details on bunkering are
      addressed in Chapter 6, which covers ports.
      6 This is not to say that gas-fired power plants cannot be operated flexibly to

      accommodate intermittent renewables. It is rather that the CCGT, as part of a lar-
      ger package, is likely to be used as a “baseload anchor” customer consuming sizable
      and predictable flows of gas. This would translate to sufficient and sizable finan-
      cing flows, which would likely be needed to make the bunkering package viable.
      7 By 2016, the largest was a 0.1 MW plant in Honolulu, which was built at a

      reported cost of more than $5 million, about 50 percent higher than the current
      cost of wave energy (Vyawahare 2015). At this point, leading organizations like
      the International Energy Agency (OECD 2015) do not yet include current or
      projected costs of OTEC power generation in their reference-cost-projection
      publications, but costs may fall quickly as deployment increases. China is build-
      ing a 10 MW OTEC machine on Hainan island, and the associated scale and
      learning may lead to significant cost decreases (Power Technology n.d.). A watch-
      ing brief should be kept on the technology and its potential in Mauritian waters.

compared with a power plant that would otherwise supply that energy if DOWA cooling were absent). (c) Note that this is an equivalence value

      petes with existing oil with no subsidy at current costs (thus there is no red line in panel b.). Above or to the right
      of the black line indicates when the investment is preferred to running existing coal fired power plants. Thus, if the

         An excellent way to visualize these trade-offs is with an isoquant—a
      curve that shows the various combinations of different inputs that can
      be used to produce any given output. In this case, as shown in Figure
      5.1, the two inputs are: (i) O-RET cost reductions, which come about
      as the performance of the technology improves; and (ii) a CO2 sub-
      sidy for the emissions that the O-RET displaces. A number of lines are
      drawn to reflect the fact that the costs of O-RET and the amount of
      CO2 displaced differ depending on the type of power plant (existing oil,

new gas, existing coal, or new coal). At any point on the line, the cost
of generating electricity from the O-RET is the same as the cost for the
power plant the line represents.8 We set the capital cost reduction and
CO2 subsidy such that the LCOE of the O-RET is equal to the LCOE
of its alternative. In addition, capital costs are expected to decrease as
the technologies are relatively immature. For example, from 2009 to
2014, with the increased use of global deployment technologies such as
photovoltaic, capital costs fell more than 50 percent (IRENA 2016b).
    In this isoquant, we assume that as new O-RET is deployed, it will
either displace existing fossil-based generation or reduce investment in
new fossil-based generation,9 as well as reducing emissions over its life.
In a market with an emissions subsidy, the higher the subsidy the more
competitive O-RET becomes. (Note that Mauritius currently receives
carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) for
landfill gas renewable energy.) Similarly, competitiveness increases as
the capital cost of O-RET falls due to learning. If the capital cost reduc-
tion or CO2 subsidy is higher than any point on that line, the O-RET
has a lower LCOE, indicating it may be competitive.
    DOWA options (not shown in the figure) are cost-competitive
against all existing and new options in the Mauritian power system.
But offshore wind and (moreso) wave are not competitive compared
to LNG or coal-fired generation without a combination of technology
learning and CO2 subsidy. If the technology costs were to be reduced
by half, then compared with coal the CO2 subsidies required would be
US$30/ton for wave energy and less than US$15/ton for offshore wind.
    Offshore wind is competitive, by contrast, with oil-fired generation,
a finding that has important implications for the island of Rodrigues
Island, which is smaller than the main island of Mauritius and is cur-
rently powered primarily by oil (Box 5.1) (CEB 2014). That said, much
depends on the geology where the wind turbines are placed. If the water
is shallow, they can be fixed to the sea-bed; if it is deep, they should be
placed on floating platforms, which will not damage corals, although
this can be significantly more expensive.


Development Scenarios
What would the impacts of potential O-RET penetration in the Mauritian
system look like? To answer this, we developed simple scenarios. These
include a baseline, existing sector development plans (EDP) and additional

tration of O-RET displaces coal and small quantities of oil (see Figure 5.2).

Box 5.1. Rodrigues: Well-suited for O-RET Demonstration Projects

The Island of Rodrigues is in a special situation, as it depends on oil for generation (unlike the main island,
which depends on coal, which is cheaper), with about 12.7 MW of capacity, of which 1.3MW is wind—and
new capacity is required in 2018 (CEB 2014). Further, oil prices are volatile, resulting in relatively high prices
of electricity. And the island itself, prized for its natural beauty, is developing, which puts a premium on not
blighting its limited land surface. Yet land-based renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar
require large areas to produce the equivalent electricity of one of the island’s current power plants.
    The two factors, volatile oil prices and limited land availability, suggest that O-RET may have an important role
to place in its future power generation—especially for wind. And as Figure 5.1 shows, wave energy may even
become economical with technology learning and carbon financing. Further, the costs involved in managing
the existing internal combustion engines on the island—to handle O-RET intermittency—may not be significant.
    Thus, Rodrigues might be very well suited to attract demonstration O-RET projects—a good reason to
undertake a detailed integrated energy plan for the island, mirroring aspects of the larger island.



                     development options (ADO), using the cost-optimizing energy models,
                     OSeMOSYS. Unlike the framing of this report as a whole, here we do not
                     consider a “doubling” of the ocean energy economy (O2), because O-RET
                     is yet to be deployed. (Depending on the scenarios, it is not unlikely that
                     as much as 5 to 15 percent of the capital costs might be public contribu-
                     tions in the form of an equity share of the investment. And given the large
                     security and GHG mitigation gains, there is the potential that the O-RET
                     might gain access to various concessionary finance streams.)
                        OSeMOSYS is a dynamic, bottom-up, multiyear energy-system
                     model that applies linear optimization techniques. It determines the
                     optimal investment strategy and production mix of technologies and
                     fuels required to satisfy an exogenously defined electricity demand, on
                     the one hand, and the capacity shortfall from the decommissioning of
                     existing power plants, on the other. This is done while simultaneously
                     satisfying constraints imposed by the analyst. In this application, con-
                     straints include minimum levels of O-RET penetration. Technical, eco-
                     nomic, and environmental implications associated with the identified
                     least-cost energy systems are extracted from the model results. Like
                     other optimization models, OSeMOSYS assumes a perfect market with
                     perfect competition and foresight (Taliotis et al. 2016).

                     Baseline Scenario
                     In the baseline scenario, no new (land- or ocean-based) RET investments
                     are made. This provides insight into the cheapest development path for
                     the island and the CO2 emissions that might be displaced by alternative
                     development paths. Note that we develop a “reference” scenario, which
                     includes a high level of land-based renewable energy technologies: 8
                     percent wind, 17 percent bagasse, and 4 percent photovoltaic by 2025.

Existing Sector Development Plans (ESDP)
Building on the baseline and adding a reference level10 of land-based
RET, limited generation is supplied by limited quantities of O-RET.
These are consistent with pilot projects for which demonstration funds
might be secured. Offshore wind is expected to generate 2 percent and
wave 1 percent of national needs. Meanwhile, DOWA cost compara-
tively displaces 1 percent of electricity demand by 2025.

Additional Development Options (ADO)
Assuming that Mauritius takes advantage of various mechanisms
and technological advances, and much higher levels of O-RET and
DOWA are deployed between 2025 and 2030: by 2030, offshore wind
then reaches 19 percent of generation and wave reaches 8 percent.
Meanwhile, DOWA displaces higher demand (4 percent) by increasing
the efficiency of commercial and industrial cooling demand.
   The results show that if we move from the baseline to the additional
development option (ADO) scenarios, increasing quantities of RET
enter the solution (Figure 5.2). Under the ESDP scenario, this would
include 132 MW of land- and 35 MW of ocean-based RET by 2025
(the O-RET investment includes 9 MW-equivalent of DOWA, 16 MW
of wind, and 10 MW of wave). In the ADO scenario, this increases to
13 MW-equivalent of DOWA, 58 MW of wind, and 10 MW of wave.
   The net results are an increase in energy-sector investment of 14 per-
cent for the ESDP scenario over the baseline, and a 66 percent for the
more ambitious ADO scenario over the baseline. Note that the dispro-
portionate increase in investment in the ADO scenario is due to the
high investment cost of offshore wind and wave. The total cost of the
system is reduced with the introduction of DOWA. Note also that in
the case of DOWA, it is already competitive with its fossil fuel alterna-
tives at the costs provided and assumed. Further, it is expected that
wave and off-shore wind costs will drop over time. This implies that
lower carbon-credit values would be required to make these invest-
ments viable, depending on the timing of that investment.11



10 The latest available indications of existing RET sector development plans are
taken from Dhununjoy and Ramparsad (2015) and Soonarane (2016). They
contain no O-RET, but give clear land-based RET targets. These are used to
define a “reference level” deployment of land-based RET.
11 It should be noted that this analysis takes a limited set of scenarios and con-

straints to investigate. Were a broader set of questions to be examined, such as how
to improve environmental performance generally, there may be notable system
changes. While they might not change the dynamic associated with the introduc-
tion of O-RET, they might change other investment. For example, the introduction

Note: All blue entries at the bottom of the graphics are for ocean-based renewable energy technology O-RET. Green, brown, and yellow at the top of
each figure indicate land-based renewable energy technologies. Black and red, indicate, respectively, coal and oil generation, capacity, and investments.



   In terms of system dynamics, not only is there an increase in RET
capacity, there is also an increase in the overall capacity of the ADO
over the baseline of 20 percent. This is because variable RET gener-
ally has a lower load factor and requires capacity reserves to maintain a
stable system. The wind is not always blowing, nor the sun always shin-
ing, so standby generation—or power storage—is needed. However, that


of natural gas could help increase system flexibility and simultaneously improve
environmental performance were it to replace oil or coal. Environmental improve-
ment would include lower sulphur dioxide, particulate, and GHG emissions.

                             dynamic is marginally reduced when moving to ocean-based solutions,
                             because offshore wind and wave have higher load factors than onshore
                             wind or solar. For DOWA, fossil-fuel-comparable load-factors and con-
                             tribution to the capacity reserve margin are thought to be feasible,
                             because the supply of cold water is constant.

                             Implications for Cost, Revenue, Jobs, Imports, and Emissions
                             The results show that as O-RET penetration rises, there is an increase
                             in cost, revenue, and jobs—a function of greater intensities associated
                             with construction and maintenance. For revenues, this will be reflected
                             in a higher tariff or in external concessionary (such as carbon) finance
                             streams. That in turn means more carbon (or other concessionary)
                             finance streams are essentially required to make sure the investments do
                             not raise either the tariff or the tax. The actual revenue increase comes
                             to a 20 percent internal rate of return on the 20 percent private share
                             of the investment (Mauritius 2013).
                                How about import levels and CO2 emissions? Reductions over
                             the least-cost baseline are significant. In the ESDP and ADO scenar-
                             ios, there are 32 percent and 51 percent less imports, respectively, in
                             2030, and there are 38 percent and 58 percent lower GHG emissions
                             for the same year. O-RET accounts for 3 percent of the total reduc-
                             tions in imports and emissions under the ESDP scenario and 18–19 per-
                             cent of these reductions under ADO. As Figure 5.3. shows, imports in

and GHG levels from the power sector are significantly reduced with
the increasing introduction of land-based RET, shown as the difference
between the reference and the baseline scenarios. There is also a fur-
ther reduction as small quantities of O-RET enter the solution in the
ESDP scenario. Further land-based RET expansion is assumed to be
limited by space constraints, while O-RET is not. Thus, large reductions
in imports and emissions in the ADO scenario are due to extensive
O-RET deployment. However, with the exception of DOWA, this is
at a cost—although a commensurate carbon reduction credit (or other
concessionary finance) may turn all these into economic options.

Economywide Impacts
The results of this analysis mirror and extend recent reporting by
the International Renewable Energy Agency and the government of
Mauritius (Mauritius 2015). Intermediate results were reviewed with
stakeholders during several workshops with national experts during
August 2016. Note that costs used are based on international values,
calibrated with available updates for the Mauritian context. In the
case of DOWA, these are taken directly from the developer. Thus, it is
important to revise, review, and update these figures as the sector and
available new information develop.
   What are the economywide impacts and present worth of the energy
sector? Both the ESDP and ADO scenarios posited for investment in
ocean energy (wave, wind and DOWA) suggest large economywide
effects from both renewable ocean energy and the deep water applica-
tion for cooling. In both cases, the benefit-cost ratio (which can be inter-
preted as an investment present value (PV) multiplier) in terms of value
added (PV) is above 2—and in the case of the more conservative ESDP
scenario, it is close to 3 (Table 5.3). But while the more optimistic ADO
scenario shows a lower benefit-cost ratio, it appears much more effect-
ive at job creation. Almost 10 times as many jobs are created under the

                               the former is only five times larger in its investment costs. This is due
                               in part to the prevalence of the higher-labor-intensity sectors (wind and
                               wave) and in part to the fact that the optimistic ADO scenario is more
                               intensive in construction work. On the other hand, thanks to the higher
                               proportion of machinery and construction as components of its capital
                               costs, the conservative ESDP scenario appears to display much higher
                               production multipliers (Table 5.4).
                                  What are the policy implications? Given that introducing O-RET
                               would reduce imports, GHG emissions, and meet RET targets,
                               Mauritius should consider making O-RET a part of its sector develop-
                               ment strategies. At present this is not the case. O-RET is absent from
                               prominent national energy, RET, development, and GHG mitigation
                               policy documents. Further, DOWA and related applications have the
                               potential to employ Mauritians and spur innovation and related entre-
                               preneurial activity.


                               Making It Happen
                               In recent years, Mauritius has been moving quickly to revitalize
                               its energy sector in a way that emphasizes renewables (Box 5.2).
                               Previously, the legal and institutional framework governing the energy
                               sector was characterized by regulatory deficiencies—notably the fact
                               that the Central Electricity Board (CEB), the dominant power sup-
                               plier (accounting for close to 40 percent of electricity generation)
                               and sole grid operator, also acted as the sector regulator (GCF 2016).
                               In September 2016, an independent regulator, the Utility Regulatory
                               Authority (URA), was operationalized. Also in 2016, the government
                               launched the Mauritius Renewable Energy Agency (MARENA), which
                               is charged with coordinating and promoting investment in renewables,
                               in particular for independent renewable-energy power producers
                               (GCF 2016). These steps are in keeping both with the framework of
                               Mauritius’ Long-Term Energy Strategy 2009–2025 and with growing

  Box 5.2.  A Snapshot of Government Efforts to Support Renewable Energy

  A renewable energy agency
  Under the Ministry of Energy (MOE), the Mauritius Renewable Energy Agency (MARENA) is synthesizing
  analyses to inform national renewable energy technologies targets, grid integration, and the role of the
  ocean. To assist integration, a document setting up norms and standards for the importation, installation,
  maintenance, and recycling of RET devices has been drafted.

  Promotion of renewables
  Recent efforts include funding photovoltaic farm deployment (such as a 15 MW facility in 2014), net-me-
  tering, and deploying subsidies for photovoltaic under green energy schemes (Mauritius 2017). Seed
  funding for wave-based mini-grid generation (including securing USD 0.6 million from Australia) has been
  attracted. Green Climate Fund support for the operationalization of MARENA and improving the readiness
  of the electricity grid to receive greater quantities of distributed renewable energy generation have also
  been secured (GCF, n.d.)
  Bilateral wave energy collaboration
  Collaboration with Australia on wave energy development is expected to yield an actionable wave sector
  development roadmap. For wind, a call for an expression of interest in a 10–20 MW offshore farm is being
  drafted. Given growth potential in wind, wave, and DOWA, an ocean technology incubator has been iden-
  tified as a facility to be jointly developed with the Central Electricity Board (CEB).

  A regional wave database
  The Mauritius Oceanography Institute (MOI) has developed a referential wave database for the entire Indian
  Ocean Commission (IOC) region. It has collaboratively deployed wave observation buoys and undertaken
  extensive satellite-based assessments. Being situated in a location with limited coral barrier, it intends to
  demonstrate wave potential with a small, low-cost pilot plant during 2017. It has also been the recipient
  of requests for information on water temperature profiles by potential ocean thermal energy conversion
  (OTEC) project developers.




concerns over the projected increases in power that will be necessary in
the near future (implying considerably more fossil fuel imports).

First: As Mauritius weighs how to make O-RET a reality, a key initial
step is to develop clear techno-economic models of the sector’s
development.
Clear techno-economic models are essential for decision makers—espe-
cially in the Ministry of Energy and Public Utilities, MARENA, and
other subsidiary bodies. From a technical perspective, these models
enable analysts to compare different system configurations without
incurring the up-front cost of actually building them, helping to miti-
gate uncertainty. From a practical perspective, they facilitate the design
of systems in a way that accounts for local resources, demands, and con-
straints that are placed upon real-life electricity systems. This ensures
that generation meets demand in the most cost-effective way and that

Box 5.3. Extending the OSeMOSYS Analysis in Mauritius

The OSeMOSYS model employed in this report could be extended to cover a wide array of initiatives
and investment, going far beyond our indicative assessment of selected O-RET technology deployment
scenarios. Such an analysis could include a thorough investigation of the entire island’s energy supply and
demand and its long-term evolution—taking into account large-scale centralized as well as decentralized
bottom-up investment and development. It could also involve an extensive examination of issues like the
role of distributed generation, electrification of transport, technology learning (including OTEC and storage),
integration of intermittency, energy efficiency, and GHG mitigation potential.
    This tool is especially important because it can account for the entirety of the energy system and its
techno-economic development, thereby providing a way to develop consistent policy scenarios that would
move through the domains of the energy sector, OE, environment, and economic development. It also is a
good fit for the dynamic energy sector, which requires a highly adoptable and adaptable tool. Its availability
would help Mauritius take advantage of changes in the sector, mitigate shocks, and rapidly assess the costs
and benefits of concessional and cooperative opportunities. Such shocks might include technology chan-
ges, oil price hikes, carbon finance, and pilot project development.




                    public utilities and governmental institutions can structure tariffs to
                    minimize consumer electricity bills. It also ensures that scenarios of
                    future energy system developments are internally consistent. Such
                    scenarios can serve as effective communication tools for nonpartisan
                    political commitment—helping to garner and mobilize private-sector
                    support and to solicit agreement and feedback from society at large. A
                    key tool in this regard would be the OSeMOSYS model, which we have
                    used in this report (Box 5.3).12

                    Second: The modelling process, from data collection to the invest-
                    ment scenarios that result, needs to be coordinated among sectors.
                    While we focus on the OE, the analysis is within the domain of the
                    energy sector, and more specifically, the power sector. Further, the
                    implications affect policy related to GHG emissions, balance of trade,
                    industrial development, import security, and others. Each of these sec-
                    tors has planning processes, yet they may not be coordinated. Thus an
                    inter-sectoral process is required.

                    Third: During this process, the options assessed need to be
                    mapped to the opportunities they present.
                    For example, DOWA provides significant and varied development
                    prospects. Building a district cooling system and innovative uses of the

derived cold water stream offers integrated development opportunities
that may involve: research and development (R&D), small and medium-
size enterprise (SME) business development, and skills development.
The selling of cold water will involve the establishment of a new energy
services company and related business model, for which pricing mechan-
isms must be determined. GHG emissions will be reduced as fossil fuel
fired electricity generation will be displaced. And, because cold water
supply is not variable, not only will the electrical energy requirement be
reduced, but so too will “capacity” requirements. For each of these there
are a number of potential revenue streams—varying from domestic to
international assistance (including carbon markets)—which will need to
be coordinated to maximize the returns and potential of this effort.

Fourth: After the mapping and cost-benefit assessments, applica-
tions will need to be submitted for financial support.
One possibility is promoting a national development agenda. For
example, feed-in tariffs for RET generation might be used to reduce
fuel imports and improve energy security. Other support may be inter-
nationally sought. For example, for all the O-RET considered, there
appears to be strong potential to apply for carbon finance and signal a
national intention to do so. That would mean Mauritius urgently con-
sidering the inclusion of O-RET as a conditional contribution within
broader NDC communications at COPs and within national Low
Emissions Development strategies (LEDs) and Nationally Appropriate
Mitigation Actions (NAMAs)—which is not currently happening.
Specific applications for climate-related funds should be investigated,
such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM),13 NAMA facility,
and the Green Climate Fund. Further, given the vacuum of applications
to date, early (well-informed) movers in the Paris agreement may make
significant gains.
   The reality is that without carbon (or other) finance, offshore wind
and wave are not yet economical. However, the technologies are rela-
tively immature, and several developers not only seek demonstra-
tion pilot sites but could also partially fund the demonstration pro-
jects. Mauritius and its ocean provide an attractive location in terms of
resource and high skills levels, as well as being a potential “lighthouse”
example for small-island developing states. As noted earlier, MARENA
has taken early strides securing such seed funding.


13 Note that both large and small-scale CDM methodologies for the introduc-
tion of renewable electricity generation to displace fossil fuel exist. These might
be easily extended to include off-shore wind and wave generation. However,
methodologies are yet to be developed for DOWA.
202   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      Fifth: There is a need to revisit electricity market policy and struc-
      ture.
      As both ocean- and land-based variable renewable electricity generation
      increases, so too do stresses—and opportunities. These stresses, caused
      by fluctuations and inflexibility in power production, require so-called
      ancillary services, which quickly absorb (or curtail) power surges and
      provide reserves to fill shortfalls. Thus, appropriate levels of ancillary
      service14 supply present a technical as well as an economic challenge.
      But they also offer an opportunity, as surges provide large quantities of
      cheap power, which might be absorbed by a process (such as desalinat-
      ing water) that does not require tight scheduling (Howells et al. 2013).
         To meet these challenges, at a technical level long-term energy plan-
      ning requires grid-stability assessments—and related work is planned to
      be funded (GCF 2016). Further insights gained will need to be trans-
      formed into appropriate market rules. Market structures need to be
      adapted to explicitly recognize and economically reward the role of
      ancillary service provision. It is advisable for Mauritius to develop part-
      nerships with other islands that are undergoing similar transformations,
      such as Hawaii and Cyprus.

      Sixth: Preliminary supporting policies need to be strengthened or
      put in place to facilitate the potential introduction of O-RET.
      Preliminary supporting policies are needed, such as assessing ease of
      application and the rules defining financial risk mitigation in the sector.
      A special assessment of the role of RET feed-in (or other supporting)
      tariffs and their levels with respect to extending them to O-RET instal-
      lations will be needed. Precedents are likely to provide useful insight,
      such as work done in Europe (OffshoreWind.biz. n. d.) or new offshore
      RET support schemes being developed in China (4c Offshore 2016).
      Supporting activities should include the extending of environmental
      impact assessments (EIAs), specifically incorporating MSP into O-RET
      development. For ocean cooling, standards will need to be developed,
      as will performance indicators and integrated development plans. For


      14 Ancillary services can be defined as “those services required to ensure that
      the interconnected electric system is operated in a manner that provides a
      satisfactory level of service with acceptable levels of voltage and frequency.”
      For example, “Operating Reserves” (defined as primary, secondary, and ter-
      tiary) are used to maintain system reliability when there is an unexpected
      imbalance between supply and demand due to various system conditions or
      contingencies. Operating Reserves can be provided from unloaded capacity at
      a generation facility or from a curtailable load that can be dispatched on short
      notice to maintain system reliability. The reserves can be contracted and paid
      for (adapted from AESO n.d.).

example, new infrastructure will be built, and its construction through
busy parts of Port Louis will require careful scheduling.

Seventh: There will need to be human capacity building in affected
arms of the national government (and its parastatals), supported
by appropriate higher education activities.
This could involve expanding energy systems and policy analysis at
the national university. In particular, this becomes trans-disciplinary.
For example, it affects all the STEM disciplines—science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics. Energy planning involves applied math-
ematics and engineering, and developing new solutions requires the
intersection of science and engineering. An example would be exploit-
ing DOWA joint centers of excellence to incubate and facilitate innova-
tion. Another example would be contracting delivery of specific training
courses, either in-country or in the form of study trips, such as fellow-
ships and scientific visits. Participating agencies could include the World
Bank Group, United Nations, International Renewable Energy Agency,
International Atomic Energy Agency, and the German Development
Agency (GIZ).
   The bottom line is that there will need to be a combination of clear,
longer-term vision, human capacity development, standards, compre-
hensive tariffs, and targeted opportunities to attract private investment
and realize the sector’s potential. The development of a master plan
informed, in parallel, by the preceding steps is needed at two levels:
First at a national level and focusing on the energy sector directly with
the Ministry of Energy and Public Utilities; and second, subsections of
that master plan should be owned by the relevant bodies under the
ministry. In the case of RET and O-RET, these might logically lie within
the remit of MARENA.
   In the short term, a pragmatic master plan might involve a limited
set of pilot demonstration projects that could later be scaled up. Those
chosen should show positive benefit-cost ratios, or strongly positive
potential longer-term benefits. At this point, it appears that a DOWA
air-conditioning and cooling application in Port Louis might be actively
pursued. Offshore wind and wave pilots should be considered on a case-
by-case basis, following negotiations with suppliers and a full assess-
ment of the integration, supplementary revenues, and in-kind contribu-
tions associated with setting up demonstration projects.
   The key to making O-RET last in Mauritius will be to ensure that
lessons learned from the pilot projects are absorbed and translated into
policy that facilitates sustainable and appropriate institutional sup-
port—along with the co-creation of an enabling environment. This
means that the pilot demonstration plants should be designed with the
204   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      end in sight, on the one hand, and the understanding that the situation
      is dynamic, on the other.
         With this in mind, monitoring and verification of the policy process
      efficacy is suggested. Thus, at the institutional level, monitoring and veri-
      fication of the effectiveness of the following should be actively designed
      and reported: (i) integrated energy modelling; (ii) inter-sector coordina-
      tion; (iii) electricity market rules; (iv) opportunity and incentive identi-
      fication (such as for concessionary finance for GHG mitigation); (v) sup-
      plementary policies (such as standards, EIA, and MSP); (vi) human cap-
      acity development; and (vii) centers of excellence performance.
         For the pilot studies, there will need to be monitoring and verifica-
      tion of the performance of the DOWA, wind, and wave applications—
      which should be undertaken in terms of technical energy, finance, eco-
      nomic, and environmental performance. The monitoring and verifi-
      cation would be required through the project life-cycle, from plan-
      ning to de-commissioning. For example, for DOWA, it will be import-
      ant to report associated indirect effects, such as reduction in electricity
      demand and emissions from systemwide power plants.
         There will also need to be a situational analysis in the form of regular
      updates of modelling and policy assessment, especially for movement in
      key drivers. For example, fossil fuel prices, the level of carbon financing,
      and the cost of immature technologies will likely be subject to change,
      which will impact the economic performance of O-RET and its expansion.
         As for adapting to a changing climate, DOWA cooling can play an
      important role. It is expected that heating demand, cooling demand, the
      level of rainfall, and other things that directly affect the energy system
      will change with the climate. DOWA cooling (and potentially sched-
      ulable pumping and water storage) will provide important resilience to
      the system in the face of climate change.


      Recommendations
      In summary, we offer the following recommendations, which are also
      summarized in Table 5.5.

      Energy Planning
      Energy planning needs to be developed to include the analytical ability
      to assess the various aspects of a transition to increased deployment of
      both ocean- and land-based and RET options, which is not currently
      being done. Strong local capacity exists within the CEB, but not else-
      where. This expertise (in the CEB, but also elsewhere) is crucial, as new
      deployment of RET will require existing power plants to change both
      their operating regimes and financial models. This effort needs to go
                                                Energy and the Ocean Economy   205


hand in hand with strengthening the power grid and reforming the mar-
ket to ensure the sector’s economic sustainability. The model developed
for our scenarios may serve as a useful starting point.

Inter-sector Panel Coordination
This should be undertaken at two levels. The first, a higher-level
coordination team, should focus on harmonization between cross-sector
policy. The second, a planning group, should inform the activity of inte-
grated energy planning and develop annual reports for key stakeholders.

Gap and Opportunity Analysis
This should be undertaken for external (and national) funds associated
with developing O-RET—ranging from GHG mitigation and technol-
ogy transfer to business development and demonstration funds.

Finance Applications
A general analysis of potential grants, concessional finance, and related
support available from international finance institutions and funds
should be made. Selected applications can immediately be developed
for the CDM,15 NAMA facility, and Green Climate Fund. O-RET
should be included as conditional NDCs—assuming appropriate GHG
co-funding and technology learning levels are being achieved.

Ancillary Service Requirements
This involves grid stability and the future electricity market structure
vis-a-vis stability and investment transparency, and may go hand-in-
hand with targeted partnerships with islands in similar circumstances.
This should inform broader energy planning activities. In particular, it
would increase options available for system expansion, including the
role of flexible gas, storage, and demand-side management.

Supporting Policies
These include EIAs and MSPs, which need to be extended to include
O-RET projects.

Human Capacity Building
This effort should be undertaken at the government level, with appro-
priate curricula developed and implemented at the national university.



15Note that this may be non-trivial. New methodologies for applications may
need to be made. For example, no DOWA applications for CDM funds have
yet been successful.

Potential Pilots
These demonstration projects should be rapidly audited and, where
economical, carefully implemented, verified by monitored perform-
ance. These include the Port Luis DOWA scheme, the Mauritius
Research Council (MRC) wave energy converter, and others that might
pave the way for commercial-scale activities.

Monitoring and verification (M&V). These processes should be put in
place to assess the effectiveness of related policy and processes associ-
ated with implementing O-RET to ensure an enabling environment.

Centers of excellence. These should be established for R&D, business
development, and exploitation of the technology in the region—espe-
cially for DOWA.

Key Messages
•	 Mauritius Port Authority (MPA) has made a good start to implementing the policies set out in the 2016 Port
   Master Plan and has the potential for further expansion to serve third-party customers outside of Mauritius.
•	 Mauritius already acts as a container transshipment hub, but it needs to forge stronger and more permanent
   links with leading container-shipping lines and identify other types of cargo for which it could become an
   important trading intermediary, particularly petroleum products.
•	 With appropriate investments in logistics and the development of a new Special Economic Zone (SEZ), it
   could also act as a regional distribution center for the Western Indian Ocean, as well as meeting the needs of
   the domestic economy. There is also scope to provide more services to passing ships (such as bunkers, stores,
   repairs, inspections, crew changes, security, and search and rescue).
•	 There are several large projects under discussion at the moment—including a new breakwater and Island
   Container Terminal near Fort George, and a petroleum products complex at Albion—that could transform the
   role of the port and substantially increase its earnings from nondomestic trade. However, these projects need
   to be further evaluated before deciding to go ahead.
•	 Container and oil transshipment are internationally mobile and will be looking for attractive investment pack-
   ages as well as suitable port facilities. There will be an increased need for proactive marketing of Mauritius as an
   investment destination, which in turn will require a strengthening of MPA’s commercial functions and a higher
   level of inter-ministerial coordination than has been normal in the past. This will allow Mauritius to build on its
   existing reputation as a stable and attractive place in which to do business.

212   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last



      Introduction

      Strategically located at the crossroads of Asian and African sea routes,
      Port Louis, the main seaport of Mauritius, handles 99 percent of the
      country’s external trade and has become an important hub for the trans-
      shipment of containers moving between other countries. It accounts for
      around 2 percent of the country’s gross output, 1.6 percent of GDP, and
      around 9,000 jobs.
         The size of the sector is recorded in the National Accounts, where
      ports form the main component of the subsector, “Services Allied to
      Transport.” This includes activities carried out by the Mauritius Ports
      Authority (MPA), the Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd (CHCL), port
      and airport services, and storage and warehousing. For the purposes of
      this exercise, the ports sector has been taken to include private terminal
      operators like Mauritius Coal Terminal and Lafarge Cement, the two
      local shipyards, and a wide range of port-related services such as freight
      forwarding, bunkering, and crew transfers.
         Over the past two decades, major investments have transformed Port
      Louis into an efficient, modern seaport. The government is now plan-
      ning to reposition it as a regional trade hub, with the focus on trans-
      shipment of petroleum products as well as containers, seafood process-
      ing, bunkering, and cruise activities. This is intended to bring in substan-
      tial additional income from outside of Mauritius, as well as serving the
      needs of an expanding domestic economy.
         The key question for Mauritius is how it can increase the port sec-
      tor’s contribution to the OE in a sustainable and economically desirable
      manner. This chapter examines the port’s current investment plans and
      uses CGE modeling to evaluate their impact on the Mauritius econ-
      omy as a whole.
         Our findings show that the projects currently under way should
      more than pay for themselves and will have an even larger positive
      impact on the economy once multiplier effects are taken into account.
      Some of the longer-term projects in the Port Master Plan—such as the
      Island Container Terminal, which includes a large breakwater, and an oil
      jetty development at Fort William or Albion—are more difficult to jus-
      tify financially and will require substantial private sector investment to
      achieve positive public-sector returns. Nevertheless, these projects have
      a positive impact on the economy as a whole and are worth develop-
      ing further.
         Whether or not they go ahead will depend on the creation of a more
      favorable environment for private investment and the implementation
      of a series of measures to “make it happen.” Because the longer-term
      investments are larger and more complex than those being undertaken
                                                Ports and the Ocean Economy   213


now, a more proactive approach to project development will be
required, with more involvement of government bodies outside of
the port, such as the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
(MoFED), Ministry of Ocean Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries
and Shipping (hereafter Ministry of Ocean Economy) and the Board of
Investment.


A Profile of Mauritius’ Ports
Responsibility for the provision of port infrastructure and services rests
primarily with two state-owned organizations: MPA, which is the main
body responsible for port planning, infrastructure investment, pilotage
and towage, and port administration; and the CHCL, which is respon-
sible for cargo handling, mainly of containers. Some private companies
own or lease their own dedicated facilities within the port, and provide
their own handling services for specific bulk cargoes such as wheat,
petroleum products, cement, and fish.
   In 2015, MPA and CHCL had revenues of US$34.2 million (MUR
1,230 million) and $59.6 million (MUR 2,144 million), respectively.
Together they employed around 1,800 people and generated around
0.8 percent of GDP. Private companies providing port services account
for a further 0.8 percent of GDP. However, direct contributions to GDP
underestimate the role of the port in supporting the remainder of the
economy. Although air freight is important for high-value goods, requir-
ing just-in-time delivery, the port handles around 99 percent by vol-
ume of Mauritius trade and has strong linkages to many other parts of
the economy.
   Frequent, competitively priced shipping services to multiple destina-
tions are an important plus point in attracting footloose foreign invest-
ment and have allowed Mauritius to expand and diversify its economy
by seeking export opportunities overseas. Exports of goods and servi-
ces make up about 49 percent of the country’s GDP, much higher than
in neighboring African countries (Table 6.1). As a small, open econ-
omy, Mauritius also depends on imports of raw materials and intermedi-
ate goods to sustain its exports. In 2015 imports of goods and services
accounted for 59 percent of GDP.
   As for port traffic (in and out), it reached 8.4 million tons in 2016.
This was slightly below the record throughput achieved in 2012 due
to upgrading work at the container terminal, which required MPA to
request shipping lines to reduce their transshipment volumes and use
smaller vessels while the work was in progress (Figure 6.1).
   Around 60 percent of the throughput is domestic trade. The rest
comes from external trade between third countries made up of

      container transshipment (27 percent), re-exported petroleum products
      such as bunkers and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) (12 percent), and
      fish (2 percent). Domestic trade has remained fairly static at 4.5–5.0
      million tons per year, with external trade accounting for almost all of the
      growth in port traffic. This has given Mauritius a better level of connec-
      tivity with the outside world than might otherwise have been the case,
      as well as generating additional income and jobs. Port traffic is domin-
      ated by containers (52 percent), but there are also sizeable movements
      of dry and liquid bulk cargo (22 percent and 24 percent respectively),
      and smaller movements of general cargo and fish (Figure 6.2).

      Container Traffic
      For an economy of its size, Mauritius has a large number of long-distance
      container services. It has capitalized on its location at the crossroads of

Indian Ocean trade to develop as a transshipment hub—handling both
relay traffic, switching between long-distance routes, and hub-and-
spoke traffic for other Indian Ocean islands. Unfortunately, it has not
been able to develop a “regional carrier” role for Mauritius Shipping
Corporation (the national shipping line), in part because of the diffi-
culty of serving low-density Indian Ocean routes profitably. The high
cost, low frequency, and lack of control over regional shipping services
are obstacles to becoming a regional distribution center.
   Container transshipment in Mauritius only began in 2003, but by
2012 it had grown to make up more than half of all the boxes moving
across the quay (Figure 6.3). It has fallen since then, largely as a result

      of the container terminal expansion works. It is expected to resume its
      upward growth path once these have been completed in October 2017.
         Transshipment traffic is very mobile, and the global container indus-
      try is now undergoing a major restructuring, as a result of overcapa-
      city, mergers and acquisitions, and tumbling freight rates. As networks
      are redesigned, Mauritius must keep in touch with the main players to
      ensure that it retains or improves on its present position. Further reduc-
      tions in port charges should be avoided if these would result in operat-
      ing subsidies, and the container lines’ co-operation sought in identifying
      mutually beneficial ways of improving productivity, expanding traffic,
      and increasing the number of destinations served.

      Liquid Bulk
      Petroleum products (96 percent of total liquid bulk cargo) are imported
      for both domestic consumption and resale. Over the last 10 years, re-ex-
      ports of ships’ bunkers have grown by over 90 percent as incentives
      have been introduced to attract both passing trade and ships already
      calling at the port. Ships’ bunkers have increased from 17 percent to 23
      percent of petroleum imports, with the prospect of a further increase
      once the product range is expanded. In 2014, Petredec, a global LPG
      company, set up a storage and distribution center in Mauritius for trans-
      shipment of imported LPG to other Indian Ocean countries, driven by
      similar economic pressures to container transshipment. Exports in 2016
      were greater than 90,000 tons and are expected to increase further.
         The question now is whether this model, which is particularly suit-
      able for LPG, can be rolled out to other types of petroleum product.
      There is a widespread shortage of storage capacity in the region that
      prevents countries from taking advantage of low oil prices, and there is
      a growing international demand for storage from traders speculating in
      the oil futures market. Since this study began, Mauritius has received
      several enquiries from private investors interested in oil transshipment,
      but further work is required to bring the projects to financial closure.
         The project currently receiving most attention is for an oil transship-
      ment facility at Albion that is being jointly sponsored by the Indian Oil
      Company, Mangalore Refinery, and the Indian Government. It com-
      prises a common user jetty to be funded by an Indian government grant,
      and a privately funded tank farm to be built in two phases.
         Other projects put forward for the Albion area that are less well-de-
      veloped include a floating oil refinery proposal from Near Shore
      Resources, the reservation of a site for the storage and regasification of
      liquified natural gas (LNG) for power station use, the reservation of
      land for additional power plants to be built over the next 50 years, and
      a site for a private-sector solar power farm.

   Within the domestic market, half of all petroleum imports are used
for transport, and a quarter of imports are used for power generation.
The remainder is used for manufacturing, household, and commer-
cial purposes. Oil currently accounts for around 30 percent of power
generation, and this proportion may fall if the share of renewables is
increased as planned from 20 percent to 35 percent by 2025. Offshore
wind and wave energy, another component of the OE, are substitutes
for oil, and will free up space at the existing oil jetty for re-exports of
petroleum products should this market develop in future. There is also
a proposal for the next power station to be dual-fired, using either gas
oil or LNG; the choice will depend on comparative prices and the speed
with which the supporting infrastructure for LNG imports can be built.
The decision is still to be taken, but an LNG import facility designed
to handle large ships would give Mauritius “first mover” advantage in
developing LNG bunkering and regional LNG transshipment activities.
218   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      Dry Bulk
      Coal is the other main power station fuel, accounting around 40 per-
      cent of power generation and over 800,000 tons per year of imports
      in 2016 (45 percent of all dry bulk imports). It is cheap but dirty, and
      was originally introduced because of its ability to complement seasonal
      supplies of bagasse as a power station fuel. Imports are likely to remain
      at around their current level because of the capital sunk into existing
      power stations. They could increase significantly after 2025 if the gov-
      ernment were to adopt a “least cost” strategy for power generation, but
      this seems unlikely for sustainability and risk-reduction reasons.
         Other dry bulk imports include cement (605,000 tons in 2016) and
      grains (295,000 tons in 2016). If better regional shipping services were
      available, imports of this type could be used to manufacture value-
      added goods (such as building materials and bakery products) for re-ex-
      port to neighboring countries, resulting in more imports and exports.

      Seafood
      The development of Mauritius as a seafood hub has been one of the
      government’s big success stories, generating an estimated 6,500 jobs in
      the fish processing sector. Tuna constitutes around 96 percent of the
      total export value of fish and fish products from Mauritius (around
      US$400 million per year), with most of the raw tuna imported from the
      Seychelles. There are around 40 importers and exporters in a market
      dominated by Princes Tuna and Thon de Mascareignes.
         A Chinese company expressed interest some time ago in develop-
      ing a third major fish unloading and processing facility in the port,
      but the strength of this interest has not been tested. Purse seiner oper-
      ations—the main form of fishing in the Indian Ocean—are beginning to
      approach sustainability limits, which will restrict the size of the future
      market for tuna-processing. However, there is likely to be demand for
      smaller-scale facilities to support the long-line fishing fleet, which could
      increase port throughput of fish by 15 percent by 2025.

      Cruise Passengers
      The Indian Ocean cruise industry is still in its infancy, partly because
      of piracy incidents in the waters to the north of Madagascar and partly
      because of the difficulty of putting together attractive itineraries when
      so few of the region’s ports have proper facilities to receive large
      cruise ships. There are still fewer than 30 cruise ship calls each year.
      Nevertheless, it has been estimated by one of the cruise line agents
      in Mauritius that cruise passengers inject around US$15 million per
      year into the economy, including Air Mauritius air fares, airport taxes,
      and local expenditures; they also improve the country’s image as a
                                                Ports and the Ocean Economy   219


luxury tourism destination. Cruise passengers now exceed the number
of people arriving on the mixed passenger-cargo services operated by
Mauritius Shipping Corporation to Rodrigues and Réunion, who are
increasingly diverting to air transport.

Shipbuilding and Repair
Mauritius has two shipyards—Taylor Smith and Chantier Naval de
l’Ocean Indien (CNOI)—which repair small ships (such as fishing ves-
sels, yachts, port craft, and small naval patrol vessels), and CNOI also
builds these types of ships. Together, the two yards have a turnover of
US$35–40 million per year (equivalent to 40 percent of the revenues
of MPA and CHCL, the two state-owned port companies) and employ
around 450 full-time and 200 casual workers. Imports make up around
20 percent of the value of their output.

Other Port Services
Although CHCL undertakes most of the cargo handling work in the
port, some of the bulk importers (such as cement, petroleum products,
fish and wheat) handle their own cargo, particularly onshore. Private-
sector support services (such as ship agency, chandlery, ship and cargo
inspection, crew changes, and security) further increase the value-added
and employment generated by the port, although by exactly how much
is still unknown.


Development Scenarios
What is the potential of the port sector to contribute to the OE and
Mauritius’ overall economic development?
    The projects that have been identified by MPA as possibly being
undertaken within the next 10 years are shown in Table 6.2. They
have been derived from the Port Master Plan, which was completed by
the Dutch engineering firm Royal Haskoning DHV in July 2016 and
updated to take into account new projects initiated since then, such as
the Albion oil jetty. They do not include the Riche Terre SEZ, which has
been treated as a general industrial development project even though it
is located close to the port and would generate significant quantities of
imports and exports.
    The projects have been grouped into two scenarios—conservative and
optimistic—for the purposes of CGE modeling. The conservative scen-
ario includes the projects actively under discussion now, while the opti-
mistic scenario comprises additional projects that might be undertaken
if additional funding were available, and/or a suitable project spon-
sor could be found. The majority of the projects in both scenarios still
220   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      require economic and financial evaluation before taking the decision to
      go ahead.
          Both scenarios assume that all the short-term investments currently
      at the planning stage—totaling US$520 million—will go ahead. These
      include: (i) routine investment undertaken by MPA (port infrastructure)
      and CHCL (port services) in asset replacement, and small-scale improve-
      ments for performance improvement, safety and security, and administra-
      tive or social reasons (US$183 million); (ii) larger investments to which
      MPA and CHCL are contractually committed—the most important being
      the expansion of the Mauritius Container Terminal (MCT) container ter-
      minal (for a combined total of US$306 million between 2015–20); and
      (iii) expected capital outlays of private port service providers—this is
      mainly routine expenditures on asset replacement, but also includes the
      current expansion plans of the two ship repair yards (US$31 million).

      Conservative Scenario
      In the Conservative Scenario, a new gate complex is proposed for
      Mauritius Container Terminal to increase security, reduce truck turn-
      around times and documentation costs, and improve terminal perform-
      ance by moving ancillary facilities like scanners and customs inspection
      areas away from the main container stacks. It is not expected to generate
      any additional revenue, but would improve service standards for the
      port’s domestic containers. The project would be funded by MPA as an
      extension to the ongoing container terminal expansion program.
         The second oil jetty at Fort George is intended to serve LPG ves-
      sels and bunker barges loading oil for transfer to the offshore anchor-
      age. This will overcome capacity constraints at the existing oil jetty,
      which the Port Master Plan expects to reach full capacity working in
      2023. The jetty and the associated tank farms would most probably be
      funded by private investors. The additional revenues generated for the
      jetty users are difficult to quantify, but have been included in the analy-
      sis on the basis of the “local content” component of private- sector earn-
      ings from bunkering and LPG storage at other ports.
         The island container terminal is a large and complex project with
      two main components:

      •	   A large breakwater (US$373 million, including associated dredging
           and reclamation costs), which would protect the existing container
           terminal and oil jetty against the effects of climate change and help
           to retain the container transshipment traffic using the existing con-
           tainer terminal. This would almost certainly have to be funded by
           the government, although grants may be available from one or more
           Climate Change Funds;
                                                  Ports and the Ocean Economy   221


•	   A 460-meter container berth with a capacity of approximately 650,000
     meters p.a. The quay wall, superstructure, and equipment costs of
     US$242 million are assumed to be paid by a private-sector partner,
     most probably a shipping line or large international terminal operator

   The breakwater would be largely non-revenue-earning, apart from
the increase in port dues and marine services revenues generated by
the additional transshipment traffic. The revenues arising from the con-
tainer berth will depend on the choice of private operator, which could
be either an international terminal operator like PSA Corp or DP World
or a major container shipping line. If it were to be an independent third-
party operator it would probably have to match MPA and CHCL’s char-
ges at the existing container terminal, which for transshipment traffic
are very low.
   Container transshipment is a mobile and highly competitive business
in which Mauritius is to a large extent a price taker rather than a price
maker, making it difficult to justify capital expenditure on the island
berth for additional transshipment traffic alone. A third-party operator
could create a commercially viable business at existing tariffs, but only
by taking higher-value domestic container traffic away from the existing
terminal operator, which would not necessarily be economically bene-
ficial for Mauritius.
   If the new container terminal were to be operated by a shipping
line, it is possible that the benefits it obtains from transshipment in
Mauritius might be higher than the current prices charged by MPA and
CHCL—that is, there may be an element of consumer surplus that the
government could capture in the form of concession fees.
   Global transshipment networks are complex even for a single ship-
ping line, and the situation has been further complicated by recent major
changes to the three main shipping line alliances. At the time of writ-
ing these were the 2M Alliance (Maersk and Mediterranean Shipping
Company), the OCEAN Alliance (CMA CGM, Evergreen and Cosco),
and THE Alliance (NYK, MOL, K Line, Yang Ming and Hapag Lloyd).
Maersk and Mediterrean Shipping Company already transship cargo in
Mauritius, but CMA CGM has recently moved its transshipment oper-
ations to a new hub in Réunion.
   In the light of the findings of the techno-economic study being imple-
mented by the MPA, a decision on the possible funding of the break-
water construction by government could be considered. The Island
Terminal Project was included in the 2009 Port Master Plan Study pre-
pared by engineering consultants Halcrow and has been further exam-
ined by the consultants Royal Haskoning DHV in the 2016 Port Master
Plan Study. It is now the subject of further studies.
222   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


         The cruise terminal is a public-sector project serving a small but
      already well-established market. Cruise ships already call at Mauritius
      using the existing quays to berth, but are likely to do so in increased
      numbers if high-quality facilities are provided. The impact of the ter-
      minal on MPA’s finances is likely to be small and will depend on the
      rents that can be obtained for commercial floor space within the ter-
      minal building. The main economic impact will be local expenditures
      by cruise ship passengers, crews, and cruise ship agents, which are esti-
      mated by MPA to be around US$15 million per year at present.
         The Caudan breakwater is a small investment required partly for
      flood protection purposes that would also provide an area of shel-
      tered water suitable for marina development close to the city center.
      Although the marina could generate revenues for both MPA and the
      private operator, these have been considered too small to be included
      in the CGE modeling work.
         The Albion oil transshipment terminal was considered in the 1996
      Port Master Plan but could not be implemented because of the high
      cost of the infrastructure, especially the jetty, and the absence of will-
      ing promoters. The 2016 Port Master Plan reached the same conclusion,
      namely that the site should be earmarked for future large-scale energy
      projects, and shortly afterwards new sponsors materialized.
         The project comprises a jetty for very large tankers (US$171 mil-
      lion), which is to be funded by a grant from the Indian government,
      and the phased development of a tank farm by Mangalore Refinery
      and Petrochemicals Limited and the Indian Oil Company for the stor-
      age and re-export of petroleum products. At the time of writing, Phase
      1 of the tank farm was expected to cost US$160 million and to have a
      maximum throughput of 3.23 million tons of petroleum products per
      year, while Phase 2 was expected to cost US$101 million, increasing
      the total maximum throughput of the complex to 9.56 million tons
      per year.
         These are very large throughputs compared with Mauritius’ 2016 oil
      traffic: 1.42 million tons of imports, of which 0.44 million tons were
      re-exported. They also represent relatively large shares of the target
      markets for petroleum products, which stretch from Djibouti to South
      Africa (10–15 percent in Phase 1, rising to 25 percent in Phase 2).
         No information is currently available about the expected revenues
      and operating costs of the transshipment operation, although we under-
      stand from MPA that the proposal submitted by the project sponsors
      expected it to have an NPV of US$63.3 million over a 15-year per-
      iod at a 10 percent discount rate. This information, combined with
      assumed future prices for petroleum products based on a crude oil price
      of US$70 per barrel, has allowed us to “back-estimate” the likely cash

flow as an input to the CGE model. Construction is assumed to begin
in 2017, with Phase 1 of the project becoming operational in 2020.

Optimistic Scenario
Phase 2 of the Albion oil transshipment project has been included in
the optimistic scenario, as its funding is conditional on the commercial
viability of Phase 1.
   The reconstruction of Quay 1, a dry bulk berth used mainly for the
handling of coal, has been included in the optimistic scenario because of
uncertainty over future levels of coal imports, which are closely linked
to the Central Electricity Board’s power generation strategy and the role
of renewable energy and/or LNG. There is little financial incentive for
MPA to undertake this project, because its main benefits—labor cost sav-
ings due to terminal automation and the ability to use larger ships fully-
laden—accrue to the Mauritius Coal Terminal, which appears unwilling
to undertake the associated private-sector investments at the present time.
   The Grand River North-West marina has been under discussion for
some time, but suffers from the small scale of existing marina facilities
in Mauritius, their association with resort developments, and possible
objections from local residents. The commercial viability of a new mar-
ina at Grand River North-West is still unknown, as no private sector
operators have yet come forward.
   The Fort William fishing harbor is a non-revenue-earning project
intended to remove non-operational fishing vessels from Trou Fanfaron
in the city center, where they hold back the full development of the
waterfront for tourism and commercial purposes, and are said to be the
cause of various social problems. Until a redevelopment plan for the Trou
Fanfaron area has been agreed, the economic and financial impacts of the
project will be relatively small, resulting in some flexibility in timing.
   The third ship repair yard is a project that is still at the concept
stage, and the market it would serve has not yet been clearly identified.
A request for Expressions of Interest is expected to be issued in 2017,
and the project will then be developed further on the basis of the most
attractive response(s). For modeling purposes it has been assumed that
the new yard would serve regional niche markets, such as port craft, off-
shore support vessels, and large fishing boats, and that its cost and rev-
enue structure would be broadly similar to that of Chantier Naval de
l’Ocean Indien (CNOI).

                              looking at the value-added associated with the projects included in each
                              scenario, and secondly by including in the analysis the indirect econ-
                              omywide benefits caused by multiplier effects.
                                 The model results shown in Table 6.3 have been based on a 10-year
                              investment program (2017–27) and an evaluation period that extends
                              to 2040. This allows for the fact that port installations rarely begin
                              working at full capacity immediately; in some cases, it may take many
                              years for port traffic growth to absorb the large and indivisible incre-
                              ments of port capacity provided by particular projects.

                              Conservative Scenario
                              The project-level benefit-cost ratio for the conservative scenario is
                              relatively low (1.17) because of the existence of non-revenue-earning
                              investments (such as the island breakwater) that are required to protect
                              existing traffic, as well as enabling private-sector investments to go ahead.
                              However, it increases to 1.59 when economywide linkages are taken into
                              account, generating over 1,400 permanent new jobs, plus an estimated
                              4,000 full-time equivalent jobs during the 10-year construction period.

                              Optimistic Scenario
                              The project-level benefit-cost ratio for the Optimistic Scenario is rela-
                              tively high (3.52) because of the smaller amount of investment required
                              and the fact that the local value-added component of the main project
                              (a third shipyard) should be quite high compared with the main projects
                              in the conservative scenario, which generate smaller potential operating
                              surpluses. The economywide benefit-cost ratio for the optimistic scen-
                              ario is slightly lower than for the conservative scenario at 1.44.
                                 The number of permanent jobs created by the optimistic scenario
                              appears low when compared with independent bottom-up estimates
                              of around 600 jobs, and may be an under-estimate. In addition, around
                                                 Ports and the Ocean Economy   225


1,000 full-time-equivalent jobs are expected to be generated during the
construction phase.

Sensitivities
All these results need to be treated with care, as many of the projects
are still at an early stage in their development. Their capital costs, rev-
enues, and operating costs will inevitably change as more information
becomes available and the projects are adapted to meet the needs of
particular private-sector sponsors.
   The timing of individual projects in relation to the growth in
demand, and the amounts of additional cargo that the project sponsors
are able to bring with them, will also have an effect on the commer-
cial viability and wider economic impacts of individual projects. This is
because there are large indivisibilities in port investments (such as the
island breakwater/container berth and the Albion oil jetty) whose cap-
acity may take some years to fill up.
   The structure of the public-private partnerships underlying many of the
projects, as well as the way in which costs and benefits are divided between
the public and private sectors, will also affect their worth, particularly
when the project benefits accrue mainly to companies outside Mauritius,
such as container shipping lines and international oil traders. Attention
must be paid to securing appropriate risk/reward ratios for all parties.
   Because the analysis in Table 6.3 is focused on value-added rather than
profits, it should not be construed as implying that all the private sec-
tor investments listed in each scenario will automatically find sponsors. In
some cases, a great deal of work may be required to put together investment
packages that are attractive to the private sector while generating enough
benefits for Mauritius to justify associated public-sector investments.
   Finally, there is the issue of risk. The OE is moving toward a new
phase in which Mauritius will be competing on the global stage for
port projects that could equally well be located in other countries. Due
to government budgetary constraints, for these projects Mauritius will
also become increasingly dependent on private finance. Risk allocation
is therefore likely to become increasingly important in the structuring
of new projects, while uncertainty about their timing will require more
a flexible approach to port planning. The institutional changes needed
to achieve this are described in the next section.


Making It Happen
The scale and nature of the new port projects arising from the OE
make it desirable for MPA to acquire the new skills that will allow it to
strengthen and expand its commercial functions.
226   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


          The number of additional staff required in MPA is likely to be
      fairly small, with the emphasis placed on obtaining the right people
      rather than the actual numbers. We envisage the creation of a small
      Commercial Division within the port, headed at the second- or third-
      tier management level by someone with business development experi-
      ence from a rapidly-growing port outside Mauritius. The head of the
      Commercial Division would be supported by four or five local staff,
      mainly graduates with a business background who would be trained on
      the job, perhaps making use of a training scheme at another larger port.
          The investment program set out in Table 6.2 is large in relation to
      the public-sector resources available for gross fixed capital formation in
      Mauritius. Thus, “making it happen” revolves around three main issues: (i)
      how to prioritize investment expenditures; (ii) how to increase the private
      sector’s share of investment expenditures, particularly from overseas; and
      (iii) how to ensure that public-sector investments represent good value for
      money. Expansion of its commercial functions will enable MPA to address
      all three issues more effectively and involve a variety of measures.

      Helping Existing Customers to Grow
      The port’s existing customer base is one of its largest assets, and helping
      customers to expand is a low risk way of contributing to OE objectives.
         Understanding customer requirements is fundamental, and one
      way of achieving this is to use customer relationship management
      tools to build up an information database on each of the port’s main
      users, focusing on the economics of their supply chains and the new
      business opportunities and threats to existing businesses that result.
      Opportunities for helping customers to grow can be discussed at annual
      “liaison” meetings, with the outcomes passed on to other relevant gov-
      ernment departments at routine inter-ministerial meetings set up to
      monitor the progress of the OE.
         Some port-related activities, such as shipping, ship building and
      repairing, and ship agency work would benefit from an expansion
      of government training schemes. The Mauritius Maritime Training
      Academy, for example, produces hotel staff for cruise vessels rather than
      engineers and deck officers for cargo ships. With the possible excep-
      tion of welding, training courses are not available for the specialist skills
      needed in a shipyard, so workers have to be trained in-house with-
      out any form of subsidy or tax relief. And because Mauritius is a small
      country, there are relatively few courses providing the skills needed to
      conduct international trade, such as freight forwarding, insurance, ship
      brokering, or customs clearance.
         Because basic educational standards in Mauritius are lower than in
      many competing Asian countries, particularly for technical subjects,
                                                Ports and the Ocean Economy   227


there is a catch-up component to in-house training costs, which the gov-
ernment might consider contributing to, especially as normal labor turn-
over spreads the general benefits of this training to other industries.
   There is also the question of whether public-sector procurement poli-
cies should give preference to local suppliers. Shipyards in Mauritius do
not receive preferential treatment in the placing orders for new vessels
by organizations like the MPA and the Fisheries Division of the Ministry
of Ocean Economy, even though this is common practice in other parts
of the world (for example, France, India, South Korea, and China).
   Automatic inclusion of local yards on tender lists, allowing them to
match the best offers obtained through competitive tendering or even
accepting small price margins above the best bid, would help to keep
this work in Mauritius. This implies a move away from the free market
principles that have characterized past economic policies, but it might
be justified for a limited period if it boosts the OE.

Finding New Customers
MPA has recently appointed its first marketing officer, who with a
limited budget still needs to develop a proactive marketing strategy
that will increase awareness of Mauritius amongst overseas companies
not using the port at the moment. This is likely to involve a mixture of
desk research, carefully targeted publicity material, and international
travel, focused on the cargo types and port-related services for which
Mauritius has the greatest comparative advantage. In practice, there is
likely to be some overlap between promoting the use of existing facili-
ties and attracting private investment in new ones.

Attracting Private Investment
There is a global trend toward increased private investment in ports, and
Mauritius is not alone in having a number of projects on the drawing
board that are suitable for public-private partnerships. However, these
need to be more widely publicized, while following guidelines for attract-
ing private investment that range from considering new projects from the
point of view of investors to conducting value-for-money assessments for
any public investments needed to support the project (Box 6.1).
   More desk research is needed to improve MPA’s understanding of
new activities like ship repairing and international oil trading. Regular
contacts need to be maintained with companies interested in investing
in Mauritius and customized business cases need to be prepared to dem-
onstrate the advantages of Mauritius as an investment location. Because
of the need to offer a package of investment incentives, later-stage mar-
keting should be undertaken jointly with the Board of Investment and
other relevant government bodies.
             228    The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last




Box 6.1. Guidelines for Attracting Private Investment

•	 Be vigilant, always on the look-out for new opportunities.
•	 Be aware of, and develop contacts with, the main players in each separate market.
•	 Understand the economics of the different businesses—the client base, cost structure, pricing policies,
   attitudes towards risk, and upstream and downstream linkages to other activities.
•	 Consider new projects from the point of view of investors—what’s in it for them.
•	 Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of Mauritius from the investor’s perspective, and compare
   with those of competing locations.
•	 Think widely about the potential costs and benefits of each project for Mauritius, including job creation,
   local value-added, backward and forward linkages, and government tax revenues.
•	 Allow for “leakages” of potential income overseas through imports and repatriation of profits.
•	 Consider ways in which the attractiveness of Mauritius can be improved through associated public
   investments, fiscal incentives, regulatory changes, labor training, “start-up” assistance, and other govern-
   ment policies designed to create a favorable business environment.
•	 Conduct value-for-money assessments for any public investments needed to support the project, ensur-
   ing that these are justified by the project’s contribution to economic growth.
•	 Be flexible but realistic when negotiating deals—the objective is to arrive at a win-win situation for each
   party.




                        At the same time, there is a need to take into account the impact of
                    new projects on existing businesses in Mauritius. In some cases, these
                    may be positive; for example, if the proposed new deepwater oil jetty at
                    Albion can be accessed by other oil companies, it would allow them to
                    use larger ships. In other cases, the impact may be negative; for example,
                    if the third shipyard were to compete in exactly the same niche markets
                    as the two existing shipyards, it could steal their business. Every project
                    therefore needs to be considered from as wide a perspective as possible,
                    considering Mauritius as a whole.
                        A better understanding of potential investors’ businesses will help
                    Mauritius to obtain the best possible deals in terms of public-private
                    equity contributions, profit sharing, and the allocation of risk. The fre-
                    quency of contacts with potential partners should be raised as each pro-
                    ject progresses, and professional advice should be sought for large pub-
                    lic-private partnerships such as the Island Container Terminal.

                    Port-related Investments
                    Because the port is so central to the success of the OE, there may be a need
                    for MPA to become involved in projects being developed by other pub-
                    lic-sector organizations when these increase the demand for port facilities,
                    or MPA can offer incentives that improve the project’s chances of success.

Source: BDO, Review of the DP World Proposal for the Riche Terre Special Economic Zone (RTSEZ).




   One such project is the Terre Rouge SEZ close to the port, which
would strengthen the position of Mauritius as a regional transshipment
and distribution hub (Table 6.4). The economic impact of the SEZ will
depend on how it is developed (labor-intensive manufacturing or cap-
ital-intensive distribution activities), and whether it is built using for-
eign direct investment or local capital. The range of potential outcomes
is large. However, “best estimates” made during the evaluation of a
recent DP World proposal suggest the scale of economic impacts listed
in Table 6.4.
   Various models are available for the development of an SEZ, but the
majority of the investment usually comes from the private sector, with
public sector investment in land, infrastructure, common services and an
initial stock of buildings kept to a minimum by “revolving fund” financing.

Project Evaluation
The Port Master Plan takes a broad look at future investment needs,
encompassing most foreseeable projects, but does not attempt to pri-
oritize investments. The larger projects listed in Table 6.2 now need to
be properly evaluated, resulting in more detailed plans for the projects
that are suitable for implementation within the next 10 years.
   Although large projects are normally evaluated by MPA as a condi-
tion for obtaining external finance, whether from commercial banks or
international financial institutions, this is often done at a relatively late
stage. Less use is made of economic evaluation techniques for projects
that are to be funded from MPA or CHCL’s own resources.
   It would be useful to look at the economywide benefits received
in exchange for the public sector component of any large investment,
including such items as roads that lie outside of the port boundaries.
Rotterdam is one of the world’s leading ports in this respect. Since
September 2012, it has been working closely with the Municipality of
Rotterdam, the Province of South-Holland, the Dutch national govern-
ment, and key port users to implement an action plan set out in its Port
Vision 2030. Some of the planning and evaluation techniques it uses
for individual projects are equally applicable in Mauritius, particularly
230   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      those involving multi-organization approaches to marketing, project
      implementation, and financing.
         Because economic evaluations can be time-consuming and expen-
      sive, we suggest a phased approach in which the quality of the input
      increases as the project moves toward financial close:

      •	   At the concept review stage, the main need is to understand why the
           project is being undertaken and what its principle costs and benefits
           will be. This is similar to the economic evaluation work that was
           undertaken in the Port Master Plan, where rough estimates were
           usually sufficient to decide whether or not individual projects were
           worth developing further.
      •	   At the project review stage, the costs and benefits are normally derived
           from a “live” project for which pre-tender designs and cost estimates
           are available, customers or partners have been identified, traffic pro-
           jections have been based on their specific requirements, and an outline
           financing plan has been put in place. For small- and medium-size pro-
           jects, this may be the end of the economic evaluation work.
      •	   For large projects such as the Island Container Terminal, a final
           review should be undertaken prior to any commitment of public
           funds. This would typically involve financial modeling and due-dili-
           gence work similar to that undertaken by banks and private equity
           funds, together with an economic impact assessment looking at the
           project’s implications for other parts of the economy.

         At the concept stage, efforts should be made to investigate and dis-
      cuss all available options before finalizing project specifications. Key
      port users, along with a strengthened and more active Port Users
      Council, may have a role to play in this process. In South Africa, for
      example, Port Consultative Committees actively review Transnet’s
      investment plans for each port and hold open workshops to discuss the
      plans with Transnet National Ports Authority. These committees are
      also consulted regularly by the Ports Regulator and the Department of
      Transport about what needs to be done to improve port performance.
         All port-related projects requiring significant public investments
      should be subject to financial and economic evaluation. The finan-
      cial evaluation should calculate the project’s financial internal rate of
      return and net present value by looking solely at the public-sector com-
      ponent of the capital expenditure, and comparing this on a discounted
      cash flow basis with net changes in public sector revenues and operat-
      ing costs arising specifically from the project. These would normally be
      calculated on a time series basis by comparison with a “do nothing” situ-
      ation in which the project did not take place.
                                                Ports and the Ocean Economy   231


   The economic (or value-for-money) evaluation is much broader
and compares the government’s contribution to capital costs with the
discounted increase in value-added for the Mauritius economy as a
whole—taking into account multiplier effects and any increase in con-
sumer surplus caused by reductions in the delivered prices of imports.
The methodology, which is a modified form of cost benefit analysis, will
vary from project to project.
   The economic impact of all major OE projects should be reviewed at
the government level before deciding whether or not to go ahead with
them, using an approach that is as standardized as possible between sec-
tors and consistent with OE policies as a whole.

Financial Planning
MPA and CHCL already produce five-year, rolling capital expenditure
plans as part of their normal budgeting processes. However, the scale
and complexity of some future projects increases the need for a better
understanding of international financing options for large infrastructure
projects, along with the capacity to model and track financial trans-
actions between the different stakeholders. This would allow more use
to be made of project-specific government grants, subordinated loans,
and revenue or profit sharing deals with private sector partners, while
keeping MPA’s exposure to financial risks within acceptable limits.

Tariff Reviews
As well as using foreign direct investment to increase the leverage of
public-sector investments in the port, attention needs to be paid to the
way in which the resulting “economic rent” is split between Mauritius
and its overseas partners. This requires tariff structures and public-pri-
vate partnership concession agreements to be designed to keep as many
of the project benefits as possible in Mauritius.
   Some ports now use a supply-chain approach to tariff setting, look-
ing at the amount of economic rent they can capture before risking
loss of cargo to the next most competitive port. This is quite common
in parts of the world where tariffs are unregulated and inter-port com-
petition is strong—for example, China, the United Arab Emirates, and
northwest Europe (Antwerp, Rotterdam, and Hamburg). It is less usual
in countries like Mauritius, where the port has a natural monopoly, and
in countries where port tariffs are externally regulated.
   Looking at the supply chains of individual customers is easiest for
the bulk trades and other commodities, like steel and timber, where the
number of customers is small and their supply chains are well-defined.
It is more difficult for container traffic, where the number of consign-
ees is large and their characteristics are more diverse. However, the high
232   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      level of consolidation that has taken place in container shipping over
      the last two years may make it worthwhile to look again at the net-
      works of the three main alliances—with a view to identifying the routes
      offering the best opportunities for transshipment in Mauritius and the
      tariff rates at which transshipment in Mauritius becomes more attract-
      ive than transshipment at alternative hub ports. This would strengthen
      MPA’s position in negotiations with its most important customers and
      could lead to some increase in transshipment tariffs.

      Lease Negotiations
      Another issue is the allocation of port land away from the waterfront,
      including the new areas of reclaimed land becoming available at the
      entrance to the harbor at Fort George (4 hectares) and Fort William
      (35 hectares).
         New leases should include clauses that make it easier to move the
      lessee—with appropriate compensation—to another location should the
      land be required for other purposes. We understand, for example, that
      the expansion of the CNOI shipyard is being delayed by the difficulty
      of moving Mauritius Coal Terminal to a site near Quay 1. Temporary
      leases on concessionary terms could also be used to avoid having land
      standing idle until suitable long-term tenants can be found.

      Port Statistics
      The process of making better use of existing assets starts with better
      information about how they are used at present. The integration of
      MPA and CHCL’s operational and financial statistics into a single Port
      Management Information System (PMIS) might lead to the develop-
      ment of better diagnostic tools that could be used to identify areas in
      the port where there is still scope for performance improvement, such
      as the under-used Bulk Sugar Terminal.
         MPA, CHCL, and Mauritius Cargo Community Services Ltd
      (MACCS) are already developing a port community information sys-
      tem that extends to importers, exporters, Mauritius Revenue Authority,
      and various other transport service providers. Smart IT applications
      would allow large numbers of transactions to be analyzed quickly,
      deepening MPA’s understanding of its customer base. Mauritius is still
      some way behind world leaders like Rotterdam and Singapore in this
      area, so additional budgetary resources may be needed to enable it to
      catch up.

      Performance Auditing
      Improving the operational performance of CHCL has for many years
      been one of the main challenges facing the port, as it is reducing the
                                                Ports and the Ocean Economy   233


productivity of existing assets below the level that could be achieved by
a private operator. For example, average crane productivity in 2016 was
only 19.9 moves per hour compared with a median value in Northern
Europe of 27.5 moves per hour, while the actual time worked per
day—after allowance for shift changes, meal breaks, etc.—was only 19
hours rather than the norm of 22 hours per day at efficient ports else-
where.
   In the past, the government has considered introducing a strategic
partner into CHCL’s shareholding structure, but has always backed
away. We recognize that this is a very sensitive political decision, but
note that continued protection of CHCL will probably reduce the
attractiveness of the island container terminal to private investors and
could limit the operational cash flow available for financing it as a pub-
lic sector investment.
   The Port Master Plan looked closely at ways of improving cargo
handling operations, but its scope did not extend as far as the organ-
izational structure and cost base of the port. Continuous monitoring
and evaluation of their own performance as businesses is now a com-
mon feature of many leading ports, forming a natural part of the busi-
ness planning cycle. It would therefore be useful to supplement Port
Louis’s physical performance indicators with detailed financial per-
formance indicators derived from MPA and CHCL’s management
accounts. This would allow the port’s overall performance—physical
and financial—to be reviewed at the level of individual installations or
cargo types.


Making It Last
How should the port sector respond to climate change and what should
it do to prevent it?

Responses to Climate Change
As sea levels rise and extreme weather events become more common,
more attention will need to be paid to protecting the port against the
consequences of climate change. This can be done in several different
ways:

•	   Monitoring weather conditions (now done automatically) and correl-
     ating them with the physical and financial consequences of extreme
     events. Consequences such as flooding and structural failures need
     to be recorded and mapped, and estimates made of the costs of the
     damage. Linking this information together will make the conse-
     quences of climate change easier to predict.
234   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      •	   Extending the analysis beyond the ports to consider not only damage
           caused by rain, winds, and sea conditions, but also the run-off regime
           of rivers flowing into the port area from the mountains behind it.
           These rivers pass through increasingly impermeable urban areas,
           where improvements to drainage could reduce damage risks to the
           port.
      •	   Ensuring that insurance policies cover extreme weather events and
           provide adequate compensation for damage.
      •	   Regularly reviewing and testing emergency response procedures,
           and actions that can be taken before the arrival of extreme weather
           events to minimize the damage caused (for example, by moving con-
           tainers to less exposed locations and tying down mobile equipment).
      •	   Designing all future investments to withstand the effects of climate
           change. Here, it would be useful to develop expected and worst-case
           scenarios for each part of the island, based on the climate change
           modeling work already carried out by the World Bank.
      •	   Investing in breakwater protection and other measures that would
           mitigate the effects of climate change. This is a very expensive
           response that needs to be carefully evaluated. The costs of building
           a breakwater to protect the MCT container terminal, for example,
           are currently estimated at US$280–370 million. A feasibility study
           for the breakwater, funded by the African Development Bank, is
           expected to begin shortly. The outputs of the World Bank’s climate
           change modeling work for Mauritius—possibly expanded—should
           provide an important input into this study.

      Measures to Reduce Climate Change
      Ports can contribute to climate change mitigation in two ways: through
      their own behavior and through their influence on the behavior of
      shipping lines. Green port policies are now becoming widespread. In the
      context of Mauritius, those related to climate change (rather than other
      forms of sustainability) include:

      •	   Better monitoring of energy consumption within the port through
           metering, plus introduction of energy-saving devices like LED light-
           ing and switches linked to movement sensors. Electricity rather than
           diesel should be used for powering equipment where possible, and
           efforts should be made to reduce engine use when equipment is on
           standby, for example for tugs and pilot launches.
           •	 Increased use of renewable energy within the port.
              •	 Photovoltaic panels can be added to warehouse roofs
                 and even installed independently as solar farms on areas
                 of unused land. Because they are easily dismantled, they
                                                  Ports and the Ocean Economy   235


            can be re-used at other locations when the unused land is
            redeveloped for port use.
         •	 MPA should not act alone in increasing its use of renewable
            energy, but should take the lead in promoting its use within
            the whole port community, sponsoring a communitywide
            plan that will allow renewable energy to be generated and
            distributed at a lower cost.
•	   Provision of cheap and accessible shore power supplies to encourage
     ships to reduce engine use in port.
•	   Regulation of activities at the Petroleum Hub to ensure, among other
     things: (i) use of double bottom tanks with leak detection systems;
     (ii) vapor recovery systems to prevent vapor leaking into the atmos-
     phere during cargo handling operations (including truck loading);
     and (iii) regular updating and testing of the emergency response plan
     for oil spills.
•	   Relocation of the open coal storage yard to a site closer to the berth,
     from which coal can be moved by a covered conveyor system rather
     than trucks. Consideration should be given to enclosing the coal stor-
     age area to prevent coal dust escaping to the atmosphere, as well as
     more conventional dust suppression measures.
•	   Control of effluents from the shipyards, fish processing factories, and
     other port-related industries.
•	   Identification of the best areas for ship-to-ship transfers at sea
     (including bunkering) that will minimize the incidence and impact
     of spills and airborne dust.

   Many green ports have opted for pricing policies as a means of
encouraging shipping companies to use more environmentally friendly
vessels. The World Ports Climate Initiative has developed an environ-
mental shipping index that scores ships’ environmental performance
based on common pollutants linked to climate change (such as nitrogen
oxide and carbon dioxide). Concessionary tariffs can then be offered to
ships whose score is above a pre-determined level.

This part of the book asks what needs to happen to ensure the long-
er-term sustainability of the ocean economy (OE). Any OE expansion
would also entail the need to cope with environmental threats coming
from a combination of anthropogenic influences and the effects of cli-
mate change. Damage to the local biotopes is already significant from
climate change, and water pollution is already significantly damaging
for coral reefs, lagoons habitats, and biodiversity. Coastal erosion and
higher vulnerability to weather extreme events is also rising. A more
active use of the OE requires technical and institutional mechanisms
to reconcile, across sectors and time, competing claims over ocean and
coastal resources.
   This is the reason why at the end of 2016 Mauritius embarked on the
process of developing a marine spatial plan (MSP). The book outlines
options that could be considered in the next stages of the MSP prep-
aration. The analysis is based on a review of international MSP experi-
ences and takes into account Mauritius-specific issues and challenges in
terms of the current legislative framework and the sources of environ-
mental pressure to be mitigated.
   Another key aspect of longer term sustainability of the OE is cli-
mate change. The final chapter of the book reviews those climate risks
that are known and those that are less well known. It illustrates how
the CGE model developed by the study team for Mauritius could be
used to quantify the socio-economic risks (notably, in terms of growth
and jobs) of climate change, focusing on a particular class of climate
shocks, namely tropical cyclones. This can help in assessing the merits
of investing in preventive adaptation measures.

Key Messages
•	 The Prime Minister’s Office announced on December 29, 2016, the intention to develop a marine spatial plan
   (MSP) for the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Republic of Mauritius to address increasing demand for marine
   space in particular fisheries and in aquaculture, tourism, and leisure.1 The purpose of this chapter is to support the
   development of MSP in Mauritius for multiple ecological and socio-economic objectives, including preparing a
   summary of environmental issues that could be addressed through coastal and marine spatial planning, sharing
   several international examples, lessons learned, and providing examples of MSP models for consideration.
•	 Globally, 22 nations or states have completed, approved, and/or implemented their own marine spatial plans,
   and planning is underway in at least 20 more. The approved plans range from policy documents through to
   regulatory plans. Mauritius can review and examine other MSP processes in formulating aspects of its own MSP
   including governance frameworks, stakeholder engagement processes, and zoning frameworks.
•	 As identified by the government, marine spatial planning is an excellent strategy to advance the ocean econ-
   omy (OE) and address climate change impacts in Mauritius. Key components of an MSP will include: clear
   objectives, stakeholder participation, and defining the geographic boundary of the plan. Following best prac-
   tices guidelines and an ecosystem-based approach, MSP in Mauritius could address spatial conflicts between
   uses, improve integration of government agencies for decision making, and prioritize key strategies to restore
   the marine ecosystem. Internationally, we have learned that there are tangible benefits to multi-objective,
   integrated MSPs over single-sector management plans, including reduced permitting times, increased coordin-
   ation between government agencies, and stakeholder buy-in for new marine protected areas.
•	 Best practices for MSP suggest that implementation plans, including new regulations, financing, timing, and
   governance structures are built into the planning outputs from day one.

      Introduction
      As Mauritius begins the process of marine spatial planning (MSP), how
      will it strike a balance between economic development, addressing
      climate change, and protecting the environment? So far, this book has
      looked at what a doubling of the OE could mean for Mauritius as a
      whole, and has assessed the potential expansion of four specific sub-sec-
      tors of the OE: energy, fisheries and aquaculture, ports, and information
      communications technologies. A recurrent finding in previous chapters
      is that expansion of the OE needs to be accompanied by improved
      management of the coastal and marine environment and by reduction
      in pressure on key natural resources such as the lagoon. This chapter
      starts by reviewing how MSP is being used around the world. After
      summarizing global best practices, it provides examples for Mauritius
      to consider for developing its own MSP.
         In September 2016, at the UN African Ministerial Conference on
      Ocean Economy and Climate Change, which was held in Mauritius,
      MSP was highlighted as a key component of developing a sustainable
      OE for nations in the Western Indian Ocean. A few months later, in
      December 2016, the Cabinet of Mauritius agreed to the elaboration of
      a Marine Spatial Plan for the Exclusive Economic Zone of Mauritius,
      in view of the increasing demand for marine space.2 Issues related to
      the UN Sustainable Development Goals, coastal zone management,
      cross-sectoral needs for jetties, embarkation/disembarkation, and mar-
      inas, as well as allocating space for offshore wind farms, aquaculture,
      deep ocean water application (DOWA), and others all require immedi-
      ate attention and planning. Mauritius has launched “expressions of

    Box 7.1.  Definitions of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP)

    MSP is a “public process of analysing and allocating the spatial and temporal dis-
    tribution of human activities in marine areas to achieve ecological, economic, and
    social objectives that are usually specified through a political process” (Ehler and
    Douvere 2009).
        IOC-UNESCO defines MSP as “a practical way to create and establish a more
    rational organization of the use of marine space and the interactions between its
    uses, to balance demands for development with the need to protect marine eco-
    systems, and to achieve social and economic objectives in an open participatory
    and planned way.” (Ehler and Douvere 2009).

and all would be subject to some MSP.3
   Marine spatial planning would accompany Mauritius’ GDP growth
strategies while simultaneously protecting the environment and improv-
ing the sustainability of its key sub-sectors: energy, fisheries and aqua-
culture, ports, and information communication technologies.


Overview of Marine Spatial Planning
The main concept of MSP is that it is a public process to allocate space
for multiple objectives, typically for economic activities and environ-
mental conservation. Principles or characteristics associated with
marine spatial planning include an ecosystem-based approach that is
area-based, integrated, adaptive, strategic, and participatory (Ehler and
Douvere 2009). Planning is undertaken using a variety of spatial and
nonspatial tools at various geographical scales including data catalogues,
compatible use matrix, and tradeoff analyses that evaluate alternate
scenarios for the future.
   Importantly, an MSP process is participatory and includes robust
stakeholder engagement and participation to have the best available
information and buy-in for the completed plan. A government mandate is
an important starting point for MSP; a recent review of 16 marine plans
around the world found that all the plans that have been implemented
to date have a high-level government mandate and the authority to
implement spatial planning vested in existing institutions (Collie et al.
2012). Additionally, these processes are iterative and adaptive, including

Bank and Mauritius Oceanographic Institute, Mauritius, September 8, 2017.

      during implementation, so the planning tools that are developed to sup-
      port the process must similarly be flexible, adaptive, and easily updated
      as new information or approaches are employed. Finally, the concept is
      multi-sectoral, involving all sectors that will be affected by the planning.
      Global best practices show the need to carefully think through imple-
      mentation plans during the planning process so that there is no loss of
      momentum from the planning phase and implementation can begin as
      soon as a plan is approved.
         Marine spatial planning was formally introduced as a concept about
      10 years ago, in 2006, and since then 13 countries have approved
      plans covering about seven percent of the surface area of the exclu-
      sive economic zones (EEZs) of the world. The Intergovernmental
      Oceanographic Commission (IOC) – UNESCO estimates that by 2025,
      40 countries will have approved plans, possibly covering over 30 per-
      cent of the world’s EEZs. The planning area for Mauritius is among the
      largest in the world, and it will join a short list of small island develop-
      ing states that are undertaking MSP.
         Why was marine spatial planning introduced as a concept in 2006?
      Initially, the intention was to develop marine protected areas in a trans-
      parent way, involving stakeholders from the sectors that would be
      affected by, or benefit from, the MPAs (e.g., Australia’s Great Barrier
      Reef). Then, as MSP grew, the rationale expanded to address rapid
      growth in the marine economic sectors, shifting consumer demand for
      more food, energy, and trade, and an increasingly larger proportion of
      goods and services coming from the marine environment as space and
      resources became more limited on land. MSP takes it origins from, and
      integrates the concepts of, ecosystem-based management and environ-
      mental impact assessments. In fact, professionals that are involved in
      these other fields can find the terminology confusing because the con-
      cepts are quite interchangeable.
         Generally speaking, there are two ways to approach an MSP: by
      developing a strategic framework or by developing a comprehen-
      sive spatial plan. Whether one or both are completed will depend on
      whether it is considered a “marine spatial plan”; if a non-spatial strategic
      plan is completed, IOC-UNESCO generally will not consider this to
      be an MSP (e.g., Canada’s plan for the Pacific North Coast Integrated
      Management Area, PNCIMA). Strategic plans are a high-level out-
      put from a planning process that identifies key strategies for manag-
      ing the ocean, and typically they develop decision-making frameworks
      (Table 7.1). Strategic plans are usually not spatial, do not involve analy-
      ses of spatial data, may or may not have full stakeholder participation,
      and usually are policy documents rather than regulatory plans. A stra-
      tegic plan may only take a few years to complete; it can be an important

Table 7.1.  Characteristics of Strategic versus Comprehensive Zoning Marine Spatial Plans
 Typology            Description

 Strategic Plan      •	   Develops a strategic framework for making decisions
                     •	   Identifies priority strategies
                     •	   Usually is not spatial; may be the first phase of a marine spatial plan
                     •	   Identifies available information and key data gaps
                     •	   May include an integrated management plan
                     •	   Has stakeholder input that may or may not involve all sectors
                     •	   Typically takes 2 to 4 years to develop
                     •	   Often serves as policy guidance, not regulatory
                     •	   Examples: Canada (PNCIMA); Malta

 Comprehensive       •	   Develops a spatial zoning design for existing and future activities and uses; multi-sectoral
 Zoning Plan         •	   Employs spatial analyses including integrated stakeholder layers, tradeoff analysis, and MPA network design
                     •	   Includes a management plan identifying allowable activities, restrictions, and prohibitions
                     •	   Relies on robust stakeholder engagement and participation
                     •	   Typically takes 4 to 10 years to develop
                     •	   Is enforceable through legislation and regulations

first phase of MSP if the time is also used to develop a spatial database
and organize stakeholder engagement for spatial planning.
   In contrast, comprehensive zoning designs are highly detailed plans
involving spatial analyses to allocate space for uses and activities.
Comprehensive zoning plans should also include (but have not always
included) spatially explicit management considerations for imple-
menting and managing activities within the zones, and they involve all
key stakeholders. Data gathering, analyses, zoning and a participatory
process can be time-consuming, so zoning plans typically take several
more years to complete than strategic plans.
   According to IOC-UNESCO’s website (updated as of March
2017), 11 countries have completed marine spatial plans (for a total
of 16 plans), 11 countries have approved plans (for a total of 13
plans), four countries have implemented their marine spatial plans
(for a total of 5 plans), and two countries have completed a five-year
review (Table 7.2.)—totaling almost 40 plans, globally. In addition, 12
countries have MSP underway and another 21 countries have either
indicated that they will have marine plans by 2021, or the planning
directives suggest that they will have by 2021, including Mauritius.
The European Union (EU) issued a Directive for MSP in July 2014
that all EU countries must complete an MSP by 2021. There are an
additional 9 countries with interest, proposals, pilots or pre-planning
activities. All told, these efforts involve 61 countries and 87 differ-
ent plans.
   There are huge ranges in the size of the planning areas for completed
MSP processes, in how long the process lasts, and in the legal status for

                             can take up to six years, depending on how much pre-planning work
                             is done and when a government determines it has started MSP. The

planning area tends to be a specific region or area, a territorial sea, or an
exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Once marine plans are completed and
approved, they may be implemented as advisory or regulatory. If plans
are advisory, it typically means that the plan contains information that
will inform, or provide advice, during decision-making. For example, in
Canada, the Marine Planning Partnership (MaPP) is an advisory plan
and is consulted, for example, to inform decisions for permits and ten-
ures in the marine environment.
   In contrast, the Belgium MSP is a regulatory plan, and so is the Belize
Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan. Regulatory plans have
more teeth when it comes to implementation; instead of a “should fol-
low” approach to future decisions they issue “must follow” directives.
However, not all governments will have the existing legislative instru-
ments to make a plan regulatory, so if new regulations are needed, this
should be built into the MSP timeline. Notwithstanding the strengths
of a regulatory plan, if an advisory plan is well written, with good sup-
port and buy-in from both government and stakeholders, it can be very
effective.
   It can be difficult to identify when a planning process actually begins
because there is a lot of preparatory work that goes into the initial
steps and this period may or may not be counted as “planning” years.
For example, for a marine planning process in Canada’s Pacific Ocean,
planning discussions started in the mid-2000s with information gather-
ing and identifying of needs, authority, and funding. During this time,
a marine conservation analysis group also began the process of compil-
ing best available data and identifying high-priority marine conserva-
tion areas using Marxan.4 This analysis took more than six years, with
more than 100 expert scientists, stakeholders and reviewers (2006–13),
and it created a spatial data catalog that is still maintained to support
decisions and other planning processes. The marine planning process
occurred between 2011 and 2015, leaving the impression that it “only”
took four years.
   Given that there are nearly 40 completed marine spatial plans,it is
helpful to think about what can be learned from these processes, in par-
ticular what worked well. It is more difficult to characterize specifically
what did not work well in a particular planning process, because such
information is rarely published; however, we address it in the summary
of Global Best Practices and “lessons learned,” below. The following

      descriptions illustrate the processes used for the types of questions or
      issues that may also need to be addressed in Mauritius.

      Belgium – Master Plan for the North Sea
      Belgium was among the first countries to implement an operational,
      multi-use MSP that covered its territorial sea and EEZ—its sea con-
      stitutes about 10 percent of the country’s territory. The first plan was
      advisory and addressed the main drivers: offshore wind and EU require-
      ments for protecting natural areas (Natura 2000 sites). The country
      then developed a master plan to allocate space for specific maritime
      uses, implemented starting in 2003, and then created a new MSP in
      2014 to lay out principles, goals, objectives, and a long-term vision. This
      new plan is legally binding and will be reviewed every six years. This
      approach may work well for Mauritius if improvements are needed in
      how decisions are made before a spatial plan can be developed. The
      approach builds an MSP in two phases, where the first plan is an advis-
      ory decision-making framework and the updated plan is spatial.

      Norway – Barents Sea – Lofoten Area and Norwegian Sea and
      North Sea Area
      The Barents Sea—Lofoten marine plan was first announced in 2001–02
      and was completed in 2006. It clarifies the overall framework and
      encourages closer coordination and clear priorities for managing
      Norway’s sea areas. These priorities increase predictability and facilitate
      coexistence among industries that are based on the use of the sea areas
      and their natural resources. The purpose of the management plan was
      to provide a framework for the sustainable use of these natural resour-
      ces and goods and maintain some structure, functioning, productivity,
      and diversity of the areas’ ecosystems. The first update, made in 2011,
      includes new knowledge, including mapping of the seabed, seabird
      populations, and geology of the area. Also updated was information
      on ecosystems, ecological goods and services, and key resources for
      value creation, trends in impacts, pressures, and environmental risk.
      The Norwegian and North Sea Area marine plan was developed to
      establish the overall political and strategic framework and guidelines for
      management across economic sectors, including fishing. An integrated
      ecosystem-based management plan was developed from 2007 to 2009,
      modeled after the Barents Sea plan. It covers 1.2 million square kilom-
      eters and is aimed at both creating value for the Norwegian economy
      and maintaining nature conservation.
         Future development was included, such as offshore wind energy. The
      plan lays out management measures for the petroleum, fishing, and mar-
      ine transport industries as well as conservation. In 2013, Charles Ehler felt
                                   Options for Adopting Marine Spatial Planning   247


that the top three plans in the world were those in Norway, Belgium, and
the Netherlands;5 at that time, there were very few comprehensive plans
completed. The Norway plans are particularly helpful to examine, because
they have not only been implemented but also recently completed their
five-year review. The approach in Norway has been to develop area plans,
rather than an EEZ plan. This may be a helpful approach for Mauritius if
the planning areas are unique or distinct enough to warrant separate plans
(e.g., for Mauritius and Rodrigues islands).

The Netherlands – National Marine Spatial Planning
The marine planning in the Netherlands has been under way since the
initial efforts in 2005 to prevent fragmentation of marine space and pro-
mote efficient use. A new MSP was introduced in 2009 in response to the
increasing interest in new activities in the North Sea—notably, developing
offshore wind farms in a manner that would not interrupt the busy naviga-
tion routes. There was also a growing demand for establishing a framework
for governmental coordination of these developments. The Netherlands
is a great example of a plan that focused on planning for a specific future
development of one activity (offshore wind) and minimizing impact on
another current activity (shipping). The Netherlands planning process was
not comprehensive, and it did not engage with all possible stakeholders, so
in the context of Mauritius it may be a type of plan that would be helpful
for the deep, offshore waters, where the main interests are deep-sea mining
(future activity) and fishing (current activity).

Canada – Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast (MaPP)
This is a comprehensive marine plan for zoning in the Province of British
Columbia, covering about 103,000 square kilometers. One of the signifi-
cant aspects of this plan is the co-led partnership between the provincial
government and 17 First Nations governments, the first such planning
process in Canada. MaPP developed three zone types and identified
more than 14,000 square kilometers of proposed new protected areas. A
cultural and economic development zone type was created—known as
a Special Management Zone—that identified important spatial locations
for First Nations culture, aquaculture development, renewable energy
development, and new or emerging tourism opportunities. This MaPP
planning process may be useful for Mauritius to examine because of
strong similarities with the North Pacific Coast: both are large geograph-

      ical areas, there is more than one distinct region for the plan, governance
      occurs at both a national and a regional level, there is a need for regional
      consistency and regional flexibility in terms of planning objectives and
      outputs, and there are simultaneous planning processes or efforts under-
      way. The MaPP study area contains far fewer people than Mauritius,
      so the process design elements, for example stakeholder engagement,
      would need to be carefully reviewed and not just replicated.

      Belize – Integrated Coastal Zone Management
      This integrated coastal zone management plan in Central America relies
      heavily on ecosystem-services modeling and creates multiple scenarios
      for development along the coast of Belize and offshore. It is driven by
      severe threats from population growth, construction, and overfishing,
      and is legislative in nature. The coast of Belize is home to the world’s
      second longest unbroken reef system, the Belize Barrier Reef, which
      contains a rich diversity of species, including three atolls and extensive
      mangrove forests. The Belize plan is a great example of a plan that has
      integrated coastal and offshore objectives and used an ecosystem-ser-
      vice approach to create scenarios and evaluate tradeoffs. The plan is
      legislated, and an implementation plan is currently being developed.


      Global Best Practices
      The IOC-UNESCO, the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Law
      Institute, and others agree that to be effective, an MSP must be

      •	   Ecosystem-based
      •	   Integrated
      •	   Place- or area-based
      •	   Adaptive
      •	   Strategic and anticipatory, and
      •	   Participatory.

         These six principles are inseparable. These underlying principles also
      align with the concept of ecosystem-based management, an integrated
      approach that considers cumulative impacts of all activities to main-
      tain (or restore) ecosystem resilience. When conducted using global
      best practices, MSP recognizes the interconnections between ecosystem
      structure and function and seeks to integrate ecological, social, eco-
      nomic and governance (or institutional) perspectives.
         What are some of the global best practices for MSP? There are sev-
      eral good resources that answer this, notably Beck et al. (2009) and
      Collie et al. (2012), as well as the consistent approaches found among
                                   Options for Adopting Marine Spatial Planning   249


plans that have reached implementation. The latter include: (i) iden-
tifying the planning area; (ii) identifying a clear spatial boundary;
(iii) choosing the geographic scale and resolution of planning that is
achievable with available resources; (iv) performing data collection and
management; (v) formulating clear objectives; (vi) devising interactive
decision support systems; (vii) having a clear government mandate; and
(viii) responding to obvious drivers and needs with clear timelines and
sufficient resources. However, because most MSPs are still fairly young,
with implementation still in the early stages for all but three plans, we
could say that these are not so much “best” as “good” practices, because
the best practices have not yet been fully identified or tested.
    To this list, we could also now add: (i) developing implementation
plans during the planning process; and (ii) identifying implementation
funding, governance structures, staff capacity, and priorities as early as
possible to ensure there is no break in momentum from plan to imple-
mentation. The first plans that were completed did not have strong imple-
mentation strategies; most plans have taken several years before imple-
mentation; and some approved plans have still not been implemented. In
contrast, some current planning processes have used innovative financing
mechanisms, like debt swaps, to create long-term funding mechanisms
for implementation and even to help support some of the planning (e.g,
Seychelles). There is a market for impact investors who are looking for
opportunities to leverage financial support in return for “green” outcomes.
    In addition to the good practices listed above, we can identify some
lessons learned from adopting these practices on-the-ground and speak
to the challenges that some of the MSP principles create so as to allow
Mauritius to learn from these experiences (Smith, unpublished). These
are described next.

Decision-making and Governance
Transparent decision-making is critical and requires a strong govern-
ance framework. Create a governance framework at the beginning of
the MSP and ensure that there is representation from government and
stakeholders at all levels of the framework, from executive or minister-
ial committees to technical working groups. The approvals process for
MSP outputs and finalizing a MSP will likely be developed near the end
of the process and should be discussed as soon as possible. Governance
frameworks may need to be adapted, revised, or updated so they should
be reviewed no less than annually and revised to reflect any gaps or
issues with representation. Clear communication and transparent deci-
sion-making goals are key for developing trust and for changing the
status quo of “top down” decision-making that lacks input from affected
economic and social sectors.

      Spatial Data
      Most geographies do not have enough information to make sci-
      ence-based decisions for all possible activities however this should not
      hold up the process. Rather than develop data inventories for all possible
      uses or issues, clearly define the scope for the MSP and decide what data
      are required from that list. Also, there typically are data gaps for human
      uses or sectoral spatial information that can be overcome using partici-
      patory mapping and optimization models; generally in all MSP processes
      there is an ongoing need to develop or identify spatially-explicit data
      for socio-economic uses. To that end, building a flexible spatial data
      framework in a GIS that is adaptive to changes in the MSP Spatial Data
      Catalogue is an important element of a planning process; data layers
      will be added throughout the entire process. All spatial data will need
      to be viewed and reviewed by stakeholders, especially sectoral uses but
      also data on biodiversity for species and habitats.. Some marine planning
      processes use a decision-support tools (DSTs) such as an online data
      layer viewer and planning tool to share spatial information with process
      participants and engage them in interactive sketching and analyses (like
      SeaSketch). DST’s that do not require internet connections include
      Adobe GeoPDF, a product that can be formulated to hold more than
      50 data layers and have participatory map in using plugins. Spatial data
      can also be viewed using an online and/or printed MSP atlas, a relatively
      modestly priced planning tool that can bring a process to life.

      Resolution of the Planning Outputs
      Choosing at what resolution the data need to be identified is a critical
      decision, and it should be made such that it matches or aligns with both
      the planning objectives and the availability of spatial data. For example,
      an EEZ-wide MSP does not usually require high-resolution data if the
      zones or planning units are going to be thousands of square kilometers
      large. If, however, the MSP is for a much smaller area and the zones are
      expected to be similarly small (tens of square kilometers), then coarse-
      scale data will not be adequate to support evidence-based decisions
      (Box 7.1).

      Timelines
      There is never enough time. Timelines or workplan milestones are
      always a challenge and are often too ambitious given the amount of
      uncertainty in a planning process, but without timelines and deadlines
      things will not get done. Output development during a rapid timeline
      can be overcome by limiting the number of planning objectives, increas-
      ing staff, increasing the number of consultancies, and creating realistic
      milestones (with the understanding that they might change). An MSP
                                    Options for Adopting Marine Spatial Planning   251


is, by nature, a political process, so other factors, such as elections, can
affect timelines, and a planning process must adapt and keep moving
forward as best as possible. Sometimes, a planning process cannot move
forward publicly while stakeholder consultations are still underway;
however, there is usually much to be done behind the scenes, so to
speak, that does not need extensive stakeholder review (e.g., compile
new data, write methodology text).

Integration and Synergies
As in other MSP processes around the world, Mauritius will have simul-
taneous and parallel initiatives or projects in their marine waters that
need to be integrated, aligned with, and synergized with the objectives
of the MSP process to avoid redundancy, or legal issues related to
authority and jurisdiction. It is important to identify all of these projects
early on and dedicate staff time to tracking and integrating them with
all relevant initiatives. During stakeholder meetings, dedicate an agenda
item to ask for updates and information on new activities or initiatives
to understand objectives, outputs, and timelines.

Land-sea Linkages
Depending on the nature of the activities and the environmental dam-
age or issues in a planning area, an MSP should include both coastal and
marine areas to explicitly make the connection between land and sea
for planning. At the very least, any new marine protected areas should
consider the adjacency of terrestrial protected areas to enhance the level
of protection for both areas.

Stakeholder Engagement
Stakeholder engagement is an essential MSP “best practice.” The diffi-
culty of the engagement can vary—from easy to achieve to complex
to achieve—depending on the geography and existing organization of
stakeholders in associations or committees. Stakeholder support funding
can assist with engagement before, during, and after meetings to provide
input on planning outputs. A stakeholder engagement framework needs
to be transparent, flexible, and adaptive to stakeholders’ needs; it is
important to monitor and evaluate stakeholder engagement on a regular
basis and encourage stakeholders to comment on and contribute to the
structure of the governance framework. 

Staff Capacity and Training
The challenge of having enough staff (and consultants) to undertake
all aspects of an MSP can be immense, and it is likely to remain so.
It must be managed with respect to timelines and outputs, yet nearly
252   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      every process suffers from being understaffed. Building local capacity is
      important, as is having access to training, mentors, advisors, and experts.

      Keep Moving Forward
      Planning processes can face many obstacles to moving forward, ran-
      ging from minor barriers that can be overcome with innovation and
      creativity (e.g., lack of spatial data for a particular sector) to significant
      political barriers that cause a process to come to a temporary halt (e.g.,
      elections). Regardless of the obstacles, it is important to keep moving
      forward and making progress. Also, there may be instances where cer-
      tain sectors choose to withdraw or temporarily not participate because
      of governance or decision-making issues and progress must still be made
      in other areas.


      Key Marine Environmental Issues in Mauritius
      A key step in preparing for an MSP is to identify and understand the
      issues, opportunities, and trends in both the environmental and eco-
      nomic sectors. The other chapters in this book provide a summary of
      the key economic sectors in relation to the OE in Mauritius. What
      follows here is a brief summary of the condition of, and threats to, key
      habitat or ecosystem types in relation to human uses and activities in
      Mauritius. It is crucial to get agreement from government and stake-
      holders on the list of environmental issues, and decide what is inside and
      what is outside the scope of an MSP process—this list is not meant to
      provide that scope. It may be necessary to place limitations on the scope
      of the planning relative to the list of issues that are identified by stake-
      holders to align with resources available and the timeline of the MSP.
      It is perhaps helpful to realize that rarely can all issues be addressed
      or resolved in the first version of a marine plan and that it is advisable
      to regularly review and update a marine plan. What is important is to
      identify, prioritize, and include those issues of greatest urgency where
      recommendations are likely to be actionable—realistic deliverables
      are key to retaining momentum in a planning process and carrying it
      through implementation.
         In order to ensure an efficient and sustainable management of marine
      uses and activities in Mauritius, scientific information is needed, such
      as biophysical characteristics, carrying capacity, and ecosystem service
      values. Maritime surveillance can provide authorities with a picture of
      what is happening at sea with respect to pressure on marine resources
      and improve monitoring and enforcement.
         In Mauritius, the main environmental problems for corals, fish,
      lagoons, mangrove, and seagrass are associated with human activities,

in some cases multiple human activities (Table 7.4). The key anthropo-
genic stressors are agricultural run-off, fisheries pressure and overfish-
ing, wastewater pollution, sedimentation of nearshore habitats, loss of
mangroves6 and seagrass, destruction of coral reefs, and erosion from
coastal development. Two significant climate change related issues are
sea level rise and warm ocean temperatures. Water pollution is caused
mainly by sewage and agricultural chemicals entering the coastal eco-
system. Plastic pollution is caused by garbage entering the ocean,
including microplastics, and is a threat to fish, seabirds, whales, turtles
and nearly all marine life.
   Anthropogenic (human-made) stressors can harm a variety of biota
and ecosystem services. Similarly, a single biota or ecosystem service
may experience cumulative effects from multiple anthropogenic stres-
sors. Table 7.4 illustrates some of the key linkages between stressors and
biota/ecosystem services in Mauritius—although the matrix may not
account for all the potential downstream effects of each stressor and
the indirect effects to other ecosystem components, species, or habitats.

Coral Reefs
Healthy coral reefs are hotspots of biodiversity (Bellwood and Hughes
2001) and are also economically important, especially to the tour-



6There has been a historical loss of mangroves, although restoration efforts are
now increasing their area.
254   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      ism and fisheries sectors (Naim, Pascale, and Mangar 2000; Spalding,
      Ravillious, and Green 2001). Anthropogenic stressors include increased
      sea surface temperatures due to climate change, water quality degrad-
      ation, destructive fishing practices, and sedimentation. On a global
      scale, climate change is considered a major threat to coral reef habitats
      (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999). In 1998, reefs in the Western Indian Ocean
      (WIO) experienced a widespread bleaching event associated with ele-
      vated sea surface temperatures (Turner 1999; Turner et al. 2000). While
      the impacts on Mauritian reefs were not as severe as on other WIO
      reefs, mild bleaching events were nevertheless widespread (Moothien-
      Pillay, Terashima, and Kawasaki 2002; Turner and Klaus 2005). As
      coral bleaching events continue to occur in the region, concerns about
      bleaching due to climate stress remain (Ramessur 2013).
         In Mauritius, the primary stressors on coral reef ecosystems are
      thought to originate with more localized pollution sources (sewage,
      industrial effluence and agricultural run-off), which lead to eutrophica-
      tion and sedimentation (Baird 2013). Coral die-offs have been observed
      in lagoons containing high nutrient loads (Ramessur 2002), and in 2012
      live coral declines of 10–30 percent in coastal lagoons were attrib-
      uted to deterioration in water quality from industrial wastes (Ramessur
      2013). These stressors can also have a combined effect. For example,
      one study concludes that the combination of eutrophication from sew-
      age outfall and overfishing could further degrade Mauritius reefs by
      promoting overpopulation of grazing urchins (Thomassin et al.,1998).
      Other destructive fishing methods (including large net fishing and bas-
      ket traps) can also physically damage corals, as can activities associated
      with tourism (including reef walking, boating, and snorkeling) (Turner
      and Klaus 2005; Ramessur 2002).

      Fisheries
      Fisheries are a pillar of the Mauritian OE—with production valued at
      over US$580 million per year, and the sector employing about 20,000
      people (Kelleher 2016). Healthy fisheries are also associated with
      enhanced revenue from tourism (Sobhee 2006), and artisanal fishing
      in lagoons and reefs matters both culturally and as a source of food
      security to some coastal communities. In Mauritius, artisanal fisheries
      are becoming increasingly overfished and will likely exceed, or have
      already exceeded, sustainable catch levels (Turner and Klaus 2005;
      Kelleher 2016). Although limited data make it difficult to assess the
      overall status of the fisheries (Van der Elst et al. 2005), a key concern
      is overfishing, particularly of coral reef fisheries (Turner et al. 2000;
      Boistal et al. 2011). Fortunately, measures are in place to encourage
      artisanal fishers to fish outside of the lagoon using fish aggregation
                                    Options for Adopting Marine Spatial Planning   255


devices (Ramessur 2002), and expanding aquaculture activities is being
promoted as a more sustainable complement to exploiting wild fisheries
(Ramessur 2002; Kelleher 2016).
   While fishing practices can impact ecosystems, the health of eco-
systems can, in return, affect the health of fisheries. One recent study
found that coral reef fisheries in Mauritius had relatively low vulnerabil-
ity to stress from climate change, yet climate stress on coral reef eco-
systems was a concern (Cinner et al. 2011). Degradation of water qual-
ity in fish habitats (like lagoons and coral reefs) can also be expected to
harm fisheries overall.

Lagoons
As lagoons provide a habitat for coral reefs, water quality and ecosystem
dynamics in Mauritian lagoons constitute important environmental
issues. Increasing development in the coastal zone has resulted in more
sewage discharge into lagoons, resulting in an overall degradation of
water quality. One study in the early 2000s noted an algal invasion
resulting from eutrophication in the Blue Bay lagoon (Ramessur 2002),
and another study noted algal blooms that indicated excess nutrients in
the Péréybere, Grand Bay, and Palmar lagoons (Baird 2013). Another
major stressor on coral reef ecosystems is poor water quality, which
can come from polluted lagoons—and agriculture is believed to be the
primary source of dissolved phosphate in lagoons via leaching from
groundwater. Heavy metal contamination has been documented in
lagoons, and hot spots of sediment, seawater, and biotic contamination
were found in locations associated with untreated sewage and/or indus-
trial effluent (Daby 2006). Submarine groundwater discharge is another
possible source. (JICA 2013; Ramessur 2013).
   The shoreline of the Flic en Flac lagoon is a popular public beach. A
study of this lagoon’s physical, chemical, and biological characteristics
for 1999–2000 notes relatively stable water quality parameters, includ-
ing safe levels of coliform indicators (Chineah et al. 2002), but this and
similar studies highlight the value of continuing to monitor water qual-
ity at popular tourist sites. There is also a potential for sea level rise to
indirectly impact ecosystem dynamics in coastal lagoons by introdu-
cing non-native species from other parts of the lagoon-reef complex,
although the severity and the nature of that threat is not easily pre-
dicted (Baird 2013).
   Oil spills are another concern in the lagoons. In 2016, the motor
vessel Benita sank off the coast of Le Bouchon, in the southeast of
Mauritius. The spill was immediately put under control in order to pre-
vent the oil from reaching the Blue Bay Marine Park, a protected area
and Ramsar convention site; however, the oil spill did reach the coast
256   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      of Brocus Island, near Le Bouchon, and caused environmental damage.
      Development in the port area plus an increase in vessel traffic entering
      the territorial sea are concerns for future oil spills and the risks to the
      fragile ecosystems in the lagoons and throughout Mauritius.

      Mangroves
      Mangroves are important coastal ecosystems in Mauritius because they
      offer a buffer against coastal erosion and wave action, protect lagoons
      from the effects of sedimentation, and provide habitats for ecologically
      and economically important wildlife (Mauritius 1991; Appadoo 2003).
      The major threat to mangroves is habitat loss due to development
      for residential, industrial, commercial, and agricultural purposes—and
      studies show that Mauritius experienced a loss of 30 percent of its
      mangroves between 1987 and 1994 (Mauritius 1991; Ramessur 2002;
      Appadoo 2003; Mamoun, Nigel, and Rughooputh 2013). Many man-
      groves are located in close proximity to highly developed areas and
      face continuing threats from the prospect of their continued expansion
      (Hammond et al. 2015). Although mangrove coverage continues to
      decline, a mangrove restoration program has been instituted, and as of
      2010 nearly 23 hectares had been restored (Mauritius 2010).

      Coastal Shoreline
      Many areas of the coastline have experienced high levels of erosion due
      to natural events such as cyclones (Ramessur 2002). Development of
      coastal areas can further exacerbate coastal erosion, which can decrease
      protection from, and resilience to, sea level rise. In addition, the loss
      of mangrove habitats can leave coastal communities vulnerable to the
      impacts of coastal erosion and damage from waves. Sea level rise can lead
      to increased storm run-up and wave action, which can damage coastal
      areas. For example, heavy rainfall and subsequent flash flooding attrib-
      uted to climate change have both been increasing in recent years, particu-
      larly in the Port-Louis area (Ramessur 2013). Although coastal protec-
      tion projects have been implemented in a number of locations, existing
      shoreline protections are likely to be inadequate in preventing increasing
      rates of erosion throughout the island, which in turn is expected to harm
      infrastructure, ecosystems, and by extension, tourism (Ramessur 2002).

      Seagrasses
      Loss of seagrasses can harm fisheries and contribute to coastal erosion
      (Fonseca 1989; Gullstrom et al. 2002). Eutrophication, sedimentation,
      bottom trawls, and other seafloor activities can also damage seagrass
      beds (Kemp et al. 1983; Tomasko, Dawes, and Hall 1996; McGlathery
      2001; Gullstrom et al. 2002; Ramessur 2002). In the West Indian Ocean,
                                    Options for Adopting Marine Spatial Planning   257


increasing coastal populations and overexploitation of resources are put-
ting seagrass populations at risk. (Gullstrom et al. 2002). Historically,
sand mining in coastal lagoons has contributed to the degradation of
seagrasses; however, after sand mining was banned in Mauritius in 2001,
some recuperation of seagrasses has been observed (Mauritius 2010).


Data for Environmental Issues
All of the aforementioned environmental issues require associated data
in order to evaluate condition, threats, and status for a planning process
in Mauritius. In any MSP process, there are data and knowledge gaps
and processes that tend to be characterized as “data poor” or “data rich”
according to status of available data and its quality. While it is doubtful
that any MSP process has all the data necessary for making every deci-
sion, this does not and should not prevent a process from moving for-
ward. Sometimes data can be created, and at other times questions may
need to be modified or addressed later, when the missing data become
available. If data are not available and a decision is necessary, then proxy
data or other information may help to inform the decision, or a decision
can be made with a notation on what basis it rests for the sake of full
transparency. Given the list of environmental issues in Mauritius noted
above and elsewhere in this book, an assessment of data needs and an
inventory of available data will reveal the data gaps and provide import-
ant perspectives on what is possible to address now and what will need
to be addressed in the future.
   For example, an up-to-date map of coral reef cover will be needed
to address coastal protection and restoration objectives and priorities,
including in relation to coastal protection and coral reef restoration. In
Mauritius, the most recent survey of coral reef cover was done in 2012–
13, conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
in support of the Ministry of Environment, Sustainable Development,
Disaster and Beach Management (MoESDDBM) for a project related
to capacity development on coastal protection and rehabilitation in
Mauritius (JICA 2015). This and all other datasets will need to be
examined and evaluated for their application to address MSP objectives.
   In summary, an inventory of available ecological and socioeconomic
data will reveal what can and cannot be addressed during a planning
process, and strategies developed to gather or create new data for future
revisions.

Existing Marine Protected Areas
One aspect of understanding the state of the environment is to inven-
tory existing marine protected areas and have a clear understanding of
258   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      the current level of protections afforded to the marine environment
      in Mauritius as well as international commitments. The Republic of
      Mauritius is committed to the 2030 UN Sustainable Development
      Goals, which call for 10 percent marine protection by 2030; currently
      marine protected areas comprise less than 1 percent of the country’s
      EEZ. Mauritius ranks third in the world for the number of endan-
      gered species (2001), and according to the International Union for the
      Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the United Nations Environment
      Programme’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC),
      only 50 square kilometers of marine waters are covered by marine pro-
      tected areas (MPAs), constituting less than 1 percent of Mauritius’s total
      marine area (note that this area does not include marine reserves or the
      marine protected area in Rodrigues).7 There are 31 areas with marine
      protection in Mauritius, and each area falls into one of seven categories:
      marine parks, fishing reserves, marine reserves, marine protected areas,
      turtle reserves, and nature reserves (Appendix 5). It will be necessary to
      evaluate both the categories and the level of protection during the MSP
      process and decide if these categories or designations suffice, or if new
      categories should be considered, potentially through zoning.


      Review of Administrative Instruments in Relation to Marine
      Spatial Planning
      In view of making MSP a reality in Mauritius, six governmental and
      nongovernmental institutions are taking the first steps toward devel-
      oping a marine spatial plan. It is important to understand the strengths
      of these institutions, and what activities are currently taking place. A
      workplan with timelines and outputs will also be needed to articulate
      the roles and responsibilities of the different institutions so as to sup-
      port MSP within the context of Mauritius. The six institutions and their
      roles to date are described next—as the MSP progresses, the roles of
      these institutions may change.

      Prime Minister’s Office
      In December 2016, Cabinet approved the elaboration of an MSP in the
      EEZ of Mauritius. At the level of the Prime Minister’s Office, research
      is currently being undertaken with regard to MSP to ensure smooth
      management and implementation of the plan.

Ministry of Environment, Sustainable Development and Disaster
and Beach Management
In the year 2000, an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)
Division was created under the aegis of the Ministry of Environment,
Sustainable Development and Disaster and Beach Management in order
to “maintain a high quality coastal environment and conserve coastal and
marine biodiversity.” With the development of MSP in Mauritius and its
outer islands, the ICZM Division will have the responsibility of ensuring
that the plan’s implementation is sustainable, as well as engaging with
other organizations to continue the preservation of marine biodiversity.

Ministry of Ocean Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries and
Shipping
This particular ministry will have a crucial role to play in the imple-
mentation of MSP in Mauritius. Being the parent ministry for the
development of the OE, its major task will be to strike the right bal-
ance between ensuring economic growth and social development of the
people on the one hand and ascertaining the sustainable use of aquatic
resources on the other.

Mauritius Oceanography Institute (MOI)
The MOI is responsible for collecting, coordinateing, storing and dis-
seminating information related to oceanography. Furthermore, it can help
policymakers to make laws that can be tailor-made to protect the marine
biodiversity of Mauritius and its outer islands. Referring to its mandate,
the MOI would host the database framework to provide a centralized
information system for MSP. The MOI serves as the technical arm of the
Ministry of Ocean Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries and Shipping.
The mission of MOI is identified in a Strategic Plan 2016–2020 and
further reinforced under the Budget Speech 2016–2017 and through
the Sub-Committee on Agro-Economy, Ocean Economy, Tourism and
Financial Services, under the Task Force on Economy. To support the MSP,
MOI will develop a database of ocean parameters for aquaculture sites and
a geographic information system (GIS). There are volumes of published,
scientific studies of the marine environment in Mauritius, as well as many
ongoing ocean studies in the region including studies of fish population
genetics. The University of Mauritius (UoM) and the MOI will both play
key roles in identifying the relevant information from those studies and
developing new information and analyses necessary for an MSP.

National Ocean Council (NOC)
In 2015, the National Ocean Council was created with a mandate to
coordinate the activities of the different stakeholders in development of
260   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      the OE. The NOC’s mandate is to assess the provision of modern logistics,
      infrastructure and services for the development of the maritime and ship-
      ping industry and formulate a new action plan for the shipping industry.

      University of Mauritius (UoM)
      The UoM has received the mandate from the government to handle
      the training and education aspect of the OE concept. In line with this,
      in 2014 a Faculty of Ocean Studies was created at UoM to provide
      both postgraduate and undergraduate courses to students. Furthermore,
      research in the fields of marine and ocean science, ocean engineering,
      and maritime trade and finance is also being done by the academics in
      order to contribute to the development of the OE. In addition to the
      courses designed for students, workshops as well as conferences are
      being organized to inform the general public about the activities con-
      ducted in relation to the development of the OE.


      Legal Issues and Recommendations
      In addition to the capacity found at the above institutions, there are no
      fewer than 25 Acts or frameworks in Mauritius that are relevant to MSP.
      As is detailed in Appendix 6, in Mauritius there exists an extensive list
      of legal instruments that can be used for the implementation of MSP.
      Despite the presence of these laws, some gaps in policy do exist and are
      discussed below, with recommendations for the MSP.
          The first gap that can be underlined is linked to the formulation of
      MSP in the existing laws. None of the acts listed in Appendix 6 gives
      a precise definition of marine spatial planning or elaborates on the
      concept. Despite the fact that there is the Integrated Coastal Zone
      Management Framework and other laws that embodies the spirit of
      MSP, none of the existing legislation in Mauritius actually serves as a
      unique legal tool to frame MSP. It is recommended that, since the plan-
      ning process is starting for the implementation of MSP in Mauritius, a legal
      framework be developed to outline the structure and legal implications
      involved in MSP.
          A second gap can be linked to conflict resolution. Although MSP
      aims at avoiding conflict among its users, there is always the risk of con-
      flict arising. For the time being, not much has been stated about how
      conflicts are to be resolved among the various stakeholders. It is recom-
      mended that a conflict resolution mechanism be developed to provide for an
      effective and efficient way of resolving conflict among the various users of
      the sea. It is being proposed that either (i) an Arbitration Tribunal should
      be established to provide for arbitration services as a way to solve disputes
      among the parties, or else (ii) parties should have recourse to the existing
                                     Options for Adopting Marine Spatial Planning   261


Environment and Land Use Appeal Tribunal, which would receive the
mandate to settle disputes.
    Thirdly, an observation that one may consider as a gap in policy relates
to the status and definitions of Marine Protected Areas in Mauritian law.
The Fisheries and Marine Resources Act 2007, at Section 4, provides
for the types of area that can be classified as Marine Protected Areas.
However, the intrinsic elements that a particular area is required to pos-
sess to be classified as a Marine Protected Area are not defined in this
Act. For example, Section 4 states that the relevant minister can declare
any area in a maritime zone—including the seabed underlying such
zones—any land associated with the maritime zones, or any wetland
to be a Marine Protected Area. Along with these, the minister may also
designate a Marine Protected Area to be a Fishing Reserve; a Marine
Park; or a Marine Reserve. What is being underlined here is the lack of
information about what features in these above-mentioned areas justify
their designation as a Marine Protected Area. It is recommended that the
law be reviewed to be more explicit about what characteristics a particular
area requires to have the status of a Marine Protected Area. The advantage
of doing so in the context of MSP will be that it will help the users to spot
an area fulfilling the characteristics provided by the law and avoid using
it for commercial purposes. Furthermore, with explicit features stated in the
law, there will be more transparency as to the places that need to be pro-
tected as MPAs and areas that fall outside the definition can be used for
other purposes. By having clearly defined MPAs and measures taken to con-
serve them, this will allow Mauritius to achieve the 10% coastal and mar-
ine areas to be protected as requested by the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity targets.


Examples of Models for Marine Spatial Planning for Mauritius
The process of proposing models for MSP in Mauritius involved a num-
ber of steps after summarizing the aforementioned information about
global MSP and lessons learned, environmental issues in Mauritius, legal
instruments, and so forth. At a minimum, we need to understand what
the enabling conditions are; what the drivers are; what the proposed
objectives or needs are; what sectors are involved; what is the appropri-
ate geographic scale to address the drivers and meet the objectives; and
what is achievable given the timelines and resources.
    Prior to proposing a model, a high-level review and analysis of
enabling conditions in Mauritius was undertaken for this book. The
Nature Conservancy’s Global Oceans Team has developed a check-
list to assist with this exercise, and based on the mission to Mauritius
in September 2016, an initial assessment was completed (Table 7.5).
The purpose of the checklist was to gain situational awareness for MSP

 Criteria              Summary

 Driver                Government and stakeholders say that planning is needed to plan for marine uses and avoid conflicts.
                       The benefits to the OE can be translated through the sustainable development of sectors such
                       aquaculture, fisheries, tourism, ocean energy and biotechnology.a For these and other activities in the
                       lagoons, issues that need to be addressed include overlapping and conflicting activities, as well as deep-
                       sea mineral exploration, coastal beach erosion, and reducing the negative impacts of waste water and
                       agricultural run-off to lagoons. Clear messages about objectives are needed, along with discussions on
                       how one process would handle all these issues.b

 Government            The Prime Minister’s Office has the authority for marine spatial planning under the Maritime Zones Act,
 authority             and MoESDDBM has authority to manage the “coastal zone” and +1 kilometer inland/offshore—both
                       agencies are interested in MSP, and MoESDDBM in particular is interested in an integrated coastal zone
                       management plan.

 Government            At the National Ocean Council Workshop in September 2016, there was a lot of support for marine
 champion              spatial planning—with likely champions being the Prime Minister’s Office and MoESDDBM. Now, with
                       the declaration of the MSP in December 2016, it will be decided who will lead the MSP in Mauritius.

 Financial             Funding for marine spatial planning is essential, but it is unclear where financing will come from for the
 Resources             MSP process and what the total amount needed in Mauritius will be. Innovative financing mechanisms
                       like debt swaps and the creation of conservation funds can support implementation of MSP, and in
                       some cases even the planning process itself.

 Local staff           The Prime Minister’s Office and MoESDDBM have staff that either do planning or engage in other
 capacity              activities that support planning. Some ministries already have planning staff for land-use plans (including
                       experience with GIS). In fall 2016, the Prime Minister’s Office was hiring four new staff to advance an MSP
                       (data portal, GIS database, and ocean observatory). The Prime Minister’s Office has recent experience
                       with spatial planning, siting a Deep Ocean Water Application near Port Louis.

 Spatial data          There will be much data to evaluate in Mauritius and determine if it is at the scale needed for the
                       MSP. The Prime Minister’s Office will begin to compile data layers and build an ocean observatory
                       and data portal. Mapping of the coral reefs is not up-to-date and will need to be a priority for MSP in
                       the coastal zone; the last mapping was in 1996. MOI, UoM, and Mauritius Fisheries Institute are good
                       sources of spatial data outside the ministries. The Prime Minister’s Office is committed to developing
                       an Ocean Observatory Database to begin collecting or collating data for the marine environment.
                       In February 2017, the Department of Continental Shelf, and Maritime Zones Administration have
                       initiated the development of a Geographical Information System and data catalogue to undertake the
                       MSP. Stakeholders and strategic partners have begun the work of identifying relevant spatial layers to
                       contribute to this system.

 Scientific            There are volumes of published, scientific studies for the marine environment in Mauritius, and many
 information and       on-going studies in the ocean including fish population genetics. The UoM and the MOI will play key
 knowledge             roles in identifying and developing information and analyses necessary for a MSP. The MOI is responsible
                       “to collect, coordinate, store, and disseminate information related to oceanography.” MoESDDBM will be
                       an important source of information related to climate change and coastal habitats.

 Legal instruments     There are several acts that authorize marine activities; the Maritime Zones Act is a key piece of legislation
                       for the authority to plan. An in-depth analysis of the legal instruments would normally be undertaken
                       during a marine planning process once the outputs of a plan are decided to understand what is needed
                       to implement an MSP (including new policy and laws).

 Stakeholders          Local stakeholders appear to be enthusiastic about participation and have recently attended a
 consultations         Coordinating Committee workshop. Some of the sectors are organized with associations, and it is
                       unclear in terms of the number of staff and resources available for participating in a multi-year MSP
                       process.

(prior to the announcement by the government in December 2016) and
identify possible gaps that may pose a challenge for an MSP process.
This checklist helps to inform the type of MSP in Mauritius that could
be undertaken immediately. For example, hypothetically, if it were
learned that there were no spatial data at this time, the recommenda-
tion would be to focus on non-spatial tasks first, while the spatial data
inventory was being developed.
   In Mauritius, there are clear drivers for MSP such as siting for aqua-
culture, resolving spatial conflicts between fisheries, tourism and other
activities in the lagoons, and addressing pollution and coastal erosion.
There is a government authority for MSP and there is at least one gov-
ernment champion. While it is unclear what financial resources are
available to undertake MSP, there appear to be staff resources in several
ministries and a great interest in starting MSP. The availability of spa-
tial data is being examined by the Prime Ministers’ Office with support
from the MOI, and there appears to be a robust scientific community
with many published and ongoing marine studies. There are several rel-
evant legal instruments, although this will need to be looked at much
more closely during the MSP process itself. Finally, there was a positive
reception for MSP from stakeholders who participated in an “MSP deep
dive” held at MOI in September 2016. A proper assessment of capacity,
resources and internal coordination will be needed before a framework
for stakeholder engagement could be developed.
   The environmental drivers that MoESDDBM has identified are:
coastal protection, controlling beach erosion, climate change impacts,
and controlling pollution of the marine environment (from wastewater
and agricultural runoff). The economic drivers identified by the Prime
Minister’s Office include renewable energy, non-renewable resources
(such as deep-sea minerals), and fisheries. The social drivers identified
by the stakeholders include capacity building, collaboration, communi-
cation, participation, and dialogue (see Appendix 4).
   Following the identification of the drivers, it is necessary to under-
stand the objective(s) for MSP. On December 29, 2016, the govern-
ment announced that it is preparing an MSP for the EEZ:

    The main purpose of marine spatial planning is to identify the
    utilization of marine space for different sea uses in accord-
    ance with national policies and legislation, while taking into
    consideration the preservation, protection and improvement
    of marine environment, including resilience to climate change
    impacts. Furthermore, the Plan will also contribute to the
    effective management of marine activities and the sustainable
    use of marine and coastal resources through the creation of
264   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


           a framework for consistent, transparent, sustainable and evi-
           dence-based decision-making. The elaboration of the Marine
           Spatial Plan is in line with the implementation of the 2030
           UN Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable
           Development Goals.8

         The government is proposing an ecosystem-based approach, looking
      to integrate coastal economic activities, dynamic coastal processes, cli-
      mate/water cycles, living resources, preservation of ecosystem services,
      and non-living resources (Radal and Runghen 2016).
         The proposed MSP would cover an area of about 2.3 million square
      kilometers, according to a Cabinet decision on May 27, 2016.
         With a large EEZ, a decision will be needed about the scale of the
      MSP. What does an MSP’s geographic boundary entail? It is typically
      understood to be from the high tide (or high water) mark to offshore
      waters. The offshore boundary is decided by the planning authority and
      could range from hundreds of meters to the entire 200 nautical mile
      EEZ. For Mauritius, the Prime Minister’s Office has indicated that MSP
      will be for the EEZ. Typically, there is some overlap between the EEZ
      and the marine sectors in the country’s territorial sea, yet there are sev-
      eral sectors that occur only in one of these geographies (Box 7.2). Thus,
      stakeholder participation needs to be tailored to the sectors that will
      benefit from or be impacted by the planning. The spatial scale of the
      use, economic or financial investments, and potential environmental
      impacts may be different between the coastal industries and the off-
      shore industries, and this should be a consideration in planning with
      respect to how to engage the stakeholders and how often.
         As for the Integrated Coastal Zone Management area (ICZM), it is
      usually defined as management of adjacent lands and waters, typically
      from one kilometer inland to one kilometer offshore. The integrated
      component of an ICZM means that it is for multiple sectors and that
      government agencies are integrated on decisions regarding objectives,
      strategies, management plans, budgets, staffing, implementation, mon-
      itoring, and enforcement.

      Examples of MSP Models
      Two examples of MSP models for Mauritius are presented, based on
      the review of information above, and discussions with governmenta
      and stakeholders in Mauritius. Both models assume an ecosystem-based

approach to the plan, using global best practices, incorporating lessons
learned from other geographies, planning for multiple objectives includ-
ing climate change adaptation, and that the planning area includes both
the coastal and offshore marine environments. Given the December
2016 announcement to undertake MSP, these examples are provided
based on analysis of MSP processes from 2006-present, with associated
advantages and disadvantages.

Example 1: First, develop a high-level strategic framework for deci-
sion-making and management of marine economic sectors (see Table
7.1). The framework will guide development and future marine invest-
ments, identify the highest priorities in terms of environmental issues to
address in Mauritius, and identify future developments likely to create
spatial conflicts with existing uses. Implement and monitor the strategic
plan for five years, revise and adapt where necessary, and then develop a
266   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      spatial plan with zones and management considerations. During the five-
      year monitoring period, spatial data are gathered, systematic conserva-
      tion planning and other analyses are undertaken to identify high priority
      conservation areas, stakeholder engagement is organized and funded,
      and governance structures are developed. This would be similar to the
      approach that Norway used to develop a comprehensive MSP. It has the
      advantage of ensuring that the decision-making framework is robust,
      tested, and adapted based on government and stakeholder feedback
      before spatial planning begins. It also has the advantage that more spatial
      data are likely to be available in the second phase in order to make deci-
      sions. It has the disadvantage that allocation of space for new activities
      might not occur for up to 10 years and the urgency of MSP may be lost.

      Example 2: Develop a decision-making framework and comprehensive
      zoning design simultaneously or sequentially, but without a period of adap-
      tation prior to implementing the complete MSP. This approach has the
      advantage of planning for future activities within the next five to six years,
      planning for increased marine protection to meet the UN Convention of
      Biological Diversity goal (10 percent by 2020), immediately starting to
      address climate change impacts, generating momentum with stakeholders
      without any disruptions, and completing the whole plan before undertak-
      ing monitoring and a five-year review. It has the disadvantage that spatial
      data may not be available for all decisions and it may exceed resour-
      ces available in the short-term (i.e., need more time for fundraising).


      Making it Happen
      Marine spatial planning has begun in Mauritius, with the first
      Coordinating Committee meeting in February 2017 to apprise stake-
      holders of the government’s decision. A questionnaire survey was pre-
      pared and given to stakeholders to begin the process of identifying mari-
      time space usage. The questionnaire requested stakeholders to identify
      priority use areas within the EEZ and Territorial Sea that need to be
      included in the planning. Also, it was proposed at that time to establish
      technical committees for each of the major sectors for the zoning and
      management plan creation.

      Sequence of Steps
      Once an overall approach is decided (see example models, above), the
      steps for MSP are fairly straightforward, although there are varying
      viewpoints on this as well. A 2009 report from the Environmental Law
      Institute prepared an excellent summary of the ideal stages of MSP, fea-
      turing steps from the Massachusetts Ocean Action Plan (Gopnik 2008)

Douvere 2009). The major difference between these two approaches is
that the Massachusetts Ocean Action Plan specifically calls for scenario
analysis and tradeoffs (or negotiation), whereas the MSP Guidebook does
not. A comparison of the two approaches is laid out in Table 7.6. What
may not be obvious from the table is that planning is iterative and will
necessarily seem like it is going backwards in order to go forward. For
example, new data must be integrated into the spatial data catalogue and
developing updated spatial products, like maps and models.
   The timeframe for completing MSP will vary depending on the
specific objectives of the planning, but in general it could be expected
to take from seven to 10 years from preplanning to “approved and regu-
lated.” In Mauritius, there are numerous environmental issues, and sev-
eral of the anthropogenic stressors are interconnected. Solving some of
these issues may take time, and so may developing an integrated deci-
sion-making framework and the conflict resolution mechanism being
requested by stakeholders.
   MSP can be thought of as occurring in phases:

•	   Pre-planning: Identify need, authority, financial support, and spatial
     boundary: 1–2 years.
•	   Phase 1: MSP as a framework for decision-making: 2–3 years.
•	   Phase 2: MSP as a zoning design and approved legislation: 3–5 years.

  A sample workplan for Example MSP Model 2 can be found in
Appendix 4.

Climate Change Adaptation
In terms of climate change adaptation, what are the key areas where
adaptation will be needed? Recent analysis suggests five areas for
268   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      Mauritius and other small island developing states:9 (i) reef resilience
      network and MPA network design criteria (ecological, social, eco-
      nomic); (ii) coral reef restoration; (iii) coastal resilience; (iv) ecosystem
      services; and (v) climate change adaptation measures.10
         Specifically, this will entail making sure that the MSP does the fol-
      lowing:

      •	   Identifies priority areas for conservation and climate change adapta-
           tion;
      •	   Identifies key species and habitats resilient to climate change, or with
           high genetic diversity;
      •	   Identifies unique habitat types and the range of variation;
      •	   Identifies threats and pressures;
      •	   Identifies stressors and drivers;
      •	   Maps coral reef cover (past, present, percent change, condition); and
      •	   Maps mangrove cover (past, present, percent change, condition).

         One of the key ways to adapt to climate change in the marine
      environment is to ensure functional resilience for marine biodiversity
      and ecological communities, as well as create a well-designed marine
      protected area network to ensure appropriate levels of protection for
      marine resources.11 In designing an MPA network for climate change
      adaptation, the ecological criteria that have been developed and tested
      for the last decade or more are suitable: (i) connectivity; (ii) size and
      spacing; (iii) redundancy and replication; (iv) unique or rare species and
      habitat types; (v) spawning aggregations, breeding areas, and foraging
      areas; and (vi) representative habitats.

      Challenges for MSP in Mauritius
      In developing an MSP process in Mauritius, at least five challenges or
      considerations should be examined and considered while the concept
      is being implemented: (i) defining the role of each institution; (ii) MSP
      in the outer islands; (iii) coordination with Rodrigues; (iv) Joint
      Management Area with Seychelles on the Mascarene Plateau; and
      (v) international pelagic resources. These are next discussed in turn.

      Change.aspx.
      10 Based on a World Bank global analysis (2010) and MoESDDBM.
      11 Not all marine ecosystems require the highest levels of protection as

      described by the IUCN (such as IUCN’s Category 1a: No-take marine reserve).
      The level of protection should ideally be assigned based on the condition of the
      ecosystem (or component), global status (e.g., IUCN Red List), vulnerability to
      disturbance, and risk factors.

Defining institutional roles. As previously mentioned, the first chal-
lenge is to clearly define the role of each institution in implementing
and managing the MSP concept. This can be seen as an opportunity to
improve efficiencies, identify overlaps or gaps, and improve working
relationships amongst the institutions. Currently, the Prime Minister’s
Office has the authority to oversee MSP in Mauritius under the Maritime
Zones Act and is also the driver for renewable energy, non-renewable
resources and fisheries. The MoESDDBM is responsible for the protec-
tion of coastal and marine environment under the concept. However,
the role and responsibilities of the Ministry of Ocean Economy, Marine
Resources, Fisheries and Shipping also has to be clearly identified. This
latter ministry has a key role to play in the implementation of MSP,
since a successful implementation of the plan will lead to the successful
development of the OE strategies. Therefore, it is important that the
duties of the Ministry of Ocean Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries
and Shipping be clearly outlined with regards to MSP for Mauritius.
Formulating clear roles for each institution is an important opportunity
to improve collaboration and coordination among agencies that are
responsible for the coastal and marine environment.

MSP in the outer islands. Another challenge to Mauritius is the imple-
mentation of MSP in the maritime zones generated by the Chagos
Archipelago (including Diego Garcia) and the Island of Tromelin
which form part of the territory of Mauritius under the Constitution
of Mauritius and over which other nations claim sovereignty. The
Government of Mauritius has reiterated that the Chagos Archipelago
and Tromelin have always formed, and continue to form, an integral
part of the territory of Mauritius, and that Mauritius does not recognize
the so-called “British Indian Ocean Territory”12,13

Coordination with Rodrigues. Since 2007, Rodrigues has taken steps
to protect its marine ecosystem through the creation of four marine
reserves (no-take zones) in the north of the island. These reserves were
identified through the participatory process of local communities and
non-governmental organizations. Furthermore, in 2009, the South East
Marine Protected Area (SEMPA) was created. The SEMPA is a multi-
use marine protected area that, like the marine reserves, involved the

      participatory process of local communities in its creation. It has to be
      underlined that the SEMPA covers 43 square kilometers and is cur-
      rently the largest MPA for the Republic of Mauritius.
         The creation of the marine reserves and the SEMPA can be linked
      to the use of a systematic conservation planning tool in Rodrigues. This
      tool allows for the use of a scientific approach to choose areas for pro-
      tection, and it allowed Rodrigues to establish its four marine reserves,
      which cover approximately 24.3 square kilometers and amount to 10
      percent of its lagoon. As for the SEMPA, part of it is used for protection
      and conservation of marine ecosystem and the rest is used for commer-
      cial and recreational activities.
         Since Rodrigues is autonomous from the Republic of Mauritius, it
      has devised its own regulations to best serve its interests. Therefore, by
      using the systematic conservation planning, Rodrigues was able to adopt
      a framework that allowed it to scientifically and strategically devised
      its marine reserves and the SEMPA. Rodrigues’ way of managing its
      sea is a good example that Mauritius should follow. In Mauritius, with
      the implementation of MSP, the island shall be able to designate fur-
      ther marine reserves and protected areas and the activities to be car-
      ried out therein.

      Seychelles-Mauritius Joint Management Area (JMA) on the Mascarene
      Plateau. There is interest in Seychelles in pursuing a discussion with
      Mauritius for a political and strategic framework for decision-making and
      management of the JMA. This framework would focus on the seabed
      resources, as per the jurisdiction of the JMA. This can easily be framed as
      an opportunity for enhanced environmental management and economic
      development for both countries, although there will be challenges because
      examples of transboundary MSPs are hard to find. This joint manage-
      ment area would ideally be a separate planning process from either the
      Mauritius or Seychelles MSP, because it has quite specific objectives, the
      planning boundary is legally distinct, and implementation would probably
      require different legal instruments from those needed for the national
      MSPs. However, it would be an advantage to proceed with this joint
      project simultaneously or in parallel with the national MSP processes,
      because of crucial information that may influence the location of zones
      adjacent to the JMA and allowable activities within the national EEZs.

      Pelagic resources and international rules. Finally, some pelagic marine
      resources are managed jointly with international bodies, for example
      tuna and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. These resources require
      careful consideration in any MSP process, because additional stake-
      holders may need to be involved in discussions about objectives, con-
                                   Options for Adopting Marine Spatial Planning   271


servation targets, zone locations, and allowable uses. For example, a
joint regional model could be advantageous with Seychelles and other
countries in the Western Indian Ocean for managing tuna populations
and Fish Aggregating Devices. To address the recent declaration that
yellowfin tuna is overfished, there is already a regional effort underway
by the IOTC.

Merits of a Proposed MSP in Mauritius
Strong international evidence of the benefits of an MSP is still limited,
and more will be more forthcoming once there are a greater number of
implemented plans that have been through a five-year review. MSP is
still at an early stage. However, anticipated benefits have been articu-
lated by Ehler (2008) and Gopnik (2008) and have been estimated
in more recent government documents. (such as the EU 2011). The
benefits of MSP can be grouped into three categories: (i) benefits of the
planning process; (ii) economic and social gains; and (iii) environmental
improvements (Gopnik 2008). In Mauritius, the Prime Minister’s
Office has proposed three key benefits of marine spatial planning: sus-
tainable use of space, enlarged economic space, and avoiding conflicting
use of space, the latter largely falling under the “economic and social
gains” benefits. The benefits described below are connected to global
best practices and lessons learned described earlier in this chapter.

Social benefits from planning. There are numerous social benefits to
MSP that have lasting impacts for implementation and other processes
that involve similar participants (e.g., Marine Protected Area Networks,
Geographic Spill Response Plans). Benefits include identifying a vision
for future uses of the ocean, and objectives for management—as noted by
Badal and Runghen (2016), one of the outputs from an MSP In Mauritius
is a vision statement. MSP is an improvement over sector-by-sector
management because it involves multiple sectors or interests, and par-
ticipants in a planning process can articulate a shared vision and create
sophisticated economic and environmental scenarios. The benefit of scen-
ario building was seen in the Belgium North Sea waters plan, when the
process forced participants to acknowledge the consequences of other-
wise unquestioned choices and assumptions (Gopnik 2008). Other social
benefits include bringing all stakeholders to the table and providing a
transparent, structured mechanism to identify and address conflicts, cre-
ate or review data layers, and develop a common base of understanding.

Economic benefits and social gains. Arguably, these are the benefits that
are of greatest interest to investors. The EU (2011) describes direct eco-
nomic effects in terms of certainty and predictability, including reduced
272   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      transaction costs, lower administrative costs, lower legal costs, and an
      enhanced investment climate. MSP lowers the transaction costs through
      improved coordination efficiency and effectiveness for governmental
      procedures. MSP processes create comprehensive spatial data catalogues
      that undergo extensive quality assurance/quality control by GIS experts.
      These databases contain spatially explicit information such as current
      uses and activities, spatial model outputs for conservation priorities, eco-
      system service values, habitat classification systems, oceanographic data,
      and more. An important legacy of MSP processes is the GIS spatial data
      catalogue for use in implementation and future decision making. If these
      databases are publicly available, for example data relevant to offshore
      wind permit applications (wind speed, depth, substrate), then all com-
      panies will have access to the same information and data are not being
      collected on a case-by-case basis, eliminating redundancy and inefficient
      spending. In addition, regulatory and compliance costs for government
      should be lower under MSP because there is buy-in for the zoning
      and management directions, there is improved information exchange
      between agencies and marine sectors, and a more predictable setting to
      make regulatory and business decisions (Gopnik 2008).

      Benefits to the environment. Finally, MSP benefits the environment.
      An integrated MSP includes environmental protection goals that are
      discussed alongside economic and social development goals. MSP is
      an improvement over MPA network design processes because the dis-
      cussion includes not only how best to allocate space for the protection
      goal or target, but also how to allocate the remainder of the space, thus
      improving ocean management for 100 percent of the planning area.
      Also, MSP processes are more and more concerned with climate change
      adaptation, especially for small island developing states, which have
      serious concerns over sea level rise, cyclone frequency, and warming
      ocean temperatures threaten the OE and expose weaknesses in coastal
      infrastructure and defense.

Key Messages
•	 Climate change is likely to endanger much of the development potential of Mauritius’ ocean economy (OE).
   Important climate related stressors threatening the OE include sea-level rise (including increases in coastal ero-
   sion), tropical storm intensification (including storm surges and changes in wave dynamics), intensified rainfall
   patterns, increased temperatures, and ocean acidification (which can affect fishery resources).
•	 The Government of Mauritius has taken important steps already to interpret the relevant climate science for the
   island and the South West Indian Ocean region; in many cases it has translated this knowledge to understand-
   ing key physical effects of importance, such as the impact of ocean acidification and sea temperature changes
   on fisheries resources. In a few cases it has quantified and monetized these impacts; for example, Mauritius’
   Second National Communication states that over the last decade, 18,500 square meters of beach have eroded
   in Mauritius, land with a rental value of MUR 1.2 million).
•	 Analysis of the latest climate change scenarios shows that localized precipitation projections through the year
   2050 are highly variable and could range from a decline of more than 25 percent to an increase of more than 25
   percent, compared to historical rainfall. The variability is the result of uncertainties in global efforts to mitigate
   carbon emissions and in climate science. This stressor may be critically important to Mauritius, as more intense
   rainfall could greatly exacerbate inland flood risks.
•	 Based on detailed, Mauritius-specific storm simulation modeling conducted for this book, climate change could
   also substantially increase both the rainfall and the wind speed and landfall patterns associated with tropical
   cyclones. As a result, we estimate that total tropical cyclone damage (from wind, storm surge, and inland flood-
   ing) in the worst case climate scenario could increase by approximately a factor of two.
•	 Virtually all storms would be stronger with climate change, and the frequency overall would also increase. An
   important result from this analysis is that the once- in-100-year storm, with climate change, could be charac-
   terized by peak wind speeds 30 km/hour higher than the historical baseline. For reference, Cyclone Hollanda,

         which struck Mauritius in 1994, was roughly a once-in-100-year storm—climate change
         would make that storm much more damaging.
      •	 As a deep-dive illustration of just one effect of climate change, and based on an appli-
         cation of the CGE model described in Chapter 2, the economic effects of this change in
         cyclone strikes on Mauritius are demonstrated to reduce the cumulative GDP (in present
         value terms) by more than 10 percent by the end of a 40-year simulation period, relative
         to a scenario that simulates historical storm occurrence. In addition, if a single 100-year
         return-period storm of the sort anticipated with climate change were to occur in the
         next 10 years, the effect would be to cause GDP to shrink for a time, and to reduce GDP
         growth rates by approximately 2 percentage points for at least the following five years.
      •	 The CGE simulations also show that while expected losses under climate change are
         larger than the historic baseline at the mean, a potentially more significant change will
         be seen in the risk of large-scale losses. For example, under current climate conditions, a
         large storm causing a loss of 7.5 percent GDP has a 10 percent probability of occurring;
         under climate change, this probability increases to 30 percent.
      •	 Mauritius has already taken steps to address climate change vulnerability, both at the
         policy level (e.g. the 2012 National Climate Change Adaptation Policy Framework) and
         at a more operational level, through the 2016 guideline for coastal setback, formulated
         in anticipation of sea-level-rise-risks to coastal assets. More can be done for better
         understanding, and mitigating, the increased risks that climate change may pose to
         the entire OE (and in fact to the economy as a whole). To mitigate the resulting social
         and economic impacts, there is a need to consider both structural responses (such as
         a review of building codes to assess resilience to stronger cyclones) and disaster risk
         financing options (such as the sovereign insurance scheme developed by Africa Risk
         Capacity or the World Bank’s Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO).




      Climate Change and the Ocean Economy: A Framework for
      Assessing Threats and Responses
      The Government of Mauritius has prioritized the development of a
      strong OE as a near-term and long-term economic strategy for the
      country. The sectors of the OE have been supported by numerous gov-
      ernment programs, legislation, and investment (Mauritius 2013). The
      potential impacts of climate change must be considered in planning
      decisions to ensure that this investment is protected into the future.

      stressors discussed in this chapter.

should be explored and tested to better characterize and quantify the risks
outlined in Table 8.1. Fortunately, there has been significant effort in recent
years to quantify these risks, which has fueled recent activity to develop,
refine, and apply suitable models (see for example, Cervigni et al., 2015).
   To assist policy makers in evaluating the potential economic impacts
of climate change and identify specific regional and sector vulnerabil-
ities, the United Nations University—World Institute for Development
Economic Research (UNU-WIDER), in collaboration with external
partners, has progressively developed an analytical framework known
as Systematic Analysis of Climate Resilient Development (SACReD),
which integrates comprehensive biophysical and economic analysis. The
climate impacts and adaptations component of the SACReD frame-
work is illustrated in Figure 8.1.
   The framework begins with climate change scenarios for a particu-
lar country. Climate change manifests itself as changes in projected levels
for temperature, precipitation, barometric pressure, humidity, and other
weather outcomes. However, with this information alone, it is difficult to
assess the potential impacts of climate change on many variables of inter-
est such as economic growth, development prospects, and the material
well-being of the population. As such, the SACReD framework traces the

      implications of changes in a broad range of climate outcomes through a
      series of important impact channels—including the production of hydro-
      power, agricultural yield, water supply/demand balance, and costs of main-
      taining and repairing damaged infrastructure and other installed capital.
         These climate change impacts then serve as inputs into an econ-
      omywide model of the country in question. The economywide models
      employed respect macroeconomic identities, meaning that all futures are
      economically coherent and account for multiple simultaneous impacts.
      For example, higher levels of rainfall may be favorable for hydropower
      generation, water supply, and agricultural production, but unfavorable for
      road infrastructure due to washouts or widespread flooding—both effects
      are accounted for in the framework.
         The critical element of this framework that is missing in many country
      applications is linking the climate science and physical impacts of climate
      change to the function and productivity of the economy. In Mauritius as in
      other countries, many aspects of the economy use environmental resour-
      ces (water, agriculture, beaches) as key factors of production, and climate
      change affects those factors of production, often though not always in
      negative ways. Nonetheless, this type of analysis is becoming more com-
      mon. For example, variants of the SACReD framework outlined above
      have been applied to Ethiopia (Robinson, Strzepek, and Cervigni 2013),
      Ghana (Arndt, Asante, and Thurlow 2015a), Malawi (Arndt, Pauw, and
      Thurlow 2014), Mozambique (Arndt et al 2011a), Tanzania (Arndt et al

2011b), Vietnam (Arndt, Tarp, and Thurlow 2015b), Zambia (Schlosser
and Strzepek 2013), and South Africa (Cullis et al. 2015).
   In the sections below, we review existing work by and for Mauritius
that characterizes and quantifies climate risks, mainly in physical terms
but in some cases (e.g., coastal erosion) with some sense of primary eco-
nomic stress as well, such as land area lost to erosion, now and in the
future, and the value of that lost land to the landowners. What has not
yet been done for Mauritius, to our knowledge, is assessing how climate
change puts at risk the factors of production, and how those risks trans-
late to loss of economic productivity, typically measured as GDP. To
demonstrate this concept, this chapter traces one aspect of the SACReD
framework, the impact of climate change on tropical cyclone frequency
and intensity, and how the damage to critical OE capital assets of more
frequent and/or severe storms will affect the Mauritius economy.1


Climate Variability and Change in Mauritius
As a small island nation, Mauritius has the potential to be particularly
vulnerable to climate change impacts (Nurse et al. 2014). Mauritius has
seen a trend of increasing average temperatures of about 0.15 degrees
centigrade over the last century (MOESD 2012). According to the
Mauritius Meteorological Services, annual rainfall decreased over the
last century. Total annual rainfall has decreased about 8 percent in the
past 10 years compared to the 1950s on the main island and, to a lesser
and more variable extent, on the outer islands (MMS n.d.). Climate
projections for the West Indian Ocean region under a low emissions
scenario future (RCP4.5), based on averages from 42 Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, show an increase in
annual average temperature of about 1.4 degrees centigrade by the end
of the century compared to the average for 1986–2005 (median value;
25 to 75th percentile: 1.2 to 1.8 degrees).
   Over the same time period precipitation is projected to increase by
2 percent (median value; 25 to 75th percentile range is 0 to 5 percent),
and sea level is projected to rise by 0.5–0.6 meters, a significant issue for
small island nations in particular (Nurse et al. 2014). The Government
of Mauritius is aware of these projections and has used them to inform


1 It should be noted that cyclones do have the potential to impact the Mauritius
OE through other impact channels identified in the SACReD framework as
well. For example, tropical cyclones very often bring with them high pre-
cipitation events, which have caused severe flooding in Mauritius in the past.
Although not shown in Figure 8.1, the “deep dive” demonstration analysis con-
siders the damage associated with both tropical storm related wind and flooding.

      various climate change adaptation and mitigation planning documents
      (e.g. MOESD 2012; MAIFS et al. 2012; Mauritius 2012). More recent
      information suggests that the potential for higher levels of sea-level rise,
      perhaps one meter or more by the end of the century, is associated with
      dynamic ice-sheet melting in Greenland and Antarctica (Vermeer and
      Rahmstorf 2009), or more rapid break-up of land-based ice sheets in
      Antarctica (DeConto and Pollard 2016).
         Figure 8.2 shows the projected change in maximum daily temper-
      ature specifically for Mauritius by mid-century based on a suite of 21
      General Circulation Models (GCMs). The median changes in maximum
      daily temperature under RCP4.5 (a high greenhouse gas mitigation effort
      scenario) and RCP8.5 (a low greenhouse gas mitigation effort scenario)
      are 1.3 and 1.7 degrees centigrade, respectively. The high-end estimate
      under RCP8.5 shows changes in temperature of 2.5 degrees centigrade.
      Changes in minimum daily temperature follow similar trends. These pat-
      terns are consistent with the projections for the West Indian Ocean.
         Projections of precipitation outcomes in Mauritius under climate change
      show significantly more variability. Under both the low-emission scenario
      and the high-emission scenario, the median estimate of annual precipita-
      tion is projected to decrease by about 2 percent compared to the historic
      baseline; however, the high- and low-end estimates for the two emission
      scenarios show a large amount of variability. Under both RCPs, projections
      range from large increases to large decreases in precipitation compared to

the baseline. Changes of this magnitude in either direction could cause ser-
ious impacts in Mauritius, as indicated in the column of Table 8.1 labeled
“non-tropical cyclone floods,” including impacts on a wide range of capital
assets inland from the coast and so technically not components of the OE.
Variability in precipitation projections of this magnitude also complicates
efforts to adapt and modify water resource supply systems in response to
these changes, owing to the projection uncertainty.
   While the models do not always agree on the direction of change
in total annual precipitation, there is a general consensus that precipi-
tation events will be more extreme, with both higher intensity storms
likely to occur more often than in the current climate, and the possi-
bility of lower or higher annual precipitation. High-intensity storms
increase inland flooding, storm surge risks, and the risk of wind dam-
age. Tropical cyclones, storms with peak wind speeds over 70 km/hour,
can be particularly damaging. Figure 8.4 shows the change in storm
total rainfall for tropical cyclones for two future eras, standardized by
historical climate rainfall for each of three storm-return periods (10-
year, 100-year, and 1000-year; see Box 8.1). These results were mod-
eled by the WindRiskTech CHIPS model.2 In the near-future era (2021

      to 2040), a typical 10-year storm will produce 12 percent more rainfall
      than the historical 10-year storm. As storm intensity increases, so does
      the change in projected rainfall. A 1000-year storm is projected to pro-
      duce 20 percent more rain than the historic baseline. These patterns are
      very similar in the mid-century (2041 to 2060) era.

                                             Storms are often categorized by the probability at which a storm of equal or
                                             greater magnitude is expected to occur, meaning the magnitude of a storm that
                                             is expected to occur once every 10 years is classified as a “10-year storm” and if
                                             expected to occur once every 100 years as a “100-year storm.” These expected rates,
                                             or return periods, are based on probabilities and do not signify that these frequen-
                                             cies will happen with certainty. In other words, a 100-year storm is a storm event
                                             that occurs with 1 percent probability each year; a 10-year storm is a storm event
                                             that occurs with 10 percent probability each year. It is possible that a 10-year storm
                                             could occur twice in one year. It is also possible, although unlikely, that two 100-year
                                             storms could occur in one year or that zero 10-year storms could occur in 50 years.

   Tropical cyclone wind speeds are a primary driver of storm
damage—these wind speeds are also projected to increase under future
climates. Figure 8.5 shows the high- and low-end estimates of the
change in wind speed (by return periods, e.g., the 100-year storm) for
tropical cyclones in Mauritius. The results are presented for two future
eras (as modeled by the WindRiskTech CHIPS model). Both the high-
and low-end future climate projections show an increase in wind speeds
for high-intensity storms, on the right of the graph. These high inten-
sity storms are the ones that cause the most significant property dam-
age. The low-end climate model (or GCM, in this case the MPI5 model)
shows a slight decrease in the more frequent storms. The deep dive
analysis described below makes use of the storm wind intensity and fre-
quency projections from the two climate models depicted in Figure 8.5:
the HadGEM5 and MPI climate models. These two models represent
high and low impacts of climate change.


Climate Change Impacts: Current Understanding and Key
Knowledge Gaps
For Mauritius, where the OE is slated to contribute greatly to the eco-
nomic development of the country, climate change impacts to coastal
regions could significantly slow economic growth if proper adaptation
measures are not implemented. As a small island nation, Mauritius is
already more economically vulnerable than the average nation, and

                              because of its size any extreme weather event that hits the country often
                              leads to a large proportion of damage (Anthoff, Nicholls, and Tol 2010).
                              Table 8.2 shows the key impacts of climate change specific to small island
                              nations from the United Nations’ IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.
                                 Several of the OE clusters are predicted to see large impacts of cli-
                              mate change with high confidence, while impacts on other sectors
                              require more research (Nurse et al. 2014). Generally speaking, there is
                              a lack of data on the impacts of climate change on small island nations
                              due to the precise scale of modeling required to understand the local-
                              ized effects. This is particularly true for Mauritius, where there are
                              relatively large differences in elevation across the island (up to more
                              than 800 meters above sea level). Areas with large differences in eleva-
                              tion show much greater variability in outcomes from changes in rain-
                              fall (owing to orographic effects on clouds and precipitation), flooding
                              (owing to steeper terrain and concentration of rainfall into runoff chan-
                              nels), and even heat stress (owing to temperature elevation gradients).
                                 Fisheries, seafood processing, and aquaculture are important com-
                              ponents of the current economy and are planned to remain significant
                              under future economic plans. Seafood fishing and processing contrib-
                              uted about 1.4 percent of GDP from 2012 to 2014 (see Chapter 1), and
                              fisheries products make up about 22 percent of total exports by value
                                      Addressing the Challenge of Climate Change   287


(see Chapter 3 for more details on the fisheries sector). Climate change
threats to this growing sector include:

•	   Coral bleaching leading to reduced fisheries production: Healthy
     coral is vital to healthy fisheries, particularly in the Western Indian
     Ocean. Coral bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures and acidifi-
     cation has negative impacts on fishery production (Hoegh-Guldberg
     et al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007). Coral calcification rates
     could decrease by up to 30 percent by 2050 due to increases in
     carbon dioxide levels, and by 2100 live corals could be reduced by
     80 to 100 percent if temperature for the Mauritius region rises 3.28
     degrees (Mauritius 2010). Loss of mangroves, a critical habitat for
     many commercially important species, due to sea level rise is also a
     concern for fisheries production (Mauritius 2012). The government
     has worked with several NGOs to combat mangrove loss through
     replanting efforts (MAIFS et al. 2012).
•	   Ocean acidification affecting mollusk shell formation: Ocean acidifi-
     cation can impede mollusk shell formation (De Silva and Soto 2009)
     which could impact oyster and oyster pearl culture, industries shown
     to have high economic potential in Mauritius (RoM 2013).
•	   Severe weather, erosion, and storm surge infrastructure damage:
     These threats damage coastal infrastructure, particularly aquaculture
     infrastructure, leading to escapes (including potentially invasive spe-
     cies) and loss of productivity (De Silva and Soto 2009).
•	   Changing ocean temperatures and species distribution: Changing
     ocean temperatures can alter currents and fish migration patterns,
     changing the availability of species across space (Nurse et al.
     2014). Changing temperatures can also introduce new species to
     the area, which may disrupt existing catch allocation arrangements
     (Mauritius 2010).

   The fishing industry in Mauritius has already seen declines in produc-
tivity, making further reductions due to climate change even more dam-
aging. As seen in Chapter 3, fisheries production, excluding large-scale
tuna production, has declined by 17 percent since 2006. Total fisheries
production has increased over the same period due to large increases (a
twelve-fold growth since 2006) in large-scale tuna production; however
tuna migratory patterns often shift and are vulnerable to changing ocean
temperatures. Any impacts to fisheries and aquaculture will be passed
on to the seafood processing industry, since the processing plants rely on
steady production from the fisheries for their supplies.
   The threats of climate change on seaport related activities are also
well studied. The value of Mauritius’ seaport ranks high due to local
288   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      port logistics and infrastructure, and cruise port amenities make it a
      likely cluster to see continued growth in the future (Mauritius 2013).
      Threats to these activities include damage to port infrastructure, change
      in navigability of access channels, interruptions in business activities and
      movements (World Bank 2016). More frequent extreme weather events
      may disrupt complex supply chains, while sediment from coastal ero-
      sion may increase dredging costs (UNCTAD 2008). Integrated invest-
      ment, planning, and operation will be necessary for ports to adapt
      (Becker et al. 2013). There may be opportunities for the marine finance
      industry to benefit from involvement in these adaptation projects.
         Chapter 6 discusses the most important responses to climate change
      necessary to protect investments in port infrastructure, including mon-
      itoring weather conditions and correlating conditions with conse-
      quences of extreme events; expanding analyses to include the hazard
      of inland flooding; ensuring adequate insurance coverage is in place;
      reviewing and testing emergency response procedures; incorporat-
      ing climate change resiliency in investment planning; and investing in
      breakwater protection and other mitigating measures.
         Coastal tourism is another important seaport related activity—
      in 2012 it was 6.5 percent of total GDP (Mauritius 2013). In addi-
      tion to the threat of infrastructure damage from flooding, winds, and
      coastal erosion, the tourism sector may also be impacted by water
      shortages exacerbated by rising temperatures and more variable rain-
      fall (Mauritius 2012). Altered seasonality could impact the tour-
      ism industry through the effects of heat stress on tourists, increased
      cooling costs, changes in wildlife populations, and infectious diseases
      (MAIFS et al. 2012). Beach erosion is also a concern for the tour-
      ism industry. Mauritius’ Second National Communication states that
      over the last decade, 18,500 square meters of beach have eroded in
      Mauritius. That land has a rental value of MUR 1.2 million (Mauritius
      2010). The Government of Mauritius has taken actions to reduce the
      impacts to the tourism sector, including implementing a mandatory
      setback from the high water mark to protect against the threats of
      coastal erosion and storm surge (Ministry of Housing and Lands 2004;
      Mauritius 2016).
         Other sectors of the economy, while potentially vulnerable to climate
      change, do not have the historical evidence of impacts and research sup-
      port of the above sectors. For example, while the most significant ocean
      warming has been observed at surface levels, deep ocean waters (700 to
      2,000 meters) are also experiencing similar, yet less significant changes
      (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014). The impact of climate change on deep-
      sea environments is difficult to observe because of access issues and lack
      of long-term data (Smith, Jr. et al., 2009).
                                     Addressing the Challenge of Climate Change   289


   The Government of Mauritius has already taken important steps
to protect the OE from climate change impacts. The Disaster Risk
Reduction Strategic Framework and Action Plan (MOESD 2012),
the National Climate Change Adaptation Policy Framework for the
Republic of Mauritius (Mauritius 2012) and the Intended Nationally
Determined Contribution for the Republic of Mauritius (Mauritius
2015) lay out a path forward for Mauritius to both minimize risk with
appropriate adaptation measures and mitigate climate change through
sustainable practices. These documents stress the importance of under-

   The 2012 document, Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation in
the Agriculture, Tourism and Fisheries Sectors in the Republic of Mauritius
and in the Water Sector in Rodrigues (MAIFS et al. 2012) acknowledges
the actions of the government thus far to protect against climate related
damages in the tourism and fisheries sector, such as mangrove replace-
ment programs and building codes that reduce infrastructure risk, and
calls for further progress in understanding and communicating the risks
of climate change. According to the Second National Communication,
the government has also undertaken several research initiatives to bet-
ter understand climate trends and impacts including developing climate
indices; monitoring possible salt water intrusion to freshwater sources;
modeling projected water availability, soil erosion, and crop responses
to climate change; and studying the contributing roles that affect the
coastal zone, ecosystems, and biodiversity. In addition, the government
has spearheaded several public education, training, and communication
plans related to the impacts of climate change (Mauritius 2010). The
following deep dive analysis seeks to provide an example of the risk of
climate change that can be readily communicated to a wide audience.

A Deep Dive on Climate Change and the Ocean Economy: The
Economywide Effects of Tropical Cyclones
Low-frequency, high-impact events such as tropical cyclones often
cause damage to infrastructure and supplies that can ripple through the
economy. For example, after a tropical cyclone the government may
need to spend money repairing flood-damaged roads. That money likely
could have been spent on a more productive program had the hurricane
not occurred. Similarly, households and businesses might be forced to
divert money that could be used for productive purposes to repair wind
damaged roofs and equipment.

      planned growth of the OE of Mauritius described in this chapter does
      not need to engage the entire SACReD framework. The analysis is
      limited to change in damages coming from changes in frequency and
      severity (as measured by maximum wind speed) of cyclones. This led
      to development of a reduced-scope SACReD framework with a single
      impact channel, where fixed capital formation is devoted to restoring
      the damaged capital as the result of cyclonic winds. This framework,
      SACReD-OE, is illustrated in Figure 8.6.
         The SACReD-OE framework demonstrated for this “deep dive” has
      four main components:

      1.	 GCM-based estimation of sea-surface temperatures (SSTs): GCMs
          are climate models that project global climate characteristics such as
          sea-surface temperatures and air temperatures, which are important
          for cyclone formation. This analysis makes use of two of roughly 20
          most-cited GCM results, which represent a broad range of projected
          climate outcomes for Mauritius.
      2.	 A probabilistic Cyclone Projection Model driven by projections of
          SSTs: This step involves deploying the CHIPS framework mentioned
          earlier, which is also described in detail in a technical appendix. The
          CHIPS framework uses GCM inputs and generates a simulation of
          future storm activity that is specific to Mauritius. The results are
          for two future time periods (2021 to 2040, and 2041 to 2060) and
                                     Addressing the Challenge of Climate Change   291


    include a full exceedance curve that summarizes the frequency and
    severity of storms (as measured by both wind speed and rainfall
    intensity) that are projected to strike Mauritius in each of these per-
    iods. As indicated in the technical appendix, the frequency results are
    calibrated to data on historic storm strikes for Mauritius.
3.	 An empirical Wind-Capital Damage Model developed for Mauritius:
    Using the wind speed outputs from the previous step, the project
    team developed an empirical model to estimate the damage to cap-
    ital on Mauritius. The model was parameterized by examining the
    damage to Mauritius’ capital estimated for a range of events where
    damage is simulated by AIR Worldwide (2016) and relating the
    damage from each simulated event to the maximum wind speed
    associated with that event. A cubic damage function was then fitted
    to these data. The function was applied to the new, projected wind
    speed and storm frequency outputs from the climate change simu-
    lations to estimate the damage from the profile of future storms as
    they could be influenced by climate change.
4.	 A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of the Mauritius
    economy focused on the OE with an impact channel of capital
    damage: The results of the projected damage to capital, both with
    and without climate change, were then used as inputs to the CGE
    macro-model described in Chapter 3 of this book. The CGE provides
    probabilistic results, so it makes use of the probabilities of a cyclone
    strike estimated by the CHIPS framework. As a result, the CGE can
    indicate the probability of damage to the broader economy in a given
    time period.

   Total expected annual damage is a function of both the frequency
of events and the intensity of the events that occur. The CHIPS model
is used to project historic and future storm frequency and intensity,
as defined by maximum wind speeds, for both the low- and high-im-
pact climate scenarios. Storm damages are defined by a damage func-
tion relating storm return periods to a percentage of asset damage.
Although the functional form used reflects the context of U.S. hurri-
cane damage (Emanuel 2011), the damage calculation for a historical
storm profile was calibrated against existing estimates for Mauritius
(AIR Worldwide 2016). Note that the method used here probably
underestimates damage from cyclone strikes, because it only provides
estimates of damage to built infrastructure and capital and ignores
effects on natural capital (such as clean water supplies, or wetland
function, for example).
   As seen in Figure 8.7, in the high impact scenario both frequency and
intensity are projected to increase in both future eras (2021 to 2040 and

a probabilistic representation of the frequency and severity of storms
that are expected to strike Mauritius under each of the four scenarios.3

above. The damages associated with tropical cyclones under both his-
torical and future climate conditions are identified in five categories of
loss: residential, commercial, infrastructure, industrial, and public.

parameters projected in the CHIPS model, and (ii) a gamma function of storm
damage defined by CHIPS model outputs and a maximum wind speed based
damage function.

      Note: The chart represents the relationship between the deciles of the distribution of the model simulation’s results
      (vertical axis), and, on the horizontal axis, the corresponding present value of GDP loss (expressed as percentage of
      GDP in the no-cyclone scenario) over a 40-year time horizon. For each decile, the value of loss shown in the chart is
      an average across a distribution of intra-decile values. Further details are available in Appendix 5 of the full report.




         The model enters “reconstruction mode” once hit with an extreme
      event. For a set number of years following the event or events, a defined
      proportion of GDP is directed to restore the damaged capital. As a
      result, that capital is not available to increase the productivity of the
      economy overall; rather, it is used to repair storm-damaged capital, so
      the long-term process of GDP growth is interrupted. This process is
      repeated for a high-impact climate scenario, a low-impact climate scen-
      ario, and a historical climate scenario.
         Figure 8.9 shows the economic impact from the CGE simulations over
      the 40-year study period. The results underline not only the increase in
      mean damage to the economy from increased tropical storm intensity,
      but also the considerable increase in risk of low-frequency, high-impact
      storms. The simulations, in fact, suggest that climate change might have a
      more important effect in terms of the rarer but more catastrophic events
      than in terms of the average loss to be expected over any given period of
      time. This is because the variability of the extreme events and their com-
      bination tends to increase more than proportionally with time.
         For example, under current climate conditions, a storm or a combin-
      ation of storms causing a loss of 7.5 percent GDP (that is, a reduction
      of GDP compared to what would have happened with no cyclones) has,
      on average, a 10 percent probability of occurring; under climate change,
      this probability increases to 30 percent on average. This is because of
                                       Addressing the Challenge of Climate Change   295


the higher destructive power of cyclones with any given return period;
and/or, because for any given intensity of impacts, cyclones are expected
to happen more frequently.
   In a comparison of direct damage with the projected climatic con-
ditions in the South-West Indian Ocean, a 100-year storm will cause
almost double the damages as a storm with the same return period in
the baseline. This effect is seen across a variety of return periods, and it
is even more pronounced in relatively frequently occurring storms, with
5-year storm damage nearly tripling.
   Figure 8.9 further highlights that storms influenced by climate
change (shown in the red line) are much more damaging to the econ-
omy than storms that have struck Mauritius in the historical record
(the blue line). Across the full range of the distribution of storms that
could strike Mauritius over a 40-year period, the high-end climate
change scenario greatly increases the chance of large GDP losses; and
the probability increases as we look at impacts of increasingly larger
magnitude. For example, the risk of losing 5 percent of GDP would go
from a 30 percent probability in the current climate scenario to more
than a 70 percent probability in the climate change scenario (a 2.3-
fold increase).4 Similarly, the risk of losing 10 percent of GDP would
increase from 3.2 percent in the baseline to about 12 percent in the
climate change case (a 3.6-fold increase). While an increase in annual
damage across all magnitudes of damage is problematic, the increase in
loss for the largest damage years is most concerning. For the 10 percent
most damaging years, losses are expected to increase by an additional
3.7 percent of GDP. A 3.7 percent loss is approximately equivalent to
losing the entire contribution of the agriculture sector, since agriculture
comprised 4 percent of GDP in 2016 (World Factbook 2016).
   Another way to explore the impact of climate change on tropical
cyclone damage is to assess the expected damage (under current and
future climate scenarios) from storms with a given return period happen-
ing in a 10-years simulation period. In Box 8.2, we evaluate the damages
associated with a 100-year storm under the mid-century high-impact cli-
mate scenarios (using the more severe consequence HadGEM climate
model) compared to a 100-year storm under baseline climate conditions.


4 The results for the simulations using historical climate are consistent with
those from the AIR Worldwide simulation but are not identical to those results.
The AIR Worldwide results are effectively a snapshot of the direct effects on
capital. The CGE results reported here simulate many snapshots of storm
events occurring over a 40-year simulation period, in various sequences, while
also capturing the long-term effects on the economy of the need for diverting
investment to reconstruction.

Box 8.2. Economy-wide Impacts of a 100-Year Storm Under Current and Future Climate Conditions

A comparison of direct damage shows that under climate change, a 100-year storm will cause almost
double the damages as a storm with the same return period in the baseline. This effect is seen across a
variety of return periods and is even more pronounced in relatively frequently occurring storms, with 5-year
storm damage nearly tripling.
    The occurrence of the tropical storm under the climate change assumptions causes GDP to dramat-
ically diverge from both the no-event and current climate baseline (i.e. the impact of the same type of
storm without the strength induced by climate change). Over the 10-year period, the net present value
of the loss due to a climate-change-amplified event is about 6.2 percent relative to the no-event baseline,
or 3.3 percentage points more than the historical event scenario. As the figure below shows, this would
be equivalent to losing more than 2 percentage points on average of GDP growth per year in the climate
change scenario.

                                Conclusions and Recommendations
                                Climate change in the form of increased heat, changes in precipitation
                                patterns, and increased frequency and severity of tropical cyclones all
                                suggest several areas of key vulnerability for the OE. Recent analyses
                                of extreme event hazards have used the current (historical) climate
                                scenario. These are important because they quantify and monetize the
                                baseline risk of floods and wind storms damaging physical capital on the
                                island (AIR Worldwide 2016), but they do not consider climate change.
                                In addition, the CGE analysis conducted here considers both the direct
                                     Addressing the Challenge of Climate Change   297


effects of storms (as the AIR Worldwide analysis does), but also the
cumulative effects of storms on GDP, where the secondary effects of
diverting resources to reconstruction have an important indirect effect
on development in Mauritius. Our analysis supports the important con-
clusions from prior work that storms associated with the current climate
have led and will lead to significant damage in Mauritius, but extends that
work to conclude that climate change will make those losses much worse.
    Climate change is therefore expected to operate as a “threat multi-
plier” in this context, exacerbating an existing natural hazard to the
Mauritius OE. Magnified storms could affect the maintenance of pro-
ductive tourism, fisheries, and industrial capital, as well as coastal resi-
dential structures. A less well-studied aspect of the climate change
threat is the effect of more intense rainfall events on flood potential—a
2016 AIR Worldwide report reflects only the current climate flood risk
(AIR Worldwide 2016), but another study of this region suggests that
flood risks could be substantially increased (Cervigni et al. 2015). The
potentially increased flood risk derives from both changes in routine
patterns of rainfall associated with gradual climate change, and chan-
ges to rainfall patterns associated with extreme events such as cyclones.
    The framework for analysis presented here can be applied to further
assess the impact of natural hazards associated with climate change on
Mauritius’ economy. The “deep dive” conducted for this book addresses
only one channel of impact—the effect of climate change on cyclone
wind speeds, and the resulting effect on capital assets and the broader
macro-economy. Further, the application is limited to characterizing vul-
nerability, and stops short of assessing the performance and potential value
of investments in climate change adaptive capacity (e.g., the construction
of a breakwater to protect port assets). The framework can be applied to a
much broader set of channels, however, and to both vulnerability and adap-
tation assessments. Acknowledging that a great deal of work has already
been conducted by the Mauritian government to both assess physical vul-
nerability and initiate adaptive actions, gaps exist in the economic assess-
ment of climate vulnerability and in identifying the economic benefits of
adaptive actions to protect existing and new OE investments from those
natural hazards that are significantly exacerbated by climate change.
    The results of this review of climate stressor information, coupled
with the deep dive, provide a strong argument for including analysis
of climate change in the assessment of investments in new product-
ive capacity to enhance the OE. Furthermore, key vulnerabilities iden-
tified here to more intense cyclones, including both higher wind speeds
and more intense rainfall events, provide a starting point for applica-
tion of the framework to finance of climate adaptation investments.
Coastal adaptation and preparedness projects, for example, have already
298   The Ocean Economy in Mauritius: Making it happen, making it last


      been funded by the Green Climate Fund in some upper-middle-income
      countries (e.g., disaster readiness investments in the Cook Islands and
      in Antigua and Barbuda).5 Mauritius is particularly well positioned to
      prepare an application for adaptation investments as a member of the
      Small Island Developing States (SIDS) group, which represents a pre-
      ferred class of potential GCF grant recipients.
         To move forward in this area, recommended actions include the fol-
      lowing:

      1.	 Refine the full island-scale risk assessments. Analyses conducted to
          date by AIR Worldwide characterize the baseline, current climate
          risks associated with natural hazards, including the flood risk associ-
          ated with rainfall events. These risks should be updated to reflect the
          latest climate science, including projections of cyclone and non-cy-
          clone precipitation and flood events as well as the impact of rising sea
          levels on storm-surge-modelled losses. While the Mauritius Disaster
          Risk Reduction Strategic Framework and Action Plan (MOESD
          2012) acknowledges the importance of mitigating the vulnerability
          to cyclone risk, it lacks the quantitative assessment of tropical cyclone
          risk under climate change. Updating these updated risk assessments
          will require that the hydrologic (rainfall-runoff) and hydraulic (flood
          mapping) analyses previously conducted be re-estimated. These new
          analyses ought to reflect the significant uncertainty in these projec-
          tions, a dimension that is needed in the risk assessment to ensure that
          they support identification of robust adaptation options.
      2.	 Add climate resilience analyses to economic assessments of new OE
          investments. Much work has been done so far by the Government
          of Mauritius to assess effects such as ocean acidification, which can
          have detrimental effects on fisheries productivity, and therefore on
          the return on investment in the fisheries sector, but those analyses
          clarify only the physical aspects of climate change and only in general
          terms. A key gap that can now be filled, however, is to assess how
          climate change affects the return on investment for port and tourism
          projects. For example, the cyclone forecast tools used in this chapter
          can be coupled with wave models to assess the benefits of building
          a breakwater to protect the port. Analyses such as these can then be
          used as part of the package to apply for climate finance funding.
      3.	 Consider disaster risk financing options to mitigate the social and
          economic impacts of low-probability, high-impact climate shocks.
          Examples of such options include the sovereign insurance scheme
