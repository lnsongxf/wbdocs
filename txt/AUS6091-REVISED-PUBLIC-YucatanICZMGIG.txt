Abstract: Approximately 4.1 million people live in the three coastal states of the Yucatán
Peninsula: Quintana Roo, Yucatán, and Campeche. Some 30 municipalities are in a coastal
territory of almost 2,000 kilometers, spanning the oil fields of the Gulf of Mexico to the world
renowned beaches of Cancun and Cozumel, just north of the second largest barrier reef in the
world. The peninsula’s natural assets also include some of the nation’s most notable cultur al
assets – Mayan temples including Chichén Itzá, Ek Balám, Uxmal and Dzibilchaltún. With poverty
far from eliminated, and economic development opportunities beckoning in agriculture,
manufacturing and hydrocarbon development, the region is under growing risks to
environmental hazards. Oil spills, hurricanes, coral bleaching, extreme flooding and erosion have
all been experienced in this region over the past decade. Based on preliminary identification of
environmental priorities, this report explores selected topics that aim to inform decision-making
in the region. A general context of “integrated coastal zone management” is used to explore
issues, constraints and potential solutions. The role of geomorphology is examined with a view
to identifying how shore management plans can contribute to improved coastal management,
particularly to combat issues related to shoreline erosion. Economic studies provide insights into
the economic impacts of extreme climate events and of economic losses from environmental
degradation and pollution. The main environmental health risks in the peninsula result in more
than 1,000 premature deaths every year and in more than 9.36 million days lost to illnesses. In
addition to pain and suffering, these risks also generate substantial economic losses,
representing 2.2-3.3 percent of gross regional income. Scenarios relating to the economic cost of
extreme weather events generate similar levels of damages: 1.4-1.5 percent of GDP in 2020 and
1.6-2.3 percent of GDP in 2050 A social accounting matrix is developed to examine the social and
environmental interconnectedness to the various parts of the economy. An institutional analysis
considers the mandates of existing institutions in the states, and of the potential role that
regulatory measures (such as environmental impact assessment) may contribute to
environmentally sustainable development without undermining economic growth prospects;
market-based incentive approaches are evaluated as a complement to the existing regulatory
approaches. The report concludes with options for consideration in the years ahead; ongoing
research to fill critical scientific gaps is a key element in future planning.

Executive Summary

Context

Some four million people inhabit Figure ES.1. Tracks of Hurricanes, Tropical Storms, &
Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula within a Tropical Depressions that Hit Yucatán, 1970-2014
short distance of 1,941 linear kilometers
of coastline. The regional economy of
the three states in the peninsula –
Campeche, Yucatán and Quintana Roo –
demonstrates both the diversity of
activities and the interdependence
between the coast and economic
growth. Quintana Roo is Mexico’s
second largest tourist destination,
having received some 10.8 million
visitors in 2013. Mining, oil and gas
feature strongly in Campeche’s
economy and are an important impetus
to ongoing development and need for Source: http://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes.
coastal infrastructure: nearly 30 percent of Mexico's fossil fuel reserves are located on the
Campeche sound and in the deep sea of the Gulf of Mexico. The state of Yucatán similarly
depends on natural and cultural tourism; in 2012, the state’s main archeological sites (Chichén
Itzá, Ek Balám, Uxmal and Dzibilchaltún) received a total of 2.15 million visitors.

For the three states of the Yucatán Peninsula, coastal areas underpin the main economic
activities. The region faces potentially major impacts due to population growth, infrastructure
development, and economic activity. However, the state of environmental management in the
peninsula has not kept up with this level of economic activity, both in terms of knowledge
production and of regulation. As a result, coastal and marine ecosystems have suffered.

Climate change could also have significant impacts on the Yucatán Peninsula, including an
increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and alteration of marine
ecosystems (e.g. coral bleaching). Due to its vulnerability to hurricanes, floods and sea level rise,
the Yucatán Peninsula is expected to become much more vulnerable to climate events
(Figure ES.1). The Yucatán Peninsula is anticipated to experience the largest increases in
temperature in Mexico, and climate change could potentially increase the poverty rate from
15.13 percent to 18.81 percent by 2030.

In response to this challenge, the state governments from the Yucatán Peninsula requested
World Bank support to strengthen the knowledge to support coastal management, as well as to
leverage the region’s natural capital to support an economic development t hat is socially
inclusive, clean, efficient, and resilient. In response to this request, the World Bank conducted
analytical work and engaged a wide stakeholder base to identify priority issues, assess alternative

policies, and lay the foundation to continuously bolster knowledge generation and management
in these areas.

The analytical work summarized in this report was conducted by an inter-disciplinary team.
Economic analysis was used to quantify and prioritize the costs of environmental degradation
and natural disasters, which have among the highest impacts on the Yucatán Peninsula. A
different type of economic analysis was used to develop a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM)
representing the flows of all economic transactions that take place within the Quintana Roo
economy. The SAM helped to provide quantitative estimates on the environmental sustainability,
economic contributions, and social implications of alternative tourism development scenarios in
Quintana Roo. Geomorphological studies helped to assess challenges and opportunities for
coastal management in the Yucatán Peninsula, with a view towards addressing current erosion
problems and anticipated climate change impacts, such as sea level rise. Policy and institutional
analysis underpinned the recommendations presented within this report.

A number of institutions participated in discussions and workshops with the team that conducted
the analytical work. These included federal organizations, particularly Mexico’s Secretary of
Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and the National Institute of Ecology and
Climate Change (INECC). At the state level, representatives from Campeche’s Secretary of
Environment and Sustainable Use (SMAAS), Quintana Roo’s Secretary of Ecology and
Environment (SEMA), and Yucatán’s Secretary of Urban Development and Environment
(SEDUMA) provided though leadership and guidance. Academic researchers and representatives
from Civil Society Organizations from the Yucatán Peninsula also provided valuable insights and
shared ongoing efforts.

Integrated Coastal Zone Management and its Role in Green Growth

Habitation in coastal areas is common and people have been dealing with changes in coastal
systems since time immemorial. Adaptation to change is nothing new in human history.
Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), however, has become more frequently adopted as
a formal, semi-codified process that attempts to reconcile conflicts and capture opportunities
among stakeholders and traditional economic sectors in the coastal zone and marine areas. Key
precepts of ICZM generally include: (i) an initial assessment of conditions based on best available
science; (ii) risk assessments; (ii) formulation of cost-effective interventions; (iv) implementation
of priority interventions through a wide range of stakeholders; and, (v) continuous monitoring
and evaluation within a long-term process that permits updates in knowledge and adaptation
through new or reformed interventions. Its scope also permits a broader form of objectives
encompassing social well-being and environmental sustainability in addition to traditional
economic growth. In complex systems such as the coastal resources of the Yucatán Peninsula,
ICZM thus provides an approach for achieving “Green Growth”: economic growth that respect s
environmental constraints while promoting social and economic welfare. Recent practical ICZM
approaches have also focused on the reduction of vulnerability under uncertainty, and the
incorporation of ideas of the global commons in the integration of global fishery issues,
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, and other issues that extend beyond a simple coastal
stretch.

Many Latin American governments have instituted sectoral approaches to environmental
development: individual laws and procedures for measuring and mitigating environmental
impacts in individual sectors (i.e. tourism, mining, agricultural, etc.). However, these laws lead to
an ad hoc approach and fail to capture the cumulative impacts of all associated activities.
Nonetheless, in terms of drawing lessons from ICZM, in many cases it is “too early to tell”. ICZM
is by its nature an intergenerational undertaking. Many regard some of the early experiences in
the United States and Europe to be successful, but there too, more recent advances in coastal
management have seen, for example, the promotion of managed retreat or realignment of
shorelines. This process abandons decades, or even centuries, of efforts to use hard defenses as
a management mechanism. Even such backtracking, however, can be interpreted as a success; it
shows that decision-making adapts as new information is made available.

Few countries have the formal regulatory structures that permit comprehensive management of
large spaces and sensitive ecosystems in an integrated manner. In Mexico, command-and-control
regulations based on a sectorial approach exist, as do other piecework environmental
regulations, but there is no structure to tie together various jurisdictions and ministries and
coordinate their actions, let alone coordinate among different sectors for ICZM. However, with
regards to the regulatory framework, something approaching integrated coastal zone
management is undertaken in Mexico largely through three policy instruments: (i) Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA); (ii) the creation of Marine Protected Zones; and (iii) ecological zoning.

In Mexico, there are significant capacity and regulatory gaps that hinder the implementation of
EIA in general, and in particular, for cumulative impacts. EIA practice in Mexico has a number of
limitations, including inadequate scoping, elaboration of environmental impact studies based on
incomplete data, insufficient participation from external experts in the preparation and
evaluation of environmental impact statements, faulty public participation, absence of clear
criteria to evaluate environmental impact statements, and weak enforcement and follow-up to
ensure that the project developer complies with all the requirements established by SEMARNAT
during the EIA process. In brief, Mexico’s EIA system in its current form is not well suited for
coastal zone management.

Mexico has 177 Natural Protected Areas, of which nearly 70 span over marine or coastal
ecosystems. There has been debate over how to use these marine protected areas (MPAs) as an
avenue for ICZM, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico. Indeed, ecological processes within the
marine environment of the gulf cannot be separated from those that occur along the coast and
within the river systems. Everything is connected, but no overall plan for managing the health of
the gulf currently exists. A challenge is to integrate coastal zone management with Large Marine
Ecosystems (LME) management, and to develop plans that take into account the health of the
entire gulf.

Mexico’s Ecological Zoning Program is more promising as a means for putting ICZM into action.
Stakeholders can, through a consultative process, agree upon a set of requirements for
development in a given ecological area. All subsequent projects are then, through the EIA
regulation, required to adhere to these requirements. Territorial Environmental Land Use
Programs (Programas de Ordenamiento Ecológico del Territorio or POETs) are regional

development plans developed through participatory processes in which local, state, and federal
government stakeholders, as well as civil society and academics, come together in a process
designed to maximize consensus. These instruments have been extensively used in Mexico,
including throughout the Yucatán Peninsula, but results have been inconclusive. To date, there
have been no rigorous attempts to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the preparation
and enforcement of POETs, most of which lack an appropriate monitoring and evaluation
framework. In fact, most of Mexico’s coastal zones lack a POET. These plans, however, are a
valuable consensus-making tool and provide one of the best ways of formalizing the agreements
that need to be made if various municipalities, states, and ministries are going to work together.

As described previously, adaptation to change is a natural human response. Climate change
adaptation (CCA) can be documented back to the ice age. One potential way forward is to link
ICZM efforts to ongoing CCA efforts. Mexico has been proactive in addressing climate change.
The country’s mitigation strategy is one of the strongest and most developed among middle- and
low-income countries. In terms of adaptation, the country is still in the planning stages:
addressing capacity and designing interventions. Under the climate change law, Mexico intends
to alter patterns of development with a view to limiting vulnerability. The law would also
conserve ecosystems to retain natural barriers to cyclonic storms and other climate events. In
Quintana Roo, for instance, authorities are taking proactive steps, through a cross-cutting Office
of Climate Change, to enact policies for altering land use in coastal areas and for mitigating
disaster risk. In many cases, the practices undertaken as part of climate change initiatives —
particularly the changes in land use—are similar to those that would be undertaken through
integrated coastal zone management. However, efforts are hampered by the difficulty of
managing participatory processes, by the distribution of responsibilities among many different
agencies, and by the lack of specific funding allocated to climate change adaptation. A first step
has been taken to overcome those hurdles by the creation of the regional climate change
commission for the Yucatán Peninsula, a joint committee created by the three states that seeks
to coordinate efforts on climate change mitigation and adaptation. The commission still faces
several challenges, including lack of a solid jurisdictional mandate and institutionalization,
absence of funding for the institution itself, and limited availability of funds for specific
interventions.

ICZM is a potentially demanding process that requires adequate information and strong
institutions. It calls for focusing of efforts to targeted issues, and improving the information base
on which decisions are made.

Coastal Geomorphology and the Role of Shoreline Management Plans

The entire coastal zone of the Peninsula is one of outstanding natural resources and beauty,
which has enabled its tourism industry to become a significant sector of Mexico’s economy. Most
of the tourist industry is focused on the coastal zone and its coastal reefs, shoreline beaches, and
ecologically important lagoons. The Biosphere Reserves of Sian Ka’an in Quintana Roo, Ria
Celestun in Yucatán, and Laguna de Terminos in Campeche reflect the national and international
importance of the coastal ecology of the Yucatán Peninsula. They also provide a range of habitats



                                                 –x–              Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
that is dependent upon its physical characteristics – a karstic platform with few rivers, low tidal
range, and a series of barrier islands. These natural resources are, however, facing increasing
threats from external changes such as increases in sea level and hurricane frequency, and also
from the presence of coastal infrastructure and its associated extensive and uncoordinated
coastal defenses.

Sea level rise, both existing and predicted, is likely to be the major factor affecting Yucatán coastal
behavior over the next few decades. Landward migration of the barrier beaches due to existing
sea level rise, exacerbated by accelerated eustatic sea level rise and local seasonal fluctuations,
both due to global warming, will affect all shoreline properties. Sand inundation of backshore
properties will also occur as barriers roll over. Shore defenses to combat the erosion, already
deployed by local residents, will lead to increased erosion down-drift.

A preliminary examination of the tide gauge records from Progreso and Ciudad de Carmen,
undertaken for this study, suggests a relative sea level rise over the past few decades of between
3 and 5 mm per year. This existing rise in sea level may be in addition to that predicted to occur
as a result of global warming. Current IPCC predictions under a low emission scenario
(i.e. RCP 2.6) are for a total rise in sea level of 0.26 m by 2100 and 0.95 m for a worst-case
scenario (i.e. RCP 8.5). However, many authorities consider that this underestimates the threat
and suggest that eustatic sea level will rise by between 0.5 and 2.0 m. This, together with the
existing rate of 3 to 5 mm per year on the Yucatán coast, would mean a total sea level rise of
between 0.77 m and 2.45 m by the end of the century. In addition, the predicted rise in ocean
temperatures due to global warming may increase the existing seasonal fluctuation in water
levels along this coast.
       Coastal erosion

Coastal erosion is now seen as a major issue for the social and economic development of all three
coastal states on the Yucatán Peninsula. Rates of erosion vary according to the area under review.
For example, Meyer Arendt (1991) reports rates of 0.6 m per year at Progreso, while Gonzalez-
Leija (2013) reported 15 m per year at Cancun. In contrast, Diez (2009), working on the Cancun
shore, reports a 34 m retreat in the period 1984-2004, a rate of 1.7 m per year. Gutierrez-Estrada
(1988) calculated an average erosion rate 1.8 m per year for the north Yucatán coast over a
110 year period. It is important to recognize that most of the erosion records provided in the
literature are for periods commencing at least 50 years and in some case 100 years ago,
indicating that shore erosion on the Yucatán is not a recent phenomenon.

The explanations often advanced for this widespread erosion are: (i) sea level rise due to global
warming; and (ii) human interference in the coastal system. Neither of them provides an
adequate reason for the observed erosion rates. Reported erosion rates commencing at least
100 years ago support the conclusion that the process began before extensive human
development of this coast.

The most common response to coastal erosion on the Yucatán Peninsula, as elsewhere in the
world, is to construct hard defenses in the form of groins and seawalls. These are intended to



                                                  – xi –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
stave off erosion and protect from catastrophic events such as hurricanes. In Cancun, following
Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, extensive repair of damaged frontage hotels and business properties
took place. Defenses, mainly in the form of sea walls, but including rip-rap barriers, were
constructed, but loss of beach material continued. This prompted a beach nourishment program,
which is a second approach to addressing erosion and appears to be the presently favored means
of coastal defense. Programs recently implemented or currently in progress include the 3 million
cubic meter recharge at Cancun, recirculation of dredged sediment from navigation channels
along the north Yucatán coast and a proposed recharge of beaches protected by artificial reef for
a new hotel complex at San Miguelito, Quintana Roo. But beach nourishment also depends on
sediment recharge, which requires careful consideration of the sediment transport pathways
prior to sediment extraction; in many cases no such analysis is provided, leading to progressive
deterioration of the coastal system.
       Some insights from geomorphology

The geomorphology of the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula has not received detailed attention in
the scientific literature. Several papers and books deal with the geology of the area and there is
a substantial literature on the ecology of the coast; only a few authors have focused on the local
dynamics of sediment and coastal morphology. There are no published accounts of the large scale
geomorphology of the peninsula. One problem facing any such investigation is the lack of primary
data on coastal energy and materials. There are no wave data for the area and only two tide
gauges: Progreso and Carmen. Studies of beach sediment are restricted to granulometry and
chemistry and there have been no attempts to identify beach sand sources or sinks. Preliminary
analytical work conducted for this study, has, however permitted some insights to be drawn of
relevance to future planning.

      In southern Campeche, there are several examples where it is clear that direct human
       intervention has resulted in local erosion. One example of this is the erosion of the
       foreshore of Carmen Island.
      In northern Campeche, the area is characterized by fine grained sediment, and planning
       processes cannot be approached in the same way as those cells formed in sand-sized
       material. This section of the coast is undeveloped and is of high ecological value.
      In Yucatán to northern Quintana Roo, preliminary observations of satellite imagery
       suggest that a continuous sediment pathway, identified on satellite imagery by major
       sand waves, exists between Isla Contoy in Quintana Roo and Celestun in Yucatán. These
       waves along the entire coastal zone of Yucatán and the accretion at Celestun, suggests
       that there is no sediment deficit on this coast. Erosion rates observed along this coast
       cannot necessarily be explained by changes in environmental conditions and it may be
       therefore that the observed erosion is due to human interference in the sediment
       transport pathways. An alternative explanation remains that sediment transport along
       this coast has gradually declined over the Holocene and that, more recently, this decline
       has resulted in a negative sediment budget in which potential sediment transport is not
       met by supply, resulting in erosion of the foreshore. These alternative hypotheses are
       clearly incompatible, the one suggesting a positive sediment budget and only human



                                               – xii –          Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
       induced local erosion, the other proposing a long term decline in sediment supply
       terminating in a negative budget today. The next planning stage should be the acquisition
       of a detailed database that will allow rigorous testing of such behavioral models and thus,
       to inform the management process.
      Quintana Roo is likely dominated by two sediment cells: north of Cancun the net sediment
       transport pathway will be northward, while south of Cancun it will be southward. A
       divergent sediment boundary implies either that sediment is input to the divide from
       offshore, or that sediment is eroded from the shore to feed the opposing sediment
       pathways. In this case both the options may apply: there exists a sediment store in the
       straits between Isla Mujeres/Contoy and the mainland, and several authors have
       documented the erosion of the shoreline along the Cancun shore.
       Shoreline management

To overcome the challenges of erosion requires a fundamental understanding of the processes
acting on the shoreline system, and on how the system itself responds to such processes.
Shoreline Management is the physical management of the shore to reduce the impact of natural
hazards, such as flooding and erosion, but also to mitigate the physical impact of human
intervention in the coastal system. Its overall objective is for a shore system that is self-sustaining
– that is one which is resilient and does not require human maintenance. Shoreline management
therefore constitutes one component of the larger program of ICZM; it may be thought of as
providing an interface between coastal science and coastal management. The process of
shoreline management includes production of a Shoreline Management Plan (SMP), designed to
evaluate the behavior of a coast, both in response to environmental and human impacts, and to
use this information to inform the economic, social and environmental plans for the coast. In this
sense, the SMP offers information to the ICZM planners; thus it must aim for efficient
communication of relevant coastal science to ICZM planners.

A Shoreline Management Plan sets out how the coast should best be managed in the future. It
is:

      An account of the past and predicted future behavior of a stretch of coastline, normally
       defined as a sediment cell;
      A large scale assessment of the risks for people and property associated with coastal
       processes within the SMP area;
      Designed to inform a policy framework that sustainably reduces risks to people and to the
       developed, historic, and natural environments – a policy framework that is central to the
       ICZM process.
SMPs set out the approach to achieve long term sustainability of coastal risk management for a
specific stretch of coast. Their aim is to provide the basis for sustainable shoreline management
policies over the next 100 years within a natural process unit (sediment cell or sub-cell). The
stretch of coast that an SMP covers includes one or more sediment cells and will typically include




                                                 – xiii –          Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
a number of communities and land uses, and a series of different physical features and coastal
defenses.

The process of SMP development includes five main tasks:

   1. Definition of sediment cells as the basic unit for coastal zone management;
   2. Collation of a coastal data base designed to support the science within the SMP;
   3. Development of conceptual (or behavioral) models for each sediment cell;
   4. Evaluation of societal demands on the coast; and
   5. Reconciliation of scientific and societal demands within the SMP framework
The content of the final SMP is shown in Table ES.1. It includes a description of the physical
processes of the coast, a review of its present and anticipated land-use, and an outline of policies
that could result in long-term sustainable use. Finally, after consultation with coastal user groups,
the SMP should report on a preferred option for shoreline management that reconciles both its
natural processes and the human uses.

                                     applied. These may not necessarily coincide with the
                                     sediment cell boundaries. Policies may include coastal
                                     defence provision; managed retreat from coastal hazard

       The Yucatán Peninsula database

A key component of the development of an SMP should be the collection, storage, and retrieval
of coastal data that can be used to develop the conceptual models of the coast. Data should be
acquired from both primary and secondary (i.e. existing) sources, with a bias towards secondary
data to reduce both costs and time; in many cases secondary data sources are either lacking or
inadequate.

The existing database for the Yucatán Peninsula is not considered adequate to support any
detailed shoreline management. What limited data is available is focused on local issues at scales
significantly smaller than those of the sediment cells outlined above. This means that
management tends to rely on reducing local impacts, rather than seeking general causes of
coastal problems. The lack of any data on waves, tides, currents, bathymetry, shoreline
topography, and the minimal data on sea level rise must be seen as a major impediment to
effective shoreline management. Urgent attention must be given to redress this situation.

Economics of Environmental Priorities

        Cost of natural disasters and climate change implications

A preliminary analysis was conducted on the data on floods, storms and rains that are associated
with the wet air masses that moved over the Atlantic and hit the Yucatán Peninsula. This analysis
shows an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, as well as growing damages per
event. These trends could be largely attributed to an increase in land and water temperature in
the region, which has been linked to climate change. If global temperatures were to continue this
upward trend, temperatures in the region would also continue to rise and would likely be
associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Table ES.2
provides a summary of projections of future temperature change and other climate change
indicators for the State of Yucatán. These projections are used as a basis for demonstrating the
potential economic damages from natural disasters arising from climate change.

Projections from the DICE 2009 model (Nordhaus, 2010) were applied to compute an increase of
global temperature from pre-industrial level up to 2050. For this analysis, the “optimal CO2
emission scenario” from the DICE 2009 model was used. Results of DICE 2009 are consistent with
the range for temperature change presented in Table ES.2. The analysis was thus conducted using
global temperature as the major exogenous parameter and presenting frequency and severity of
extreme weather events as a function of global temperature increase.

The deadliest historical natural disasters in Yucatán took place in 1990. Overall mortality trends
have remained relatively constant for the last 40 years in Mexico, but mortality from extreme
weather events has fallen slightly, to the credit of official efforts to improve preparedness to


                                                – xv –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
these events. However, despite these efforts, the number of people affected by extreme events
has increased significantly over the last 20 years.

The economic analysis relies on a per case cost for the worst disasters, looking individually at:
(i) lives lost; (ii) people affected; (iii) houses destroyed; (iv) houses affected; (v) schools affected;
(vi) medical centers affected; (vii) hectares of crop loss; and, (viii) livestock lost. The unit losses
were translated into future potential economic losses through Monte Carlo analyses simulations
driven by different climate scenarios. If GDP were to grow 2-3 percent annually in the three states
in the Yucatán Peninsula, the annual mean economic cost of extreme weather events (ordinary
events) would be about 0.4 percent of GDP. This figure is about twice more than the annual cost
of natural disasters for Mexico as a whole. However, in the 95th percentile (when the damages
would be highest) this cost could reach 1.4-1.5 percent of GDP in 2020 and 1.6-2.3 percent of
GDP in 2050.

These results provide an economic valuation of potential damages from meteorological events
associated with climate change. The estimates are based on economic valuation methods
associated with probabilistic events. The uncertainty in cost estimates remains significant and
may differ considerably depending also on the geographical incidence and timing of the event.
The exercise demonstrates that economic valuation can be helpful in communicating risks and in
identifying priorities. In the overall ICZM context, such valuations can also be conducted to
determine the economic impacts of other hazards (e.g., water pollution, air pollution, soil
contamination), which may be hypothesized to be relevant in specific local circumstances. Before
this report, no such analyses to have been undertaken for the Yucatán Peninsula; the following
section summarizes another such example

Economic valuation of potential damages demonstrates that there is a trend of ever-increasing
cost impacts. Avoiding even a small portion of such costs through appropriate emergency
preparedness, risk mitigation, or similar programs would be money well spent. ICZM efforts that
reduce vulnerability to these significant hazards are an important adaptation mechanism. These
efforts should consider both relatively infrequent, but catastrophic events, as well as events with
less severe impacts, but that occur frequently.

        Cost of environmental degradation in the Yucatán Peninsula

In the Yucatán Peninsula, as practically everywhere else, government agencies have limited
resources to develop policies and support interventions that will contribute to sustainable
development. Having a rigorous methodology to set priorities is therefore essential to ensure
that scarce public resources target the environmental issues that cause the most severe social
and economic impacts, and particularly those that affect primarily the poor and other vulnerable
groups. A methodologically rigorous approximation to identify environmental priorities is to
quantify the impacts and economic costs of these issues. As part of this analysis, economic
valuation techniques were used to estimate the cost of environmental degradation impacts on
human health, and thus on economic and social development and well-being. To estimate these
impacts, the first part of the analysis calculated the number of deaths and cases of illnesses
caused by environmental problems with well-established health effects, particularly household


                                                  – xvi –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
(indoor) air pollution, outdoor air pollution, lead exposure, and inadequate water supply,
sanitation and hygiene. These calculations relied on available data at the state and national
levels, as well as from an extensive literature review. Where possible and relevant, risks were
estimated based on the specific characteristics of stakeholders, such as age group, or urban vs.
rural settings, among others. For example, because indoor air pollution occurs within home
dwellings, its impacts for different households can be more easily evaluated. Other categories of
environmental degradation—such as outdoor air pollution or exposure to lead—occur in areas
where the differentiation of effects across different stakeholder groups cannot be measured
using the available resources and data.

After estimating the health impacts of the environmental risks, the analysis quantified the
economic losses that they represent. These losses come in many forms, including loss of income,
productivity, and contributions to household activities due to premature mortality, illness, and
neuropsychological impairments (IQ losses). Illness also involves cost of medical treatment.
These costs were quantified in monetary terms by means of valuation techniques used in
economics.

Using conservative assumptions, the analysis estimates that 1,073 – 1,100 people died in the
Yucatán Peninsula in 2013 from environmental health risks (Table ES.3). In terms of health
impacts in the peninsula, household air pollution is the most severe problem, followed by
outdoor air pollution; these two types of air pollution are responsible for around 80% of deaths
associated with an environmental health risk. Adult lead (Pb) exposure and inadequate water,
sanitation and hygiene caused 13% and 7% of total deaths, respectively.

From an economic standpoint, the annual cost of the environmental health effects is estimated
in the range of MX$ 10,900 – 16,100 million in 2013, with a mid-point estimate of MX$ 13,500
million. This cost is equivalent to 2.2 – 3.3 percent of Yucatán Peninsula’s estimated gross
regional income in 2013, with a mid-point estimate of 2.75 percent. Lead exposure is responsible
for 48 percent of this cost, mostly because of it results in impaired intelligence in children and a
consequent reduction in lifetime earnings. About 26 percent of the cost is from household air
pollution, 16 percent is from outdoor air pollution, and 10 percent of the cost is from inadequate
water, sanitation and hygiene.

Peninsula are significant and result in a major loss of economic opportunities and quality of life,

these challenges, the state governments of the Yucatán Peninsula could consider filling additional
knowledge gaps and assessing interventions targeting environmental priority problems.

Although blood lead levels have been decreasing over time, efforts should be made to identify
and control lead exposure in “hotspots”. In addition, in light of recent evidence of the severity of
impacts of lead in children, measurement studies should be undertaken to confirm blood lead
levels among children, map geographic pockets of high blood lead levels, and identify and control
sources of lead exposure.

Given the significant health effects and high cost of household use of solid fuels for cooking,
increased emphasis should be placed on improved cooking stoves, ventilation, and switching of
fuel to LPG. When tackling both indoor and outdoor air pollution, governmental efforts should
prioritize mitigating emissions and reducing concentration of PM2.5, which is the air pollutant
with the largest health effects.

Finally, improvements should be continued in the water and sanitation sector, with emphasis on
bridging the sanitation gap, ensuring good quality drinking water, and continuing efforts to
improve hand washing practices and other hygiene dimensions.

Although the three state governments from the Yucatán Peninsula have begun to address shared
challenges jointly, notably in the case of climate change, there is currently no priority setting
mechanism in the region and the scarce available resources are not used to address the
categories of environmental degradation that are causing the most significant effects. This
economic analysis of health costs provides an urgently needed framework to align resources and
efforts to achieve better environmental conditions. The methodologies and approach adopted
by this analytical work can be replicated in the future to evaluate progress in reducing
environmental conditions, identifying policy and intervention improvements, and determining
the most efficient use of scarce resources. In doing so, it is crucial to continuously incorporate
new scientific findings, evolving methodologies, and broader stakeholder perspectives.

       Tourism and social inclusion

Another priority challenge for the Yucatán Peninsula’s coastal areas is the lack of sustainability
of the tourism model that has driven economic growth, particularly in Quintana Roo. This
represents an important case of an economy whose development has been led by the expansion
of the tourist industry organized around the traditional model of the tourist enclave and beach
resort concentration. Deteriorating environmental conditions and changing international trends
combined with climate change threats have made this tradition obsolete as a model of industrial
organization, and increasingly unreliable as an engine of sustainable development. Moreover,
the model has excluded local populations, particularly indigenous households, from its economic
benefits.

Because of its riches in terms of natural beauty, cultural heritage and human potential, Quintana
Roo appears particularly apt to accept the challenge of converting its economy toward the new
type of tourism, based on lower scale development, devoted to the ecological and cultural
aspects of the visitors’ experience, higher social and economic inclusion, and a more integrated
economic structure. The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) developed as part of the analytical work
helped to explore and test these hypotheses, on the basis of available statistics and the results
of two field surveys conducted on a sample of international and national tourists and of local
households, respectively.

The analysis conducted seems to corroborate the hypothesis that Quintana Roo can develop its
economy at a faster pace and with a more balanced growth by differentiating its development
model by: (i) re-balancing the spatial pattern of development through land use planning and
regulation, with special attention to the control of the urban sprawl and conservation of the
coastal ecosystem; (ii) promoting small scale development of the tourism supply chain more
widely, based on local entrepreneurship and small and specialized operators; (iii) investing in
environmental and of biodiversity conservation; (iv) investing in tourism development, through
basic infrastructure (water, sanitation, feeder roads) and non-basic infrastructure (access and
maintenance of archaeological sites, parks, museums), not only in proximity to the beaches and
seafronts, but also in the forest and wetland areas; and (v) encouraging the involvement of the
indigenous population in the various segments of the tourism supply chain, including agriculture,
transportation, lodging, and tourism operations.

Environmental Impact Assessment Revisited

Mexico’s legal framework and practice are not suited to support comprehensive environmental
management. This becomes particularly clear when assessing EIA in coastal zones. Arguably, from
its conception, EIA was not meant to be the predominant environmental management tool, but
to complement other legal, economic, and administrative instruments by opening up
environmental authorities’ decision making to public scrutiny, particularly in relation to projects
likely to cause significant environmental impacts. However, in Mexico, as in other countries, EIA
has become the main environmental management tool and is often the only instrument used to
address complex environmental problems, as exemplified by coastal zone management in
Campeche.

In the cases reviewed for this report, EIA practice had a number of limitations, including
inadequate scoping, elaboration of environmental impact studies based on incomplete data,
insufficient participation from external experts in the preparation and evaluation of the
Environmental Impact Statement (MIA – “Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental”), faulty public
participation, absence of clear criteria to evaluate the MIA, and weak enforcement and follow-
up to ensure that the project developer complies with all the requirements established by
SEMARNAT during the EIA process.

Part of the difficulties for the better use of EIA stem from the existing legal framework. On one
hand, the laws and regulations include a large number of activities for which an EIA must be
undertaken. On the other hand, SEMARNAT is required to approve all MIAs, unless they fall under


                                                – xix –          Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
the specific circumstances mentioned above. As a result, SEMARNAT receives a very large
number of MIAs every year, which it has to evaluate under tight deadlines. As a rough
comparison, in Mexico an average of 2,786 projects per year were submitted to the EIA process
between 2008 and 2012, compared with an average of 463 projects per year in the United State.
The resources and time that SEMARNAT has available for each of these projects is limited,
curtailing opportunities to engage other agencies, external specialists, or the public. Lack of
resources is also a constraint to conduct field visits for supervision and enforcement.

As in Mexico, most countries in Latin America use lists to determine which projects or activities
are subject to an EIA. The existence of such lists is supposed to reduce discretionary decision-
making. However, they generate a different problem: the rigidity of the lists limits their ability to
filter out the actions that would not generate significant environmental effects. Lists are also
used to determine whether a regional or a specific MIA should be prepared. In the specific case
of coastal areas, only large aquaculture projects would call for a regional MIA. Other cases that
would trigger the preparation of a regional MIA include projects with potential synergistic,
cumulative, or residual impacts on ecosystems. However, there is a dearth of methodologies,
guidelines, and regulations that guide effective cumulative and synergistic impact assessments.
Arguably, many projects in coastal areas would likely have cumulative or synergistic impacts.
However, as the reviewed cases show, the EIA for projects in the coast of Campeche did not need
to address these types of impacts.

EIA’s potential contributions to ICZM are also limited because of insufficient involvement of
independent domestic or international experts, which is not required under the regulatory
framework in place. In addition, project developers are responsible for hiring the consultant who
prepares the EIA, resulting in a clear conflict of interests. Developers’ main interests are meeting
the bare minimum legal requirements and overcoming any potential objections to the project.
Consultants thus have incentives to focus on these objectives, rather than on conducting rigorous
environmental studies.

Public participation can add value to the EIA process by making visible the problems, constraints,
opportunities, and challenges that tended to be hidden by limited screening, scoping, and
environmental impact study preparation stages. However, public hearings are often resource-
intensive and, if not properly organized, can easily turn into a community’s opportunity to voice
demands for issues with little or no relationship to the project. Clearly regulating the public
hearings process, as well as complying with other provisions aiming to facilitate public
participation, such as ensuring that the relevant information is publicly available, could
strengthen EIA practice in Mexico.

One of the fundamental contributions of EIA is the identification of mitigation measures that can
be implemented to avoid, minimize, or offset the negative effects associated with the proposed
project. For this reason, the EIA process includes a follow-up mechanism that would ideally help
authorities to ensure that the conditions for approval are fulfilled, to monitor whether the
action’s environmental impacts are similar to those predicted by the environmental impact study,
to assess whether the selected mitigation measures are effective, and to generate information
to improve other EIAs.


                                                 – xx –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
In Mexico, as in other countries, environmental authorities rarely monitor the action’s imp acts
after the corresponding license or permit has been issued, mainly due to lack of resources.
Exploring mechanisms to increase the resources available to environmental agencies, such as
including the cost of supervision in the fees paid by developers, is therefore crucial to improve
EIA’s effectiveness.

One clear complementary or replacement intervention to the EIA process is increasing reliance
on market-based incentives. This report reviewed a range of such incentives, including: (i) user
charges and taxes/subsidies; (ii) market creation through tradable permits and deposit/refund
mechanisms; (iii) market creation through payment for ecosystem services; (iv) final demand
intervention such as eco-labeling, disclosure requirements, and environmental awareness
building; (v) final demand intervention related to supply-chain management; and,
(vi) introduction of more comprehensive liability legislation. While all such approaches have their
advantages and disadvantages, coastal systems and the activities within them are adequately
diverse that the use of such instruments may usefully complement the currently dominant
command-and-control approach.

In the context of ICZM, the complexity of problems and issues does not always lend itself to a
single approach. Indeed, systems that rely primarily on EIA would benefit from complementary
market-based approaches, legal relief through publicly accessible regulatory and court processes,
and voluntary mechanisms by industries that meet local social and environmental goals while
also contributing to cost-effective operations. An appropriate way forward for EIA reforms is to
identify and implement such complementary market-based approaches.

Recommendations: A Way Forward

This report has highlighted the need to fill scientific knowledge gaps and to develop a strong
knowledge base that can inform decision-making and lead to an integrated coastal zone
management, resulting in enhanced environmental, economic, and social resilience in the
Yucatán Peninsula. In addition, this report’s findings provide compelling arguments to develop
specific interventions to tackle the obstacles to green and inclusive growth faced by the Yucatán
Peninsula.

A major obstacle to confront the peninsula’s development challenges is the lack of a formal
priority setting mechanism and an adequate institutional framework to align available resources
with the most pressing environmental challenges. Using rigorous priority-setting tools, such as
the cost of environmental degradation study presented in this report, is an important step to fill
this gap. Once environmental priorities have been set, institutional resources should be aligned
to address them, and if needed, policies or regulations should be adopted or reformed to
efficiently and effectively tackle the issues that are causing the most severe damages. Monitoring
and evaluation systems should also be strengthened to assess the extent to which the objectives
of environmental priorities are being met. Accumulation of data, results, and experiences in
policy design and implementation should be integrated into the M&E systems to support
continuous social learning that underpins further policy improvements.

The existing regulatory toolkit is inadequate to promote ICZM in the Yucatán Peninsula. Shoreline
Management Plans (SMPs) are a proven approach to achieve long term sustainability of coastal
risk management for a specific stretch of coast. Developing an SMP includes five main tasks:
(i) definition of sediment cells as the basic unit for coastal zone management; (ii) collation of a
coastal data base designed to support the science within the SMP; (iii) development of
conceptual (or behavioral) models for each sediment cell; (iv) evaluation of societal demands on
the coast; and (v) reconciliation of scientific and societal demands within the SMP framework.

To conduct these tasks, the next steps should focus on the collection, storage, and retrieval of
coastal data that can be used to develop the conceptual models of the coast. Data should be
acquired from both primary and secondary sources. The advantage of using secondary data is
that it can reduce both costs and time; however, in many cases secondary data sources are either
lacking or inadequate.

The existing database for the Yucatán Peninsula is not considered adequate to support any
detailed shoreline management. What limited data is available is focused on local issues at scales
significantly smaller than those of the sediment cells outlined in the geomorphology sections of
this report. This means that management tends to rely on reducing local impacts, rather than
seeking general causes of coastal problems. The lack of any data on waves, tides, currents,
bathymetry, shoreline topography, and the minimal data on sea level rise must be seen as a major
impediment to effective shoreline management. Specific actions are needed to lay the
foundations for an information system that can integrate existing and new data to help fill these
data gaps.

Given the significant impacts caused by environmental degradation in the Yucatán Peninsula, the
environmental information system should also integrate data that will underpin the development
of effective and efficient interventions to tackle environmental health risks. Indoor and outdoor
air pollution cause the most significant health impacts. Therefore, the monitoring system should
prioritize monitoring of emissions, concentrations and exposure levels to fine particulate matter
in outdoor and indoor environments. Initial efforts could focus on monitoring PM2.5, and
gradually expand capacity to also monitor PM1.0. The monitoring system should also include a
source and composition inventory of the source structure of both primary and secondary PM to
guide future air quality management planning and interventions. The monitoring system could
also include black carbon emissions, a pollutant linked to PM, with known effects on the climate
and on human health.

Improving the knowledge base on lead exposure is also critical because this environmental health
risk causes the most significant economic losses in the Yucatán Peninsula. Although blood lead
levels have been decreasing over time, efforts should be made to identify and control lead
exposure in “hotspots”. In addition, in light of recent evidence of the severity of impacts of le ad
in children, measurement studies should be undertaken to confirm blood lead levels among
children, map geographic pockets of high blood lead levels, and identify and control sources of
lead exposure.

In addition to building this information system, steps to address the peninsula’s sustainability
challenges would include the preparation of pre-feasibility, feasibility, and design studies for
specific interventions on coastal management, pollution control, environmental health, and
management of natural ecosystems through strengthened management of natural protected
areas and Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). These studies would
help to identify the most efficient and effective alternatives to tackle the regional environmental
priorities presented in this report.

Finally, there are two different types of economic losses associated with the extreme weather
events that affect the Yucatán Peninsula: (i) relatively modest losses caused by low intensity, but
frequently occurring natural hazards; and (ii) high losses caused by catastrophic events that occur
more rarely. Studies should be prepared to assess the adaptation interventions that could be
implemented to reduce vulnerability to both kinds of economic losses, recognizing that the
benefits and costs of interventions to address the impacts of low intensity events can be
quantified with more certainty than those focusing on catastrophic events.

An appropriate way forward is to proceed with a series of pilot projects and interventions,
complemented by technical assistance, institutional strengthening, and a scientifically founded
M&E program consisting also of appropriate targeted R&D efforts. Table ES.4 summarizes this
report’s recommendations to help overcome the main obstacles to green and inclusive growth
faced by the Yucatán Peninsula.

   1. Introduction

   1.1     Overview

The Yucatán Peninsula is comprised by the three states of Campeche, Yucatán and Quintana Roo.
Its coast has an extent of 1,941 linear kilometers and has a population of more than four million
inhabitants. Among these three states, Quintana Roo has the longest coastline, stretching over
1,176 km, followed by Campeche, with a coastline of 425 km. The state of Yucatán, located in the
central part of the coast, has the smallest coastal territory, with 340 km (Figure 1.1) (INEGI, 2015).

In Quintana Roo, 10 of the Figure 1.1. Map of the Yucatán Peninsula
state’s 11 municipalities
are on the coast; in
Campeche seven of the 11
municipalities are coastal.
This      is    significantly
different from the case of
Yucatán, where only 13 of
a      total     of      106
municipalities are located
on the coast. In addition,
whereas Quintana Roo’s
and Campeche’s coastal
areas host each state’s
main urban centers, most
of      Yucatán      coastal
municipalities          have
populations of less than
                              Source: Google maps
10,000. Thus, although
Yucatán is the state with the largest total population, coastal populations are much larger in
Campeche and Quintana Roo (INEGI, 2010a).

In addition to these geographic and demographic variations, there are also important differences
in the economic structure of the coastal areas of these three states. In the case of Campeche,
mining contributed with more than 83 percent of the state’s GDP in 2009 (INEGI, 2011). Nearly
30 percent of Mexico's fossil fuel reserves are located on the Campeche sound and in the deep
sea of the Gulf of Mexico; in the last thirty years, development of these resources has accelerated
considerably (Yanez-Arancibia and Day, 2004). The oil industry in Mexico contributes an average
30 percent to public net income (SENER-SHCP) and makes Campeche—with its tremendous off
shore oil reserves—the fourth highest contributor to the nation’s GDP, contributing 5 percent to
the total GDP. As noted by Villalobos and Rivera (2009), after the discovery and exploitation of
oil deposits off the coast of Campeche, PEMEX, the state-owned oil company, established its
regional administrative center in Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche. Attracted by the relatively
favorable employment opportunities, population grew rapidly and the urban area expanded



                                                  –1–              Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
quickly, particularly between 1970 and 1990. Fishing and aquaculture are also important
economic activities, although clearly at a much smaller scale than oil production. Fishing and
aquaculture have relative low importance in Mexico, where the sector only accounts for
0.8 percent of the county’s GDP. Approximately 14 percent of this takes place in the Gulf of
Mexico and the Caribbean. This seems very little, but only four states concentrate 70 percent of
the total volume, making Campeche a relative fishing and aquaculture hotspot. Increasing
economic activity, coastal and inland, comes with higher demand for ports and marine and land
transport.

In the case of Quintana Roo, tertiary activities generated more than 85 percent of GDP in 2009
(INEGI, 2011). Quintana Roo is the second top tourist destination in Mexico, as evidenced by the
more than 10.8 million visitors it received in 2013 (more than 11 percent of total tourists for that
year). Even though the state received only about 4 percent of domestic tourists, the state was
the destination of 44 percent of the international visitors that traveled to Mexico in 2013 (CETM
2013). Moreover, Quintana Roo captured 38.9 percent of total foreign exchange into the country
from tourism in 2012 (SEDETUR, 2014). The share of tourism in the Quintana Roo economy is the
highest for any state in Mexico. For example, 53.3 percent of the state’s total gross output is
generated in the tourism sector. The predominance of the tourism sector is also clear in other
economic variables, including the percentage of jobs, economic units and compensation
generated by tourism (INEGI, 2010).

In the state of Yucatán, tertiary activities are also the backbone of the economy, contributing
more than 71 percent of GDP in 2009 (INEGI, 2011). However, 80 percent of tourists are domestic
and the number of total visitors is significantly smaller, representing about 15 percent of those
that visited Quintana Roo in 2013 (CETM 2013). Yucatán’s archaeological sites are the most
visited attraction. In 2012, the state’s main archeological sites (Chichén Itzá, Ek Balám, Uxmal and
Dzibilchaltún) received, a total of 2.15 million visitors, which represents an increment of
12 percent in comparison with 2011 (CULTUR, 2013).

   1.2     Environmental Issues and Priorities

For the three states of the Yucatán Peninsula, coastal areas underpin the main economic
activities. However, the state of environmental management in the peninsula has not kept up
with this level of economic activity, both in terms of knowledge production and of regulation. As
a result, coastal and marine ecosystems have suffered. Eutrophication is a major issue in the
waters off the Yucatán peninsula and the region faces potentially major impacts due to
population growth, infrastructure development, and economic activity (Herrera-Silveira et al.,
2004; Carranza-Edwards, Marín-Guzmán, and Rosales-Hoz, 2010). Water quality is a major issue
in the Yucatán, leading to “problems of human health, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, fish
kills, seagrass loss, coral reef destruction, and even marine mammal and seabird mortalit y”
(Herrera-Silveira et al., 2004).

In addition, climate change could have significant impacts on the Yucatán Peninsula, including an
increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and alteration of marine
ecosystems (e.g. coral bleaching) (Pech, 2010). The Yucatán Peninsula is anticipated to


                                                 –2–             Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
experience the largest increases in temperature in Mexico, and climate change could potentially
increase the poverty rate from 15.13 percent to 18.81 percent by 2030 (de la Fuente and Olivera,
2013). Furthermore, due to its vulnerability to hurricanes, floods and sea level rise, the Yucatán
Peninsula is expected to become much more vulnerable to climate events (Borja-Vega and de la
Fuente, 2013).

Although there are different physical and economic features, the Yucatán Peninsula states are in
many ways interdependent. All states benefit from natural and cultural heritage assets that form
the backbone to domestic and international tourism. Cooperation has been evident in
development of transportation infrastructure. Environmental policies mandated at the Federal
level require consistency and harmonization in implementation at the state level. With a
population of only 4 million, its future growth prospects will depend on continued cooperation
and harmonization of policies that do not undermine the growth potential. Hydrocarbon
development in Campeche, for example, must be done with appropriate environmental
standards in place such that environmental risks to the Yucatán Peninsula as a whole are not
increased. Competition for tourists must not be driven to the point where local carrying
capacities are exceeded.

The interdependence of the state economies is acknowledged by all parties, and has been
evident in the interest expressed to tackle large problems such as climate change that all states
face in common. What has been evident in the lead-up to this cooperation, however, is that there
remain substantial gaps in scientific knowledge. In spite of these gaps, many of the priorities in
environmental management have already been identified on a preliminary basis. What is not yet
clear, however, is the extent of the interconnections among these priorities, or their connection
to other policy priorities (e.g., poverty alleviation, economic diversification, or increased trade).
Addressing these interconnections and identifying the appropriate policy approaches, is a long-
term challenge that will depend on addressing the scientific gaps, testing different approaches in
an adaptive fashion, and sharing experiences over the coming decade to identify and to confront
the highest priority issues. In this context, this report summarizes the results of inter-disciplinary
analytical work that aims to take a first step at filling knowledge gaps by using rigorous
methodologies to: (i) identify and rank environmental problems; (ii) assess policy alternatives to
address key sustainable development challenges; and (iii) establish a social learning mechanism
to identify the shortcomings of proposed interventions and continuously improve them, as well
as consider the involvement of different stakeholder groups.

   1.3     Scope and Methodology

In response to this challenge, the state governments from the Yucatán Peninsula requested
World Bank support to strengthen the knowledge to support coastal management, as well as to
leverage the region’s natural capital to support an economic development that is socially
inclusive, clean, efficient, and resilient. In response to this request, the World Bank conducted
analytical work and engaged a wide stakeholder base to identify priority issues, assess alternative
policies, and lay the foundation to continuously bolster knowledge generation and management
in these areas.

The analytical work summarized in this report was conducted by an inter-disciplinary team.
Economic analysis was used to quantify and prioritize the costs of environmental degradation
and natural disasters, which have among the highest impacts on the Yucatán Peninsula. A
different type of economic analysis was used to develop a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM)
representing the flows of all economic transactions that take place within the Quintana Roo
economy. The SAM helped to provide quantitative estimates on the environmental sustainability,
economic contributions, and social implications of alternative tourism development scenarios in
Quintana Roo. Geomorphological studies helped to assess challenges and opportunities for
coastal management in the Yucatán Peninsula, with a view towards addressing current erosion
problems and anticipated climate change impacts, such as sea level rise. Policy and institutional
analysis underpinned the recommendations presented at the end of this report.

A number of institutions participated in discussions and workshops with the team that conducted
the analytical work. These included federal organizations, particularly Mexico’s Secretary of
Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and the National Institute of Ecology and
Climate Change (INECC). At the state level, representatives from Campeche’s Secretary of
Environment and Sustainable Use (SMAAS), Quintana Roo’s Secretary of Ecology and
Environment (SEMA), and Yucatán’s Secretary of Urban Development and Environment
(SEDUMA) provided though leadership and guidance. Academic researchers and representatives
from Civil Society Organizations from the Yucatán Peninsula also provided valuable insights and
shared ongoing efforts.

The report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 describes the institutional framework for coastal
management in the Yucatán Peninsula; within this context, it also provides a general overview of
integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and how Mexico is currently trying to implement it.
Chapter 3 discusses the relevance of coastal geomorphology to coastal management, both to
address current erosion problems and anticipated climate change impacts, such as sea level rise.
It concludes with a discussion of the role of shoreline management plans in coastal management.
The report next presents two different economic analyses in areas of high priority and interest
identified during stakeholder discussions. Chapter 4 discusses the results of the economic costs
of environmental degradation in the Yucatán Peninsula, focusing particularly on the historic
impacts of natural disasters and their potential effects in the context of future climate change.
Chapter 5 summarizes the results of an analysis conducted to identify and rank the
environmental problems that cause the most severe social and economic impacts in the Yucatán
Peninsula. Chapter 6 analyzes the economic structure of the Quintana Roo economy and the
impacts of tourism development for different economic sectors, based on which it discusses
opportunities to shift towards a tourism model that fosters social inclusion and conservation and
restoration of natural capital. Chapter 7 treats the potential role of environmental impact
assessment (EIA) as a means to integrated shoreline management and environmentally
sustainable development; EIA is already considerably developed but would need some reforms
for it to be a useful tool in the ICZM context. Most significantly, it needs to be strengthened in
terms of demands to project developers and accommodate adaptive measures in its regulatory
structure. Conclusions are provided in Chapter 8.

   2. Institutional Considerations for Coastal Management in the Yucatán
      Peninsula

   2.1     Introduction

Mexico’s environmental management framework is inadequate to address the large-scale
impacts of economic activities in the Yucatán Peninsula. In the case of offshore mining
operations, Mexico has a number of environmental regulations governing the construction and
operation of these projects; however several areas are either absent or under-enforced. For
example, public participation is extremely underutilized: public comments were incorporated
into only 19 percent of the cases studied by Hernandez et al. (2012). Additionally, there is
virtually no scope, within the Mexican governmental framework, for the states to take a role in
managing oil industry activities. Overall, Mexico’s legal infrastructure only contains half the
requirements that would be needed to create a regulatory environment conducive to sustainable
operation of the oil industry. For coastal tourism in Quintana Roo and for the fishing industry
along the Yucatán coast, this number is even lower: 36 percent and 25 percent respectively
(Hernandez et al., 2012; Vidal and Capurro-Filigrasso, 2011).

There are also a number of gaps regarding knowledge production. For instance, while
development of offshore oil reserves proceeds apace, there is little knowledge as to the impact
of these activities upon the marine environment. There have been studies, largely inconclusive,
of the effect of the presence of fossil fuel sediment within the water. However there have been
no long-term studies of the effect of pollution or other impacts associated with other phases of
the activity: construction, noise, transport, air quality, excavation, etc. (Hernandez et al., 2012).
Most of the research in the fisheries sector has been focused on how to conserve specific species,
rather than on how to consider broader ecosystem linkages (Garcia, 2003; Ortiz-Lozano, 2007).

In recent years, it has been recognized by academics and planners that regulations alone are not
enough to provide for the sustainable future of the coastal and marine ecosystems of the Yucatán
Peninsula. Even if each oilrig or fishing boat is operated according to regulation, the overall
development of the region would still entail potential ecosystem impacts. The resulting strategy
coordinates usage of land, water and national resources with a view to maintaining biodiversity
and preserving the overall health and resilience of the ecosystem (Maltby, 2003). On an
international level, this approach is often reflected in the integrated management of coastal and
marine ecosystems.

   2.2     Role of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)

   2.2.1   History of ICZM

Coasts have always been valuable zones of habitation both for human beings and for valuable
flora and fauna. As such, coastal systems include the biomes that are most vulnerable to impacts
from economic development (Lindeboom, 2002). In the past several decades, there has been
increasing interest in maintaining the natural biodiversity and the valuable ecosystem services of
these regions, even in the face of increasing development (Dietz et al., 2003).

Habitation in coastal areas is, however, nothing new and people have been dealing with changes
in coastal systems since time immemorial. The United Nations estimates that 44 percent of
people in the world live within 150 km of the coast. As depicted in Figure 2.1, 50,000 years of
such habitation has implicitly generated a long history of integrated coastal management through
which human populations have adapted to and modified coastal systems. The timeline
demonstrates simply that people have been dealing with changes in the coastal regions for a long
time. Going back 50,000 years, human populations have suffered through floods, changes in sea
level, droughts, wetting periods and drying periods. People have adapted to this through hard
engineering, such as dikes and embankments, changes in diet, diversification and many types of
adaptation. Notably, people have moved with the seashore. This time period includes geological
time: over the past 50,000 years there have been glaciation events, a flip in the earth’s magnetic
field, loss of Neanderthals, and evolution of Homo sapiens (the “Wise Man”) in a way that brings
us to the present. Moving forward, some argue that humanity will need to evolve to “Sustainable
Man” – Homo sustinens – to continue to adapt in a world of increasing population and vulnerable
resources.

Modern process-oriented ICZM is frequently considered to have started in San Francisco in 1965,
followed shortly by the US Coastal Zone Management Act. But the timeline in Figure 2.2 over the
past century also highlights that major works using process-oriented methods were also
conceived prior to that. Approaches in the Netherlands, for example, show a heavy engineering
response of Dutch ICZM before “Modern ICZM” was ever started. That engineering includes
putting in dikes that dried up a sea and turned it into polders, which is land useful for settlement
and agriculture. The practice of polders can be seen throughout Europe however: they are found
in the UK and other countries of mainland Europe. Bangladesh has also adopted the polder
practice over the past decades. All of the engineering in the Netherlands, however, was to protect
people and assets: devastating floods in 1916 and 1953 resulted in what are now arguably the
strongest coastal defenses in the world.

As shown in Figure 2.3, international norms were elaborated through the Noordwijk Guidelines
in 1993. European countries started policies of “managed realignment” in the 1990s: this
involved abandoning to the sea areas that were previously inhabited.

      2.2.2   Preliminary Definitions and Insights

           ICZM DEFINED
The Global Programme of Action (GPA), developed by the United Nations Environmental
Programme (UNEP), is an example of a traditional ICZM approach. It involves: (i) an initial
assessment of conditions; (ii) an assessment of risks and constraints involved in addressing
underlying problems; (iii) formulation of cost-effective interventions; (iv) implementation of
interventions; and (v) monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness (UNEP/GPA, 2006). Such
process-orientation is a key aspect of modern ICZM that encourages learning cycles. More
rigorous attempts at definition have resulted in characterizations such as the following, which is
used by the European Union (European Environment Agency CEC Communication 2000/547
ICZM)1:
        ICZM is a dynamic, multidisciplinary and iterative process to promote sustainable
        management of coastal zones. It covers the full cycle of information collection, planning (in its
        broadest sense), decision making, management and monitoring of implementation. ICZM uses
        the informed participation and cooperation of all stakeholders to assess the societal goals in a
        given coastal area, and to take actions towards meeting these objectives. ICZM seeks, over the
        long-term, to balance environmental, economic, social, cultural and recreational objectives, all
        within the limits set by natural dynamics. 'Integrated' in ICZM refers to the integration of
        objectives and also to the integration of the many instruments needed to meet these
        objectives. It means integration of all relevant policy areas, sectors, and levels of

          administration. It means integration of the terrestrial and marine components of the target
          territory, in both time and space.

Many Latin American governments have instituted sectoral approaches to environmental
development: individual laws and procedures for measuring and mitigating environmental
impacts in individual sectors (i.e. tourism, mining, agricultural, etc.). However, these laws lead to
an ad hoc approach and fail to capture the cumulative impacts of all associated activities. Many
have argued for a more integrated approach, which comprehensively monitors and set priorities
for a given ecosystem (Saturnino et al., 2008). In defining Integrated Coastal Management, Oz
and Arancibia (2014) are more specific in some of the goals but provide a definition that is similar
to that of the EU:
          ICM is a dynamic process by which decisions are taken for the use, development and
          protection of coastal areas and resources, to achieve goals established in cooperation with
          user groups and authorities. ICM recognizes the distinctive character of the coastal zone, is
          multiple-purpose-oriented, analyzes implications of development, conflicting uses, and
          interrelationships between physical processes and human activities, and promotes linkages
          and harmonization among sectoral, coastal and ocean activities. There are at least seven
          different kinds of integration: (a) intergovernmental, (b) land-water interface, (c) intersectoral,
          (d) interdisciplinary, (e) interinstitutional, (f) intertemporal, and (g) managerial.

Other regions have been more precise in their definitions. The state of Victoria in Australia
regards ICZM as one of the three parts that contribute to an overarching idea of “ecologically
sustainable development (ESD)”. Other blocks include Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) and
Adaptive Management (AM). Their specific understanding of ICZM is (Victorian Coastal Strategy
2008):2

          [a] framework that attempts to integrate planning and management in a region, such as the
          State of Victoria, across the land and sea interface and the private and public land interface, to
          treat the coastal zone (which includes the catchment) as one biophysical entity.

All of the above definitions share a number of elements in common. Specifically they involve:

           Elements of stocktaking and diagnostic exercises, often involving new and ongoing
            research;
           Explicit or implicit objective setting;
           Participation of multiple stakeholders;
           Priority setting – often with economic valuation –,regarded as necessary at the beginning
            and throughout the process;
           Sectoral integration, as opposed to traditional sector-oriented processes; and
           Learning and feedback that contribute to ongoing adaptation.

In addition, the more recent ICZM approaches have also focused on:

      Addressing the reduction of vulnerability under uncertainty: precisely because of scientific
       gaps that can not necessarily be filled within the required policy-making time horizons;
       and
      Incorporation of ideas of the global commons in the integration of global fishery issues,
       Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, and other issues that extend beyond a simple
       coastal stretch.

The Noordwijk ICZM Guidelines (1996) provide a codified manual for following an ICZM process.
They are based on the Rio Agenda 21 (Chapter 17) outcomes of 1992 and were first developed
by interested parties in a meeting in Noordwijk Netherlands in 1993. Subsequent refinements by
the World Bank over the period 1993-1996 provide a useful starting point for ICZM program
implementation. The guidelines include the following specific objectives:

       1. Strengthen Sectoral Management. This is conducted through a variety of means such
          as: (i) training and awareness building for decision-makers; (ii) reforms and activities
          in key coastal sectors; (iii) efforts to sectoral coordination and cooperation; and,
          (iv) identification of actionable policies (such as removal of distortionary economic
          policies that contribute to pollution).
       2. Protect Coastal Ecosystems. This objective is actionable and involves: (i) a “ridge to
          reef” approach, capable of addressing issues related to fisheries, coral reefs, beaches,
          dunes, seagrass beds, mudflats, riparian systems, coastal lagoons, and upper
          watersheds; and (ii) prevention of damage to such systems and, if needed, their
          restoration.
       3. Promotion of Rational Development. This involves programs aimed at: (i) risk
          reduction; (ii) mitigation for human and ecosystem health; and, (iii) design and
          implementation of appropriate regulatory and incentive mechanisms. A new
          emergent objective also includes: (iv) the development of “green cities”.

The guidelines also feature the following general principles:

          Adhere to Precautionary Principle: the principle that the introduction of a new
           product or process whose ultimate effects are disputed or unknown should be
           resisted;
          Adhere to Polluter Pay Principle: the principle that whoever is responsible for any
           form of pollution or environmental damage should be responsible for covering the full
           costs of such damage, or for avoiding the costs of such damage;
          Conduct Proper Resource Accounting: attach economic value to ecosystem goods and
           services, and potentially to natural assets;
          Acknowledge Transboundary Responsibility: cooperate where possible in areas of
           mutual interest; and
          Respect Intergenerational Equity: do not limit options of future generations.

           COASTAL ZONES IN THE BROADER LANDSCAPE
ICZM is compatible with numerous other methods and approaches to spatial planning in a
broader landscape. Ecosystem based management (EBM) and watershed management
approaches have been espoused as a way of respecting natural landscapes in planning, in
contrast to more traditional boundaries that typically relied on convenient political and sectorial
boundaries. Indeed, the greatest challenges for all such approaches is that the planning processes
(including budgeting, financing, and regulation) remain constrained by political boundaries
associated with nations, states, counties, parishes or similar political, sectorial or socially
determined borders. By explicitly recognizing these institutional constraints, however, ICZM
seeks to balance the socio-economic realities with the natural biophysical realities.

In that respect, ICZM is very compatible with a more recently elaborated “landscape approach”.
As described by the World Bank3:
     [a] “landscape approach” means taking both a geographical and socio-economic approach to
     managing the land, water and forest resources that form the foundation – the natural capital
     – for meeting our goals of food security and inclusive green growth.

     The World Bank Group is increasingly employing landscape approaches to implement
     strategies that integrate management of land, water, and living resources, and that promote
     sustainable use and conservation in an equitable manner. By taking into account the inter-
     actions between these core elements of natural capital and the ecosystem services they
     produce, rather than considering them in isolation from one another, we are better able to
     maximize productivity, improve livelihoods, and reduce negative environmental impacts. Put
     more simply: we can “use natural capital without using it up.”

That said, a coordinated multi-sectoral perspective is required: a “landscape approach” that
provides the organizing principle for investing in and managing land, water, and forest resources
based on rational spatial planning and socioeconomic considerations.4

In partnership with the World Bank, Mexico has also embarked on a program to improve forest
management within such a landscape approach. As the forests are both inland and coastal, such
initiatives can eventually provide an important basis for further developing more comprehensive
ICZM approaches.

Such an approach ensures activities in other sectors such as agriculture, transport, mining, or
hydropower are undertaken in ways that limit impacts on forest and other natural resources
integrity at the same time they maximize development benefits.

            INSIGHTS
In terms of drawing lessons from ICZM, in many cases it is “too early to tell”. ICZM is by its nature
an intergenerational undertaking. Many regard some of the early experiences in the United
States and Europe to be successful, but there too, more recent advances in coastal management
have seen, for example, the promotion of managed retreat or realignment of shorelines. This
process abandons decades, or even centuries, of efforts to use hard defenses as a management
mechanism. Even such backtracking, however, can be interpreted as a success; it shows that
decision-making adapts as new information is made available.

Notwithstanding the difficulty in drawing conclusions, some general lessons are evident and can
be summarized as follows:

      Most ICZM weaknesses relate to institutional breakdowns, delays or inadequate financing
      The process itself can become a burden and source of conflict: pick and choose a few
       elements. Most ICZM processes describe very complex systems that interact, but that
       does not imply that the responses need to be complex, although bureaucracies frequently
       seem to prefer a complex solution.
      Assess institutional factors carefully before deciding on single vs multiple institutions. The
       original Noordwijk Guidelines recommended that a single institution to address coastal
       issues is the best way forward. While some positive examples are available (Barbados),
       the single institution approach has not generally worked in larger contexts because it just
       adds one more layer of bureaucracy to what is often already a complicated institutional
       setting.
      Laws tend not to be adaptive: write them carefully.
      Economic valuation helps in priority-setting. The approaches to valuation have been
       found useful by policymakers the world over. Waite, Burke and Gray (2014) recently
       published a manual and case studies of relevance in the Caribbean context.
      Market based incentives work, but so do regulations. Before pursuing either, however,
       one should remove perverse incentives first. A perverse incentive is an economic signal
       intended to improve conditions in one sector, but that works against the objectives of
       sound coastal zone management.

Also, the following findings may be more controversial, but have also become part of the reality
of ICZM in some countries:

      Do not presume that historically slow changes will continue to be slow: systems flip. Coral
       bleaching is an example where massive bleaching events resulted in coral deaths in
       tourism hot-spots around the world.
      Encourage risk taking, experimentation, and innovation. This is part of adaptive
       management, but is a major barrier in many institutions worldwide. Incentive structures
       are generally designed to do exactly the opposite.
      Acknowledge that people may need to move, or that a historically possible activity is no
       longer viable. Various locations around the world, for example, have embarked on



                                                 – 12 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
        programs of managed re-alignment that permit the sea to reclaim areas that have
        previously been inhabited. In some regions (Black Sea and Varadero, Cuba), hotels built
        on dunes have been destroyed as part of these efforts.
       ICZM can still incorporate conservation, development, restoration, conversion, and hard
        engineering. There is an incorrect view that ICZM is entirely conservation–oriented, but
        more correctly, it should be regarded as process-oriented and capable of addressing both
        conservation and development needs and making necessary trade-offs along the way. A
        fundamental aspect of ICZM is that it is based on valid information, which all parties can
        scrutinize before making decisions. Such decisions still provide scope for hard engineering
        solutions.

The World Bank has also had recent experience in implementing ICZM initiatives. Assistance to
the has encompassed a US$285.67 million initiative with general objectives of building national
capacity for implementation of a comprehensive coastal management approach in the country,
and of piloting the integrated coastal zone management approach in states of Gujarat, Odisha
and West Bengal.5 The project was initiated in 2010 and the following practical lessons can be
drawn from that experience that are relevant to further initiatives in India as well as new
initiatives elsewhere in the world:

       Clear subsidiarity must be established: responsibility (for implementation) should reside
        at the most effective and appropriate level, for reasons of (i) political legitimacy,
        (ii) administrative efficiency, and (iii) substantive issues related to the nature of cross-
        sectoral sustainability problems. Conflicting interests in practical implementation can
        only be resolved if those stakeholders with an active interest in outcomes are also
        involved in implementation.
       There is no cookbook implementation arrangement that fits all problems. Traditionally,
        three types of arrangements have been used and each has advantages and disadvantages:
        (i) expanding the duties of an existing agency; (ii) concentrating authority in a new
        agency; and, (iii) creating an inter-ministerial council or inter-agency coordinating
        committee with a lead agency.
       Whichever implementation arrangement is followed, the arrangement will be most
        successful if: (i) skillsets include integration/program management as opposed to
        specialized technical skills; (ii) capacity must be put in place to respond quickly and to
        handle a wide array of management tasks (contracting, finance, accounting, monitoring
        and reporting, public communication, budgeting, transparent approval processes); and,
        (iii) a shared long-term vision is founded based on a scientifically sound common
        knowledge base.
       The majority of ICZM projects underestimate the financial resources needed because of
        the complex nature of coastal processes that result in implementation delays and the
        frequent need to expand the scope of activities as work progresses.

    2.3      ICZM in Mexico

    2.3.1    Current Policy Instruments

Few countries have the formal regulatory structures that permit comprehensive management of
large spaces and sensitive ecosystems in an integrated manner. In Mexico, command-and-control
regulations based on a sectorial approach exist, as do other piecework environmental
regulations, but there is no structure to tie together various jurisdictions and ministries and
coordinate their actions, let alone coordinate among different sectors for ICZM.

In the past, the Mexican Government has recognized the importance of promoting an integrated
policy for marine and coastal areas. However, the development and integration of such policy
has been subdued by other perspectives and sectoral priorities. To illustrate this point, the
Mexican Government created in June 2008 the Intersecretarial Commission for the Sustainable
Management of Seas and Coasts (CIMARES). The Commission adopted in 2012 the National Policy
for Mexican Seas and Coasts, with three overarching objectives: (i) improving the living
conditions of coastal populations; (ii) strengthening local economies and strengthening regional
competitiveness; and (iii) ensuring the structure and functioning of marine-coastal ecosystems
(CIMARES, 2012). The objectives of this policy were incorporated into Mexico’s National
Development Plan for 2013-2018. However, available information indicates that CIMARES has
met only once under the current Federal Administration (2012-2018).6

However, with regards to the regulatory framework, something approaching integrated coastal
zone management is undertaken in Mexico largely through three policy instruments:
(i) Environmental Impact Assessment; (ii) the creation of Marine Protected Zones; and
(iii) ecological zoning (Creel, 2005; Hernandez et al., 2012).
    2.3.2    Environmental Impact Assessment

Mexico requires all projects to submit an environmental impact assessment if they fall under the
categories mentioned in the EIA regulations. These EIAs are a tool for: (i) opening up projects to
public scrutiny; (ii) analyzing possible negative impacts; and (iii) mandating mitigations for those
impacts (Ortega-Rubio et al., 2001). In terms of coastal management and generally speaking, EIAs
can be either project-focused or regionally focused. When they are project-focused, they
narrowly target the impacts of a particular site: a new oil rig, for instance. When they are
regionally-focused, they look at potential impacts of an entire enterprise—a new oil field, for

instance—within the context of the other economic activities that are taking place within the
broader ecosystem (Hernandez et al., 2012). As for México, regional EIAs are an exception; the
majority of EIAs presented are project-- based. In a recent case study carried out for priority sites
in the Yucatán Peninsula, none of the EIAs available during the last 10 years was regional.

EIAs have been used as a method for assessing cumulative impacts of activities in coastal zones
(Kennedy, 1994). However, assessing such cumulative impacts is difficult because of the scale
and the number of considerations involved. Furthermore, it becomes necessary, when looking at
cumulative impacts, to begin taking into account social, economic and political forces (Matishov
et al., 1998).

Under traditional EIA, the impact of one activity upon another activity is a major consideration.
For instance, an EIA might measure the impact of oil production upon the local fisheries. But a
cumulative impact assessment measures the impact of all economic activities in the area
(Matishov et al., 1998).

There are two major approaches to cumulative impact assessment. The first is primarily scientific
and analytical. Under this approach, the purpose of the assessment is to make estimations and
predictions regarding current and future activities in the region and, under best scientific
practices, to develop a general understanding of what the expected impacts of these activities
might be and how policy-makers could mitigate them. The second approach, in contrast, views
the assessment primarily as a tool for revealing priorities within the region. Under this approach,
the assessment is used as a priority-setting tool to elicit public comment and participation by
stakeholders. Scientific knowledge production is still a component of the assessment, but the
knowledge is produced in concert with affected groups. Their concerns influence the production
of knowledge and the production of knowledge in turn influences their concerns (Kennedy,
1994).

In Mexico, there are significant capacity and regulatory gaps that hinder the implementation of
EIA in general, and in particular, for cumulative impacts. EIA practice in Mexico has a number of
limitations, including inadequate scoping, elaboration of environmental impact studies based on
incomplete data, insufficient participation from external experts in the preparation and
evaluation of the MIA, faulty public participation, absence of clear criteria to evaluate the MIA,
and weak enforcement and follow-up to ensure that the project developer complies with all the
requirements established by SEMARNAT during the EIA process (see Chapter 7 for a more
detailed discussion). In brief, Mexico’s EIA system in its current form is not well suited for coastal
zone management.
   2.3.3   Ecological Zoning Program

Mexico’s Ecological Zoning Program is more promising. Stakeholders can, through a consultative
process, agree upon a set of requirements for development in a given ecological area. All
subsequent projects are then, through the EIA regulation, required to adhere to these
requirements. Territorial Environmental Land Use Programs (Programas de Ordenamiento
Ecológico del Territorio or POETs) are regional development plans developed through



                                                 – 15 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
participatory processes in which local, state, and federal government stakeholders, as well as civil
society and academics, come together in a process designed to maximize consensus. These
instruments have been extensively used in Mexico, including throughout the Yucatán Peninsula,
but results have been mixed. A POET could be potentially complemented by an urban
development plan (PDU), which is developed in a similar manner, although synergies between
these two types of planning instruments are rarely built, largely because they fall under the
purview of different agencies. Like POETs, PDUs are sometimes hampered by a lack of technical
and institutional capacity within local and municipal governments for overseeing the complex
tasks involved in assessing environmental needs, setting priorities, and building consensus
among stakeholders (Hardoy et al., 2014; Creel, 2005). There is also a certain level of
unwieldiness to the creation of a POET. They are developed through a participatory process
managed by a consultant, which means that one stakeholder can throw up significant roadblocks.
Because of this, the resulting agreements tend not to be as strong as would be desired. In
addition, to have legal validity, POETs must be approved by a decree from the authority at the
competent level (e.g. federal, state, or municipal). To date, there have been no rigorous attempts
to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the preparation and enforcement of POETs, most
of which lack an appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework (INE, 2012). For the Yucatán
peninsula there are 3 regional and ten municipal POETs.7 However some large areas are yet to
be covered by a POET; specifically, Campeche’s coastal zone lacks a regional POET, and in
Quintana Roo, only the Sian Ka’an region is covered by a regional POET. Within the Yucatán
Peninsula, only Yucatán‘s coast is entirely covered by a regional program. In fact, most of
Mexico’s coastal zones lack a POET. These plans, however, are a valuable consensus-making tool
and provide one of the best ways of formalizing the agreements that need to be made if various
municipalities, states, and ministries are going to work together.
      2.3.4   Marine Protected Areas

Mexico has 177 Natural Protected Areas, out of which nearly 70 span over marine or coastal
ecosystems. There has been debate over how to use these marine protected areas (MPAs) as an
avenue for integrated coastal zone management. In general within Mexico, the designation of a
marine protected zone has also often included an influence zone, which has acknowledged
environmental and socioeconomic ties to a specific protected area. However, protected area
officials often have limited influence on development or management of the influence zone.

In general, there has been interest from policy-makers, protected area managers, and other
stakeholders to find some way to achieve better integration and co-management. Such
coordination would allow those in charge of planning zones to be cognizant of their effect on
nearby protected ecosystems and to create policies with those ecosystems in mind. ICZM
advocates want to use the scale and the popularity of MPAs—there is far more area under
protected status than under anything approaching integrated management —to create larger
ICZM initiatives. MPA advocates want to build upon the protected area concept by creating
linkages between different MPAs and creating an understanding that the entire Gulf of Mexico is
one large ecosystem (Cicin-Sain and Belfiore, 2005). Indeed, ecological processes within the

marine environment of the gulf cannot be separated from those that occur along the coast and
within the river systems. Everything is connected, but no overall plan for managing the health of
the gulf currently exists. A challenge is to integrate coastal zone management with Large Marine
Ecosystems (LME) management, and to develop plans that take into account the health of the
entire gulf (Yanez-Arancibia et al., 2013).

   2.4     Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Mitigation

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognizes a wide host
of potential policy responses to the threats and consequences of climate changes. Mitigation
measures are intended to reduce the pace or degree of climate change: typical policy measures
are associated with mechanisms that reduce GHG emissions or offset such emissions through
activities that absorb or lock up carbon dioxide or other GHGs. Afforestation, reforestation,
composting, CO2, or methane storage are all examples of activities that represent mitigation
efforts. Some of these activities also have joint benefits: the United Nations Reducing Emissions
from Deforestation and Forest Degradation programme (UN-REDD+), for example, is also
intended to meet certain social goals and to improve biodiversity. Mitigation programs in coastal
communities worldwide have taken advantage of economic incentives to plant mangroves,
institute composting, and promote conservation of sea grass beds.

By contrast, adaptation measures include activities that may be necessary to cope with the
impacts of current or future climate change. Climate change adaptation (CCA) can be targeted to
fire risks, droughts, flooding, pests, extreme weather events, increased acidity or temperatures
in marine systems, changes in the food supply chain, or preparedness for a host of uncertain
impacts. In coastal regions, sea level rise may also be a concern. An important context for CCA is
that these impacts have been occurring since time immemorial: floods, droughts, collapses of
food stocks, and other hazards are all a part of human history. To a significant degree, formal and
informal mechanisms have been in place for some time to adapt to our changing environment.
What is perhaps unprecedented is that the timeframes for adaptation may be more immediate
than heretofore experienced, and that the scale may also not be one to which many of these
mechanisms are accustomed. Migration away from a dangerous coast has always, for example,
been the only option for some cultures. However, modern cities, industries, and populations are
more likely to harden coastal defenses than to move away from the coast. While migration
remains an available coping strategy, most CCA efforts over the next century will be dedicated to
a host of other activities that are integrated into public and private investment decisions, and
into how human populations interact with the broader systems that make up the coastal
environment.

Mexico has been proactive in addressing climate change. The country’s mitigation strategy is one
of the strongest and most developed among middle- and low-income countries. In terms of
adaptation, the country is still in the planning stages: addressing capacity and designing
interventions. Under the climate change law, Mexico intends to alter patterns of development
with a view to limiting vulnerability. The law would also conserve ecosystems to retain natural
barriers to cyclones and other climate events. However, these intentions have not yet been acted
upon (Hardoy et al., 2014). In Quintana Roo, for instance, authorities are taking proactive steps,


                                                – 17 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
through a cross-cutting Office of Climate Change, to enact policies for altering land use in coastal
areas and for mitigating disaster risk. In many cases, the practices undertaken as part of climate
change initiatives—particularly the changes in land use—are similar to those that would be
undertaken through integrated coastal zone management. However, efforts are hampered by
the difficulty of managing participatory processes, by the distribution of responsibilities among
many different agencies, by the lack of specific funding allocated to climate change adaptation
(Hardoy et al., 2014). A first step has been done to overcome those hurdles by the creation of
the regional climate change commission for the Yucatán Peninsula, a joint committee created by
the three states that seeks to coordinate efforts on climate change mitigation and adaptation.
The commission still faces several challenges, including lack of a solid jurisdictional mandate and
institutionalization, absence of funding for the institution itself, and limited availability of funds
for specific interventions.

It is acknowledged that, for Yucatán Peninsula states, adaptation issues are more pressing than
mitigation issues. The Yucatán Peninsula’s population of more than four million will have limited
influence over national GHG emissions, although they may benefit from economic incentives
associated with UNFCCC and related programs. The greater focus on adaptation is a natural
consequence of the perceived increase in climate-related threats: hurricanes, beach erosion,
mangrove loss, coral bleaching, fishery collapses, and fires can all be conveniently classified to
some degree as “climate change impacts”. With the exception of hurricane intensity, frequency,
and timing of incidence, however, all of these impacts may also be related to other influences
over which local authorities have some control. Beach erosion may be related to settlement
patterns and improper construction on dunes. Loss of mangroves may be related to settlement
patterns and incentives that promote conversion. Coral bleaching may be aggravated by
eutrophication and land-based pollution. Fishery collapses may be associated with inappropriate
use of gear or unsustainable levels of effort rather than changes in environmental conditions.
Most fires in the world are man-made. In short, while this implies that many “climate impacts”
may have nothing to do with climate, it does show that there is significant scope for intervention
to “adapt” because some of these impacts may be caused by local actions. Concretely, this
implies that CCA and its associated activities must be woven into multiple aspects of ongoing
decisions across a broad range of areas. In the coastal zone, almost any approach to CCA can
build synergies with ICZM.

CCA and ICZM efforts and institutional structures are highly complementary. A successful climate
change strategy, particularly in a coastal area, strongly resembles integrated coastal zone
management, in that it: (i) requires coordination among all sectors and departments in an area;
(ii) addresses the need to maximize resilience by guiding development in sustainable directions;
and (iii) involves planning for long term (50-100 years in the future) outcomes (Hardoy et al.,
2014). In addition, they can also be linked to relevant biodiversity and conservation activities in
the Yucatán Peninsula.

   2.5     Summary

This chapter has described the institutional framework for coastal management in the Yucatán
Peninsula; within this context it also provides a general overview of ICZM and how parts of it are

currently addressed in Mexico. A key conclusion of the chapter is that ICZM is a potentially
demanding process that requires adequate information and strong institutions. It calls for
focusing of efforts to targeted issues, and improving the information base on which decisions are
made. Subsequent chapters in this report relate to geomorphology, selected social and economic
dimensions of relevance in the Yucatán Peninsula, and potential reforms and enhancements to
the EIA process: these all act as a bridge to some of the more detailed policy options and
approaches that inform the final conclusions in Chapter 8.

   3. Coastal Geomorphology and Climate Change Adaptation

   3.1     Brief description of overall geomorphology

The Yucatán Peninsula forms part of the larger Yucatán Platform, composed of carbonate
sediments dating from the Cretaceous. It has depths of 3 to 4 km and extends over the 200 km
wide Campeche Shelf to the west and north, and a narrower shelf on the east. The shelf is
bounded in the west by the Yucatán Escarpment and to the east by the Yucatán Channel, which
marks the boundary between the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea (Kjerfe, 1994).

The entire coastal zone of the Peninsula is one of outstanding natural resources and beauty,
which has enabled its tourism industry to become a significant sector of Mexico’s economy. Most
of the tourist industry is focused on the coastal zone and its coastal reefs, shoreline beaches, and
ecologically important lagoons. The Biosphere Reserves of Sian Ka’an in Quintana Roo, Ria
Celestun in Yucatán, and Laguna de Terminos in Campeche reflect the national and international
importance of the coastal ecology of the Yucatán Peninsula. They also provide a range of habitats
that is dependent upon its physical characteristics – a karstic platform with few rivers, low tidal
range, and a series of barrier islands. These natural resources are, however, facing increasing
threats from external changes such as increases in sea level and hurricane frequency, and also
from the presence of coastal infrastructure and its associated extensive and uncoordinated
coastal defences.

The coastlines of the Yucatán Peninsula can be conveniently divided into three distinct
geomorphic regions, coinciding with the administrative boundaries of the three states of
Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucatán.

   3.2     Quintana Roo

The coastal zone of Quintana Roo lies within the zone of the Caribbean Sea and is developed on
a low relief, karstic platform. It has a surface veneer of lithified Pleistocene aeolian sands,
extending seawards as a narrow shelf between 400 m and 1000 m wide, with a narrow
intermittent fringing coral reef extending along the coast. The northeast coast is characterized
by a series of islands (Mujeres, Blanca, Contoy) and barrier beaches enclosing lagoons (Nichupte,
Chakmochuk, Holbox) with fringing coral reefs. Landward from Islas Mujeres and Contoy, the
seabed is characterized by extensive sand waves, between 5 and 6 meters thick, and composed
of ooides and bioclastic debris carried northwards and focused into this area by the Yucatán
Current (Harms et al. 1978). The coastal sediments lie on a platform of lithified aeolian sands
forming headlands such as Punta Nizuc and Punta Cancun, between which barrier beaches and
tombolas have developed. South of Punta Nizuc, a narrow beach ridge forms a series of pocket
beaches between successive aeolianite headlands; the barrier beach and lithified beach ridges
enclose a tidal mangrove wetland (Loucks & Ward 2001). In the southern part of the region, the
coastal fringe of coral reefs and barrier islands protects extensive coastal wetlands and lagoons
(Ascencion, Chetumal), with mangrove forest fed by fresh water from the largely subterranean
karstic river system. Sediment sources for the entire region appear to be confined to coral debris
from the fringing reefs; however, erosion of the underlying aeolian deposits may contribute a


                                                – 20 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
minor fraction of the total input. South of Isla Blanca, the coast is typified by erosion of the beach
sediments and to a lesser extent the underlying carbonate aeolianites. Tidal range is between
0.2 and 0.6 meters and winds are predominantly from the north east. This means that net
sediment transport in the northern section of this coast is northwards, but to the south of Punta
Nizuc, this reverses to give a net southward drift. The implications of this sediment divide on the
overall coastal behavior and its impact on human development of this coast are discussed below.

   3.3     Campeche

The coast of Campeche State forms the western coast of the Yucatán Peninsula and faces a broad
submarine shelf extending to the Campeche Bank Reefs, a series of emergent platform reefs and
submerged bank reefs. Average rainfall falls to less than 400 mm in the north of Campeche State.
This, together with the karstic topography, means that, apart from the Rio Champoton, there are
few surface rivers and fresh water discharges into the coastal zone in a series of springs.

The northwestern coast lies in the wave shadow of the dominant northeasterly waves that
characterize the northern coast of the peninsula. As a result of this low energy regime, the near
shore to the north of Campeche City is composed of deposits of fine-grained, cohesive carbonate
sediment, perhaps derived from the coral reefs that lie on the Campeche Shelf, and which masks
the underlying limestone rock. The seaward margin of the coast supports mangrove vegetation
backed by a wide saline plain, largely unvegetated, and which merges landward into a second
mangrove belt. This section of the coast is undeveloped and is of high ecological value.

In the center, between Campeche City and Champoton, the limestone has been tectonically
uplifted to form a cliff coastline, merging into a series of beach ridges formed from Pleistocene
carbonate sands and gravels lithified into beach rock. South of Champoton lies a wide
depositional plain, probably of mid-Holocene age and with up to 40 ridges, reported by some
authors (e.g. Psuty, 1965; Thom, 1967) to be composed of mobile shell fragments, whose
landward boundary is a fossil shore cut into the Pleistocene conglomerates. South of this zone,
the coastal barrier island of Isla del Carmen encloses the Laguna de Terminos. The Real Inlet to
the east and the Carmen inlet to the west are both dredged channels; although tidal range is
small (0.5 m), substantial tidal deltas have formed at both entrances to the lagoon, with a flood
tide delta on the Real Inlet and an ebb tide delta at the Carmen Inlet (David & Kjerfve 1998). The
seaward shoreline of the island is experiencing rapid erosion, in particular during hurricanes,
when sediment wash-over is a major problem to settlement and roads.

   3.4     Yucatán

The northern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula lies within the Gulf of Mexico oceanographic
province. The coast fronts a wide (200 km) submarine shelf with a slope of 1:1000 extending
north to the Campeche and Alacran Reefs. Tides are mixed, with a diurnal dominance and a tidal
range of between 0.1 and 0.8 meters. Waves are dominantly from the northeast, but veering to
southeast, towards the Quintana Roo coast (Appendini et al. 2012, Ward & Brady 1973). The
coastal zone is a flat, highly permeable, karstic plain with no surface rivers, but with a series of
coastal lagoons landward of a 200 km long line of barrier islands formed of multiple beach ridges


                                                 – 21 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
developed during the Holocene. These lagoons are tidal, but receive fresh water from
groundwater springs or direct run-off from bordering mangroves during the rainy season (June
to October). The western coast has been extensively urbanized for tourism and summer home
residents (Meyer-Arendt 1991). These coastal properties are exceptionally vulnerable to wave
damage, flooding, and sand inundation. Despite the high rainfall (1,500 mm/year), water supply
and sewage disposal is a major problem in this permeable, karstic area.

The barrier beaches extending along the coast are formed of carbonate sands, probably derived
from the extensive sand wave deposits that accumulate in the lee of Islas Mujeres and Contoy,
and which are transported westward towards Holbox and the Yucatán coast by wave-driven
currents. Longshore transport along the northern coast is dominantly east to west, with rates
estimated at between 20,000 m3 a-1 and 70,000 m3 a-1 (Appendini et al. 2012). This relatively low
rate reflects the low wave energy propagated across the wide shelf.

The accretionary nature of the coast is clearly shown by the successive beach ridges; yet, despite
this indication of a Holocene history of deposition, the coast is now characterized by erosion at
rates averaging between 1 and 2 meters per year.

   3.5     Summary of coastal issues important for the economy

   3.5.1   Sea level rise

Sea level rise, both existing and predicted, is likely to be the major factor affecting Yucatán coastal
behavior over the next few decades. Landward migration of the barrier beaches due to existing
sea level rise, exacerbated by accelerated eustatic sea level rise and local seasonal fluctuations,
both due to global warming, will affect all shoreline properties. Sand inundation of backshore
properties will also occur as barriers roll over. Shore defenses to combat the erosion, already
deployed by local residents, will lead to increased erosion down-drift (Appendini et al 2012).

A preliminary examination of the tide gauge records from Progreso and Ciudad de Carmen,
undertaken for this study, suggests a relative sea level rise over the past few decades of between
3 and 5 mm per year. This existing rise in sea level may be in addition to that predicted to occur
as a result of global warming. Current IPCC predictions (Church et al. 2013) under a low emission
scenario (i.e. RCP 2.6) are for a total rise in sea level of 0.26 m by 2100 and 0.95 m for a worst-
case scenario (i.e. RCP 8.5). However, many authorities consider that this underestimates the
threat and suggest that eustatic sea level will rise by between 0.5 and 2.0 m (Nicholls et al. 2010).
This, together with the existing rate of 3 to 5 mm per year on the Yucatán coast, would mean a
total sea level rise of between 0.77 m and 2.45 m by the end of the century. In addition, the
predicted rise in ocean temperatures due to global warming may increase the existing seasonal
fluctuation in water levels along this coast, currently shown by the Progreso tide gauge record to
be around 300 mm. Hurricane frequency and intensity, already increasing, may accelerate
further. Such increases in sea level and storm events would force the barrier beaches landwards
onto the mainland and lead to the loss of the lagoons and other coastal habitats – reducing their
potential for human usage (Blum et al. 2002).




                                                  – 22 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
   3.5.2   Increased hurricane frequency

The increase in hurricane frequency and intensity associated with global warming may accelerate
the problems caused by sea level rise (Webster et al. 2005). As hurricane frequency increases,
recovery from hurricane damage, both to the shoreline and to the fringing reef systems, will be
incomplete between successive events, leading to progressive deterioration of the systems.

It can be argued that the general morphology of the Yucatán coast is presently adjusted to
medium frequency, medium magnitude storms such as the winter northerly storms (nortes),
rather than the low frequency, high magnitude hurricanes. Hurricane damage to coral reefs,
beaches and dunes, such as that produced by Gilbert in 1988 and by Wilma in 2005, can be
severe, but these natural coastal systems recover from such impacts and resume their former
function and form before the next hurricane event, which occur once every decade, on average.
In addition, hurricanes can produce some benefits to the natural coastal system such as the
production of coral debris that acts as an essential sediment input to coastal sediment cells and
which therefore accelerates the recovery process (Conner et al. 1989). The predicted increase in
hurricane frequency and intensity equates to an increase in net hurricane power, and thus, in
their destructive potential so that coastal systems, both natural and human, will be forced to
adjust to this new environment control (Emmanuel 2005).
   3.5.3   Shoreline Erosion

Coastal erosion is now seen as a major issue for the social and economic development of all three
coastal states on the Yucatán Peninsula. Rates of erosion vary according to the area under review.
For example, Meyer Arendt (1991) reports rates of 0.6 m per year at Progreso, while Gonzalez-
Leija (2013) reported 15 m per year at Cancun. In contrast, Diez (2009), working on the Cancun
shore, reports a 34 m retreat in the period 1984-2004, a rate of 1.7 m per year. Gutierrez-Estrada
(1988) calculated an average erosion rate 1.8 m per year for the north Yucatán coast over a
110 year period. It is important to recognize that most of the erosion records provided in the
literature are for periods commencing at least 50 and in some case 100 years ago, indicating that
shore erosion on the Yucatán is not a recent phenomenon.

The explanations often advanced for this widespread erosion are: (i) sea level rise due to global
warming; and (ii) human interference in the coastal system. Neither of them provides an
adequate reason for the observed erosion rates. Although future sea level rise may result in
substantial coastal recession, sea level rise over the past 50 years, as shown by the Progreso tide
gauge, has totaled 250 mm and is unlikely to account for the widespread loss of beach sands and
associated coastal recession. It is possible that an increase in water depth of 250 mm could drown
out sand waves on the seabed, lifting the wave base so as to prevent sand transport to the shore,
but such a process again is unlikely to account for widespread erosion rates of 1-2 m per year.
Human interference in the form of hard structures built to combat erosion necessarily post-dates
the erosion process and therefore cannot be responsible for its initiation, although it may
exacerbate rather than reduce erosion rates. Indeed, reported erosion rates commencing at least
100 years ago support the conclusion that the process began before extensive human
development of this coast.

Coastal erosion is a response to reduction in sediment supply to the coastal system, so that
potential sediment transport rates by wave-driven currents can only be met by erosion of existing
sediments within the system. Sediment sources for the Yucatán coastal system are primarily the
modern coral reefs, although some inputs may derive from erosion of fossil carbonate sands.
Degradation of the coral reef systems, partly due to global warming (e.g. bleaching, increased
frequency of hurricane damage) and partly due to anthropogenic impacts (e.g. pollution) will
result in a reduction of carbonate sediment available for beach replenishment.
   3.5.4   Urbanisation of the shoreline

Although Mayan culture avoided coastal locations, most probably in response to the volatile
nature of the region, the necessity for port locations in the 19th century, and the more recent
development of domestic shoreline homes in Yucatán and commercial tourism in Quintana Roo,
have led to urbanization of the coast and exposure of this infrastructure to extreme events.

Meyer-Arendt (1991) has referred to the ‘recreational frontier’ of small domestic houses on the
Yucatán coast centered on Progreso and expanding eastwards, engulfing small fishing villages. In
Quintana Roo, Torres & Momsen (2005) have described the development by the Mexican
Government of an ‘isolated tropical forest enclave’ at Cancun to initiate the highly successful
economic development strategy of ‘Planned Tourism Development (PTD)’ that has now
enveloped the shoreline of the Nichupte lagoon with hotel complexes (Bezaury et al. 1998). In
contrast, the coast of Campeche remains largely undeveloped, although there is increasing
pressure for both domestic and commercial recreational use, particularly in the southern coastal
zone (Rivera-Arriaga & Villalobos-Zapata 2005).

The perceived necessity of a shoreline location for such development, both domestic and
commercial, has largely ignored the inherent dangers of the coast, threats that include floods
and direct hurricane damage, as well as shoreline erosion. In many cases, if not most, the
development has extended to the upper shoreline, ignoring the 20 m federal maritime zone, so
that former mobile beach ridges and sand dunes have been engulfed.

The results of this development have been two-fold. First, natural coastal hazards have impacted
socio-economic development, which includes the construction of largely uncoordinated coastal
defense systems and, more significantly, domestic investment. Meyer-Arendt (1991), for
example, concluded that investment in international tourism development slowed down after
the 1988 hurricane. Impacts of hurricanes in the past coupled with predictions of increased storm
frequency and rising sea levels in the future have also prompted more short-term investment
with negative impacts on both the urban and natural environment.

Second, the impact of shoreline urbanization on the natural environment has been to decrease
the resilience of the shore to natural hazards and to increase the threats from both erosion and
flooding. The envelopment of mobile dunes and barrier beaches by urban infrastructure and hard
coastal defenses prevents their adjustment to environment changes. Erosion of a shoreline is, in
almost all cases, a negative feed-back response to decreased sediment supply so that the
coastline changes its orientation with respect to dominant waves, and a lower transport rate is



                                               – 24 –          Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
produced, thus reducing and eventually eliminating erosion. Urbanized coasts are unable to
respond in this way so that potential sediment transport rates remain high and erosion of the
seabed proceeds until shoreline defenses are undermined and collapse.

Low elevation coasts, such as those of the Yucatán Peninsula, have natural flood defenses in the
form of barrier beaches, which migrate landward as sea level rises so maintaining their standard
of protection. The virtual petrification of these former mobile barriers by urbanization means
that no such migration can take place so that barriers will be overtopped by rising sea levels
rather than move landwards and upwards.
   3.5.5   Current activities for erosion management

The response of most coastal managers to erosion is to provide shore defenses, which, as shown
above, can reduce the resilience of the coast to natural hazards and in some cases can actually
increase erosion rates. The north Yucatán coast provides many examples of such management
problems, where construction of “espigones” (groins) in the 20th century resulted in accelerated
erosion down-drift. There are three major types of response to erosion currently used in Yucatán:
hard defenses, beach nourishment, and artificial reefs.

Hard defenses (groins, seawalls)

The most common response to coastal erosion on the Yucatán Peninsula, as elsewhere in the
world, is to construct hard defenses in the form of groins and seawalls.

Meyer-Arendt (1991) describes the response to erosion on the north Yucatán coast as driven by
individual hurricane events, coupled with coastal construction works. The 1944 hurricane, for
example, exacerbated erosion already in progress along the Progreso shore, following the
development of the harbor there. This led to a government initiative in 1964 to build a series of
rock and timber groins (espigones); the impact of these espigones, coupled with further harbor
development, including dredging of the harbor navigation channel, resulted in increased down-
drift erosion. The response was a widespread and unauthorized construction of espigones by
beachfront property owners, without permits, and encroaching on the 20 m federal maritime
zone. Over 150 espigones were initially constructed in this way, but by 1980 it became obvious
that these actually accelerated down-drift erosion and subsequently their construction was
formally banned. Hurricane Juan in 1985 prompted a new phase of defense construction by local
property owners, this time in the form of seawalls, usually of the ‘staircase’ design, and by 1987
almost 20 percent of frontage properties were so ‘protected’. Hurricane Gilbert (1988) caused
extensive damage to these new constructions by undermining their foundations; most properties
fronting the sea were destroyed and sediment over-wash inundated those located further
landward. Few of these properties were insured.

In Cancun, a similar set of responses to hurricane events has taken place but here properties,
mostly owned by national and international corporations, are insured. Thus, following Hurricane
Gilbert in 1988, extensive repair of damaged frontage hotels and business properties took place.
Defenses, mainly in the form of sea walls, but including rip-rap barriers, were constructed, but



                                               – 25 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
loss of beach material continued. This prompted a beach nourishment program as detailed
below.

Beach nourishment

Beach nourishment appears to be the presently favored approach to coastal defense. Programs
recently implemented or currently in progress include the 3 million cubic meter recharge at
Cancun (Diez et al. 2009), recirculation of dredged sediment from navigation channels along the
north Yucatán coast (Arellano 2014 pers. comm.) and a proposed recharge of beaches protected
by artificial reef for a new hotel complex at San Miguelito, Quintana Roo (Amytis Pers. comm.
2014).

The critical factor in each of these recharge schemes is the extraction area for the recharge sand.
In such schemes, sediment should normally be extracted from the down-drift side of the recharge
site so that sand is carried back to the extraction site and a circulatory system is set up. However,
in some cases, such as those involving harbor or navigation dredging, dredged sediment should
be side-cast in the direction of drift rather than against it so that recharge acts as a sediment by-
pass process. Sediment recharge therefore requires careful consideration of the sediment
transport pathways prior to sediment extraction; in many cases no such analysis is provided,
leading to progressive deterioration of the coastal system. A brief discussion of the three areas
of recharge on the Yucatán Peninsula listed above will amplify this point.

   (a) In the case of the north Yucatán recharge program, although direct extraction is from
       beach deposits, some of these deposits are temporary stores for dredged-arisings from
       navigation channels. This means that the process of recharge is in effect harbor by-
       passing. Sediment transport of this coast is east to west so that dredged arising should be
       moved in that direction.
   (b) The scheme for recharge at San Miguelito, between Puerto Morelos and Playa del Carmen
       on the Quintana Roo coast, proposes extraction from a sand bank inshore of a local coral
       reef immediately north of the recharge site. This would short-circuit the net sediment
       transport pathway on this coast, which is from north to south, leading to accelerated
       erosion north of the recharge site and obviating any benefit to the site itself.
   (c) The Cancun recharge scheme is in a complex sediment transport area lying across a
       sediment divide. Extraction was from the Mujeres Bay sand banks, an area of extensive
       sand waves described above. Approximately 3 x 106 m3 of sand was extracted from this
       source and placed on the shore between Punta Cancun and Punta Nizuc, as reported by
       Diez et al. (2009), who note that relatively little information is available on the subsequent
       behavior of the coast after recharge. Discussion of the probable sediment transport
       pathways for this area was given above, where it was noted that a major sediment
       divergence occurs along this section of the coast. Thus movement of the recharge
       sediment is likely to move either north or south, depending on the position of the
       recharge in relation to the divergence zone. If the recharge lies on the southern side of
       the divergence, then sediment transport would be south towards the eroding beaches
       between Puerto Morelos and Tulum. If, on the other hand, the recharge is to the north of


                                                 – 26 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
         the divergence, then sediment transport will be northwards to the already sediment-rich
         beaches of north Quintana Roo.
Artificial reefs

There is a growing interest in the deployment of artificial reefs designed for coastal defense
around the world and a few such schemes have been advocated for the Yucatán Peninsula,
although there are no published accounts of these. One such scheme is that on the mid-Quintana
Roo coast at San Miguelito, where an artificial concrete reef is proposed to protect an artificially
recharged beach. The artificial reef would be located between the natural fringing coral reef and
the shore. The scheme is intended to reduce wave energy at the beach to reduce erosion rates,
which presently average 1 m per year. However, one effect of the artificial reef may be the
disruption of sediment inputs (i.e. coral debris), from natural reef to shore. As noted above, coral
debris constitutes one of the main sediment inputs to this sediment cell and any reduction in this
input will be critical. A decrease in sediment supply to the near-shore here would result in
accelerated sediment transport along the near-shore, perhaps accelerating beach erosion.

   3.6      Major coastal processes that define the Peninsula

The geomorphology of the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula has not received detailed attention in
the scientific literature. Several papers and books deal with the geology of the area (e.g. Ward
et al. 1985; Perry et al. 2003) and there is a substantial literature on the ecology of the coast (see
for example Bezaury et al. 1998), but few authors have focused on the dynamics of sediment and
coastal morphology. Notable exceptions are the work of Appendini et al. (2012) and Diez et al.
(2008, 2009). Appendini et al. (2012) provide a detailed analysis of sediment transport along the
coast of northern Yucatán, while Diez et al. focus on the Quintana Roo coast between Cancun
and Tumul. There are nevertheless no published accounts of the large scale geomorphology of
the peninsula. One problem facing any such investigation is the lack of primary data on coastal
energy and materials. There are no wave data for the area and only two tide gauges: Progreso
and Carmen. Studies of beach sediment are restricted to granulometry and chemistry (e.g.
Phleger 1971) and there have been no attempts to identify beach sand sources or sinks.

As a result both of this lack of data and the paucity of published accounts, any summary given
here must be in the form of a first approximation designed to encourage further research, rather
than provide a secure foundation.

   3.7      Sediment cells on the Yucatán Peninsula

One of the major tasks of a coastal management process is to identify sediment cells along the
coast. The sediment cell is a stretch of coast between boundaries, which partly or wholly contain
sediment movement. Any development within the sediment cell will therefore have a minimal
impact on areas outside its boundaries. Thus the sediment cell provides a self-contained area for
coastal planning. Within a sediment cell, the impacts of development will be contained and can
often be mitigated, secure in the knowledge that neighboring regions will be unaffected.




                                                 – 27 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
The identification of sediment cells is an iterative process, whereby an initial approximate
definition is subsequently refined as additional data is acquired. It is also important to ensure
that the major cells are identified into which minor sub-cells are nested. Thus, for example,
Vanegas et al. (2014) identified 16 sub-cells on the Campeche coast south of Ciudad de
Campeche, all of which may be subsumed within single primary cells.

A preliminary attempt at identification of the primary sediment cells on the Yucatán Peninsula
has been undertaken as part of this analytical work. Five primary cells have been defined
(Figure 3.1). A short review of the process involved in identification of each cell is given below.
Figure 3.1. Preliminary definition of sediment cells for the Yucatán Peninsula




Note: Red arrows indicate tentative sediment pathways and direction; blue dashed arrow indicates the
Yucatán current.

    3.7.1   Cell 1: Southern Campeche

This sediment cell occupies the eastern section of the Gulf of Campeche, with the western half
extending across Tabasco and into Veracruz. The southern shore of the cell between Ciudad del
Carmen and Chenkan is a wide sedimentary plain composed of a series of beach ridges, while the
northern shores between Ciudad del Carmen and Champoton are devoid of superficial sediment.
There are no coral reefs apart from the distant Campeche and Alacran reefs. The cell therefore
presents a problem in that there appears to be no sediment source for the large volume of
sediment contained in the beach ridges of the southern shore.


                                                  – 28 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
Several authors (e.g. Psuty 1965; Castillo et al. 1991) have commented that the ridges are
composed of shell fragments rather than the quartz sand that forms a similar ridge within
Tabasco State, but no direct sedimentological evidence for this was provided and it may be that
only the modern beach is formed from shells. However, if the beach is formed from molluscan
shell fragments, then the source must be from the nearshore seabed and it is probable that the
series of beach ridges was formed during extreme events such as ‘nortes’ and hurricanes , which
winnow the low-density shell material from the nearshore seabed and transport onto the upper
shore. If this hypothesis is accepted, then the erosion of the shoreline between Champoton and
Ciudad del Carmen may be due to a decrease in productivity of mollusks here, perhaps due to
overfishing or to pollution. Nevertheless there are several examples where it is clear that direct
human intervention has resulted in local erosion. One example of this is the erosion of the
foreshore of Carmen Island, where the recent dredging of Real Inlet into Laguna de Terminos
resulted in the diversion of shell sands into the lagoon forming extensive islands there, while the
loss of sediment on the down-drift side of the inlet has caused erosion of the Isla de Carmen
shore.
   3.7.2   Cell 2: Northern Campeche

The Campeche coast between Ciudad de Campeche and Celestun lies in the wave shadow of the
dominant north easterly waves that characterize the northern coast of the peninsula. As a result,
this area is characterized by a low energy regime so that the nearshore is composed of deposits
of fine-grained carbonate muds, derived partly from the coral reefs that lie on the Campeche
Shelf, and partly from in situ vegetation. The seaward margin of the coast supports mangrove
vegetation backed by a wide saline plain, largely unvegetated, and which merges landward into
a second mangrove belt. This section of the coast is undeveloped and is of high ecological value.

Since this cell is characterized by fine grained sediment, it cannot be treated in the same way as
those cells formed in sand-sized material. This is because fine grained sediments are transported
in suspension over long distances by ocean currents so that boundaries to sediment pathways
are not relevant.
   3.7.3   Cell 3: Yucatán to north Quintana Roo

Preliminary observations of satellite imagery suggest that a continuous sediment pathway,
identified on satellite imagery by major sand waves, exists between Isla Contoy in Quintana Roo
and Celestun in Yucatán. This is supported by the work of Appendini et al. (2012) who provide
modeled predictions of potential transport pathways and rates on this shore. Although Appendini
et al. (2012) do not speculate on the source of sediment, it is likely to be the extensive sand wave
field extending from Isla Mujeres to Isla Contoy in Quintana Roo and described by Harms et al.
(1978) and shown in recent (2012) satellite imagery. Appendini et al. (2012) predict that the net
western potential sediment transport rates on this coast are in the region of 20,000 to 70,000 m3
per year.

The northern coast of Yucatán is characterized by an almost continuous barrier beach backed by
a sequence of beach ridges and sand dunes, as well as numerous lagoons, which appear to



                                                – 29 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
represent sediment stores for any excess sands transported alongshore and thus balancing the
sediment budget. These sediment stores culminate in the barrier beach and lagoon at Celestun:
an area which satellite imagery shows as accreting between 2004 and 2013, perhaps indicating
an overall positive sediment budget for this primary cell.

The sand wave field in northern Quintana Roo extends over an area of approximately 40 km2,
which, assuming an average thickness of 5 m, represents a total sand store of over 200 x 106 m3:
sufficient to supply two millennia of longshore transport along the Yucatán coast. This, together
with the satellite imagery showing sand waves along the entire coastal zone of Yucatán and the
accretion at Celestun, suggests that there is no sediment deficit on this coast.

If this is a correct assumption then the erosion rates observed along this coast cannot be
explained by changes in environmental conditions and it may be therefore that the observed
erosion is due to human interference in the sediment transport pathways. The construction of
the pier at Progreso, together with the dredging of the harbor channel, resulted in rapid down-
drift erosion and has been often quoted as an example of the negative impacts of coastal
construction (e.g. Meyer-Arendt 1991). Numerous other examples of a similar cause-effect
process can be seen to the east of Progreso (e.g. at Chicxulub and Telchac).

However, an alternative hypothesis may be proposed for this cell, based on observations of the
sequence of beach ridges that occur along the north Yucatán coast. The sequence at Ria Legartos,
for example, shows approximately 50 beach ridges whose orientation with respect to the modern
shoreline swings clockwise as they become younger. The most modern ridges are truncated at
their eastern extremities by erosion of the present day shore. The orientation of a shoreline with
respect to dominant wave direction is an indication of the strength of the longshore current and
a clockwise swing on this coast indicates a decrease in the current velocities over time. The
implication is that sediment transport along this coast has gradually declined over the Holocene
and that, more recently, this decline has resulted in a negative sediment budget in which
potential sediment transport is not met by supply, resulting in erosion of the foreshore.

These alternative hypotheses are clearly incompatible, the one suggesting a positive sediment
budget and only human induced local erosion, the other proposing a long term decline in
sediment supply terminating in a negative budget today. Both hypotheses are rehearsed here as
an example of the process by which behavioral models are advanced for individual sediment cells
– the basic methodology leading to shoreline management planning. The next stage should be
the acquisition of a detailed database that will allow rigorous testing of such behavioral models
and thus, to inform the management process.
   3.7.4   Cell 4: northern Quintana Roo

As a first approximation, it is proposed here that Cell 4 extends from a divergent sediment
boundary in the north to Punta Allen at the mouth of Ascension Lagoon in the south. Sediment
inputs across the northern boundary are from the seabed sediment store between Puerto
Morelos and Punta Cancun. Additional sediment input along the shore is coral debris from the
fringing reefs that front this coast. The net sediment pathway along the coast is southward,



                                               – 30 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
although there is a strong cross-shore sediment movement as noted by Diez et al. (2009). This
may mean that sediment is moved from the beach to the deeper water offshore where it moves
into the northward-moving Yucatán Current (e.g. Kjerfe 1994). It is proposed that this northerly,
high-velocity current moves the cross-shore sediment northward where it is deposited in the
seabed store in the lee of Isla Mujeres and Contoy as described above (Figure 3.1). The remaining
sediment inshore of the reefs continues south to Punta Allen where it is carried into Ascension
lagoon and deposited in a sediment sink (i.e. removed from further coastal processes).

The northern boundary of this cell cannot be precisely defined given the available information,
but lies between Puerto Morelos and Cancun. Gonzalez-Leija et al. (2013) proposed that a
divergent sediment divide exists between Punta Cancun and Punta Nizuc, and this is consistent
with morphological evidence that shows a major change in coastal orientation at Cancun.
Although wave data is not available for this area, Appendini at al (2012) provide a wave rose for
a point 50 km east of Cancun, based on hind cast modeling, which shows that the dominant
waves here are south-easterly. Although wave refraction would modify the wave approach angle
at the shore, this means that north of Cancun the net sediment transport pathway will be
northwards, while south of Cancun it will be southward. The exact location of such a divide will
vary according to wave conditions at any given moment, but in general this describes a divergent
sediment boundary located between Punta Cancun and Puerto Morelos.

A divergent sediment boundary implies either that sediment is input to the divide from offshore,
or that sediment is eroded from the shore to feed the opposing sediment pathways. In this case
both the options may apply: the sediment store in the straits between Isla Mujeres/Contoy and
the mainland has been described above and several authors have documented the erosion of the
shoreline along the Cancun shore.
   3.7.5   Cell 5: southern Quintana Roo

Cell 5 is defined here as extending from Puerto Madero at the mouth of Espiritu Santo lagoon to
Canjero Cay at the mouth of the Chetumal Lagoon. This sediment cell is characterized by a thin
sand veneer on intertidal beaches, mainly contained within pocket bays defined by a series of
minor headlands formed from the underlying aeolianites. Sediment inputs appear to be
restricted to coral debris from the fringing reefs. Net sediment movement is southerly, but with
the strong cross-shore component noted above for Cell 4. During storm events, beach sediment
is moved seaward across the shore (draw-down) and meets the northward moving Yucatán
Current. It is possible therefore that some sediment from Cell 5 enters into the outer pathway of
the circulatory system of Cell 4, thus the sediment from both cells moves north with the Yucatán
Current and is redeposited in the lee of Isla Contoy. However, the presence of the three major
sediment sink areas (Ascension, Espiritu Santo and Chetumal lagoons) between Cell 4 and Cell 5
acts as a receptor for the southward moving inner pathway and prevents the completion of a full
circulation pathway linking the two cells.

   3.8      Management of the coastal and marine areas

   3.8.1    Shoreline management

Shoreline Management is the physical management of the shore to reduce the impact of natural
hazards, such as flooding and erosion, but also to mitigate the physical impact of human
intervention in the coastal system. Its overall objective is for a shore system that is self-sustaining
– that is one which is resilient and does not require human maintenance. Shoreline management
therefore constitutes one component of the larger program ICZM; it may be thought of as
providing an interface between coastal science and coastal management. The process of
shoreline management includes production of a Shoreline Management Plan (SMP), designed to
evaluate the behavior of a coast, both in response to environmental and human impacts, and to
use this information to inform the economic, social and environmental plans for the coast. In this
sense, the SMP offers information to the ICZM planners; thus it must aim for efficient
communication of relevant coastal science to ICZM planners.
   3.8.2    Shoreline management plans: Structure and Content

A Shoreline Management Plan sets out how the coast should best be managed in the future. It
is:

        An account of the past and predicted future behavior of a stretch of coastline, normally
         defined as a sediment cell;
        A large scale assessment of the risks for people and property associated with coastal
         processes within the SMP area;
        Designed to inform a policy framework that sustainably reduces risks to people and to the
         developed, historic, and natural environments – a policy framework that is central to the
         ICZM process.
SMPs set out the approach to achieve long term sustainability of coastal risk management for a
specific stretch of coast. Their aim is to provide the basis for sustainable shoreline management
policies over the next 100 years within a natural process unit (sediment cell or sub-cell). The
stretch of coast that an SMP covers includes one or more sediment cells and will typically include
a number of communities and land uses, and a series of different physical features and coastal
defenses.

The process of SMP development includes five main tasks:

   6. Definition of sediment cells as the basic unit for coastal zone management;
   7. Collation of a coastal data base designed to support the science within the SMP;
   8. Development of conceptual (or behavioral) models for each sediment cell;
   9. Evaluation of societal demands on the coast; and
   10. Reconciliation of scientific and societal demands within the SMP framework

The content of the final SMP is shown in Table 3.1. It includes a description of the physical
processes of the coast, a review of its present and anticipated land-use, and an outline of policies
that could result in long-term sustainable use. Finally, after consultation with coastal user groups,
the SMP should report on a preferred option for shoreline management that reconciles both its
natural processes and the human uses.

   3.8.3   Sediment cells

The sediment cell is a stretch of coast between boundaries that partly or wholly contain sediment
movement. It is the basic functional unit of the coast. It acts as a self-contained unit so that any
development within the sediment cell will have a minimal impact on areas outside its boundaries.
Within its boundaries coastal processes act as a coherent, integrated system. An understanding
of the way in which this system functions allows identification of the impacts of development or
management and to take action to mitigate such impacts.

In order to define the boundaries of a coastal sediment cell, it is necessary to understand the way
in which it functions. This is an iterative process in which a first approximation of the sediment
cell boundaries is made based on whatever information is available, followed by a detailed review
of the coastal processes within this approximation, based on a more comprehensive data base,
which may lead to boundary adjustment.
   3.8.4   Conceptual models

Conceptual or behavioral geomorphological models are currently seen as an essential stage in
the management of a coastal area and form the basis for the SMP. A conceptual model is a
summary of the overall functioning of the coastal system within sediment cell boundaries. It


                                                 – 33 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
considers the historic evolution of the coast, its present day processes and morphology and,
crucially, attempts to predict future changes. Conceptual models are high-level models that
encompass rather than replace more specific quantitative models. Thus, a conceptual model may
suggest scenarios that can be tested using hydrodynamic models.

A critical stage in the development of the conceptual model is the development of a sediment
budget. Information from a variety of sources, both secondary and primary, are used to build up
a composite map of sediment sources, sinks, stores and pathways. This in turn allows a more
precise definition of the sediment cell boundaries as part of the iterative process mentioned
above. Since predicting future coastal change is the end product of the study, the changes in
wave or tidal energy, the sources and sinks for sediment, and human inhibition of sediment
movement all contribute to coastal morphological change and form the basis for the conceptual
model. Thus, the conceptual, modeling stage of the SMP must depend on the collation of an
adequate database, whose principal attributes are outlined below.
   3.8.5   The Yucatán Peninsula database

A key component of the development of an SMP should be the collection, storage, and retrieval
of coastal data that can be used to develop the conceptual models of the coast. Data should be
acquired from both primary and secondary (i.e. existing) sources, with a bias towards secondary
data to reduce both costs and time; in many cases secondary data sources are either lacking or
inadequate.

The existing database for the Yucatán Peninsula is not considered adequate to support any
detailed shoreline management. What limited data is available is focused on local issues at scales
significantly smaller than those of the sediment cells outlined above. This means that
management tends to rely on reducing local impacts, rather than seeking general causes of
coastal problems. The lack of any data on waves, tides, currents, bathymetry, shoreline
topography, and the minimal data on sea level rise must be seen as a major impediment to
effective shoreline management. Urgent attention must be given to redress this situation.
   3.8.6   Primary data

Primary data inputs should be kept to a minimum in view of the timing, cost, and applicability of
such data. Detailed primary data obtained from field survey is normally obtained to test a specific
hypothesis. Such hypotheses emerge only in the secondary stages of any investigation, as the
initial aim of this study is to generate general behavioral models rather than investigate specific
causal hypotheses. Thus, primary data collection must be concerned with obtaining general
background information. There are four categories of coastal data required at this stage:

   1.   Coastal energy
   2.   Coastal morphology
   3.   Coastal sediments
   4.   Coastal ecology

The measurement of these components should form part of a general monitoring or surveillance
system for the Yucatán coast. This should ideally be organized on an inter-state basis, perhaps by
federal agencies, so as to avoid unnecessary duplication and to ensure a comprehensive
approach.

Table 3.2 summarizes the key attributes of each category that should be included in the basic
monitoring system. It is essential that each attribute is considered both as a spatial and a
temporal variable, since many, if not most, natural processes have return intervals measured in
years or even decades; for this reason, all monitoring should be designed to be a continuous
process.

The location, density, periodicity, and extent of primary data collection are matters for detailed
planning. An initial proposal might be to base surveillance systems within each of the preliminary
sediment cells defined above. Within each sediment cell, each of the attributes shown in
Table 3.2 should be monitored.
    3.8.7    Secondary data

Secondary data, despite its name, is of central importance. Ideally, secondary data should be
obtained and reviewed before primary field data collection is planned so that the design of the
primary data monitoring system might be based on this secure foundation. Where this is
impossible due to time constraints on the study, secondary data should be reviewed as soon as
possible and applied to the development of a conceptual model of coastal behavior that should
then inform the primary data collection methodology.

The basic attributes of a secondary database are outlined in Table 3.3. Spatial data in the form of
maps, charts, and remote sensed imagery should be made available in GIS format, allowing
temporal and spatial comparisons.

   4. Cost of Natural Disasters and Climate Change Implications

   4.1      Introduction

Like much of the Caribbean, the Yucatán Peninsula lies within the Atlantic Hurricane Belt. Because
of its almost uniformly flat terrain, the peninsula is particularly vulnerable to the large storms
coming from the east. Tracks of all hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions that hit
Yucatán in 1970-2014 are presented in Error! Reference source not found.Figure 4.1.

A preliminary analysis was conducted on      Figure 4.1. Tracks of Hurricanes, Tropical Storms, &
the data on floods, storms and rains that    Tropical Depressions that Hit Yucatán, 1970-2014
are associated with the wet air masses
that moved over the Atlantic and hit the
Yucatán Peninsula. This analysis shows
an increase in the frequency of extreme
weather events, as well as growing
damages per event. These trends could
be largely attributed to an increase in
land and water temperature in the
region, which has been linked to climate
change (Gobierno de Yucatán, 2012).

If global temperatures were to continue
this upward trend, temperatures in the
region would also continue to rise and Source: http://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes.

increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Error! Reference source not

   4.2     Frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the Yucatán
           Peninsula

Estimating climate change impacts is difficult, among other reasons, because of the high
uncertainty in the dynamics that influence the intensity and magnitude of extreme weather
events. One approach to deal with such uncertainty is to conduct a probabilistic analysis to cover
a wide range of possible climate change scenarios. To this end, projections from the DICE 2009
model (Nordhaus, 2010) were applied to compute an increase of global temperature from pre-
industrial level up to 2050. While the probabilistic analysis helps to address some sources of
uncertainty, their results are challenged by global emission scenarios and unknown parameters
of the climatic system.

For this analysis, the “optimal CO2 emission scenario” from the DICE 2009 model was used.
Results of DICE 2009 are consistent with the range for temperature change presented in
Table 4.1. Therefore the analysis presented in this chapter was conducted using global
temperature as major exogenous parameter and presenting frequency and severity of extreme
weather events as a function of global temperature increase.

Available data shows an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events in the Yucatán
Peninsula after 1985 (Figure 4.2). Such increase could be partly explained by improvements in
the reporting system, but it can also be attributed to climate change. Based on this historical
data, future scenarios were projected by linking the frequency of extreme weather events with
global temperature increases, which were developed using estimations of decadal temperature
trends from NOAA (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/) The analysis also estimated the relationship
between extreme weather event frequency in Yucatán Peninsula and global temperature for the
period 1970-2011 and 1990-2011. These two periods show a different quality in registration and
reporting of extreme weather events in Mexico.

The analysis revealed a stronger relationship between the frequency of extreme weather events
and temperature increase in Yucatán Peninsula. This relationship is about 35 percent stronger
for the 1990-2011 period, compared with the 1970-2011 timeframe.

The same methodology was used to analyze intensity of extreme weather events. The intensity
of these events can be approximated by estimating the economic cost for each event, including
its direct and indirect costs. In this analysis, only the cost of floods, rain and storm events were
estimated for Yucatán Peninsula, because they are extreme natural meteorological events
associated with climate change that result in significant loss of life and assets.

The deadliest natural disasters in Yucatán took place in 1990. Overall mortality trends have
remained relatively constant for the last 40 years in Mexico, but mortality from extreme weather
events has fallen slightly, to the credit of official efforts to improve preparedness to these events.
However, despite these efforts, the number of people affected by extreme events has increased
significantly over the last 20 years (Figure 4.3).
Figure 4.3. Dead, Missing, and Affected People in Natural Disasters in Yucatán




Source: Golub, 2015, based on data from UNISDR (http://www.desinventar.net)


The economic damage caused by each disaster was estimated using the methodology of value at
risk from the report by UNISDR (2013) (Table 4.2). In addition, the cost of mortality risk was
estimated using a methodology based on the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL). The losses of
affected people were estimated using one third of Mexico’s GDP per capita. The value of homes
was estimated based on Heston (2010), while those of schools and medical centers were
approximated at the same value. Natural disasters also affect productivity of agricultural lands.
Thus, the marginal lost profit per hectare was estimated using the values in Golub (2014), while


                                                  – 39 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
the cost of one livestock unit lost was based on the data reported by UNISDR (2015) and (Golub,
2014).

The value at risk analysis relies on a description of the intensity and recurrence of natural hazards
using a probability distribution function. Although historical data can often be used to project the
occurrence of specific events in the future, this is not the case in the context of climate change,
under which the intensity and frequency of extreme events is constantly changing. To address
this challenge, the frequency of natural disasters was estimated based on reports available from
the     Disaster      Information       Management         System      maintained      by     UNISDR
(http://www.desinventar.net).

After the natural hazards were characterized, the analysis established a damage function for a
given hazard, taking into account the exposure and fragility of the population, ecosystems and
economy. In this case, the application of past observations can be used to establish a baseline,
but not necessarily as a future predictor because the exposure and sensitivity of population,
ecosystems and economy could change over time. For example, Mechler (2005) refers to an
increase of population and economic growth with higher assets accumulation in Mexico as a
factor that increases exposure to natural hazards. The analysis estimated the mean direct and
indirect losses for the last 40 year period.

The analysis sought to assess the existence of significant effects based on a non-linear response
of intensity of extreme weather events with respect to global temperature change. None of these
non-linear linkages were identifiable because of information quality, hence the increase of
intensity of extreme weather events in Yucatán Peninsula was modeled as a linear function of
global temperature increase.

During the reported period, there were 3 years (1988-1990) with a very high cost per event. The
largest was associated with the impact of hurricane Gilbert in 1988. Total losses for that event
are several magnitudes higher than the average annual value. This kind of event cannot be
analyzed based on available data and requires additional consideration. The analysis should

consider the possibility that a similar or even higher magnitude event may happen any time,
albeit with a very low probability (available data suggests a return period of 50 years). The
intensity observed in 1989 and 1990 is also rare, but the return period is about 20 years
(Figure 4.4).

The analysis estimated the structure of the cost of extreme weather events, based on the 6 years
with the highest cost (Figure 4.5). The total cost structure is estimated excluding the Gilbert
hurricane year of 1988, because local costs that year were an order of magnitude higher than the
average for the other years.

Infrequent major natural disasters with large impacts have a significantly different structure of
impacts than similar low-impact but higher frequency events (Figure 4.5). For the most
devastating events, losses accrued by local businesses account for a major fraction of the total
cost, while tourism and infrastructure losses also constitute a major component of local losses
(Gobierno de Yucatán, 2012). Based on the analysis of historical data, the following section
provides an outlook for economic losses associated with extreme weather events as result of
climate change.

   4.3     Economic losses associated with extreme weather events as result of
           climate change

The analysis applied a special climatic model to address uncertainties attributed to climate
sensitivity and other major climatic system parameters. This model translates global GHG
emissions into global temperature increase, based on the DICE 2009 model. Due to a high level
of uncertainty of value of the economic losses, the analysis includes a Monte Carlo simulation to
assess combined uncertainties and to compute the distribution for the output parameters (i.e.
annual economic cost of extreme weather events in Yucatán Peninsula in 2020-2050).

Figure 4.6 presents the distribution of the economic cost function for the selected scenario. The
results show that the most damaging event may happen with relatively low, but still significant,
probability. The figure illustrates shifts in the annual expected economic cost associated with
extreme weather events. This shift is attributed to a positive feedback between global
temperature increases and growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The
probability density function of damage shifts right over time. Expected annual economic losses
are relatively modest, in the order of MXN 6-17 billion; however, there is a significant tail risk
that reflects a combined uncertainty of global temperature increase, and intensity and frequency
of individual events. However, a high end tail risk is at least a magnitude below the reported
losses for major events.

If GDP were to grow 2-3 percent annually in the three states in the Yucatán Peninsula, the annual
mean economic cost of extreme weather events (ordinary events) would be about 0.4 percent of
GDP. This figure is about twice more than the annual cost of natural disasters for Mexico as a
whole (Golub, 2014). However, in the 95th percentile (when the damages would be highest) this
cost could reach 1.4-1.5 percent of GDP in 2020 and 1.6-2.3 percent of GDP in 2050 (Gobierno de
Yucatán, 2012).

   4.4     Summary

This chapter has provided an economic valuation of potential damages from meteorological
events associated with climate change. The estimates presented in this chapter are based on
economic valuation methods associated with probabilistic events. As noted in this chapter, the
uncertainty in cost estimates remains significant and may differ considerably depending also on
the geographical incidence and timing of the event. However, what emerges clearly from this
analysis is a trend of ever-increasing cost impacts. Avoiding even a small portion of such costs
through appropriate emergency preparedness, risk mitigation, or similar programs would be
money well spent. ICZM efforts that reduce vulnerability to these significant hazards are an
important adaptation mechanism. These efforts should consider both relatively infrequent, but
catastrophic events, as well as events with less severe impacts, but that occur frequently.

This chapter also demonstrates that economic valuation can be helpful in communicating risks
and in identifying priorities. In the overall ICZM context, such valuations can also be conducted
to determine the economic impacts of other hazards (e.g., water pollution, air pollution, soil
contamination), which may be hypothesized to be relevant in specific local circumstances. To
date, the only such analyses to have been undertaken for the Yucatán Peninsula is the one
summarized in Chapter 5 of this report. However, more comprehensive analyses could be
pursued as part of a broader priority-setting exercise to determine which issues have the most
significant potential economic impacts.

    5. The Cost of Environmental Degradation in the Yucatán Peninsula8

    5.1      Introduction

In the Yucatán Peninsula, as practically everywhere else, government agencies have limited
resources to develop policies and support interventions that will contribute to sustainable
development. Having a rigorous methodology to set priorities is therefore essential to ensure
that scarce public resources target the environmental issues that cause the most severe social
and economic impacts, and particularly those that affect primarily the poor and other vulnerable
groups.
A methodologically rigorous approximation to identify environmental priorities is to quantify the
impacts and economic costs of these issues.9 As part of this analysis, economic valuation
techniques were used to estimate the cost of environmental degradation impacts on human
health, and thus on economic and social development and well-being.10 To estimate these
impacts, the first part of the analysis calculated the number of deaths and cases of illnesses
caused by environmental problems with well-established health effects, particularly household
(indoor) air pollution, outdoor air pollution, lead exposure, and inadequate water supply,
sanitation and hygiene. These calculations relied on available data at the state and national
levels, as well as from an extensive literature review. Where possible and relevant, risks were
estimated based on the specific characteristics of stakeholders, such as age group, or urban vs.
rural settings, among others. For example, because indoor air pollution occurs within home
dwellings, its impacts for different households can be more easily evaluated. Other categories of
environmental degradation—such as outdoor air pollution or exposure to lead—occur in areas
where the differentiation of effects across different stakeholder groups cannot be measured
using the available resources and data.

After estimating the health impacts of the environmental risks, the analysis quantified the
economic losses that they represent. These losses come in many forms, including loss of income,
productivity, and contributions to household activities due to premature mortality, illness, and
neuropsychological impairments (IQ losses). Illness also involves cost of medical treatment.
These costs can were quantified in monetary terms by means of valuation techniques used in
economics.

The cost of premature mortality was estimated by using a value of statistical life (VSL), which is
based on individuals’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a reduction in the risk of death. The VSL
applied to the Yucatán Peninsula is MX$ 5.9 million or US$ 461 thousand. This is somewhat over

  The economic cost of environmental degradation is often valued by estimating the value of environmental
externalities, or the cost borne by society even if the costs are not reflected in market prices. An example is urban
air pollution: urban residents may suffer from pollution, but the pollution emitters are not charged for their
pollution and are not required to compensate those who get sick.

environmental priority problems in the study conducted by the World Bank in Argentina.

50 times the Gross Regional Income (GRI) per capita in the peninsula in 2013. The cost of IQ losses
is estimated based on the present value of the reduction in lifetime income.

The cost of illness was calculated using two commonly used valuation techniques. The cost-of-
illness (COI) approach integrates the cost of medical treatment and the value of income and time
lost to illness. The second approach equates cost of illness to individuals’ WTP for avoiding an
episode of illness. Studies in many countries have found that individuals’ WTP to avoid an episode
of an acute illness is generally much higher than the cost of treatment and value of income and
time losses (Alberini and Krupnick, 2000; Cropper and Oates, 1992; Dickie and Gerking, 2002;
Wilson, 2003).

In this report, the cost of a day of illness is estimated as 50 percent of the average labor income
in the Yucatán Peninsula. This figure is also applied to individuals without income, because illness
prevents most of these individuals from undertaking household work and other activities with a
social value. In addition to monetary values, estimates also reflect the effect of environmental
degradation on Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), an internationally accepted measure of
years of healthy life lost due to diseases caused by environment degradation or other causes.

    5.2      Health and Economic Effects of Environmental Degradation

Using conservative assumptions, this report estimates that 1,073 – 1,100 people died in the
Yucatán Peninsula in 2013 from environmental health risks. Around 80 percent of the deaths
Yucatán from household and outdoor air pollution, while adult lead (Pb) exposure and
inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene caused 13% and 7% of total deaths,
respectively. In addition to these premature deaths, environmental health risks also caused
millions of cases of illness and impaired intelligence among children (Table 5.1).

The health effects from the environmental risk factors can be monetized by using standard
valuation techniques in order to provide an economic perspective of the magnitude of these
effects. The annual cost of the environmental health effects is estimated in the range of MX$
10,900 – 16,100 million in 2013, with a mid-point estimate of MX$ 13,500 million. This cost is
equivalent to 2.2 – 3.3 percent of the Yucatán Peninsula’s estimated Gross Regional Income (GRI)
in 2013, with a mid-point estimate of 2.75 percent (Table 5.2).

About 48 percent of the cost is from lead (Pb) exposure, of which the vast majority is from
impaired intelligence in children. Approximately 26 percent of the cost is from household air
pollution, 16 percent is from outdoor air pollution, and 10 percent of the cost is from inadequate
water, sanitation and hygiene. This last cost, however, does not include substantial non-health
costs such as cost of bottled water purchased because of public perceptions of health risk
associated with piped water and water from wells.

    5.3      Lead (Pb) exposure

As these figures indicate, lead (Pb) exposure is the environmental health risk with the highest
cost. Lead in the human body can originate from exposure to lead in air, drinking water, food,
dust, soil, paint, cosmetics, utensils, several herbal medicines, children’s toys, ornaments and
jewelry, and other materials and articles containing lead. Identified sources of lead in Mexico
include glazed ceramics used for cooking and food storage, metal smelters, and mining waste
(Villalobos et al, 2009; Acosta-Saavedra et al, 2011; Farias et al, 2014).

Studies in Mexico have found large declines in BLLs in the general population from the 1980s.
Much of this decline is attributed to the phase out of leaded gasoline. A review of 83 studies with
150 measurement samples of over 50,000 participants concluded that Blood Lead Levels (BLLs)
in Mexican children declined from nearly 20 µg/dL prior to 1980 to around 5 µg/dL in the mid-
2000s (Caravanos et al, 2014).

Based on the available data, it is estimated that the current average BBL in children under five
years of age in Mexico City may be around 2.5-3.0 µg/dL, reflecting a likely continued decline in
BLLs since the time of the last studies. BLLs in other urban areas of Mexico seem to be somewhat
higher, around 3.5 µg/dL (Farias et al., 2014; Trejo-Acevedo et al., 2009). BLLs among rural
children under five years of age are expected to be substantially higher than those of children in
urban areas. One source of higher BLLs is the high prevalence of use of lead-glazed pottery for
cooking and food storage, which was identified as a significant factor of high BLLs in Morelos by
Farias et al (2014). Caravanos et al (2014) found that rural BLLs were about 50-60% higher than
urban BLL. Based on this information, an average BLL of 3.7 µg/dL among children under five
years of age is estimated for the Yucatán Peninsula.

Very few recent studies of adult blood lead levels in Mexico were identified during the
preparation of this report. In light of the BLLs among children, the current average BLL in adults


                                                    – 47 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
of over 25 years of age in the Yucatán Peninsula may also be around 3.7 µg/dL. This would suggest
a mean BLL of 4.35 µg/dL among males and 3.05 µg/dL among females, if the gender difference
is similar to that observed in the United States.11 Based on the above, it is estimated that 87
percent of children under five years of age, 79 percent of adult females, and 93 percent of male
adults have a BLL of ≥ 2 µg/dL (figures 4.1 and 4.2).

A well-established effect of lead exposure is neuropsychological impairment in children,
measured as IQ losses.12 The effect is found to occur even at very low BLLs (Lanphear et al, 2005;
Surkan et al, 2007; Jusko et al, 2008). In fact, no BLL threshold below which there are no impacts
on children’s IQ has been identified in the international research literature. Thus, this analysis

estimates a total annual loss of 87 – 197 thousand IQ-points among children under five years of
age in the Yucatán Peninsula, with a mid-point estimate of 142 thousand.13

The main health effect of lead exposure among adults is the effect on systolic blood pressure
(SBP) and consequent risk of cardiovascular disease (Lim et al, 2012). Estimating the
cardiovascular disease burden from lead exposure requires calculating BLLs by age groups
because the risk associated with a change in SBP varies by age (Table 5.3).

A BLL lower threshold value of 2.0 µg/dL is applied in this report to estimate the cardiovascular
disease burden from lead exposure. Based on this threshold, an estimated 138 deaths from lead
exposure occurred in the Yucatán Peninsula in 2013 (Table 5.4). About 40% of these deaths were
among the population younger than 70 years. In addition, an estimated 185 disability years or 67
thousand disability days were lost from non-fatal cardiovascular disease. This corresponds to 337
– 674 thousand days of illness.14

      5.4     Household air pollution

Household air pollution is the environmental challenge with the second highest economic costs.
The severity of household air pollution is associated with the use of solid biomass fuels for
cooking, as was done by 28 percent of Yucatán Peninsula’s population in 2000. The highest
prevalence was in the State of Yucatán (41 percent), followed by Campeche (35 percent). Only 2
percent of the population used solid fuels in Quintana Roo (Perez-Maldonado et al, 2011). This
practice declined to 19% of the population in 2010, compared to 14.5% nationally.15 By 2013
about 17 percent of the peninsula’s population (around 190 thousand households), of which 70%
reside in the State of Yucatán, would have used solid fuels if the trend from 2000 to 2010
continued.

Combustion of solid fuels generates several health damaging pollutants, including fine particulate
matter (PM2.5), which causes several respiratory diseases. Measurement studies in Mexico and
three other countries in Latin America have found 24-48 hours average PM2.5 concentrations in
the kitchen area of about 130-1020 µg/m3 among households that used wood for cooking over
open fire or unimproved stoves. Some of the studies also measured 24-48 hours personal PM2.5
exposure, which averaged 120-264 µg/m3.

Based on available data, table presents the estimated exposures to PM2.5 in households using
solid fuels for cooking in the Yucatán Peninsula. In the absence of more detailed exposure studies,
a distribution from 75 to 250 µg/m3 is applied, with average personal exposures in the range of
144 – 173 µg/m3.16 The distribution reflects an assumption that 15-25 percent of households
using biomass cook with an improved chimney stove, and thus have estimated personal
exposures in the range of 75-100 µg/m3.

Peninsula, 2013

   Personal exposures of 338 µg/m3 among women, 285 µg/m3 among children, and 205 µg/m3 among men in
households using solid fuels from studies in India formed the basis for the recent global burden of disease (GBD) 2010
study (Smith et al, 2014). The exposure levels applied to the Yucatán Peninsula are substantially lower, based on the
reviewed monitoring studies in several Latin American countries.

The most substantial health effects of PM2.5 in the household environment are cardiovascular
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer among adults, and acute
lower respiratory infections (ALRI) among young children (Lim et al, 2012). Table 5.6 presents the
estimated relative risks of these disease outcomes from exposure to PM2.5 in the household
environment. These risks are gender and age-weighted population averages.17 An annual PM2.5
threshold of 7.3 µg/m3 is applied in this report, below which it is assumed that there are no health
effects (Lim et al, 2012).

This report estimates that 524-551 people, with a central estimate of 538 persons, died from
household PM2.5 air pollution in the Yucatán Peninsula in 2013 (Table 5.7). Over 4 percent of the
deaths were individuals younger than 70 years of age. Deaths caused by household air pollution
represent 10 percent of total deaths in the Peninsula from these diseases. In addition, an
estimated 1,131 – 1,190 disability years, or 413-434 thousand disability days were lost from non-
fatal events of disease, which corresponds to 2.1 – 4.3 million days of illness.18

   Note that the relative risk of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease changes little from 100 µg/m 3 to
400 µg/m3 of PM2.5 concentrations. As these two disease outcomes account for 70% of health effects from household
air pollution, total estimated health effects are relatively insensitive to the population exposure distribution presented
previously.

   This reflects a disability weight of 0.1-0.2. Several cardiovascular diseases and moderate COPD are categorized in
this range in the GBD 2010 Study.

    5.5      Outdoor air pollution

Particulate matter (PM) and especially PM2.5 is the outdoor air pollutant that globally is
associated with the largest health effects. Ambient PM2.5 air quality measurements in the
Yucatán Peninsula are scarce. In INECC’s report on air quality in Mexico only provides PM2.5 data
for the city of Merida, were annual average concentrations were 11 µg/m3 in 2013 (INECC, 2014).

Recent nationwide and global estimates of PM2.5 concentrations using a combination of
satellite-based measurements, chemical transport models, and, when available, ground level
measurements represent an alternative to the single use of ground level measurements to
estimate the health effects of PM2.5. Brauer et al (2012) report, based on such data, that PM2.5
concentration levels in most locations of Yucatán Peninsula are in the range of 5-10 µg/m3. Such
spatially detailed estimates of PM2.5 enable an estimation of health effects in all urban and rural
areas of the peninsula. These data and modeling may, however, tend to underestimate
concentrations in many cities and should therefore be applied with caution (van Donkelaar et al,
2015).

In the absence of comprehensive ground-level monitoring of PM2.5 from the Yucatán Peninsula,
estimates presented in Brauer et al (2012) and ground-level monitoring from the city of Merida
are here combined to provide estimates of annual PM2.5 concentrations throughout the
peninsula for 2013. As PM2.5 concentrations vary within each city and urban area, and across
rural areas, a population exposure distribution is derived as presented in Table 5.8.

An annual PM2.5 threshold of 7.3 µg/m3 is applied in this report, below which it is assumed that
there are no health effects. Based on the PM2.5 concentrations and exposure distributions in
Table 5.8, about 70 percent of the population at Yucatán Peninsula is exposed to PM2.5 levels
associated with health effects.

Based on these estimates, 332 people died from outdoor PM2.5 air pollution in the Yucatán
Peninsula in 2013. About 72 percent of these deaths were in the Merida Metropolitan Area and
five other metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100 thousand (Table 5.9). The deaths
caused by outdoor air pollution represent around 6.5% of total deaths in the Yucatán Peninsula
from these causes. Over 47% of the deaths from PM2.5 were individuals younger than 70 years
of age. In addition, an estimated 445 disability years or 162 thousand disability days were lost
from non-fatal events of disease. This corresponds to 0.8 – 1.6 million days of illness.19

According to the 2010 Population Census, nearly 92 percent of households in Mexico had piped
water supply to their dwelling or yard. In the Yucatán Peninsula, this was higher, at about 94
percent of households.

The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) by WHO/UNICEF
estimates that 85 percent of the Mexican population had access to an improved and non-shared
sanitation facility in 2011. An estimated 11 percent of the population shared a facility. According
to the Population Census 2010, about 90% of the population had flush or pour-flush toilets
connected to a piped sewer system or septic tank. According to the same Census about 90% of
households in the Yucatán Peninsula had sanitation services in 2010 and 84% of the households
have piped drainage to sewer system or septic tank (Table 5.11).

In addition to good quality drinking water and sanitation, good hygiene practices are essential
for infectious disease prevention. In particular, hand washing with soap at critical times has been



                                                    – 54 –                Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
found to substantially reduce diarrheal illness (Curtis and Cairncross, 2003; Fewtrell et al, 2005;
Ejemot et al, 2009; Waddington et al, 2009; Cairncross et al, 2010; Freeman et al, 2014). However,
limited information is available on household and community hygiene practices and conditions
in the Yucatán Peninsula, preventing this report from providing any meaningful assessment.

Inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WSH) causes diarrhea and other infectious
diseases. Poor sanitation and hygiene increases the risk of parasite infestation, while poor hand
washing practices are a major contributor to diarrhea and respiratory infections in children (Rabie
and Curtis 2006). Repeated diarrheal infections in early childhood contribute to poor nutritional
status (e.g., underweight), as evidenced by research studies in communities with a wide range of
diarrheal infection rates in a diverse group of countries (World Bank, 2008).

The health effects of inadequate WSH in the Yucatán Peninsula include diarrheal mortality and
morbidity in children and adults, and child mortality from poor nutritional status caused by
inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. In particular, inadequate WSH caused 79
deaths in the peninsula in 2013 (Table 5.12). This represents 46 percent of all deaths from
diarrheal diseases including typhoid.20 About 35 percent of these deaths were among children
under five years of age, and 34 percent were among the population older than 70 years. In
addition, inadequate WSH caused an estimated 1.25-1.65 million cases of diarrheal disease, or
3.75 – 4.90 million days of illness.

     5.7     Summary

This chapter has identified and ranked the environmental risks that cause the most severe health
and economic impacts in the Yucatán Peninsula. In particular, it summarized the result of an
economic analysis that estimated that between 1,073 and 1,100 people died in the Yucatán
Peninsula in 2013 from environmental health risks. In terms of health impacts in the peninsula,
household air pollution is the most severe problem, followed by outdoor air pollution; these two
types of air pollution are responsible for around 80% of deaths associated with an environmental
20
  Pruss-Ustun et al (2014) attributes 46% of diarrheal disease to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene in Latin
America. Globally, the attributable fraction is 58% among low- and middle-income countries. Infectious disease
deaths from underweight among children under five years of age caused by diarrheal disease are very low, given that
the prevalence of moderate and severe underweight in Mexico totals around 3%..


                                                        – 55 –             Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
health risk. Adult lead (Pb) exposure and inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene caused 13%
and 7% of total deaths, respectively.

From an economic standpoint, the annual cost of the environmental health effects is estimated
in the range of MX$ 10,900 – 16,100 million in 2013, with a mid-point estimate of MX$ 13,500
million. This cost is equivalent to 2.2 – 3.3 percent of Yucatán Peninsula’s estimated GRI in 2013,
with a mid-point estimate of 2.75 percent. Lead exposure is responsible for 48 percent of this
cost, mostly because of it results in impaired intelligence in children and a consequent reduction
in lifetime earnings. About 26 percent of the cost is from household air pollution, 16 percent is
from outdoor air pollution, and 10 percent of the cost is from inadequate water, sanitation and
hygiene.

The analysis, thus, indicates that environmental health risk exposure levels in the Yucatán
Peninsula are significant and result in a major loss of economic opportunities and quality of life,
particularly for lower income groups, such as households that still use biomass fuels. In order to
address these challenges, the state governments of the Yucatán Peninsula could consider filling
additional knowledge gaps and assessing interventions targeting environmental priority
problems.

Although blood lead levels have been decreasing over time, efforts should be made to identify
and control lead exposure in “hotspots”. In addition, in light of recent evidence of the severity of
impacts of lead in children, measurement studies should be undertaken to confirm blood lead
levels among children, map geographic pockets of high blood lead levels, and identify and control
sources of lead exposure.

Given the significant health effects and high cost of household use of solid fuels for cooking,
increased emphasis should be placed on improved cooking stoves, ventilation, and switching of
fuel to LPG. When tackling both indoor and outdoor air pollution, governmental efforts should
prioritize mitigating emissions and reducing concentration of PM2.5, which is the air pollutant
with the largest health effects.

Finally, improvements should be continued in the water and sanitation sector, with emphasis on
bridging the sanitation gap, ensuring good quality drinking water, and continuing efforts to
improve hand washing practices and other hygiene dimensions.

Although the three state governments from the Yucatán Peninsula have begun to address shared
challenges jointly, notably in the case of climate change, there is currently no priority setting
mechanism in the region and the scarce available resources are not used to address the
categories of environmental degradation that are causing the most significant effects. This study
provides an urgently needed framework to align resources and efforts to achieve better
environmental conditions. The methodologies and approach adopted by this analytical work can
be replicated in the future to evaluate progress in reducing environmental conditions, identifying
policy and intervention improvements, and determining the most efficient use of scarce
resources. In doing so, it will be crucial to continuously incorporate new scientific findings,
evolving methodologies, and broader stakeholder perspectives.

   6.1     Introduction

Tourism is a complex economic activity with a potentially substantial impact on the economy and
the environment, both for Quintana Roo and for Mexico as a whole. Its evolution, structure and
model of industrial organization can have a profound influence on economic development, the
pattern of resource use and the environment. Even though it shares many characteristics with
the industrial and service sectors, tourism is peculiar in its structure: it can be considered a special
subset of the economy, combining many different production sectors, both of industrial and
service nature. These include the organized hotel industry and restaurant business, but also
infrastructure and a series of other activities that contribute to the supply of tourist services and
that are either directly consumed or are incorporated into the products and services that tourists
buy.

While the value chain of tourism is potentially long and complex, in many countries the
multinational nature of the business has been associated with a tendency for vertical integration.
In this model, the final product is conceived as an enclave of residences and entertainment for
an international and affluent crowd, heavily dependent on imported goods and services.

This pattern of organization of the industry, based on large investments by multinational hotel
chains, has been expanding steadily in the past 50 years and appears to have achieved impressive
success in terms of sales, profits and growth. Its characteristics as a global good has insured
improving standards of quality and an increasing favor with international travelers, but, at the
same time, has raised a number of questions. These questions concern both the limited impact
that the enclave-based, import-dependent model has on the local economy and, more
poignantly, the negative effect on the environment.

Another aspect of this structure of tourism is that it has traditionally implicitly or explicitly
benefited from domestic subsidies that are not always enjoyed by other sectors. In an attempt
to attract investment, local authorities have provided incentives through a variety of means to
investors (e.g., land, subsidized services, duty free imports of goods needed in the industry).
These subsidies may or may not be offset by other revenues to government coffers but they
inevitably lead to inefficient resource allocation. Over-use of energy and water is rampant in
many places of the world because of low pricing of such commodities. Another inefficiency
relates to land-use: land in coastal areas that may traditionally have been left untouched under
traditional use patterns is of potentially high value within the tourism sector. Land in these areas
is often developed at densities far above the carrying capacity of the environment and the local
services that supply such areas.

The climate change debate, in particular, has focused attention on the potentially devastating
effects that sea level rise may have on a great number of resources that are located in coastal
areas increasingly threatened by floods and extreme weather events. Questions have also been
raised on the direct environmental impacts from massive construction and invasive architecture,
as well as from the infrastructural developments induced by such a concentration of land


                                                  – 58 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
development on fragile coastal areas. Finally, the prevailing model has also been blamed for its
failure to link with local culture and stimulate local business, thereby promoting mass tourism as
an essentially predatory activity, with no capacity to induce, through sector and employment
multipliers, endogenous growth.

Counter to this traditional scenario of international tourism as a globalized commodity with no
significant linkages with the local community, several alternatives have been proposed to
improve the contribution of the tourism industry to the national/regional economy and, at the
same time, to generate more efficient patterns of resource use with regard to the environment.
These alternatives are all based on the idea that a higher level of integration with the territory
and its culture is necessary for tourist resorts, and that this integration must include both the
widening and the deepening of the local value chain. Moreover, all of these alternatives tend to
reject the traditional concentration of tourism activity on the coast, and advocate a broader
policy of investment aimed to direct tourists towards the cities of the interior and other points
of attraction with cultural or entertainment value.

On the whole, these alternative scenarios can be seen as an effort to identify profiles of
investment with more and stronger linkages between tourism, local industry and services,
cultural production, and more generally, economic development. They can also be seen as
attempts to identify alternative patterns of tourism as a global and local composite consumption
good, by combining the traditional reception and entertainment services with more sophisticated
forms of cultural experience, respect for the environment, and the valorization of local human
and non-human resources.

The alternatives suggested to the beach resort model, however, have themselves raised a
number of problems. On one hand, they are generally based on broad ideas and ideological
concerns, rather than on specific, concrete and economically well-founded models. This is the
case, for example, of so called “eco-tourism”, which in most of its practical applications can still
be seen more as a brave attempt to tame the conflict between mass travel and the ecological
balance, than as a well-defined product and business model.

On the other hand, the new models of tourism, because of their reliance on concepts such as
exploration (i.e. penetration into unexplored realities) and experience of alternative cultures,
threaten to generate new dangers in terms of the potential disruption of environments and
populations, which were relatively unaffected by the enclave type traditional model. In virtually
all cases of both old and new tourist modes, the economic and social effects are unclear both in
terms of their predictable results and their measured outcomes. This is, for example, true in
Quintana Roo for the local Mayan population, which has been affected by the Cancun type of
development only to the extent that it has been used to provide low wage workers, but could be
even more adversely influenced by the development of an eco-tourism with direct impact on
Mayan settlements and the local rural resource base.

While the forms of eco- and cultural tourism proposed appear unclear and fraught with their own
dangers, the design of alternative models should also be subject to more detailed analysis. The
search of models that would be able to involve local human and non-human resources and



                                                – 59 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
stimulate endogenous, sustainable growth, in particular, is important both to evaluate the
existing tourism patterns and the economic policies that could steer the industry towards modes
of production that are simultaneously more efficient and more respectful of the environment as
tourism’s primary resource.

Identifying forms of tourism with lower leakages, higher direct and indirect effects on the
economy, dynamic economies of scale, and more and stronger linkages with other economic
activities thus appears to be crucial to the understanding and the definition of appropriate
economic policies for the sector. In Quintana Roo, this analysis is ever more important because
of many reasons, including that, in the context of the predictable environmental disruption
induced by climate change, the Cancun model of tourism development does not appear to be
viable any more, at least not without radical modifications.

   6.2        Highlights of the Methodology

The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is a system of national/ regional / sub-regional accounts
represented in a matrix format (Stone, 1962, 1981). It includes the inter-industry linkages
through transactions typically found in the Input-Output (I/O) accounts and the transactions and
transfers of income between different types of economic agents, such as households,
government, firms, and external institutional sectors.
The SAM consists of a set of interrelated subsystems that, on the one hand, give an analytical
picture of the studied economy in a particular accounting period and, on the other hand, serve
as an instrument for assessing the effects of changes on the particular flows represented by it
(injections and linkages in the system), which might be the result of policy measures.
The SAM is a double-entry table, describing the structure of the economic system through its
disaggregation in key blocks, thought as origin and destination of transaction flows. Thanks to its
theoretical and methodological characteristics, it can represent the distributive and
redistributive income process by including the accounts headed to the institutional sectors
(households, firms, and government). Following this approach, the economic system is typically
disaggregated into the following blocks:
         1.   Primary production factors (labor and capital);
         2.   Production sectors (agriculture, industry, services and their disaggregations);
         3.   Households;
         4.   Firms;
         5.   Government (public administration);
         6.   Capital Formation (public and private gross fixed investments);
         7.   Rest of the Country (ROC) and Rest of the World (ROW)

Both the expenditures (columns) and revenues (rows) are defined for any productive and
institutional sector. If data are available, any of the above blocks can be further disaggregated
depending on the objective of the analysis. The SAM can be considered an extension of the
traditional I/O model proposed by Leontief, which also consists of a transaction matrix and
records, in quantitative terms, the exchange flows of an economic system in a specific place, for


                                                  – 60 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
a specific period of time. In its usual configuration, the SAM includes the I/O matrix of the
intermediate exchanges between production sectors, the accounts related to institutional
sectors (households, firms and government), production factors (labor and capital), capital
formation, and rest of the economy.

     6.3     Estimating a Social Accounting Matrix to Evaluate Eco-sustainable Tourism
             in Quintana Roo

     6.3.1   A New “Social Accounting Matrix” for the Economy and the Environment

The problem of integrating environmental and economic accounts was first addressed through
the concept of “spatial and physical economy” in the works developed by: Isard (1969), Ayres
and Kneese (1969), Leontief (1970) and Victor (1972). The symmetrical environmental input –
output table (SEIOT) based on the Leontief methodology included emissions to the atmosphere
and water, and was further developed in several more recent contributions. From a statistical
point of view, the “National Accounts System of United Nations, 1993 (NAS93)” presented for
the first time a national system of accounts extended to environmental accounting, but without
a specific choice on the methodology to measure and incorporate systematically the
environmental effects and on which metrics to use. After many years of debate and different
attempts from national and international institutions, in 2003 the UN published a manual, named
SEEA03 (System Environmental and Economic Accounting), providing prescriptions to collect and
incorporate in national accounts the costs of physical flows linked to the environment and their
connection with the monetary flows associated with production activity and consumption. The
manual includes also the design of a hybrid SAM, called SAMEA and subsequently SEAM, which
combines economic and environmental flows in an integrated set of accounts.
Based in part on SEEAO3 and in part on a parallel documentation of the European Union21, several
countries have now a set of national environmental accounts (the so called NAMEA accounts)
integrated in one or more environmental social accounting matrices. However, since most
natural resources and environmental goods are strongly rooted locally, the real challenge is to
develop social accounting matrices that refer to sufficiently small regional and sub-regional
contexts, so that the local impact of resource management and governance can be appropriately
taken into account.
Several recent studies and initiatives attempt to address this problem by developing regional
SAMs. For example, Scandizzo, Ferrarese and Vezzani (2011) develop a system of SEAM for 20
regions in Italy, which are available on a website and can be utilized flexibly to study the impact
of various environmental policies on the economic system. Rodriguez, Braak and Watson (2011)
propose an automated SAM that can be fit at the local level to develop economic base
assessments in small regions. Uwakonie et al. (2010) present a local application of an AEAM to
the Broken Bow Lake (BBL) in Oklahoma. They value the total impact of BBL and their distribution

  The first document of the EU in this regard is a position paper by the European Commission in 1994,titled
“Directions of the European Union in relation to the environmental indicators and the Green National Account: the
integration of the systems of information economic and environmental”.

among local stakeholders by considering SEAM direct and indirect effects of returns from
hydroelectric power and municipal and industrial water activities, valued at market prices, while
use losses prevented and assumed equal to net income to account for output of the flood control
activity. They also value output of recreation on the basis of a net benefit per visitor-day. Usami
(2008) develops a SEAM model for villages in India to analyze interactions between economic
activities and natural resources, use of local water and land resources, soil degradation caused
by over-use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and shortage of organic matter.
Table 6.1 and Table 6.2 show the structure of an environmental SAM, constructed according to
the UN methodology (called SEEA03 for the SAMEA or System Environmental and Economic
Accounting), which accounts for both the physical flows linked to the environmental sphere, the
monetary flows associated with production activity and consumption, and their connections.
From an economic standpoint, the SAMEA contains a SAM in which the flows are expressed in
monetary units, associated to the economic flow, or in other words, related to production activity
and consumption, as well as those that refer to a subsequent distribution and redistribution of
these flows. From an environment point of view, the SAMEA rows account for the flows of natural
resources that the productive system uses as inputs (for example, water resources) or the

the emissions (i.e. how recycled water is picked up by nature once it has been used by the
production process), household consumption, and the emission of greenhouse effect gasses.

      6.3.2   A SAM from Quintana Roo: Field Surveys and SAM Parameters

A critical input in the estimation of the SAM for Quintana Roo was provided by the results of two
parallel surveys conducted by a team of researchers and students from the University of
Quintana Roo and the University of Rome. They concerned, respectively, the characteristics and
the potential of tourist demand (both national and international), and the socio-economic
characteristics of the local Maya population, particularly with regard to its actual or potential
involvement in tourism.
Key results from the tourists’ sample show an interesting socio-economic structure, that reflects
a preference for the educated, and with a sufficiently balanced professional affiliation and
cultural attendance profile. The attitude towards tourism appears to be characterized by a
combination of minimalist tendencies (“we are doing just a vacation”) with a clear preference for
cultural activities related to heritage, but not excluding the accessory facilities and activities, such
as nightlife, extreme sports, and adventure. However, more than 80 percent of tourists are
interested in visiting the archaeological sites and carrying out activities related to them.
The tourist sample is balanced in terms of gender representation and characterized by a large
prevalence of highly educated individuals (more than 79 percent university graduates, graduate
or undergraduate). However, this group seemingly behaves similarly to other groups sampled
from the point of view of leisure activities and experience with cultural goods. The scenario
preferred is still the traditional one, with the highest proportion of the respondents (58 percent)
giving their preference to the natural beauties of the coast, but with a significant proportion
interested in the cultural and ecological possibilities that their visit may yield. Willingness to pay
for conservation programs appears also significant and diffused, and somewhat related to the
level of education, especially in the passage from university students to graduate degree holders.
In general, therefore, this sample presents a tourist profile very different from the usual
practitioner of mass tourism, reflecting what could be termed a parsimonious- tentative

approach to ecological and cultural tourism. Survey respondents appear well-educated and
interested in cultural activities, judiciously favoring a more conservative, but potentially fruitful
development scenario for tourism in Quintana Roo, and willing to contribute both money and
efforts for its realization.
The household survey concerned all the Maya population of the state, with the higher
concentration in the villages touched by tourism activities. Key findings show that most of the
indigenous population is poor or very poor, with high level of unemployment, little involvement
in tourism and, when involved, with meager benefits from low level jobs and precarious
employment. Gender discrimination seems important, but gender roles and weights appear non-
conventional and changing. Even though 80 percent of the men interviewed claimed that they
would not allow women to work, the roles of women in the workforce and in bread winning for
the family appear significant, and characterized by little involvement in agriculture, and a major
presence in commerce and services. Sensitivity to ecological issues seems high and willingness to
pay for a conservation programs is also correspondingly high, on average, even though many of
the respondents believe that conservation should be a prerogative and a responsibility of the
government.
The results from the survey also suggest that the Maya individuals and communities look at
tourism as a potentially very beneficial activity and that they are well inclined, and in many cases,
eager, to participate in ecotourism development. However, the following could potentially
constitute obstacles to the development of a grassroots-based ecological tourism:
   •   The lack of a good health system: for instance, in the small villages, medical facilities are
       closed in the weekend and often also during the week.
   •   The lack of a good educational system (most of the villages only have primary schools)
       and in many cases (such as in Señor) people only speak Maya.
   •   The lack of a good transportation system (some villages can be reached only by taxi or
       private car, such as X-Cabil).
   •   The strong decision power of Farmers’ Councils that decide over land use.
   •   Gender discrimination.
   6.3.3   Other Data Sources

Other data used to estimate the Quintana Roo integrated economic and environmental SAM
were drawn from the following sources:

               1. National Account Data, including a rather aggregate estimate of make and use
                  industrial tables.
               2. The SAM for Mexico from the Global Trade Analysis Project database
               3. An estimate of the state input output table from the University of Quintana
                  Roo
               4. Data from the National Household Survey
               5. Time series statistics of national account, production and consumption data
               6. Aggregate sector data for agriculture, tourism, infrastructure, etc.

Existing data, together with primary data collected by the two field surveys, were used both to
construct the SAM and as baseline inputs to define the alternative scenarios of tourism
development and climate change. The constructed SAM (with a simplified version shown in
Table 6.3) has 29 sectors22 and is calibrated to the year 2010.

The results show a rather sparse matrix, indicating an economy characterized by high import
dependence and low linkages between sectors, including the main drivers of development, such

  The sectors are: Agriculture and fishing (1 sector); Industry (4 sectors); Services (13 sectors); Value Added (Labor
and Capital); Institutions: indigenous (Maya) households, non-indigenous households, domestic tourists,
government, international tourist; Investment and saving; Natural Capital; and Rest of the World.

as tourism, construction, industry and government services. Table 6.4 and Figure 6.1 show the
values of forward and backward linkages. Forward linkages measure the capacity of a sector, as
compared to the average, to participate in a general increase of the whole economy. In turn,
backward linkages measure the capacity of a sector, as compared to the average, to generate a
diffused increase in the rest of the economy. More specifically, the forward linkage measures the
average increase in the activity level (output or income) of one sector as a consequence of a unit
increase in the output of all sectors. The backward linkage measures the increase in the average
output of all sectors as a consequence of a unit increase of the activity level of the sector
considered. In both cases, the measure is transformed into a Rasmussen index by dividing its
values for the overall forward or backward linkage average.

As the analyses show, forward linkages are lower than the average for productive and many
service sectors, but high for some sectors that are linked to traditional tourism, such as hotels
and restaurants. However, they are relatively high for value added from factor income and non-
indigenous households, implying a relatively high degree of inclusion of domestic labor and

capital, and residents in the economy. Indigenous households, on the other hand, seem to have
a very low degree of participation in the market economy, with very high level of exclusion in
terms of upstream activities, such as employment in tourism, transportation and other more
dynamic market activities. Backward linkages, which measure the capacity of each sector to
generate positive spillovers for the economy, are somewhat larger and exceed unity for both
domestic and international tourists.

Table 6.5 and Table 6.6 show the impact multiplier estimates. These can be interpreted as the
result of several policy experiments, where the impact on all sectors and institutions is computed

(along the columns) in response to an exogenous increase in each sector activity or institution of
100 units of production (for sectors) or income (for institutions). The exogenous increases in
sector production can be interpreted as increases in corresponding sector demands, while
institutions’ income increases can be interpreted as increases in remittances from the rest of the
country or the rest of the world (including subsidies), productivity or employment shocks. For
tourists, income increases correspond to increases in preferences (greater number of tourists)
for Quintana Roo and increased willingness to pay per tourist or both. Table 5.5, which reports
the values of the multipliers in response to shocks in employment, sector activities, and tourism,
suggests that the greatest impact is always obtained on the service sector, with the maximum
(340 percent of the shock) obtained from the increase in the income from international tourists.
The largest overall impact (on value added) is from employment (184 percent), followed by an
increase in the activity level of the construction sector and of commerce, which would cause
value added to increase by 127 percent and 121 percent, respectively. As mentioned earlier, the
indigenous population benefits only marginally (if at all) from any of these expansions, which are
mainly appropriated by the non-indigenous population and the government.

Table 6.6 shows the values of similar multipliers, but with the exogenous stimulus applied directly
to the institutions, among which is included natural capital (or “mother nature”) as a sector that
represents natural resources and related activities. An increase in the value of this sector has
indeed the highest multiplier (104 percent) on value added, and a very high one on services
(199 percent) and on non-indigenous households (107 percent). This is a somewhat surprising
result, and is mainly due to the importance of this form of capital in Quintana Roo for activities
such as forestry, fishery, energy and water supply, and even construction and industry. The result
also implies that any deterioration of natural resources due to overexploitation and poor
conservation practices would have large negative consequences for the state economy. The table
also shows that, while the effect of an exogenous income increase of household income on value
added is of the same order of magnitude for both indigenous (82 percent) and non-indigenous
(86 percent) families, the latter are able to appropriate a much larger share of any direct income
increases. Only for an income subsidy paid directly to them, as in the case of the Prospera
program, are the indigenous households able to claim a benefit slightly above 100 percent of the
income transfer. In all other cases, the forward multiplier, which measures their participation in
the case of growing income for government, other households, or natural capital, is under
10 percent.

   6.4      Policy Analysis: Development Scenarios

Three scenarios were developed with the SAM, each representing a different strategy of tourism
and economic development. For each scenario, a simulation was carried out to estimate the
impact of alternative investment patterns. The three scenarios are: (a) Business as Usual (BAU);
(b) Focused Growth; and (c) National Expansion.

The BAU scenario reflects the most recent features of tourism in Quintana Roo, which can be
characterized as slow increases in demand and supply of the traditional forms of tourism. Tourist
expenses tend to decline and mass tourism negatively impacts natural resources (wetland and
forests) by exploiting the ecosystem services, without contributing to conservation and
restoration of natural capital. From the point of view of the rest of the economy, this scenario is
characterized by unchanged production and a slow decrease in value added.

The Focused Growth scenario reflects an increase in mass tourism, with a massive development
of resorts and the associated negative effects on ecosystem services. The growth in the tourism
sector is characterized by foreign tourism, according to the traditional pattern, which is
essentially based on imports. On the economic development side, there is a slow increase in
productivity and in jobs for the local population. Tourist expenses decrease significantly and
households’ consumption slightly decreases.

The National Expansion scenario reflects an economic development focusing on investment in
sustainable tourism, family hotels, and green growth. Investments are projected to enhance
small, local enterprises. Tourism expansion is combined with the development of the local value
chain, with lower contributions from imports. The sustainable character of this type of tourism
supports the development of ecosystem services, with an increase in wetland and forest
conservation. The rest of the economy is characterized by significant increases in local jobs and
services supply, with increases also in tourist expenses and households’ consumption capacity
(Table 6.7).

To simulate the structural effects of the policies embedded in the different scenarios, a
differential reformulation of the linear (Leontief) Input - Output model was used, according to
the following equation:

         Equation 6.1   X  ( I  A*) 1[(A) X  Y ]

Where A and A* are the SAM matrices, respectively, with and without the scenarios’ hypotheses,
and ΔY is the vector of exogenous changes in receipts or expenditure of the capital account
(project intervention or exogenous investment). The hypothetical conditions characterizing each
scenario and the effect of the same investment program within each scenario (Table 6.8) are then
explored, through a SAM simulation according to Equation 6.1. While the change in the SAM
matrix is different for each scenario, the investment program is the same and includes a direct
transfer to households, of US$ 570 million, with the expenditure vector based on several types
of investment projects in the tourism and environmental sectors.

As the results show, each scenario has significantly different implications, resulting in widely
different impacts of the investments made for families, national tourists, and biodiversity, among
other sectors.

Table 6.9 shows the structural shocks resulting from changes in the production and behavioral
coefficients associated with the different scenarios. While the results in Table 6.9 are
independent of a particular investment program and illustrate the overall impact of structural
changes postulated for the three scenarios above, they have an impact on the investment

program through the changes in the coefficients and linkages reflected in the SAM model.
Table 6.10 sums up the total impact divided into medium impact and investment impact for each
scenario, according to Equation 6.1.

The impact of the structural changes shown in Table 6.9 suggests a number of considerations. A
move to the National Expansion scenario appears to perform best in terms of productivity (value
added increase) and is the only change that does not have an adverse effect on biodiversity and
that does increase the incomes of local residents, including poorer indigenous households. In
addition, this structural transformation seems to be consistent with an economic expansion
based on agriculture, construction, and tourism, somewhat at the expense of manufacturing and
other capital intensive activities, such as transportation. These results are confirmed by
considering the effects of structural changes combined with an injection of exogenous resources
(Table 6.10). In the case examined, the move to the National Expansion scenario performs far
better than the changes to the other two scenarios from the perspective of income generation,
income distribution, environmental protection, and tourism promotion.

   6.5     Summary

This chapter has provided an applied analysis of the various economic, social, and environmental
linkages that exist in a small open economy such as Quintana Roo. Using selected primary survey
techniques and existing structural models of the local economy, it permits simulation of
development scenarios using controlled assumptions. Such analyses can also be conducted for
other states in the Yucatán, or the general lessons can be extrapolated and tested in less
quantitative terms through focus groups or targeted surveys. Most notably, the modeling efforts
demonstrate that viable alternatives exist to traditional tourism models. Specifically, a “National
Expansion” scenario contemplates tourism expansion combined with the development of a local
value chain, with lower contributions from imports. It results in increases in value added, and is
the only scenario evaluated that does not have an adverse effect on biodiversity and that does
increase the incomes of local residents, including poorer indigenous households. In brief, the
scenario performs best from the perspective of income generation, income distribution,
environmental protection, and tourism promotion. Such scenario analyses are a powerful tool in
setting priorities and in identifying appropriate policy interventions in the context of coastal
management and planning.

     7. Environmental Impact Assessment for ICZM


     7.1    Introduction

The following chapter seeks to analyze if and how the Mexican Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) process could contribute to integrated coastal zone management and environmentally
sustainable development in coastal and shoreline zones. To that end, the general EIA process in
Mexico will be described shortly, followed by an analysis of recently carried out case studies in
priority sites of the state of Campeche.23 The chapter closes with a discussion on necessary
reforms to the EIA system.

     7.2    EIA in Mexico

Latin American countries have used EIA as an environmental management tool to “control the
environmental impacts of a broad range of projects” (Sánchez-Triana and  Enriquez 2007)
“Through EIA, authorities often establish design and operation conditions that aim to
compensate for the lack of adequate environmental standards” (Sánchez -Triana and  Enriquez
2007). In the region, the responsibility for environmental compliance falls on project developers,
who must meet EIA-related requirements that are evaluated and enforced by the relevant
government authority (Acerbi, et al 2014). The preparation of EIAs is mandatory for specific
actions, usually referred to as projects, activities, or works, among others.

In this regard, Mexico is no exception.24 The overall objective of Mexico’s EIA-system is to protect
the environment, and avoid or reduce negative impacts by setting conditions for infrastructure
projects or activities that could disrupt ecological balance, or violate established limits and
conditions, as set out in the Law and Regulations.25 Hence, EIA is about identifying the potential
environmental effects or impacts of a proposed action, and identifying the necessary corrective
or mitigation measures.

The law and regulations of Mexico contain a list of actions that require an EIA, as well as the
characteristics, circumstances, thresholds, and additional aspects that would trigger the
preparation of an EIA for such actions. These instruments also contemplate special types of
constructions and activities that are excluded by the regulations and therefore by law do not
require an EIA.

Katharina Siegmann.

The supervision of the EIA process is the responsibility of the federal environmental ministry –
SEMARNAT. State and municipal authorities can request the preparation of EIAs for activities that
are not explicitly considered as a responsibility of the Federal government. In addition, the
Federal government can sign agreements with states or municipalities, transferring them
responsibilities for various environmental management responsibilities, including EIA. This is a
logical consequence of the conception of EIA as an environmental management tool, which is
consistent with the perception of EIA in the region as a whole.

There are two types of Environmental Impact Statement (Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental-
MIA): Regional and Particular. Regional MIAs apply to actions with potential regional effects, such
as industrial parks, highways and railways, or projects that would affect a watershed or lead in
any way to the destruction, isolation or fragmentation of ecosystems. The Particular MIA is for
actions triggering an EIA that do not qualify for a Regional MIA. A MIA must be complemented
by a risk study if the action is considered high-risk. Actions may be exempted from the EIA if the
foreseen impacts are already regulated by norms, the works or activities are expressly
contemplated in a regional development or urban development plan approved by SEMARNAT,
or if the facilities will be located within authorized industrial parks. In such cases, the developer
must prepare a Preventive Report (Informe Preventivo-IP).

In addition, there is no formal scoping procedure. The general scope includes consideration of
ecosystems, their preservation and restoration, and protection of the environment.
Environmental forecasts, and identification, description, and evaluation of the following impacts
must be presented: environmental, cumulative, synergistic, significant or relevant, and residual.
Local and regional MIA must include environmental projections and evaluation of alternatives.
The legal framework requires the definition of mitigation measures as part of the EIA, but does
not call for a structured plan or program to ensure that such measures are systematically
integrated into the action’s operation. Specific MIAs must include me asures to prevent and
mitigate impacts. Regional MIA must include strategies to prevent and mitigate impacts
(cumulative and residual) on the regional environment.

The law states that the authorization of works and activities must consider compliance with legal
requirements, urban development and regional development plans, and the existence of natural
protected areas. This is particularly important when it comes to POETs (see chapter 2), which
must be considered if they have been adopted through the official publication of a decree from
the Executive Power of the corresponding jurisdiction.

IP and MIA can be prepared by any individual. Specifically, there is no need to consult with a
registered or specialized firm to elaborate the MIA.

SEMARNAT is required by the law to notify state and local governments when it receives MIAs
for: hazardous or radioactive waste facilities, industrial parks where high-risk activities will be
undertaken, real estate developments that will affect coastal ecosystems, or actions that will
affect natural protected areas under federal jurisdiction. As part of the evaluation of the MIA,
SEMARNAT may request the technical opinion of other public agencies or entities, if required by




                                                 – 78 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
the type of work or activity. However, no concrete rules or procedures are established for these
additional consultations.

SEMARNAT publishes weekly lists of IP and MIAs. Thus, as well as the MIA itself, the files of the
respective MIAs are available to the public. Action developers may request the classification of
information that, if disclosed, could affect industrial property rights or commercial interests.
Public consultations are only carried out under specific circumstances, and specifically only based
on a decision by SEMARNAT whether to carry out a consultation or not and following a request
by a member of an affected community. In special cases, public meetings are held for information
and feedback. Hence, there is no general consultation process for MIA.

Finally, the Federal Environmental Attorney (PROFEPA) must inspect and monitor compliance
with regulations and environmental authorizations. PROFEPA can require responsible parties to
present information on compliance with environmental provisions.

   7.3     EIA in coastal zones

First and foremost, there are no specific sectorial or regional provisions when it comes to content
and studies for MIAs. Thus, any MIA follows the general rules and procedures established by the
law and regulations regarding those terms. Thus, for the purpose of this analysis, two field sides
in the state of Campeche were chosen – a touristic and fishery coastal area, Sabancuy
(Figure 7.1), and one of the Yucatán Peninsula’s most important ports, Seybaplaya (Figure 7.2).

The EIAs presented for these regions during the last 10 years were consulted and those that
specifically referred to interventions on the shoreline were thoroughly analyzed. EIAs for projects
inland, offshore or with no implication to the shoreline, such as developments within the port,
were excluded from the analysis. The case studies are therefore based on the MIAs for three
projects in Sabancuy and two projects in Seybaplaya that aim at:

   a) Dredging of the channel that connects Sabancuy with the Gulf of Mexico to assure secure
      waterways for fishermen and ships;
   b) Avoid coastal erosion in the intervention zone through hard infrastructure; and
   c) Interventions to the port, including land reclamation and breakwaters.
Specifically, in the case of dredging projects, the commercial use of the dredged materials was
explicitly mentioned in the EIAs, highlighting the commercial interest associated with this activity.

It should be noted that all MIAs analyzed were approved by SEMARNAT. Thus, they provide an
opportunity to evaluate if the projects managed to achieve their overall objectives and whether
and how they contributed to a sustainable shoreline development. The results of the analysis
shed light on the potential role of EIA as an ICZM tool.

The main results of the analysis are outlined below.
   7.3.1   Regional vs. specific MIA.

Beside the provision in the legal framework for regional MIAs, all proponents presented specific
project-based MIAs for their interventions. Table 7.1 shows the marginal differences in the
content of regional and specific MIAs. However, it can be assumed that specifically the definition
of the environmental system would be quiet different considering a regional rather than a
specific MIA. Logically, the definition of the environmental systems leads to different
perspectives on environmental problems, possible project impacts, and even the applicable legal
instruments on territory and urban planning.

Considering that Campeche’s coast lacks a regional POET (Chapter 2 provides more details), there
seems to be no regional focus when it comes to interventions on the coastline. The same can be
assumed for Quintana Roo, where only the region of Sian Ka’an, a national protected area, is
covered by a regional POET. Only Yucatán state presents a state-wide regional coastal POET.
While it is assumed that such regional POET contributes to an ICZM focus, a specific analysis
should be carried out to prove that assumption.

Currently, regional MIAs are only required for eleven categories of projects, which include
industrial or aquaculture parks, aquaculture farms of more than 500 hectares, and specific types
of infrastructure (dams, nuclear power plants, roads, and railways). Regional MIAs are also
required for projects that might alter watersheds, for POETs and PDUs, and for groups or projects
or activities that would be developed in a determined ecological region. In addition, a regional
MIA would be required for projects that would be developed in sites where cumulative,
synergistic, or residual impacts are likely and could result in the destruction, isolation, or
fragmentation of ecosystems. Available information suggests that projects developed in coastal
areas would fall under the last category, but that SEMARNAT has only required project
developers to elaborate project-based (specific) MIAs.
   7.3.2   Environmental system and scope of data analyzed to determine environmental
           impact.

The analysis showed that while the MIAs referred to the same geographic area, the
environmental system described in each of them was very different. This appears to be a result
of the lack of specific guidelines or requirements that project developers need to adhere to when
describing the environmental system for the intervention zone.

In addition, the identification, description and evaluation of the environmental impacts that are
expected as a result of the proposed project were carried out mostly based on regional data and
existing sources. This is a cause of concern, particularly as all MIAs were presented as specific,
and not regional, MIAs. None of the project developers gathered specific in situ data. Hence, the
underlying data regarding climate, geomorphology, tide, wind, waves, flora, and fauna, among

others, are rather general and taken from existing studies and sources. Table 7.2 indicates the
detailed analysis of the data presented for the MIAs.

Overall, the information presented in the MIA is considered deficient in all cases, including both
project-specific and regional information.

Moreover, project developers do not report – prior to project implementation or as a long term
monitoring measure – the installation of any oceanographic equipment that would measure the
daily variation in sea level, wind, waves and / or currents. Neither do they gather specific field
data to quantify the variation in the characteristics of the sand and the respective beach profiles.

As mentioned above, secondary regional data constitutes the main information that support the
evaluated MIAs. This is a cause of concern, particularly when taking into account the coastal
zone’s changing environmental and climate conditions, as well as its complex structure. Specific
in situ measurement and modeling is required to analyze the possible externalities within the
regional environmental systems, a thorough analysis of interactions among all indicators that
affect the shoreline, and the long term effects of hard infrastructure development in the coastal
region.
   7.3.3   Experts that elaborate the study.

The Mexican regulatory framework allows anybody to elaborate a MIA, regardless of the
complexity of the proposed intervention zone or the project itself. There is no list of registered
or recognized specialists for certain project categories.

In the case of the MIAs analyzed for this report, none of them involved a consultancy firm
specialized in coastal zones. Only one MIA – for the port of Seyplaya – was reviewed by an
independent research institute. In two cases where the project proponent is a public entity – port
authority and Ministry of Transport – the developer itself elaborated the MIA without hiring
external specialists for the study.

In addition, SEMARNAT’s procedures to evaluate complex projects are not known outside of the
agency. The Secretary can only reject MIAs when: (i) development of the activity or project would
violate existing laws or other legal instruments; (ii) the activity or project would endanger species
or affect already threatened species; or (iii) it is based on false information. Under any other
circumstances, SEMARNAT is legally mandated to authorize the project, although in doing so,
SEMARNAT does have the power to modify the project or condition the approval on the adoption
of additional prevention and mitigation measures. The process used to identify such additional
measures or project modifications is not transparent, and the public has no means other than
SEMARNAT’s resolution to better understand, for example, whether an inter-disciplinary team
was involved in evaluating the MIAs for complex projects, or whether the effectiveness and
efficiency of the additional mitigation measures required by the Secretary are well known.

   7.3.4   Inter-institutional and public consultation.

In compliance with the law, SEMARNAT consulted the project proposals and respective
environmental studies with state and municipal authorities. However, it is not clear based on
which criteria SEMARNAT requests the technical opinion of other public agencies or entities. No
concrete rules or procedures are established by law for these additional consultations. In
addition, SEMARNAT has absolute discretion to accept or reject the opinions or
recommendations provided by any of the consulted agencies. The analyzed MIAs do not bring
clarity to that. In the Sabancuy region, SEMARNAT consulted the Commission for National
Protected Areas for at least one of the MIAs; however, such consultation did not take place for
the other project proposals. Additional technical feedback by institutions like the Navy
(Secretaría de Marina), the Ministry for Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and
Food, the National Commission for Biodiversity Knowledge and Use, public universities and
investigation centers, among others, could have provided additional technical elements to
evaluate the environmental studies underpinning the MIA.

Public consultation is crucial to EIA, particularly given that one of the main goals of EIA is to open
up environmental decision-making to public scrutiny (Ortolano et al., 1987; Sánchez-Triana and
Ortolano, 2001). However, SEMARNAT did not organize a public consultation for any of the MIAs
evaluated in this case study. SEMARNAT’s decisions were based on the regulatory framework
currently in place, under which public consultations are only held under specific circumstances.
Specifically, SEMARNAT must decide whether or not to organize such consultations based on an
explicit request by an affected community, which was not the case in any of the cases under
review. In the absence of public consultations, civil society, research institutions, experts and
NGOs can only learn about a project based on the very short summary that is published in
SEMARANT’s weekly Environmental Gazette.
   7.3.5   Access to information.

In two out of five reviewed cases, the proposed project’s information that must be publicly
available (the environmental impact study and SEMARNAT’s final decision on the MIA, including
the additional requirements on which the approval is conditioned) was incomplete. Specifically,
SEMARNAT’s final decision, with the conditions under which an approval was issued, was missing.

This situation demonstrates the authority’s lack of compliance with existing legal provisions; it
also makes it very hard for stakeholders and other interested parties to fully understand a project
proposal, related environmental studies, and the conditions under which the project must be
developed and operated.

   1. Conditions and follow up.
Project proponents must propose prevention and mitigation measures for environmental
impacts as part of the MIA. The analysis showed that these very proposals then end up being the
conditions under which SEMARNAT approves the MIA, and therefore, the implementation of the
project. In a few cases, other consulted public entities proposed additional conditions. However,
the present analysis finds that this is more an exception than a rule. Thus, MIAs lack objective


                                                 – 86 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
and independently defined conditions to ensure environmentally sustainable project
implementation.

In addition, there is no record on any follow up of these conditions. This would include systematic
monitoring of their compliance as a responsibility of the proponent, and field visits by authorities
responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements established by SEMARNAT,
particularly the Federal Environmental Attorney (PROFEPA).

   2. Reactive vs. proactive environmental management.
The five proposed projects that were reviewed for this analysis aimed, directly or as a co-benefit,
at solving a shoreline problem, mainly coastal erosion.

These cases highlight the role of EIA as an instrument for reactive environmental management,
which generates ad-hoc responses associated with specific projects. In other words, EIAs are not
conducive to addressing large scale environmental challenges proactively, such as shoreline
erosion.

The effectiveness of EIA can be further questioned based on physical observations of the
shorelines where interventions were implemented with SEMARNAT’s authorization. Specifically,
although the reviewed projects included actions to protect the shoreline, satellite images depict
a considerable loss of beach cover in both areas, but more clearly in Sabancuy (Figure 7.3 and
Figure 7.4). (

      7.4     Economic Instruments & ICZM26

There are a number of general economic principles that form the background philosophy for an
economically and environmentally sustainable strategy for natural resource management. These
principles are also often cited within the context of ICZM initiatives. The two most often
enunciated include the polluter-pays and precautionary principles. The polluter-pays (or user-
pays) principle assigns rights that allow internalization of costs that would not normally be
incurred by the polluter or user (externalities). The precautionary principle provides a mechanism
for dealing with the uncertainty of impacts (Perrings 1991; O’Riordan and Cameron 1994).

A number of mechanisms have been developed and used to promote these principles. At one
extreme they include fines or sanctions that are linked to traditional command-and-control (CAC)
regulations. At the other extreme they include laissez-faire approaches that require consumer
advocacy or private litigation to act as incentives for improving environmental management. In
between are the more familiar tax-and-subsidy approaches as well as the less familiar
mechanisms relying on traded property rights. All of these approaches attempt to internalize
environmental costs of natural resource use.

There is no single standardized definition of an incentive-based or “market”-based instrument
(MBI), but the commonly held understanding and the definition employed here is that an MBI
must, foremost, attempt to align private costs with social costs to reduce externalities
(Panayotou 1994, 1995). Within this definition, the particular strength of an MBI then depends
on the degree of flexibility that a polluter or resource user has in achieving a given environmental
target. A very “weak” MBI essentially dictates through regulation the type of technologies that
firms must use, or the targets they must meet. This is the inflexible Command and Control (CAC)
approach – which also entails an economic incentive to the extent that failure to comply can
result in monetary sanctions. A very “strong” MBI allows market signals rather than explicit
directives determine the best way to meet a given standard or goal. Environmental Impact
Assessments (EIA) and their associated regulatory structures, sanctions and fines are typically
regarded as part of a CAC approach.

Flexibility is operationalized by equating it to the level of decentralization that occurs in
transferring social (or state) decisions to the private (individual) level. A strong MBI decentralizes
decision-making to a degree that the polluter or resource user has a maximum amount of
flexibility to select the production or consumption option that minimizes the social cost of
achieving a particular level of environmental quality; profit- or utility-maximizing behavior in this
case also generates a “lowest social cost” outcome for the achievement of a given policy
objective.

The framework presented here focuses on the cost-effectiveness of reducing externalities in
defining an MBI. This interpretation provides scope both for internalizing the costs or benefits of

any externality while allowing the freedom of choice that will permit users to select an
appropriate technology for optimizing environmental quality.

Table 7.3 illustrates the broad spectrum of instruments that might be available, all of which
implicitly or explicitly have some incentive effect. They fall across a continuum ranging from very
strict command approaches to decentralized approaches that rely more on market or legal
mechanisms. Even traditional CAC regulations, with heavy fines, create a presumed incentive
effect because the resource user would be compelled to comply with the regulations to avoid the
sanctions.

    7.4.1      Goals of Incentive-Based Instruments

In principle, there is a wide range of methods available for attempting to regulate or manage
environmental quality. Each of these intends to address a variety of goals. One goal associated
with decentralized decision-making relates to cost-effectiveness. The asymmetry of information,
for example, often implies that individual agents, private firms, or community associations are
more likely than governments to identify the most cost-effective means for achieving a given
environmental goal, such as less water withdrawal, less water pollution, or more forest coverage.
This forms the basis for the common theoretical result that – if one focuses entirely on private
costs – strong forms of MBIs are more cost effective than their weaker counterparts or than CAC
approaches (Tietenberg 1990).

Another fundamental goal of most environmental regulatory systems is to decrease externalities.
Externalities exist where the agent making the production or consumption decision does not bear
all of the costs or benefits of this decision. Externalities abound in environmental issues. Disposal
of industrial effluent into a waterway may be a low-cost solution to waste disposal for the
polluter, but firms and individuals downstream may suffer consequences through higher costs
from lost fishery production, higher water treatment costs, lower amenity values (for recreation),
or loss of critical drinking water supplies. Most economic incentive structures attempt to transfer
some of this cost back to the individual responsible for the decision. A similar situation could exist
with environmentally beneficial decisions: a firm that cleans polluted intake water and then
discharges clean water after using it in its internal process would, in fact, be creating a positive
externality, and in such cases it could be argued that it is optimal to provide subsidies to such a
firm in direct proportion to the value of this external benefit.

A third goal that many policymakers have when designing an appropriate economic incentive
system is revenue generation. There are, however, practical tradeoffs to consider between
revenue generation and incentive effects. For example, it would be possible to levy a very high
charge that effectively discourages all polluting activity. Abatement levels would be very high in
such a case, but no revenue would be generated. Similarly, very low charges would generate little
revenue and generate little abatement because there is no incentive for firms to reduce pollution.
Typically, revenue is maximized at some intermediate level of abatement. A policy decision must
be made relating to how much additional revenue (beyond the maximum) a government is willing
to give up to generate higher levels of abatement. The answer to this policy question should be
related to the marginal benefits of pollution abatement, but in fact it typically is more a function
of government budgetary realities that regard such taxes as a convenient means for underwriting
environmental management efforts.
    7.4.2      Types of Incentive-Based Instruments.

Regulations, Fines, and Penalties
Centralized control-oriented approaches relying extensively on regulatory guidelines, permits, or
licenses have traditionally been the preferred mechanisms for controlling environmental impacts


                                                 – 92 –               Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
in urban areas. Although it is technically simple to impose regulations with specific fines for
noncompliance, the problems associated with implementing them and achieving compliance are
for many developing countries insurmountable.

First, “regulatory drag” can occur when the regulatory approval system, because it is
overburdened, unnecessarily holds up critically important investments, and in so doing acts as a
drag on economic development prospects. Second, the capacity to implement regulations is
often limited because of inadequate human resources, or inadequate supportive infrastructure
such as environmental information or monitoring networks. Third, local financing constraints
arise because authority for environmental regulations is often delegated to lower (local) levels of
government without adequate sources of financing for implementing and monitoring the
regulations. Fourth, conflicting standards often prevail where individual ministries or
departments have been responsible for setting environmental regulations within their own
departments; lack of coordination often leads to conflicting or overlapping regulations. This is
often most pronounced for water-related issues because of the numerous stakeholders involved
in water use. Finally, conflict of interest within government programs exists where government
agencies are themselves the implementing or investing authority; self-regulation becomes
problematic under such circumstances and seldom are there built-in incentives to ensure
compliance. This is especially a problem with common infrastructure facilities that typically are a
government mandate.

User Charges and Taxes (or Subsidies)
Some of the greatest opportunities for improved environmental management include those
arising from appropriate market-oriented instruments. The application of these mechanisms
typically has a number of goals. First, incentive effects which provide economic reasons for
polluters or resource users to lower their impacts are reflected in user charges for typical
infrastructure services such as sanitation and water provision. Incentives can also be used to
affect intermodal choices: environmental taxes on fuels can discourage private automobile use,
and concomitantly reduce demand for complementary public goods such as roads. Second,
market-oriented approaches can be used as a recurrent revenue base; this is especially important
where local institutions are expected to be financially autonomous, or are required to fund
selected regulatory functions. An important variant of the user charge is a “presumptive tax.”
The basis of the tax is an effluent charge that is sensitive to a presumed level of pollution. A firm
is compelled to pay the tax, and no specific monitoring is conducted. If the firm wishes to reduce
its tax burden, it must conduct monitoring at its own expense (but still subject to regulatory audit)
to demonstrate that its actual pollution loads are less than the presumed loads. Subsidies can
also be used as an economic incentive for environmental management. Subsidies on
environmentally appropriate behavior are analytically identical to taxes on inappropriate
behavior. Such subsidies have been especially common in developing countries for the
importation of pollution control technologies or for credit subsidies where the credit is used for
environmental investments.

Market Creation (Permits and Deposit-Refund)




                                                 – 93 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
At a more complex level, market-oriented approaches can include some form of market creation.
The most complex system involves tradable permits where user/polluter rights are assigned,
according to a desirable total level of use or pollution, and compliance is achieved by trade. One
potential advantage of such systems is that they may reduce bureaucracy and government
participation in the process. Such decentralization of decision-making is particularly important in
high growth economies where regulatory drag might otherwise be a problem. Another
potentially important type of market creation involves reform of property rights to confer some
form of property right (either individual or collective) in areas of environmental sensitivity. The
right holder then has the incentive to manage resource use sustainably, and the legal right to
seek compensation from agents that benefit from the resource. Deposit-refund systems are also
based on a market created to buy back sources of solid wastes. These have been used extensively
to promote recycling. Such schemes are also appropriate for difficult problems such as toxic and
hazardous waste management.

Market Creation (Payment for Ecosystem Services PES)
The PES approach to environmental protection entails the creation of arrangements where
individuals or communities are paid to undertake actions that increase the levels of ecosystem
services desired by those who stand to benefit from those services. The Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) is perhaps the most well known such arrangement that facilitates the
payment by the global community for carbon emission reductions, to those providing the
emission-reduction ecosystem service. PES policies are a growing trend because they offer a
direct and possibly poverty-alleviating method for achieving environmental objectives. However,
transaction costs of implementation, monitoring and enforcement can be high if the large
number of agents is high such as when there are many individual landowners whose collective
action threatens certain ecosystem services.

Final Demand Intervention (Eco-labeling, Disclosure Requirements, or Environmental
Awareness)
Eco-labeling to promote environmentally sound production and packaging is a relatively passive
form of intervention; it decentralizes decision-making to the final consumer. A more aggressive
form involves promulgating disclosure requirements: firms are required to publish precisely what
they pollute. There are no sanctions attached to such disclosure but consumers are then given
the choice of how to deal with the products of particular firms. Another example of education
and awareness building, targeted to industries, is the UNIDO waste minimization program that
assists in identifying appropriate technologies for specific plant and industry types. The programs
typically improve energy and material efficiency for plants, while at the same time reducing waste
generation. All such interventions can effectively reduce urban infrastructure requirements,
improve environmental quality, and have important spin-offs in other social sectors. Their major
disadvantage is that they typically require some form of subsidy.

Final Demand Intervention (Supply-chain Management)
Related to eco-labeling, firms are increasingly sensitive about the environmental and social
context in which their suppliers operate. In such cases, firms downstream in the supply chain
intervene in the upstream production processes of their intermediate products by insisting that


                                                – 94 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
certain environmental protection activities are undertaken in during production. These types of
interventions have resulted in upstream firms installing pollution control equipment to satisfy
their buyers’ sourcing criteria.

Liability Legislation
Litigation-oriented approaches to environmental management require only that legislation be in
place that confers relatively straightforward rights and obligations to resource users. These
approaches form a legal umbrella for court cases, which then consider the nature and extent of
environmental damages on a case-by-case basis. Most of these approaches are relatively new,
and have seen very limited application in developing countries (quite often because legal systems
are themselves weak in such countries). Even in industrial countries they are hampered by the
analytical difficulties of establishing cause and effect, or of ascribing blame or negligence.

One significant objection to using litigation-oriented mechanisms is neither environmental nor
economic: it is social. Because such systems assume that all have equal access to the courts, the
mechanisms often discriminate against the poor and others with limited access to legal recourse.
   7.4.3     Lessons & Implications for ICZM

In each of the cases considered, there is usually both an incentive element as well as a control
element. Simply stated, there is no getting around the classic “carrot and stick.” Experience with
these types of mechanisms around the world has shown that they have different advantages and
disadvantages, and that depending on the goals of the government, some mechanisms are better
than others. The following general conclusions can be drawn from this experience:

        Systems based solely on control-oriented approaches impose high private costs and often
         are not enforceable given existing institutional capacity. The current EIA system in Mexico
         also exhibits these characteristics.
        Litigation-oriented approaches require the development of a strong legal system to which
         all members of society have equal access.
        Market-oriented instruments allow polluters and resource users to find their own best mix
         of controls or responses, and therefore result in lower private costs than other approaches.
        Local authorities and strong institutional support play an important role in the success of
         market-oriented mechanisms.
In the context of ICZM, the complexity of problems and issues does not always lend itself to a
single approach. Indeed, even CAC systems benefit from complementary market-based
approaches, legal relief through publicly accessible regulatory and court processes, and voluntary
mechanisms by industries that meet local social and environmental goals while also contributing
to cost-effective operations. An appropriate way forward for EIA reforms is to identify and
implement such complementary market-based approaches.

   7.5       Summary

Mexico’s legal framework and practice are not suited to support comprehensive environmental
management. This becomes particularly clear when assessing EIA in coastal zones. Arguably, from



                                                    – 95 –            Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
its conception, EIA was not meant to be the predominant environmental management tool, but
to complement other legal, economic, and administrative instruments by opening up
environmental authorities’ decision making to public scrutiny, particularly in relation to projects
likely to cause significant environmental impacts (Acerbi et al, 2014). However, in Mexico, as in
other countries, EIA has become the main environmental management tool and is often the only
instrument used to address complex environmental problems, as exemplified by coastal zone
management in Campeche.

In the reviewed cases, EIA practice had a number of limitations, including inadequate scoping,
elaboration of environmental impact studies based on incomplete data, insufficient participation
from external experts in the preparation and evaluation of the MIA, faulty public participation,
absence of clear criteria to evaluate the MIA, and weak enforcement and follow-up to ensure
that the project developer complies with all the requirements established by SEMARNAT during
the EIA process.

Part of the difficulties for the better use of EIA stem from the existing legal framework. On one
hand, the laws and regulations include a large number of activities for which an EIA must be
undertaken. On the other hand, SEMARNAT is required to approve all MIAs, unless they fall under
the specific circumstances mentioned above. As a result, SEMARNAT receives a very large
number of MIAs every year, which it has to evaluate under tight deadlines. As a rough
comparison, in Mexico an average of 2,786 projects per year were submitted to the EIA process
between 2008 and 2012, compared with an average of 463 projects per year in the United
States27 The resources and time that SEMARNAT has available for each of these projects is
limited, curtailing opportunities to engage other agencies, external specialists, or the public. Lack
of resources is also a constraint to conduct field visits for supervision and enforcement.

As in Mexico, most countries in Latin America use lists to determine which projects or activities
are subject to an EIA (Acerbi et al, 2014). The existence of such lists is supposed to reduce
discretionary decision-making. However, they generate a different problem: the rigidity of the
lists limits their ability to filter out the actions that would not generate significant environmental
effects. Lists are also used to determine whether a regional or a specific MIA should be prepared.
In the specific case of coastal areas, only large aquaculture projects would call for a regional MIA.
Other cases that would trigger the preparation of a regional MIA include projects with potential
synergistic, cumulative, or residual impacts on ecosystems. However, there is a dearth of
methodologies, guidelines, and regulations that guide effective cumulative and synergistic
impact assessments. Arguably, many projects in coastal areas would likely have cumulative or
synergistic impacts. However, as the reviewed cases show, the EIA for projects in the coast of
Campeche did not need to address these types of impacts.

EIA’s potential contributions to ICZM are also limited because of insufficient involvement of
independent domestic or international experts, which is not required under the regulatory

framework in place. In addition, project developers are responsible for hiring the consultant who
prepares the EIA, resulting in a clear conflict of interests. Developers’ main interests are meeting
the bare minimum legal requirements and overcoming any potential objections to the project.
Consultants thus have incentives to focus on these objectives, rather than on conducting rigorous
environmental studies (Acerbi et al, 2014).

Public participation can add value to the EIA process by making visible the problems, constraints,
opportunities, and challenges that tended to be hidden by limited screening, scoping, and
environmental impact study preparation stages. However, public hearings are often resource-
intensive and, if not properly organized, can easily turn into a community’s opportunity to voice
demands for issues with little or no relationship to the project (Acerbi et al, 2014). Clearly
regulating the public hearings process, as well as complying with other provisions aiming to
facilitate public participation, such as ensuring that the relevant information is publicly available,
could strengthen EIA practice in Mexico.

One of the fundamental contributions of EIA is the identification of mitigation measures that can
be implemented to avoid, minimize, or offset the negative effects associated with the proposed
project. For this reason, the EIA process includes a follow-up mechanism that would ideally help
authorities to ensure that the conditions for approval are fulfilled, to monitor whether the
action’s environmental impacts are similar to those predicted by the environmental impact study,
to assess whether the selected mitigation measures are effective, and to generate information
to improve other EIAs.

In Mexico, as in other countries, environmental authorities rarely monitor the action’s impacts
after the corresponding license or permit has been issued, mainly due to lack of resources
(Sánchez-Triana and Enríquez, 2007). Exploring mechanisms to increase the resources available
to environmental agencies, such as including the cost of supervision in the fees paid by
developers, is therefore crucial to improve EIA’s effectiveness.

   8. Conclusions

Approximately 4.1 million people live in the three coastal states of the Yucatán Peninsula:
Quintana Roo, Yucatán, and Campeche. Some 30 municipalities from these states are in a coastal
territory of almost 2,000 kilometers, spanning the oil fields of the Gulf of Mexico to the world
renowned beaches of Cancun and Cozumel, just north of the second largest barrier reef in the
world. The peninsula’s natural assets also include some of the nation’ s most notable cultural
assets – Mayan temples including Chichén Itzá, Ek Balám, Uxmal and Dzibilchaltún.

With poverty far from eliminated, and economic development opportunities beckoning in
agriculture, manufacturing and hydrocarbon development, the region is under growing risks to
environmental hazards. Oil spills, hurricanes, coral bleaching, extreme flooding and erosion have
all been experienced in this region over the past decade. The analytical work presented in this
report indicates that environmental health risks also impose substantial economic costs on the
region and curtail the local population’s opportunities for economic advancement. The main
environmental health risks in the peninsula result in more than 1,000 premature deaths every
year and in more than 9.36 million days lost to illnesses. In addition to pain and suffering, these
risks also generate substantial economic losses, representing 2.2-3.3 percent of GRI.

In terms of health impacts in the peninsula, household air pollution is the most severe problem,
followed by outdoor air pollution; these two types of air pollution are responsible for around 80%
of deaths associated with an environmental health risk. Adult lead (Pb) exposure and inadequate
water, sanitation and hygiene caused 13% and 7% of these deaths, respectively. From an
economic standpoint, lead exposure is the cause of 48 percent of the cost of environmental
degradation, mostly because it results in impaired intelligence in children and a consequent
reduction in lifetime earnings. About 26 percent of the cost is from household air pollution, 16
percent is from outdoor air pollution, and 10 percent of the cost is from inadequate water,
sanitation and hygiene.

This report has also presented estimates of the economic impacts of natural disasters under
climate change. Available data show upward trends in terms of both the frequency and severity
of natural resources in the Yucatan Peninsula, particularly since 1985. These trends are expected
to continue in the future. If the peninsula’s economy were to grow 2 -3 percent annually, the
annual mean economic cost of extreme weather events (ordinary events) would be about 0.4
percent of GDP. This figure is about double the annual cost of natural disasters for Mexico as a
whole (Golub, 2014). However, in the 95th percentile (when the damages would be highest) this
cost could reach 1.4-1.5 percent of GDP in 2020 and 1.6-2.3 percent of GDP in 2050 (Gobierno de
Yucatán, 2012). These figures underscore the urgency of reducing vulnerability through
appropriate emergency preparedness, risk mitigation, and ICZM efforts. Adaptation
interventions in the Yucatan Peninsula should consider both relatively infrequent, but
catastrophic events, and events with less severe impacts, but that occur frequently.

The three states in the Yucatán Peninsula share a common geography and to a certain extent,
development challenges such as climate change. While there are important socio-economic



                                                – 98 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
differences between the states, coastal ecosystems provide fundamental ecosystem services for
all of them, including protection from extreme weather events and resources that underpin their
economic activities. However, as discussed in this report, coastal ecosystems face a number of
challenges, including severe erosion and impacts from unplanned urban expansion,
infrastructure development, and significant pollution. These challenges are likely to be
exacerbated as a result of climate change, particularly if current environmental degradation
trends continue, thereby eroding the resilience of natural ecosystems.

A major obstacle to confront these challenges is the lack of an adequate institutional framework.
In Mexico, coastal management is undertaken largely through three policy instruments:
(i) Environmental Impact Assessment; (ii) the creation of Marine Protected Zones; and
(iii) ecological zoning. Lack of coordination and institutional capacity has hampered the
effectiveness of these instruments. However, these instruments are also insufficient to tackle the
coastal area’s priority issues, including sea level rise and coastal erosion.

The analytical work presented in this report included the preparation of case studies to better
understand the role of EIA in supporting management of coastal zones. In the reviewed cases,
EIA practice had a number of limitations, including inadequate scoping, elaboration of
environmental impact studies based on incomplete data, insufficient participation from external
experts in the preparation and evaluation of the MIA, faulty public participation, absence of clear
criteria to evaluate the MIA, and weak enforcement and follow-up to ensure that the project
developer complies with all the requirements established by SEMARNAT during the EIA process.

Arguably, part of the problem is that EIA has become the predominant environmental
management tool in Mexico. An average of 2,786 projects per year were submitted to the EIA
process in Mexico between 2008 and 2012.28 As a result of this extensive use of EIA, SEMARNAT
establishes ad hoc requirements for each authorized project, which PROFEPA is unable to
supervise or enforce due to lack of resources. Given that EIA is aimed at opening up
environmental authorities’ decision making to public scrutiny, particularly in relation to projects
likely to cause significant environmental impacts, it is necessary to further evaluate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the EIA process.

The main ecological planning instruments in Mexico are Territorial Environmental Land Use
Programs (POETs) and Urban Development Plans (PDUs). Both POETs, PDUs are sometimes
hampered by a lack of technical and institutional capacity within local and municipal
governments for overseeing the complex tasks involved in assessing environmental needs,
setting priorities, and building consensus among stakeholders (Hardoy et al., 2014; Creel, 2005).
There is also a certain level of unwieldiness to the creation of a POET. They are developed through
a participatory process managed by a consultant, which means that one stakeholder can throw
up significant roadblocks. Because of this, the resulting agreements tend not to be as strong as
would be desired. In addition, to have legal validity, POETs must be approved by a decree from
the authority at the competent level (e.g. federal, state, or municipal). To date, there have been

no rigorous attempts to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the preparation and
enforcement of POETs, most of which lack an appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework
(INE, 2012).

In the Yucatán peninsula there are three regional and ten municipal POETs.29 However some large
areas are yet to be covered by a POET; specifically, Campeche’s coastal zone lacks a regional
POET, and in Quintana Roo, only the Sian Ka’an region is covered by a regional POET. Within the
Yucatan Peninsula, only Yucatan’s coast is entirely covered by a regional program. In fact, most
of Mexico’s coastal zones lack a POET. These plans, however, are a valuable consensus-making
tool and provide one of the best ways of formalizing the agreements that need to be made if
various municipalities, states, and ministries are going to work together.

An effective approach to address coastal management issues would be to develop a Shoreline
Management Plan (SMP), setting out how the coast should best be managed in the future. The
development of a sediment budget is a critical stage in the development of the conceptual model
for the plan. A major obstacle that needs to be overcome to establish this sediment budget is the
lack of information that would facilitate building up a composite map of sediment sources, sinks,
stores and pathways. Since predicting future coastal change is the end product of the study, the
changes in wave or tidal energy, the sources and sinks for sediment, and human inhibition of
sediment movement all contribute to coastal morphological change and form the basis for the
conceptual model. Thus the conceptual modelling stage of the SMP must depend on the collation
of an adequate database. The governments of the Yucatán Peninsula would benefit from
establishing an institutional framework that would allow collection of the required primary and
secondary data.

Another priority challenge for the Yucatán Peninsula’s coastal areas is the lack of sustainability
of the tourism model that has driven economic growth, particularly in Quintana Roo. This
represents an important case of an economy whose development has been led by the expansion
of the tourist industry organized around the traditional model of the tourist enclave and beach
resort concentration. Deteriorating environmental conditions and changing international trends
combined with climate change threats have made this tradition obsolete as a model of industrial
organization, and increasingly unreliable as an engine of sustainable development. Moreover,
the model has excluded local populations, particularly indigenous households, from its economic
benefits.

Because of its riches in terms of natural beauty, cultural heritage and human potential, Quintana
Roo appears particularly apt to accept the challenge of converting its economy toward the new
type of tourism, based on lower scale development, devoted to the ecological and cultural
aspects of the visitors’ experience, higher social and economic inclusion, and a more integrated
economic structure. The SAM developed as part of the analytical work helped to explore and test
these hypotheses, on the basis of available statistics and the results of two field surveys
conducted on a sample of international and national tourists and of local households,
respectively.

The analysis conducted seems to corroborate the hypothesis that Quintana Roo can develop its
economy at a faster pace and with a more balanced growth by differentiating its development
model by: (i) re-balancing the spatial pattern of development through land use planning and
regulation, with special attention to the control of the urban sprawl and conservation of the
coastal ecosystem (ii) promoting small scale development of the tourism supply chain more
widely, based on local entrepreneurship and small and specialized operators; (iii) investing in
environmental and of biodiversity conservation; (iv) investing in tourism development, through
basic infrastructure (water, sanitation, feeder roads) and non-basic infrastructure (access and
maintenance of archaeological sites, parks, museums), not only in proximity to the beaches and
seafronts, but also in the forest and wetland areas; and (v) encouraging the involvement of the
indigenous population in the various segments of the tourism supply chain, including agriculture,
transportation, lodging, and tourism operations.

   8.1     Next steps

This report has highlighted the need to fill scientific knowledge gaps and to develop a strong
knowledge base that can inform decision-making and lead to an integrated coastal zone
management, resulting in enhanced environmental, economic, and social resilience in the
Yucatán Peninsula. In addition, this report’s findings provide compelling arguments to develop
specific interventions to tackle the obstacles to green and inclusive growth faced by the Yucatán
Peninsula.

A major obstacle to confront the peninsula’s development challenges is the lack of a formal
priority setting mechanism and an adequate institutional framework to align available resources
with the most pressing environmental challenges. Using rigorous priority-setting tools, such as
the cost of environmental degradation study presented in this report, is an important step to fill
this gap. Once environmental priorities have been set, institutional resources should be aligned
to address them, and if needed, policies or regulations should be adopted or reformed to
efficiently and effectively tackle the issues that are causing the most severe damages. Monitoring
and evaluation systems should also be strengthened to assess the extent to which the objectives
of environmental priorities are being met. Accumulation of data, results, and experiences in
policy design and implementation should be integrated into the M&E systems to support
continuous social learning that underpins further policy improvements.

As explained in Chapter 3, the existing regulatory toolkit is inadequate to promote ICZM in the
Yucatán Peninsula. Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) are a proven approach to achieve long
term sustainability of coastal risk management for a specific stretch of coast. Developing an SMP
includes five main tasks: (i) definition of sediment cells as the basic unit for coastal zone
management; (ii) collation of a coastal data base designed to support the science within the SMP;
(iii) development of conceptual (or behavioral) models for each sediment cell; (iv) evaluation of
societal demands on the coast; and (v) reconciliation of scientific and societal demands within
the SMP framework.

In order to conduct these tasks, the next steps should focus on the collection, storage, and
retrieval of coastal data that can be used to develop the conceptual models of the coast. Data


                                               – 101 –          Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
should be acquired from both primary and secondary sources. The advantage of using secondary
data is that it can reduce both costs and time; however, in many cases secondary data sources
are either lacking or inadequate.

The existing database for the Yucatán Peninsula is not considered adequate to support any
detailed shoreline management. What limited data is available is focused on local issues at scales
significantly smaller than those of the sediment cells outlined in Chapter 3. This means that
management tends to rely on reducing local impacts, rather than seeking general causes of
coastal problems. The lack of any data on waves, tides, currents, bathymetry, shoreline
topography, and the minimal data on sea level rise must be seen as a major impediment to
effective shoreline management. Specific actions are needed to lay the foundations for an
information system that can integrate existing and new data to help fill these data gaps.
Chapter 3 discusses with more detail the specific attributes of the primary and secondary data
that should be integrated into such system.

Given the significant impacts caused by environmental degradation in the Yucatán Peninsula, as
explained in Chapter 5, the environmental information system should also integrate data that
will underpin the development of effective and efficient interventions to tackle environmental
health risks. Indoor and outdoor air pollution cause the most significant health impacts.
Therefore, the monitoring system should prioritize monitoring of emissions, concentrations and
exposure levels to fine particulate matter in outdoor and indoor environments. Initial efforts
could focus on monitoring PM2.5, and gradually expand its capacity to also monitor PM1.0. The
monitoring system should also include a source and composition inventory of the source
structure of both primary and secondary PM in order to guide future air quality management
planning and interventions. The monitoring system could also include black carbon emissions, a
pollutant linked to PM, with known effects on the climate and on human health.

Improving the knowledge base on lead exposure is also critical because it is the environmental
health risk that causes the most significant economic losses in the Yucatán Peninsula. Although
blood lead levels have been decreasing over time, efforts should be made to identify and control
lead exposure in “hotspots”. In addition, in light of recent evidence of the severity of impacts of
lead in children, measurement studies should be undertaken to confirm blood lead levels among
children, map geographic pockets of high blood lead levels, and identify and control sources of
lead exposure.

In addition to building the information system mentioned above, steps to address the peninsula’s
sustainability challenges would include the preparation of pre-feasibility, feasibility, and design
studies for specific interventions on coastal management, pollution control, environmental
health, and management of natural ecosystems through strengthened management of natural
protected areas and Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). These
studies would help to identify the most efficient and effective alternatives to tackle the regional
environmental priorities presented in this report.

In addition, as explained in Chapter 4, there are two different types of economic losses associated
with the extreme weather events that affect the Yucatán Peninsula: (i) relatively modest losses



                                               – 102 –           Yucatán ICZM Green Inclusive Growth
caused by low intensity, but frequently occurring natural hazards; and (ii) high losses caused by
catastrophic events that occur more rarely. Studies should be prepared to assess the adaptation
interventions that could be implemented to reduce vulnerability to both kinds of economic
losses, recognizing that the benefits and costs of interventions to address the impacts of low
intensity events can be quantified with more certainty than those focusing on catastrophic
events.

The matrix in Table 8.1 summarizes this report’s recommendations to help overcome the main
obstacles to green and inclusive growth faced by the Yucatán Peninsula.
