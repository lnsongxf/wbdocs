THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 16,829,144

by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 141

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 144*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        Obtain approval of plan from the City Council

        The general procedure for obtaining the approval of the project
        plan is as follows:

        1. BuildCo arranges for a private engineering consultant to
        complete the building plans. The plans must be prepared by
        licensed architects and signed by an engineer. However, the type
        of engineer is not specified, so they do not have to know
        anything about construction. There is an abusive practice of
        architects / engineers signing plans prepared by technicians who
        worked independently without actually reviewing them simply to
        obtain the payment.

        2. BuildCo completes the “application for permission to develop
        or to subdivide land” and a by-laws form, and submits the forms
        and the plans to the City Council with payment of a fee based on
        the size of the building and the assessed value of the land.           60 days               MWK 42,444
   1

        3. The plans and application are then forwarded to a technical
        panel for consideration. The panel’s members are representatives
        from the following organizations:

        • Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi
        • Malawi Telecommunications Limited
        • Water Board
        • City Council - Physical Planning Department
        • City Council - Engineering Department
        • City Council - Parks and Recreation Department
        • City Council - Health and Environment Department
        • City Council - Building Department
        • Occupational Safety, Health, and Welfare Department of the
        Ministry of Labor
        • Malawi Housing Corporation
        • Ministry of Transport and Public Works

                                                                             complete
      The panel reviews the building plans and application and either
      approves the development or suggests amendments. If the panel
      requires amendments, BuildCo is notified by mail of the changes
      required. BuildCo can also contact the City Council by phone or
      in person to inquire about the status of the application.

      A water connection application is filed along with the site plan. If
      the panel accepts the application, it is forwarded to the Town
      and Country Planning Committee, which meets monthly. The
      committee notifies BuildCo by mail and a notice of decision, a
      legally binding document, and the by-laws form are issued.

      The meeting of the City Planning Committee takes place only
      once a month, and the Technical Panel meets only once every 2
      weeks. However, companies may choose to opt for a fast-track
      option which allows companies to convene an emergency
      meeting of the Town and Planning Committee at a higher fee
      charged on top of standard fees. The fee for a fast-track option
      would be MWK 50,000. In this case, the meeting will take place
      within about one week of the payment being made. BuildCo will
      receive an oral decision at the end of the meeting. If there is an
      affirmative decision, construction can begin right away. The
      official document will be issued soon after. In practice however,
      this option is seldom used seldom by companies. Many
      companies plan ahead of the time and have prior consultations
      with the municipal officials.

      Under normal circumstances under Town and Country Planning
      Act, the Planning Committee should either approve the
      application or inform the applicant why it cannot be approved
      within 60 days of the application being submitted. In reality, this
      does not happen often. However, the silence-is-consent rule
      applies. If after 60 days there is no response, construction can
      begin.

      As of May 1, 2004 the cost according to Blantyre City Council is
      0.8% or construction cost + MWK 800.00 (local tax) + MWK
      100.00 (application fee).

      * Submit project brief and obtain certificate of EIA
      (environmental impact assessment) exemption from Director
      of Environmental Affairs Department

      Unless a project is likely to have a significant environmental
      impact, project developers can prepare and submit a project
2     brief with little or no assistance from environmental specialists.     15 days      MWK 5,000
      Since projects and their stage in the project cycle vary widely,
      detailed guidelines for the content of a project brief are not
      possible. However, Section 24 of the Environmental Management
      Act requires that a project brief should at least state:

      1. The nature of the project;

      2. The activities that shall be undertaken;
      3. The possible products and by-products anticipated;
      4. The number of people the project shall employ;
      5. The area of land, air or water that may be affected; and
      6. Any other matters as may be prescribed.

      More generally, a project brief should also contain:

      1. A basic description of the project purpose, size, location and
      preliminary design, including any alternatives which are being
      considered (i.e., site, technology, construction and operation
      procedures, handling of waste).
      2. The stage of the project in the project cycle.
      3. A location map of the project site or site alternatives, and a
      site plan as it is currently known. Maps and plans should
      conform to the standards discussed below.
      4. A discussion of which aspects of the project are likely to cause
      environmental concerns and the proposed environmental
      management measures.

      Agency: Environmental Affairs Department



      Notify the City Council of the commencement of
      construction and receive inspection

      During the construction phase of an approved project, the City
      Assembly sends out inspectors at various stages of construction.
      Inspectors from the City Assembly’s Departments of Building,
      Environment and Health, and Fire join the national-level
      Occupational Safety, Health, and Welfare Department to inspect
      the construction site approximately five times. These inspectors
      come as a team, and there is no charge for these visits.

3     The Building Department issues six cards that specify when a          14 days       no charge
      building should be inspected. BuildCo notifies the inspectors by
      sending a card at the appropriate stage of construction. The City
      Assembly inspectors come within 2 days to 2 weeks of
      notification. However in reality many do not come due to scarcity
      of resources. In practice, builders continue construction after
      submitting the notice without waiting for the inspection.

        levying fee, the Municipality has to evaluate the construction
        cost according to its methodology. In addition, quantitative

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

The indicators reported here are based on a set of

what the indicators cover). The procedures, along
with the associated time and cost, are summarized
below.

       Search for encumbrances at the Lands Registry

       Parties conduct a search at the Deeds Registry to ensure that no
       encumbrances are still pending on the property. The search can be
       conducted either by the title number (faster) or by plot number (slower).
       Malawi still has two systems of land title registration i.e. Title registration
       under the Registered Land Act and Title registration under the Deeds
       Registration Act. The former is simpler and searches are also simpler and
       quicker. If it is just one property search it takes no more than 15 minutes         1 day           MWK 5,000

       in the Title Registry but it may take longer in the Deeds Registry because
       of cross-referencing. For one property it could take on average about an
       hour. An official search certificate may be issued if the parties request
       one. The search certificate details all subsisting entries in the register of
       the property at the date of the search.

       Obtain City rates clearance certificate

       A letter is sent to the City Assembly to obtain a City rates clearance
       certificate. The parties search for unpaid city taxes on the property at the
       Municipality, which is free of charge . The system is computerized and it
       is just a matter of punching in the Rate Payer's details and the account
       comes up on the screen with all outstanding taxes. One can call to obtain         1 - 3 days            MWK 500

       Chief Executive, which substantially extends the time.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
