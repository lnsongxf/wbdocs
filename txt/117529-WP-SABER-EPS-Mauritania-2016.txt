Policy Goals for Independent Private Schools                                                                               Status
 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    In the absence of policy, independent private schools have authority to determine salary levels, to dismiss
    teachers and to set teacher standards. The school also has legal authority to appoint, deploy, and dismiss
    teachers, as well as to determine how curriculum is delivered. The government has set class size to a
    maximum of 50 students.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    The government sets standards for what students need to learn for independent private schools, but there is no
    indication of when or how well. A standardized examination is set only for entry into the first grade of the
    secondary level. No other exams occur during other grades for this type of schools. Policy dictates that schools
    be inspected regularly but the term is not specified.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Parents have the right to be informed and participate in the functioning of the school. However, schools only
    provide ad-hoc information on examination results. Regarding the inspections, neither students nor parents are
    interviewed as part of the process. Schools are allowed to select students based on geography.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    The government allows all of the following provider types to operate a school: not-for-profit, faith-based and for
    profit. Certification standards regarding land and facilities restrict entry of new schools into the market.


Policy Goals for Government-Funded Private Schools                                                                         Status
 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    In the absence of policy, government-funded private schools are able to determine salary levels, to dismiss
    teachers and to set teacher standards. The school also has authority to appoint, deploy, and dismiss teachers,
    as well as to determine how curriculum is delivered.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
     There is no existing legislation on setting standardized examinations and schools can apply their own rules on
    a case-by-case basis. There is no regulation which mandates that government-funded private schools be
    subject to inspection. No sanctions can be administered to these types of schools based on either examination
    or inspection results.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Parents have the right to be informed and participate in the functioning of the school. However, schools only
    provide limited information on examination results. Schools have to prioritize enrolment of children whose
    parents live in the immediate vicinity. Furthermore, parental choice is restricted by compulsory monetary
    contributions from parents which, if not paid, prohibit the child from attending the school.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    The government allows all the following types of organizations to operate a school: not-for-profit, faith-based,
    and for-profit. Certification standards regarding land and facilities prevent diversity of supply. Schools are given
    information on their allocations between 4 and 6 months before the start of the academic year.

The four policy goals enable a government to increase
innovation and strengthen accountability among the
critical actors in an education system (figure 2).
Empowering parents, students, and communities
enhances the ability of parents to express their voice and
hold policymakers accountable for results. Additionally,
when parents are empowered, in most contexts, they
can have greater influence over provider behaviors.
Increasing school accountability strengthens the quality-
and equity-assurance mechanisms between the state
and education providers. Encouraging innovation and
promoting diversity of supply can allow providers to
respond to local needs. Increasing school-level
autonomy in critical decisions improves the services
provided to students. Allowing a diverse set of providers
to enter the market can increase client power and enable
citizens to choose from a wider range of models. By

SABER-EPS recognizes that the four policy goals outlined
in box 1 can assist governments in raising accountability
for the education services provided in their countries.
The tool allows governments to systematically evaluate
their policies and implement practices that are effective
across multiple country contexts.


Four types of private provision of education
Across the world, governments can implement
numerous strategies to improve educational outcomes
by supporting non-state education provision. SABER-EPS
benchmarks key policy goals across the four most
common models of private service delivery:
    1. Independent private schools: schools that are
       owned and operated by non-government
       providers and are financed privately, typically
       through fees.
    2. Government-funded private schools: schools
       that are owned and operated by non-
       government providers, but receive government
       funding.
    3. Privately managed schools: schools that are
       owned and financed by the government, but
       are operated by non-government providers.
    4. Voucher schools: schools that students choose
       to attend with government-provided funding;

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
       produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
       institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
       their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
       policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
       tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers, and
       parents to policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
       snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
       system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Engaging the
       Private Sector in Education.
