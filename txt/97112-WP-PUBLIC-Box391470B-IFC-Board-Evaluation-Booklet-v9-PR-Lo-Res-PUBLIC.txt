    FOREWORD

    The recent promulgation of Indian Companies Act, 2013, and amendments introduced by the Securities and Exchange
    Board of India (SEBI) to Clauses 35B and 49 in response in April 2014, has considerably raised the bar for corporate
    governance in Indian companies. The revised regulations put strong emphasis on internal financial controls, risk
    management, and Board oversight. The role of the independent director has been further strengthened to make it
    more objective and purposeful.

    What is interesting to note is that the requirement for a Board evaluation has been made mandatory for every listed
    company and other public company with a paid-up capital of Rs 25 crore or more (approximately US$ 4 million).

    Are companies in India ready to face the challenge of effective implementation of an effective and productive Board
    evaluation process? What are the global best practices, and what are some of challenges and resistance and how these
    can be overcome? What are some of the issues and considerations likely to be generated by Board evaluations? Mary Jo
    Larson and Chris Pierce write about Board evaluation, the logic behind this concept, the benefits of such a process, and
    the extent to which it can be deployed in a productive manner by Boards. They illustrate their points of view by using
    examples from India employing experience they have gained over the years working extensively with and for a number
    of prominent Indian companies, including the Tata Group. They emphasize the role of the chair in providing valuable
    leadership, the necessity for establishing standards and benchmarks, engaging other senior leaders and providing
    legitimacy to the entire process in making it a useful and productive exercise that can be meaningfully undertaken
    by Boards. The success and usefulness of the Board evaluation will depend to a considerable extent on the genuine
    commitment demonstrated by the chair.

    The analysis and insights provided by Mary Jo and Chris in using third party experts well versed in the Board evaluations
    to assist in the evaluation process and involving other stakeholders to solicit feedback is instructive and timely. Their
    thoughts and guidance are offered as a practical guidance in implementing an effective Board evaluation process and
    is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of all the different components that comprise an effective process, but
    highlight the key constituents that warrant consideration before embarking on the process.

    With the efforts made by regulators to avoid another Satyam incident through the introduction of various reforms,
    the challenges for India remain in implementation and enforcement. For the companies, they need to follow corporate

governance practices not just in letter but also in spirit. Board evaluation will need to be taken seriously and the
recommendations be looked at as areas for improvement rather than as criticism. In other words, make it a constructive
process. Efforts should be made to avoid it being just a box-ticking exercise, especially regarding performance of
independent directors, who need to be more aware of their role. Ensure that the process is value-accretive and provides
strategic guidance; ensure that it is seeking to identify areas that will genuinely enhance the Board’s performance
collectively and the effective contributions of its directors individually. It should not be used as a witch hunt.

In a recent survey by McKinsey of Boards around the world, it was revealed that of the 772 directors surveyed only
34% indicated that they “fully comprehended” their companies’ strategies. Even more alarming was the indication that
only 22% stated their Boards were “completely aware” of how their firms created value and an even fewer 16% of the
directors surveyed indicated that their Boards had a “strong understanding” of the dynamics of their firms’ industries
[Where Boards Fall Short, Dominic Barton and Mark Wiseman, Harvard Business Review, January 2015].

An effective Board evaluation process would seek to tease out this sort of information and which would alert
the Board chair that he or she has some work on their hands. The key for any Board is that it adds value to
management’s deliberations in determining strategy and the critical thinking which lends itself to a solutions driven
decision-making process.

The driver for successful corporate governance implementation is the Board’s desire to conform, improve, and perform,
in line with the true spirit of corporate governance reform. Mary Jo and Chris’s study is a welcome contribution to
a better understanding of the influencing factors of Board evaluation, on the challenges, and how to address these
challenges to get the Board from a routine, process driven focus to one that is consciously performance driven in
supporting value-driven decisions.

4      Board Evaluations: Insights from India and Beyond
I. INTRODUCTION

Board evaluation has emerged as a corporate governance priority and brought to the forefront many associated
challenges. This is not a revolutionary change. Board assessment procedures are evolving as nations and companies
formulate and test diverse requirements. In India, for example, the Companies Act of 2013 mandates that the code of
conduct for independent directors include: “Bring an objective view in the evaluation of the performance of Board and
management.”

Until recently effective Board evaluation was not regarded a Board priority. In 2002, Yale University Professor Jeffrey
Sonnenfeld commented: “I can’t think of a single work group whose performance gets assessed less rigorously than
corporate Boards.”

However, in the last 12 years the situation has substantially changed. Corporate governance practitioners have been
applying Peter Drucker’s idea that “what gets measured gets managed,” and among senior leaders, what gets
acknowledged and valued gets done even better.

India has moved to the forefront of this governance challenge with its new Companies Act of 2013, which states
that the Board of every listed company and other public companies with paid-up capital of Rs 25 crore or more
(approximately US$ 4 million) shall report the annual performance evaluation of individual directors, the Board and
its committees.2

Amendments made by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to Clauses 35B and 49 of the Equity Listing
Agreement issued in April 2014 mention “Monitoring and reviewing Board Evaluation framework” as a key function of
the Board.3

In the following pages, we examine features of Board evaluation and the challenges now facing Boards in India and
beyond. “Board evaluation” is a term that commonly refers to the assessment of the Board as a whole, its committees
and its individual members. At this stage, companies in India tend to emphasize the evaluation of the Board as a whole,
and this article reflects that situation.

Recognizing the merits of various approaches, we highlight the Board’s leadership culture – the tone at the top – as an
essential feature of an effective assessment process. As described below, Board evaluation is driven by the values and
performance expectations of senior leaders in Tata Group, Infosys and other well-known Indian companies.

Topics addressed in this article include:

•	   Incentives for Board evaluation

•	   Extent of Board evaluation globally

•	   Significant requirements in India

•	   Predictable barriers and challenges

•	   Case example of Board leadership from India

    “If the chair and the Board perceive Board evaluation as an opportunity to get the Board

    What are the incentives for Board evaluation? This section              for the regular, systematic assessment of leadership

governance professionals representing more than
42 countries29, directors continue to approach ‘Board
evaluation’ with caution and resistance. A recent
study in Belgium30 revealed that the requirement for
periodic Board evaluation is one of the least respected
governance recommendations.                                                                          BUSINESS

What are the barriers and challenges? To begin, Board
evaluation is not a familiar international practice. Most of
the countries at the forefront of governance change have
only introduced Board evaluation in the last 12 years.                                   PERSONAL                  STRUCTURAL

There are predictable reasons why performance evaluations
do not take place or are ineffective. Patterns of resistance
include three barriers: defensive attitudes, legal and
procedural concerns, and perceived business risks.
