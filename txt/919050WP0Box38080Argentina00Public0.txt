THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

      appointed as managers of such company need to have previously
      obtained their respective CUITs (as managers of local companies) and
      the sole legal representative or the ""administrator"" (if more than one
      manager has been appointed legal representative) needs to have

      legal representative or the ""administrator"" with Fiscal Code must file

      system. Upon that, the sole legal representative or the ""administrator""
      will have to file with the corresponding agency of the AFIP: (a) the AFIP
      form F. 420/J (listing the number of employees and the date of hire), as
      filed with the online tax system, signed by this individual before a
      notary public; (b) evidence of filing of such form with the online tax
      system; (c) the ""approval certificate""; (d) a certified copy of the SRL's
      bylaws, duly registered with the Office of Corporations; (e) two
      documents evidencing the SRL's fiscal domicile (i.e. any service invoice,
      police's domicile certification, lease or commodatum agreement, etc.).
      Upon approval of the filed documentation, the AFIP will issue the SRL's
      CUIT. Afterwards, the sole legal representative or the ""administrator""
      should link his/her personal Fiscal Code with the SRL's CUIT (by
      evidencing that he/she is the sole legal representative or the
      ""administrator"" at the SRL; in the latter case by filing with the AFIP the
      form detailed as Annex IV to AFIP's General Resolution 2239/2007,

      • A document from Directorate of Real Estate and Registry, proving the
      sworn declaration of completed work. That form is obtained in that
      directorate and displays the proprietor’s signature, in addition to a
      simple heliographic copy of the building plan
      • Original plan of the work in fabric or film transparent polyester, which
      can be unified (architecture and structures) or displayed in two
      separated originals

      BuildCo must submit an affidavit on completion of the construction
      work. After that, the administrative authority has 60 working days to
      verify the affidavit’s accuracy and truthfulness. According to the
      Building Code, this action releases contractors involved in the
      construction from liability, leaving the owner as the sole liable party.
      Even so, neither the final approval nor the affidavit nor the final

The indicators reported here for Argentina are based on

        connection, a receipt of the application to the Municipality for approval
        of the electrical plans ("Habilitacion Municipal del plano

        clearance at the end of the connection process. But a receipt attesting
        that the procedure has been initiated already has to be submitted at the
        time of the application. The municipal clearance is required for all new

      representative of the customer is present at the time of the inspection.

      The customer's subcontractor carries out the civil part of the works
      required by EDESUR

      After the customer receives the cost estimate and the details of the
      external connection works needed from EDESUR, he hires a
5     subcontractor to carry out the civil part of the works required by             25 calendar days     ARS 12,500
      EDESUR.

      EDESUR does the connection works and installs the meter

      EDESUR approves the works that the electrical contractor of the
      customer did, obtains the relevant approvals from the municipality to do
      the excavation works in public spaces and finalizes the rest of the
      connection works. The installation of the meter happens on the same
      day that the connection works are carried out and the electricity starts
      flowing right away.

      The signed supply contract is a prerequisite for EDESUR to start its part
      of the connection works. By means of the supply contract the client
      commits to paying the electricity that will be consumed and to not lower
      the initial load estimate on which the connection works are based. In this
      moment, the client also has to present the electrical plans approved by
      the relevant Municipality ("Habilitacion Municipal del plano
6     electromecánico and del plano de la instalación eléctrica"). After the     21 calendar days          ARS 1,500
      supply contract has been signed, EDESUR inspects the part of the
      connection works that was carried out by the electrical contractor of the
      customer. EDESUR will only start its part of the works once the civil
      works for the connection have been finalized by the electrical contractor
      of the customer.

      Since August 2012, according to the Resolución ENRE 0215/2012, the
      EDESUR charges a contribución especial reembolsable (CER) for new
      connections. The CER is reimbursed to the client through electricity bills.
      The reimbursement happens in a maximum of 48 equal payments
      reimbursed with interests .

      * Obtain a Real Estate Reference Value (Valor Inmobiliario de
      Referencia)

      Property transfers in the City of Buenos Aires and some parts of the
      Province of Buenos Aires require a “Valor Inmobiliario de Referencia
      (VIR)” (Real Estate Reference Value”). The VIR was introduced by
      Resolutión Nº 67-AGIP-10 of February 10, 2010 and later amended by
      Resolutión Nº 435-AGIP-11 of August 3, 2011. A VIR is assigned to every
      property by the revenue agency and it sets a minimum base to calculate
      the stamp tax. The VIR aims to prevent the undervaluation of properties
      done to pay less stamp duty on property transfers.                           Less than a day

      free and it can be obtained online by the notary through the revenue
      agency website www.agip.gob.ar. However, not all the properties in the
      City of Buenos Aires have been assigned a VIR yet. In these cases the
      notary must obtain a certificate stating that there is no VIR for the
      property.
