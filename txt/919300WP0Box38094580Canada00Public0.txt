THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

Canada is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                   Legal form: Private Corporation

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,              Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       File for federal incorporation and provincial registration via
       Industry Canada’s online Electronic Filing Centre

       To file for incorporation electronically (via Online Filing Centre), the cost
       is CAD 200. There is no fee for the provincial registration in Ontario.
       Electronic filing for incorporating a business is 1 day and the Business
       Number is sent to the company within 5 days.

       The following documents are required to file for federal incorporation
       and provincial registration:
       1. Form 1: Articles of Incorporation
       2. Form 2: Initial Registered Office Address and First Board of Directors
       3. Provincial registration form.

       Labrador, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan can be done at the same time              5 days          CAD 200

       when the documents for federal incorporation are filed (via Joint
       Online Registration System), generally, a federal company that intends
       to conduct business in other Canadian province would need to register
       in that province individually. See, for example, Part 11 of the Business
       Corporations Act (British Columbia).

       Four incorporation options available:
       1. Incorporation of a numbered name corporation, e.g. 1234567 Canada
       Inc.
       If the company is incorporating under a name, rather than a number, a
       name search report must be obtained at a cost of CAD 21.47. The
       search report and articles must be filed within 90 days of the
       production of the name search report.

        (a NUANS® search in electronic format is required to accompany the
        submission);
        4. Incorporation of a numbered name corporation that has been pre-
        reserved.
        It is a same day service, if you submit the forms online prior to 1PM, the
        incorporation certificate should be provided on the same day by 5PM.

        Once a corporation is created, the corporation's information is
        transmitted to the Canada Revenue Agency which then transmits back
        the Business Number with the corporate income tax account number.
        This number can be accessed within a day from the online database of

        * Apply and obtain a zoning certificate

        Under Chapter 363-3.1 of the Building Code, a zoning certificate is
        mandatory prior to requesting a building permit. The zoning certificate
        costs 25% of the total prescribed building permit fee. Once the
        application has been received and payment is made, the application
        will be circulated to city divisions and external agencies for detailed
        technical review and comments.

      The municipality forwards the site plan to the fire department for
      approval. On some occasions, a City councilor will get involved in the
      review of the site plan and community consultation may be requested
      by the Planner. The process can take anywhere from 3 month to 9
      months depending on the complexity of the site plan, political interests,
      and on how often the applicant needs to revise the plan to meet the
      City's desired revisions. Once approved, the City often has conditions
      that need to be met before building permit can be obtained.

      Obtain building permit

      The building permit is issued by the City of Toronto. BuildCo must post
      the building permit on the construction site. In certain cases, the
      process of reviewing the building permit application can be started by
      the City before the site plan is approved. The City can issue a temporary
      building permit at that time. However, the final building permit cannot
      be issued before the site approval is granted. The building permit and
      the site plan approval are granted by different municipal departments.
      The site plan approval entails verifying planning compliance with the
      city bylaws (for instance, if enough parking spaces are included in the
      plans). In contrast, the building permit application review analyzes
      technical issues.                                                           15 days      CAD 13,916

      The Ontario Building Code was revised in November 2012. The new
      building code requires that on top of including all design plans and
      plot information, one must include a form ensuring energy efficiency,
      completed by the architect, mechanical designer, and electrical
      designer.

      This price includes the cost of the application intake, review, and
      inspection activities.

      Request and receive foundation work inspection

      Building inspectors review projects during key stages of construction to
      ensure that work complies with the building code and approved plans.
      Inspectors may visit several times, depending on the project; they must
5     be able to see the part of the work under inspection. Inspectors require     1 day        no charge

      During this time Toronto Hydro will check for feeder capacity, prepare

      include the following: (a) Extend the overhead primary feeder cables
      down the street by installing a new pole line up to the point that is inline
      with the customer's building. (b) From an overhead feeder install a
      primary riser switch and fusing at the pole. (c) Construct underground
      ducts from the base of the pole up to the customer’s property line. (d)
      Install underground primary cable from the riser switch to the

      work which is their responsibility.

      Toronto Hydro performs an economic evaluation on the "expansion"
      portion of the connection and the forecasted revenue of connecting this
      customer. In this case, the customer will have to provide a security
