Introduction / Project Scope

The Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15) will undergo rehabilitation and upgrading from two-lane
Category II to a four-lane Category I Highway and will be funded by WB-IBRD and to be
implemented by Azer Road Service (ARS) under the Ministry of Transport. This will form part of
the continuous four-lane highway of the Baku to Shamakhi (M4) Road. This segment of the M4
will connect to the subsequent M4 (km 15-45) section which is now under construction into four-
lane highway.

The objective of this environmental assessment (EA) is to assess the impacts of the four-lane
construction of the 1.5 km segment of the Baku-Shamakhi (km 13.5-15) road. The road
segment is short and the road traverses mainly settlement areas, social impacts will be more
prevalent than physical environmental impacts. Primary social and physical environment is
presented herein along with necessary mitigation measures as well as secondary areas such as
such as material sources, asphalt plant and concrete batching plant and campsites.

The EA Report, which includes an environmental management plan, addresses the needs of
applicable laws and regulations of the Government of Azerbaijan including the provisions of the
World Bank on the following: (1) Operational Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01,
January 1999); (2) Operational Policy Note on Management of Cultural Property in Bank
Financed Projects (OPN 11.03, August 1999); (3) Operational Policy on Natural Habitats (OP
4.04); and (4) The Disclosure Handbook (December 2002).

The EA follows the EIA procedure of Azerbaijan as being administered by the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources (MENR) following all pertinent legislations and regulations
and International Agreements and Conventions in which Azerbaijan government was a
signatory.

Description of the Project

The project road of 1.5 km will provide the continuity of four lanes from Baku to Shamakhi.
Accordingly, by the road will be supportive of the objectives of the entire Baku-Shamakhi road
which are as follow:
    Reduce road transport costs for road users
    Improve access and transit throughout the entire road
    Enhance safety within Azerbaijan’s east-west corridor, through the implementation of a
       number of subprojects
    Better road quality and better safety through new alignments
    Lower travel costs and a shorter travel time.

The four-laning of the entire Baku-Shamakhi road is expected to result to economic growth for
Azerbaijan is as a consequence of higher returns on investments through the marked growth of
the traffic, increase in speed, and subsequent decrease in travel time with the better road
infrastructure. In general, the enhanced east-west connections will foster economic integration
and growth within the country, particularly the non-oil growth, leading to a degree of economic
diversification.

Most part of this 1.5km stretch passes through Mushfiq (part of Garadah Rayon) and Ashagi-
Guzdak (part of Abasheron Rayon), which is characterized as urban area. The terrain is sloping
downward from south to north, and thus dictates the direction of drainage. A large part of the
villages are residential zones, while the outlying areas can be characterized are primarily semi-
arid desert, with some isolated saline relic lakes.

Environmental Impact Assessment Report For Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15),              August 2015



The four-laning will entail the following:
    Centered along the centerline will be a 3.00 meter median
    Four (4) traffic lanes: Both sides of 2 x 3.75m
    Both side shoulder with mid-guard rail: 1 x 1.5m
    Both side service road: 1 x 3.75m
    Both side narrow shoulder: 1 x 0.75m
    Both sidewalk: 1 x 1.50m

The entire construction roadway from sidewalk to sidewalk will have a width of 30.00m. One
feature that will be quite unique in the area will be the presence of service road for local traffic
with a total paved carriage way of 5.12m from curb to guardrail.

Description of the Physical Environment

The project area geographically is within the foothills of eastern prongs of Greater Caucasus.
Landscape of the Project corridor is totally flat with average 100 m altitude. The soil is of grey-
fulvous type, typical for dry climate, maximum precipitations of 350 mm with a bio-climate
potential of 0.8, which is the lowest index for soils in Azerbaijan. Climate of the area is
characterized as semi-desert and dry steppe, with average annual precipitation of up to 200
mm. The summer seasons are very hot and dry; and the winter seasons rather mild. Water
sources are very limited at the area, with one lake near the project road - the Tashagil lake, a
very salty lake and is located in about 500 m north-east from the start point of the project road.

Description of the Natural Environment

There is no original vegetation found along the project corridor anymore. The area is fully
populated and both road sides are totally occupied by private houses (mainly with gardens) and
commercial facilities. There is an area of artificial tree plantation with mature pine (about 65%)
and cypresses (about 35%). Trees are adjacent to the project road at 0+400 – 0+600 LHS and
at 0+450 – 0+650 RHS. In addition, there are plant boxes provided almost along the whole road
with aim to reduce traffic affects to the population.

Fauna of the area has been totally devoid due to anthropogenic activities. The number of wild
animals occurring at the area is very limited due to high density of human population. In the
general vicinity, there are certain species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians that are
known to exist. There is one species – Greek Tortoise (Testudo graeca) both internationally and
locally protected that occurs within the project corridor; however would only be found in fruit and
vegetable gardens within private properties. The impacts to any of these animals are rather
minimal as the settlements tend to discourage their presence.

Human Environment

The Project section from km13+290 – km15+000 is part of Baku-Shamakhi road and passes
through Absheron Economic Region of Azerbaijan. When traveling from east to west from
km10+000, at the right-hand side is Ashagi-Gusdak settlement belonging to Absheron Rayon of
Absheron Economic Region; while at the left hand side is Mushfiq settlement belonging to
Garadag Rayon of Baku.

The entire stretch is lined with mixed commercial establishments and residences. However,
region-wise, Absheron has an agricultural and poultry industry industrial centers which produce
agricultural and manufactured products, along with scientific-research institutes and
laboratories.

Summary of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures

In the four-laning of the road segment, direct and/or indirect impacts are generated which are
rather short-term as they are felt and manifested during the actual performance of the
construction activities. Modification of the actual worksites and material sources gives rise to
direct impacts, including disturbances to natural environment components such as air and
noise, flora and fauna, and water. Social impacts occur along the vicinity of the road nuisance
such as impairment of the usual access, community health and safety concerns, plus socio-
economic conflicts. Likewise, those temporary facilities allied to the construction, such as quarry
sites and borrow pits, excess soil disposal sites, contractor’s workers camps, and asphalt plants
generate also short-term impacts. It is expected that impacts from these types of activities will
cease once the contractor completes the project road and demobilizes from the site.

Environmental Management during Construction

Most of the forecasted direct and indirect impacts will be experienced during the construction
period. To eliminate, minimize or mitigate these impacts and Environmental Management Plan
that specifies mitigation is hereby presented in this EIA report as part of the requirements for the
performance of the works. Correspondingly, to monitor these impacts, an Environmental
Monitoring Plan is also included. Parameters in these monitoring plan should be regularly
monitored which becomes the basis of spot compliance of the Contractor. The Construction
Supervision Consultant shall ensure that mitigation measures are implemented and the
environmental monitoring parameters are at acceptable levels.

The possible temporary impacts as consequence of the construction activities will consist of,
among others, disruption of current traffic circulation, roadway safety, damage to access roads,
dust nuisance, and gaseous emissions, potential pollution of soils and water resources, and
momentary interference to neighboring settlements through various operation activities. Off-site
activities include quarry, burrow pit and asphalt plant operations, which if not managed properly,
may cause localized adverse impacts. The Contractor’s yard and workers’ camp can be
potential sources of temporary adverse impacts. Considering all the identified impacts, it
becomes essential for the Contractor to prepare his site specific EMP and later conscientiously
implement own throughout the duration of the project. The emphasis of the EMP shall be on the
following:
          Layout of the work camp and details of the proposed measures to address adverse
             environmental impacts resulting from its installation, consistent with the provisions of
             the construction norms BCH 8-89;

           Sewage and septage management plan for provision of sanitary latrines and proper
            sewage collection and disposal system to prevent pollution of watercourses;

           Waste (solid as well as hazardous) management plan covering provision of garbage
            bins, regular collection and disposal in a hygienic manner, as well as proposed
            disposal sites for various types of wastes consistent with appropriate regulations.
            Measures to address the disposal of hazardous waste should specifically be
            indicated;

           Description and layout of equipment maintenance areas and lubricant and fuel
            storage facilities including distance from water sources/bodies and specific
            prevention, containment and mitigating measures in case of spillage;

           Soil Management Plan detailing measures to be undertaken to minimize effects of
            wind and water erosion on stockpiles, measures to minimize loss of fertility of topsoil,
            timeframes, haul routes and disposal site;

Environmental Impact Assessment Report For Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15),                August 2015



           Dust management plan which shall include schedule for water spraying on access
            road and in nearby settlements along the project road, as well as list of equipment to
            be used;

           A plan indicating the location of the proposed material extraction site as well as
            rehabilitation measures to be implemented for the borrow areas and access roads
            upon project completion;

           An Emergency Response Plan (in case of spills, accidents, fires and the like) for
            asphalt plants.

Prior to commencement of construction activities/site works, all of the above plans will be
submitted by the contractor to the Ecology and Safety Sector (ESS) of the ARS for approval.
Monitoring will be done by the ESS on every environmental aspect of the operations of the
contractor for conformance to EMP and to relevant environmental laws and regulations.

Capacity Building

The staff training for ESS/district ARS is recommended as part of the construction supervision
contract by an international environmental specialist focusing on capability on the proper
enforcement of the EMP. A typical ESS/ARS staff training will consist of lecture-type
presentation of the general procedure and requirements for effective environmental monitoring
followed by more detailed on-the-job and hands-on training at the construction site where the
trainees will participate in the activities of the international environmental specialist/construction
supervision staff in reviewing the Contractor’s reports, periodic monitoring inspections,
deliberation of environmental issues involving the Contractor and the project stakeholders, and
finally the accomplishment of environmental reports.

Public Consultation Summary and Information Disclosure

In conformance with the Operational Policy (OP)/Bank Procedure (BP) 4.01: Environmental
Assessment of the WB-IBRD, In conformity with the Operational Policy (OP)/Bank Procedure
(BP) 4.01: Environmental Assessment of the WB-IBRD, public consultation for the Four-laning
of the Baku-Shamakhi km 13.5-15 Section was scheduled on 23 October 2015 at 3:00 pm at
Ashagi Guzdek Settlement Municipal Office, part of Absharon Rayon. The PIU-ARS coordinated
the holding of public consultation with the Local Executive Power of Absharon Rayon, wherein
local residents, village officials/representatives, local NGOs, and other stakeholders were
invited. This was attended by around of 20 participants and in which the Environmental
Consultant elaborated the rehabilitation works, project’s environmental, social impacts, and land
issues along with WB and GoA policies in minimizing and mitigating projected impacts.
Comments were later solicited from the participants in an open forum and both by means of
written documentation filled out by the participants themselves. Minutes of the Meeting have
been separately documented and attached to the Report.

Upon finalization of this EIA document for Baku-Shamakhi km13.5-15 project briefs shall be
made available (in Azeri language) available in public places for the project-affected and local
NGOs. Accordingly, ARS shall see the approval from MENR who will issue the Environmental
Permission for the project. Subsequently, the Bank shall post the approved EA report in their
Infoshop.

Conclusions

As determined in the environmental assessment the results clearly indicate that the

construction, which will be temporary in nature. It is important that the appropriate mitigation
measures during the design, construction, and operation phases be undertaken in order to
minimize the negative impacts of the Project to acceptable levels.

An estimated cost for the mitigating measures has been done and shall be made separate cost
items in the Bill of Quantities. This is one way of assuring that the measures will be given due
attention and implemented within the project duration.

As a conclusion, should the measures be implemented conscientiously, the negative impacts
will be successfully mitigated and the road rehabilitation project will bring immediate and long
term benefits to the people through improved infrastructure, reduction in transport cost,
enhanced mobility and better accessibility.

1.      INTRODUCTION

1.1     Project Background and Previous Studies

The project being considered in this Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is referred to as
the Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15). This project will entail the rehabilitation and upgrading
of a road segment from two-lane Category II to a four-lane Category I Highway which starts at
km 13+290 to km 15+000 as the actual chainage. This road segment is part of the upgrading of
the entire Baku-Shamakhi Road (M4) starting from km 10 and km 91. Funding for this project
will be coming from WB-IBRD and to be implemented by Azer Road Service (ARS) under the
Ministry of Transport.

The existing road segment has been rehabilitated in the period between 2008 and 2010 into a
Category II road as per the Former Soviet Union Standard (SNIP) 2.05.02-85. The construction
works produced a road with a two lane carriageway with a paved width of 9.00 m and an
unpaved shoulder width of 2 x 3.00 m.

The Baku-Shamakhi road is a section of the shortest way from Baku to Georgia and to western
Azerbaijan. The rest of the segment of this road up to km 91 is under construction into a 4-lane
road, with their respective EIAs. Since this short segment is also planned to be reconstructed
into a four-lane road for uniformity of sections, an EIA is required.

1.2     Brief Description of the Study Area

The Baku-Shamakhi highway is a segment of the Magistral Road, M4. This is the initial
segment of the highway currently being upgraded from two-lane highway to four-lane highway.
The starting point of this approximate 1.5km road segment is near the western ramp of Tagiyev-
Sahil (R6) and M4 interchange. The Tagiyev-Sahil Road has been completed last year as part
of the AHP-2 project also funded by the World Bank. The endpoint of this road is at km 15
which located west of the trumpet interchange. This is also the beginning point of the
subsequent segment of the Baku-Shamakhi highway (km 15 – 45) which is being constructed
into a four-lane highway.

A major part of the 1.5km segment passes through Mushfiq (part of Garadah Rayon) and
Ashagi-Guzdak (part of Abasheron Rayon), where 90% of the corridor is lined with mixed
residential and commercial properties. With the first improvement of the road in 2008–2010, the
area also has improved with increased in commercial stalls that lined the road, such as agro-
market, merchandizing stores, car repair shops, restaurants and wedding palaces. In the
outlying areas, some light industries have sprung up like brick factories, concrete blocks, and
warehouses.

The residential zone on the left-hand side seems to have two zones – one along the road, while
the second zone sorts of fan out to the southwest direction. A new set of residential apartment
buildings has been erected at the south end of this road which can house considerable number
of residents in the future. The residential zone at the right-hand-side is thinner than that of the
opposite side with some remnants of old factory site at the interior.

The terrain is sloping downward from south to north; whereby essentially the properties on the
left-hand side are higher than those of the right-hand side. Natural drainage follows this
direction such that the existing creeks and waterways in the area likewise drain from south to
north.

A canal is found near the end of the road which serves as the primary waterway in the area
draining runoff water from the south side to the north side. A trace on this waterway indicates
that this converges with local tributaries to form a larger waterway that discharges into
Sumgaitchay River.

The outlying areas in beyond the settlements on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the road
can be characterized are primarily semi-arid desert, with some isolated saline relic lakes. Mud
volcanoes are found in these semi-arid regions but quite far already to be affected by the short
road construction.

Generally, for the road rehabilitation project the direct and indirect impacts will be confined
within a strip of 35-40 meters of the road reserve within 60meters of the ROW. This strip will be
directly affected by reconstruction activities where road components will be constructed such as
median, traffic lane, service roads, side-walk, road embankment, embankment slopes, drainage
lines, and protective railings. Indirect impact can extend even beyond the 60 ROW due to social
and physical environmental characteristics of the project area. A box culvert may have to be
reconstructed or extended at the end of the road near the trumpet interchange.

Within the construction width, the important items that can be affected are the decorative plant
boxes with ornamental plants that were installed by the local municipality to adorn the roadway.
With the four-laning, almost all of them are touched by the construction strip, such that
decisions will have to be made for complete or partial removal.

Other areas referred to as extended area of influence will include the designated borrow areas
and access roads, contractor’s yard, workers’ camp, asphalt plants and disposal sites for any
excavation spoils and solid wastes, and watercourses in the vicinity. The main critical receptors
in the area are the population centers of Mushfiq & Ashagi-Gusdak. There is no ecologically
protected area that will be affected and no archeological and culturally important are anticipated
to be impacted by the four-laning. A map of the project road is shown in Figure 1 below.

1.3     Methodology and Scope of the Environmental Assessment

The preparation of the Environmental Assessment (EA) for Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15)
was undertaken by means of research of available secondary information, field investigations,
consultations with ARS, and Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR), and
stakeholder consultations.

In addition to the RER, EA&MF, and RPF, other references used for this EA are previous
studies prepared by other consultants primarily: Scott Wilson (May 2009) for Azerbaijan
Motorway Improvement And Development Baku – Shamakhi Road Widening: Km 15 to Km 45;
IRD for Upgrading of Baku-Shamakhi Road Section of Baku-Shamakhi-Yevlakh Road,
preparation of Environmental Assessment and Environmental Management Plan. Field
investigations on the Baku-Shamakhi (km13.5-15) sections were performed in August 2015.
The public consultations were done in ____ Village, part of Absheron on __.

The purpose of this document is to assess the impacts of the four-lane construction of the 1.5
km segment of the Baku-Shamakhi (km 13.5-15) road. Since the road segment is short and the
road traverses mainly settlement areas, social impacts will be more prevalent than physical
environmental impacts. Construction will be limited within a maximum strip of 40meter to
accommodate a road width of around 30 meters. A forecast on the primary social and physical
environment is presented herein along with necessary mitigation measures. Relevant
parameters in terms of noise and air quality shall be periodically monitored to ensure that
impact to the residents will be minimized.

Secondary impacts are likewise presented from areas which will be utilized for the road
construction such as material sources, asphalt plant and concrete batching plant and
campsites.


2.      POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK

The legal and institutional framework for this EA considered prevailing national legislations in
Azerbaijan and WB environmental policies and guidelines. The contents of this report focus on
description of existing environmental conditions, environmental impacts associated with road
rehabilitation, recommended mitigating measures and environmental monitoring program.
Furthermore, to ensure proper compliance additional training intervention, especially for
Ecology and Safety Sector (ESS) of Azer Road Service (ARS) of the Ministry of Transport and
local counterpart at the field level, on procedures for EMP compliance monitoring and related
EIA concerns is deemed necessary and its conduct is proposed during Project implementation.

2.1     EIA process

In processing of any environmental assessment for relevant projects in Azerbaijan, MENR’s
State Ecological Expertise (SEE) Department (under the Department of Environmental Policy
and Environmental Protection) is responsible for the review and approval of environmental
impact assessments (EIAs) submitted by proponents or developers. Proponents or developers
of project shall submit necessary EA documents to the SEE in a form of a project brief following
the format in Appendix D of EA&MF and which will be subjected to two stage processing. The
first stage will take around one month and will entail an initial examination of the application of
the proposed activity to be undertaken by the MENR along with the expected impacts of the
proposed activity are considered. This stage may also include preliminary consultations with
other agencies, NGOs, experts and initial public inquiries on the various aspect of the project.
When determined that the project or activity will likely cause only minor impacts on the
environment, the application may be approved with some conditions. On the other hand, if the
activity is assessed to cause significant impacts, a full EIA is required. Subsequently in such a
situation, a scoping meeting of representatives of the developer/applicant, invited experts and
invited members of the public will be organized and to be chaired by the MENR. Based on the
outcome of this scoping meeting, the MENR will notify the developer of the required scope and
depth of the investigation and public consultation during the EIA study.

The second stage of the EIA process will take around three months, and which will entail a
review and investigation by the MENR of the documents which would be submitted by the
developer/proponent. A group of 5-11 expert reviewers and experienced members (e.g.
members of the Academy of Science, university staff, or officials from other ministries) will be
convened to perform the EIA document review and which will be chaired by MENR. The
composition of the review group shall be upon the discretion of the MENR but will be taken from
a roster of experts who can deal adequately with project-specific environmental issues. The
expert group will undertake public submissions, investigations, and consultations relevant to the
project impacts as deemed necessary for the review process. Consequently, at the end of this
stage, a written review of documentation together with recommendations is submitted by the
environmental review expert group to the MENR.

Based on the submitted review documents, the MENR then decides on whether to deny the
application or to approve it, with or without conditions. In the case of road projects specified
conditions attached to the approval relate to the construction phase and may include site
management; noise; dust, discharges to the air land, subsurface or water, solid waste
management, emergency contingency plans, etc. These conditions are set to assist the
proponent/developer control the environmental impacts such that they are maintained as the
acceptable limits. Should the application be approved with conditions, either the activity starts
with due consideration on the conditions or the proponent/developer may opt to appeal against
the conditions and resolutions may be subjected to judicial proceedings.

2.2      Legislation with reference to Environmental Assessment

In Azerbaijan, the fundamental legislation governing the implementation of environmental
policies is the Law on Environmental Protection of 1999. This law provides the basis for the
legal, economic, and social aspects of environment protection. The said law stipulates that its
objective is to protect environmental balance thus ensuring environmental safety, prevent the
hazardous impact of industry and other activities to natural ecological systems, preservation of
biological diversity and proper use of natural resources.

The basic process of conducting environmental assessment for proposed projects in Azerbaijan
is through the State Ecological Expertise (SEE). The aim of the State Ecological Expertise is to
identify impacts on environment caused by industrial units, examine the results of such impacts
and predicting possible ones, in accordance with the environmental requirements and
qualitative parameters of environment (Art. 50 EP Law). Further, Article 52 of EP Law stipulates
the Objectives and Responsibilities of the State Ecological Expertise as follows:

        1. Activity of SEE is directed to assessment of an enterprise causing impact to
           environment and identification of the degree of risks of made decisions, identification
           of effectiveness of taken measures for environment protection and use of nature
           resources.

        2. The SEE is an important mechanism used for environment protection, with the rights
           to interfere, if needed, into lawmaking process in case of any violations of
           environmental interests.

 3. Responsibilities of the SEE:

                  Identification of the level of safety of enterprises, in terms of environment, and
                   their activities which might cause direct or indirect harm to environment and
                   public health thus exposing the present and future generations to danger;

                  Identification of conformity with the regulations of environment protection,
                   sanitary-hygienic norms and rules, when the enterprise is yet under construction
                   and planning;

                  Identification of the quality of             environment   protection   measures   and
                   substantiation of such measures.

The field or sector coverage of the SEE is specified in Article 54 (The units controlled by the
SEE) of the EP Law as:

1.    The State and local programs related to development and placement of productive
      capacities in governmental and economical institutions.

The primary institution in Azerbaijan with respect to the environment is the Ministry of Ecology
and Natural Resources (MENR). A Presidential Decree in 2001 transformed the former State
Committee for Ecology and Natural Resources Utilization (SCENRU) into the MENR. Thereon,
along with its inherent mandate from SCENRU, the MENR assumed over the functions of
several other state bodies such as the departments of Hydrometerology, Geology, Forestry, and
Fishery. The functions and activities of the MENR are sub-divided into the following main
sectoral areas:

            Environmental policy development

            Environmental protection

            Water monitoring and management

            Protection of marine (Caspian Sea) bio-resources

            Forest management

            Bio-resources and protected areas management

During construction of the project, the applicant/developer should ensure adherence to
conditions attached to the approval and be responsible for monitoring the developments of the
projects along with the regular and timely reporting to MENR. The monitoring programme of the
proponent/developer should be designed to give clear indications prior to conditions being
breached. Practical corrective measures should be undertaken by the proponent/developer in
order to avoid breach of any conditions stipulated in the approval.

The MENR is authorized to issue warning to proponent/developer should it observe that
conditions are being breached. In the event that conditions are breached, the
proponent/developer is obliged to stop whatever activity which is causing the breach. In such
cases, the MENR may reconsider the approval, possibly with the participation of the
Environmental Review Expert Group, and the conditions of approval may be reviewed.

Should project designs be altered significantly from those presented in the in the feasibility
phase EIA, additional reports on the impacts of the changes may be requested by MENR.

In matters of legal framework, the constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan embodies precepts
and principles for environmental protection, ownership of natural resources and preservation of
cultural heritage. Article 14 of Chapter III (Basic rights and liberties of a person and citizen)
entails the state ownership of natural resources in Azerbaijan, without prejudice to rights and
interests of any physical persons and legal entities. Article 39 constitutes the rights of everyone
to live in a healthy environment, to gain information about true ecological situation and to get
compensation for damage done to his/her health and property because of violation of ecological
requirements. Article 40 states the rights to practice and participate in culture and protection of
historical, cultural, and spiritual inheritance and memorials. In Chapter IV (Main responsibilities

In addition the legislative framework relating to the environment generally consists of the
following:

            Parliamentary legislation that defines and establishes the State regulation of
             protected natural areas, and the protection and use of the environment and
             biodiversity

            Presidential Decrees and orders and the Cabinet of Ministers resolutions

On July 18, 2001, the Republic of Azerbaijan ratified the treaties of the Convention on Wetlands
of International Importance as Waterfowl Habitation which was held in Ramsar city (Iran) and
which later became to be known as the Ramsar Convention. The Ramsar Convention was the
first of the modern global intergovernmental treaties on the conservation and sustainable use of
natural resources, and emphasized on the conservation and wise use of wetlands primarily as
                                                            16

habitat for waterbirds. Traditionally regarded as wastelands, wetlands were at constant threat
due to conversion of use, especially to agriculture. With the Ramsar Convention, the importance
of wetlands has been recognized in sustainable development and for conservation of world’s
biodiversity. In Azerbaijan wetlands perform vital functions such as flood control, water
purification, water regulation, production of fish and etc, making them essential in the
biophysical health of the areas. Primarily the signatories to the Ramsar Convention are
expected to do the following: (i) specify at least one wetland on a List of Wetlands of
International Importance; (ii) encourage the wise use of wetlands; (iii) establish wetland
reserves, cooperate in the exchange of information and shared wetlands species.

1.1.1    Administrative Framework
The following government agencies will be involved in the management and monitoring of
environmental aspects or concerns of the proposed road rehabilitation project:

ARS is responsible for planning, constructing, operating, and maintenance of national roads in
Azerbaijan. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the ARS will be in charge of project
management, among others, to ensure that appropriate budget will be provided for the
implementation of mitigation measures and monitoring the programme, and that the contract
provisions are properly implemented. The Ecology and Safety Sector (ESS) of the ARS shall
coordinate the EA study, carry out required public consultations, ensures implementation of the
EMP and public disclosure of the EA study. The ESS shall also liaise with relevant government
offices for securing environmental approvals.

The ESS and the district offices of ARS in Rayons along the project road will undertake day-to-
day supervision of construction and oversight of the implementation of environmental
management plans during project implementation.

The Regional Monitoring Department of the MENR shall undertake routine and random
monitoring of the project to determine compliance with environmental regulations and
standards.

The Sanitary and Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Health (MOH) will undertake
routine monitoring of the living conditions and sanitary provisions at the contractor’ s work camp
and worksites. MOH’s Regional Disinfection Centre shall be involved in approving the
contractor’s work camp installations and facilities and their compliance with the relevant sanitary
and health norms and guidelines.

During the operational phase of the Project, ARS will undertake routine monitoring of road
safety, the storm water drainage system, the condition of tree plantations and re-vegetation, etc.

3.      PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION

3.1     Objectives and purpose of the project

The project road of 1.5 km will provide the continuity of four lanes from Baku to Shamakhi.
Accordingly, by the road will be supportive of the objectives of the entire Baku-Shamakhi road
which are as follow:
    Reduce road transport costs for road users
    Improve access and transit throughout the entire road
    Enhance safety within Azerbaijan’s east-west corridor, through the implementation of a
       number of subprojects
    Better road quality and better safety through new alignments
    Lower travel costs and a shorter travel time.

The four-laning of the entire Baku-Shamakhi road is expected to result to economic growth for
Azerbaijan is as a consequence of higher returns on investments through the marked growth of
the traffic, increase in speed, and subsequent decrease in travel time with the better road
infrastructure. In general, the enhanced east-west connections will foster economic integration
and growth within the country, particularly the non-oil growth, leading to a degree of economic
diversification.


3.2     Project Works Description

From the existing two-lane Category II road, the segment km 13.5-15 of the Baku-Shamakhi
highway shall be reconstructed into four-lane to connect to the existing four lane road at both
ends. The four-laning will entail the following:
     Centered along the centerline will be a 3.00 meter median
     Four (4) traffic lanes: Both sides of 2 x 3.75m
     Both side shoulder with mid-guard rail: 1 x 1.5m
     Both side service road: 1 x 3.75m
     Both side narrow shoulder: 1 x 0.75m
     Both sidewalk: 1 x 1.50m

The entire construction roadway from sidewalk to sidewalk will have a width of 30.00m. One
feature that will be quite unique in the area will be the presence of service road for local traffic
with a total paved carriage way of 5.12m from curb to guardrail. The cross-sectional profile of
the road is shown in the next Figure.

The road construction will also include drainage, cross-pipes and culverts along with relocation
of underground and above ground utility lines.

Generally, for the road construction the direct and indirect impacts will be confined within a strip
of 30-35 within the designated ROW. This strip will be directly affected by reconstruction
activities where road components will be constructed such as pavement, shoulder, road
embankment, embankment slopes, drainage lines, and protective railings. Indirect impact can
extend even beyond the 60 ROW mainly due to social environmental characteristics of the
project area. One canal will be either be extended or rebuilt depending on the final design.

In addition to the four-laning of the roadway, the pavement within the 1.5 km shall be
strengthened based on a new design. The pavement strengthening shall entail a new structural
pavement design based on new parameters adopted to strengthen the road pavement in
anticipation of heavier loadings. Because of this, the road pavement of the 1.5km section will be
rebuilt to conform to the new design parameters. Changes in thicknesses in the New Project
Design were introduced by the design engineers. In the construction, this will be implemented
by scarifying the pavement structure up to embankment layer and onto which the new design
project design. The design modification is shown on the table below and depicted on the
subsequent schematics.

4.      DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT

4.1     Physical Environment

4.1.1    General Geology and Soil
The project area geographically is within the foothills of eastern prongs of Greater Caucasus.
Landscape of the Project corridor is totally flat with average 100 m altitude. However
surrounded landscape is characterized as arid hills and with the existence of mud volcanoes.

Original soil is of grey-fulvous type. These soils are normally restricted to maximum altitudes of
about 100 m. Gray-fulvous soils are typical for dry climate with maximum precipitations of 350
mm. The bio-climate potential is 0.8, which is the lowest index for soils in Azerbaijan. Some
characteristic features of the gray-fulvous soils are: moisture content: 0.10 - 0.15; humus
coefficient 1.0 (no more than 3%); ph: 8.7 - 9.0; water-stability of structure: 22 (which means
that the content of water-stable aggregates is 22%, which is lowest index with the exception of
salt-marshes and solonetz); granulometric composition: loamy – 0.78; heavy-loamy – 0.60;
medium-loamy – 1.0; light-loamy – 0.73; loamy sand is absent. Erodibility fluctuates between 0
and 0.20 km/km2 (this indicates the length of the ravine extension on an area of 1 km2), salinity
ranges between 0.42 and1.0 g/m3.

4.1.2    Climate and Water Resources
Climate of the area is characterized as semi-desert and dry steppe, with average annual
precipitation of up to 200 mm. The summer seasons are very hot and dry; and the winter
seasons rather mild. Average annual temperature is about +14oC with average low temperature
in January about 0oC; and +25oC in July. Number of hours of sunshine is about 2500; summed
solar radiation is around 135 kcal/cm2. Snow can cover the area in winter for around 10-20 days
continuously a year. The main directions of wind are west and north-west throughout the year.

Water sources are very limited at the area. There is one lake near the project road - the
Tashagil lake, with very salty water and is located in about 500 m north-east from the start point
of the project road. This relict water body was a part of the Caspian Sea historically and
separated with the declining water level. Presently, water in the lake is strongly polluted by
sewages discharging from surrounded settlements. Another water stream is the small tributary
of Sumgaitchay River crossing the project road at km 1+650. Previously, this small stream was
temporary and totally dried in the summer time; however existing natural canyon is used by
adjacent settlements for sewages discharging. Thus, this water stream became permanent and
strongly contaminated and even canyon banks are full of litters with different domestic waste.


4.2     Biological Environment

4.2.1    Flora
There is no original vegetation found along the project corridor anymore. The area is fully
populated and both road sides are totally occupied by private houses (mainly with gardens) and
commercial facilities. The plant boxes are provided almost along the whole road with aim to
reduce traffic affects to the population. These plant boxes are planted with grass cover and
planted with some small bushes as oleander and few young trees as cypress, oleaster and
willow. These plant boxes are mainly adjacent to the road and probably will be affected within
construction phase of the project implementation. There is also one area of artificial tree
plantation with mature pine (about 65%) and cypresses (about 35%). Trees are adjacent to the
project road at 0+400 – 0+600 LHS and at 0+450 – 0+650 RHS.

4.2.2    Fauna
Fauna of the area has been totally devoid due to anthropogenic activities. The number of wild
animals occurring at the area is very limited due to high density of human population. In the
general vicinity the animals that are known to exist are mainly:
    - mammals – Golden Jackal, Red Fox, Hare, Eared Hedgehog, Pipistrelle Kuhli Bat,
        Common Rat and Red Tailed Sanderling;
    - birds – Common Kestrel, Rock Dove, Little Owl, Hoopoe, Crested Lark, Pied Wagtail,
        Black Bird, Goldfinch, Rook, Hooded Crow, Common Starling, Rose-colored Starling,
        and House Sparrow;
    - reptiles – Greek Tortoise, Caspian Gecko and Viper Snake;
    - amphibian – green toad.
Most of animals and birds are concentrated at gardens of private houses. There are two
predator' mammals (red fox and golden jackal) occurring at surrounded hills and may roam in
the project area at night time only (for hunting on domestic birds).

There is one species – Greek Tortoise (Testudo graeca) both internationally and locally
protected that occurs within the project corridor; however would only be found in fruit and
vegetable gardens within private properties. Thus this species has minimal risk of impact.
However, Contractor be attentive and be careful during construction phase of the project to
avoid direct damage to the animals by heavy equipment or trucks in case they will cross the
project road. Other species would have same minimal risk of project affect. It is also
recommended to avoid tree cutting (within section 0+400 – 0+650) process within breeding
season (end of April up to end of July) to avoid nests damage.


4.3      Socio Economic Background of the Project Area

4.3.1    Administrative Division of Project Area
The Project section from km13+290 – km15+000 is part of Baku-Shamakhi road and passes
through Absheron Economic Region of Azerbaijan. Currently, km15+000 to km91+000 section

4.3.4    Baseline Socio-economic Conditions of Project Area
The Absheron region was formed in 1963 and over the past years has established a high-level
control over collective and state farms of Baku and Sumgait including their provinces. Absheron
has an agricultural and poultry industry, as well the industrial centers which produce agricultural
and manufactured products. Scientific-research institutes and laboratories are also present in
the region.

Currently, the number of enterprises operating in the region is one-hundred one (101); that
amounts to almost half of all two-hundred eighteen (218) within Absheron Economic Region.
These enterprises generate 111,938 thousand Manat - a volume of industrial products, works
and services in the rayon. There are thirty-six (36) schools, one (1) special college, and one (1)
University. There are twenty-one (21) health institutions consisting of four (4) hospitals, and 17
polyclinics).

The number of industrial enterprises operating in Garadag Rayon is ninety (90). There are
twenty-five (25) schools, four (4) colleges, four (4) music schools, and one (1) special boarding
school in the rayon. Twenty-three (23) of health institutions are found in Garadag Rayon,


                                                             25

including the Republican Guzem hospital and Alat Railway Hospital. Agriculture is not
developed in the region and there is no rural area within the Garadag Rayon.

4.3.5    Income sources

Based on the distribution of income sources by Economic Regions, the monthly income of
people in Baku Region is 239 Manats, including those from Garadag Rayon. Whereas, people
in Absheron ER make around 212.7 Manat per-person, per-month. Most part of the incomes in
both regions are from employment in the public sector, 111.1 and 119.3 Manats in Absheron
and Baku ER respectively; whereas property income bring the same amount in both economic
regions. The income derived from the private sector in Baku Region is 24%; while for Absheron
Region it is 18.6% (Table below).

5.      FORECAST ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

In the four-laning of the road segment, direct and/or indirect impacts are generated which are
rather short-term as they are felt and manifested during the actual performance of the
construction activities. Modification of the actual worksites and material sources gives rise to
direct impacts, including disturbances to natural environment components such as air and
noise, flora and fauna, and water. Social impacts occur along the vicinity of the road nuisance
such as impairment of the usual access, community health and safety concerns, plus socio-
economic conflicts. Likewise, those temporary facilities allied to the construction, such as quarry
sites and borrow pits, excess soil disposal sites, contractor’s workers camps, and asphalt plants
generate also short-term impacts. It is expected that impacts from these types of activities will
cease once the contractor completes the project road and demobilizes from the site.

Considered in this study are those generated during the construction period as well as during
the operations period. Those that pertain to the construction shall serve as guidance to the
Contractor and Construction Supervision Consultant (CSC) or the Engineer for the
implementation of the project. While those for the operation shall be more of guidance to the
Client after the handing-over of the project by the Contractor.

5.1     Effects during Construction Period

In this short stretch of the Baku-Shamakhi Road (km 13.5-15) the primary disturbance along the
road corridor will entail generally earthworks such as removal of existing pavement, removal or

                                                             26

relocation of objects that are within the construction strip, laying of subbase and base course
layers and asphalt pavement, extension of necessary waterway crossings and installation of
road furniture. Detailed impacts are presented in the ensuing discussions.

5.1.1       Physical Environmental aspects
           (1) Roadway Earthworks
Since the road will be constructed on existing road and shoulder, no major cut or fill will be
done. Depending on the final design, road elevations may have to be modified to be at the same
level with the existing ones to which this segment will connect. Roadway cuts shall entail
excavation, removal and reusing, when proved to be suitable, for embankment/filling work.
Unsuitable soil materials shall be disposed in areas where it would be proven to be non-
detrimental to adjacent community and the environment. The work scope also includes all
excavation necessary for side ditches and relocation of underground utilities. Some excavation
and filling will be done at the extension of water way crossings. Taking all of these into
consideration, cut and fill works is expected to be minimal.

Since the 1.5km sections of the road will be constructed on existing road and shoulder, impacts
on major cut or fill are quite minimal. The four-laning of the existing road will entail the following
to conform to the new design:

    (i)      Scarifying and milling of the existing asphalt layers: Wearing Course, Binder Course
             and Bituminous Base Course

    (ii)     Excavation, removal and temporary stockpiling of the existing Crushed Base Layer
             and Granular Subbase

    (iii)    Excavation and laying of 30cm Capping Layer with CBR>15% from quarry sites;

    (iv)     Re-laying of thicker Granular Subbase from 33cm to 35cm, using stockpiled portion
             (excess Capping Layer and possibly from milled materials in conformance with the
             specified gradation);

    (v)      Re-laying of thicker Crushed Base Layer from 15cm to 25cm;

    (vi)     Re-laying of thicker Bituminous Base Course from 12cm to 21cm;

    (vii) Re-laying of thinner Binder Course from 10cm to 8cm; and

    (viii) Re-laying of Wearing Course of the same thickness (5cm)

Where new two-lane portion shall be constructed for the service roads, these will require the
following scope of the New Project Design:

    (i) Preparation of the road embankment layer as needed;

    (ii) Installing 30cm Capping Layer;

    (iii) Laying of 35cm Granular Subbase;

    (iv) Laying of 25cm Crushed Base Layer;

    (v) Laying of 21cm Bituminous Base Course;


                                                             27

    (vi) Laying of 8cm Binder Course; and

    (vii) Laying of 5cm Wearing Course.

The reconstruction of the new pavement will entail short term disturbance at the site consisting
of noise, dust, equipment emission, impairment of local community access. Noise can be
mitigated by proper scheduling the usage of equipment, installation of mufflers and regular
equipment maintenance and provision of noise barriers when needed. Dust can be routinely
minimized by watering of certain exposed areas and covering materials being hauled in trucks.
Location for temporary material stockpile can pose some localized issues which the Contractor
can resolve by proper planning.

In some areas, cut and fill for the new lanes to conform to the New Project Design may have to
be done along with the construction of side ditches for drainage. Roadway cuts shall entail
excavation, removal and reusing, when proved to be suitable, for embankment/filling work.
Unsuitable soil materials shall be disposed in areas where it would be proven to be non-
detrimental to adjacent community and the environment. The work scope also includes all
excavation necessary for side ditches and relocation of underground utilities. Some excavation
and filling will be done at the extension of water way crossings. The impacts of the cut and fill
works will be minimized by proper planning and determining sites to obtain materials or deposit
them when they are in excess. Re-cultivation of borrow areas should be done after their usage
and deposited materials should be stabilized by proper grading to allow natural re-vegetation.

          (2) Slope Stabilization
The road segment is generally flat although the terrain is sloping downward from the left-hand
side to the right-hand side. No major filling is anticipated to conform to cross-fall slope.
However, at the western end of the road where it connects to the km15 point, slope stabilization
will be needed as the road traverses over a canal. The downstream part of the canal drops into
a gully which means the roadsides in this area will be filled and side slopes of these
embankments will have to be stabilized. The fill area starts approximately at chainage 1+600 to
1+800. Fill embankments will be properly engineered, compacted and will have a stable slope.
Embankment near the canal will have adequate structural measures to prevent erosion and
collapse such as geo-mattress, riprap revetments, etc. It will be advisable also to undertake re-
vegetation in areas along the slope where plants or grasses can survive.

Minor cuts are indicated at from chainage 1+ 550 to the end at the left-hand side and from
1+785 to the end at the right-hand side. However, these cuts are shallow and stability will not be
a major issue. Normal grass cover may be sufficient for these shallow cut areas.

          (3) Culvert Construction/Extension
An existing culvert at km 1+650 will have to be extended due to the four-laning works. Some
demolition works may have to be done, however the Contractor should make sure that all
demolition debris are cleared from the water way. It may be advisable to perform the demolition
and construction works during the dry season to minimize any adverse water contamination.

Road access and normal traffic along Baku-Shamakhi Road should be maintained. If any traffic
re-routing needs to be done, sufficient advisory and notification should be provided to the
people and motorists. Dust and noise nuisances should be minimized during construction.
Protective barriers and fencing should be provided to prevent people and animals from loitering
at the project site for safety purposes.

The Contractor should also ensure that oil and fuel leakages are prevented and contained at the
vicinity of the culvert construction as part of the mitigating measures incorporated in the EMP to
prevent potential contamination of these water bodies. Special emphasis in the EMP pertaining

                                                             28

to fuels, oils and chemicals on the site should be on storage, handling procedure, and dealing
with small and large spills.

Construction at or near bodies of water such as streams, will be done as much as possible
during dry seasons where the disturbance to water quality will be negligible. To assure minimal
impacts, the contractor should do the following:

         Install cofferdams, silt fence, sediment barriers or other appropriate devices to prevent
          migration of silt during excavation and boring operation within rivers, streams or lakes.

         Dewatering and cleaning of cofferdams will be performed to prevent siltation, by
          pumping from cofferdams to a settling basin or a containment unit.

         Discharge of sediment-laden construction water (e.g., from areas containing dredged
          spoil) directly into surface watercourses will be forbidden.

         Sediment laden construction water will be discharged into settling lagoons or tanks prior
          to final discharge.

             (4)   Air and Noise Pollution

The Department of National Environmental Monitoring of the MENR conducts air quality
monitoring in a number of designated spots in in accordance with the statute “On the rules of
implementation of state monitoring of the environment and natural resources” prepared by the
Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, and approved by the resolution No.90 of the
Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 1 July, 2004. The Table below presents
the maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) as national limit values for some of the
substances in the ambient air.

During construction phase, it is expected that air quality will undergo some moderate and
temporary deterioration. Generally, dust from construction traffic and elevated levels of nitrogen
oxide (NOx) and sulphur oxide (SOx) from construction equipment exhaust will be the primary
pollutants. The dust will settle on local vegetation, structures and buildings, and may cause
some degree of respiratory stress to nearby residents. These impacts will be mitigated by
continuously spraying of water on the road construction site and in other areas where dust will
have to be controlled. The exhaust fumes from trucks and heavy equipment should meet
emission standards. With regards to other impacts, it is important that the contractor and the
local officials would be able to work together to control potential problems and minimize
complaints from the local population. Among the available measures to reduce air pollution and
emission levels are the following:




                                                             29

      (i)            maintenance of construction equipment to good running condition and avoidance, as
                     much as possible, of idling of engines which can contribute to exhaust emission;

      (ii)           banning of the use of machinery or equipment that cause excessive pollution (e.g.,
                     visible smoke) on account of their age and fuel consumption levels;

     (iii)           establishment of aggregate, asphalt, and concrete plants as far away as possible
                     (minimum 500 m) from human settlements and operation of such facilities within the
                     terms of Government pollution control guidelines;

     (iv)            submission of a dust suppression program which provides detailed action to be taken
                     to minimize dust generation and equipment to be used to ESS, PIU and CSC prior to
                     construction;

     (v)             Bypass roads may be located at considerable distance from residential areas to
                     minimize air quality impacts, among others;

During the road rehabilitation phase, heavy machinery will be used, and although these
activities may be intermittent and localized, they nevertheless contribute tremendous amounts
of sustained noise during equipment operation. In Azerbaijan noise standards were based on
the former Soviet Union standards as shown in the Table below:

A number of mitigating measures to minimize impacts of excessive noise and vibration can be
done by the contractor during the conduct of his work as follows:

             (i)       Work will be restricted to between 0600 to 2100 hours within 500m of the
                      settlements.

             (ii)     A limit of 70 dBA will be set in the vicinity of the construction site and strictly
                      followed;

             (iii)    Machinery to be used for the construction should be equipped with mufflers to
                      minimize the generation of noise;

             (iv)     Whenever possible the local population should be advised of occurrence of
                      elevated noise levels to enable them to take the necessary preparatory measures.


                                                             30

 Azer Road Service, Min. of Transport, Gov’t of Azerbaijan                                                   IBRD
Environmental Impact Assessment Report For Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15)             August 2015



The Contractor should provide additional measures to minimize noise upon the request of the
residents.

           (5) Water Contamination
During road construction a number of occurrences can cause water contamination. Wastewater
discharged during the construction phase will consist of wash-water from the equipment
maintenance shops and sanitary wastewater effluent from the work camps. The sanitary
wastewater from smaller camps should be equipped with septic tanks and that there will be no
direct discharge of untreated sanitary waste to surface water bodies. Bigger camps should have
waste water treatment plant. In addition there are possible contamination concerns that need to
be prevented as follows:

    a) During construction, provisions should be made to allow the passage thru pipes of raw
       sewage (existing open sewers) through pipes from villages, as well as irrigation waters,
       through the embankment.

    b) During waterways construction, the Contractor must exercise caution in discharging oily
       or human waste so as to prevent them from leaching into rivers.

    c) It is anticipated that all construction water will be taken from surface sources approved
       by the construction supervision engineer, and similar care shall be taken to ensure that
       human and oily waste is not discharged into existing watercourses.

    d) On completion of the Works the Contractor shall remove all sewage systems installed by
       him at work camps unless agreed otherwise with the construction supervision engineer.

Fuel and lubricant spills can, in most instances, occur at the Contractor’s work camp and motor
pool while maintaining and washing equipment and work vehicles. The oily wash-water should
be passed through an adequately sized, gravity oil separator prior to discharge.

As part of the requirement, the Contractor shall furnish the ESS and CSC a description and
layout of equipment maintenance areas and lubricant and fuel storage facilities including
distance from water sources and irrigation facilities. The storage facilities for fuels and
chemicals will be located away from watercourses and will be confined with impermeable lining
to contain spillage and prevent soil and water contamination. All fuels and chemicals shall be
stored and disposed properly in compliance with MENR requirements.

As part of the TOR indicated in the EMP and civil work contract, the Contractor will prepare the
specific prevention and mitigation measures to address potential fuel and oil leakages and
accidents that will pose risk to possible contamination of the water bodies nearby.

          (6) Solid and Hazardous Waste Management
Specifically on the construction of project road, considerable refuse materials will be generated
and have to be managed properly. The Contractor should establish appropriate solid waste or
garbage and hazardous waste management at the work camp and at the project site/s. The
Contractor shall collect and dispose of all garbage from houses, offices, camps and other
buildings occupied by him and the Engineer and from each area where his or the Engineer’s
employees are working, until completion of the Contract.

Domestic wastes from work camps, spoils from earthwork, and general construction waste will
be the responsibility of the Contractor, with regards to collection and disposal in conformance
with national and local standards. Spoil disposal sites will be identified prior to the start of
construction. Standards for restoration of spoil sites will be detailed in the contract documents.


                                                             31

Hazardous wastes generated during both construction and operation of the Project will likewise
be under the responsibility of the Contractor. Potential impacts to the environment are from
accidental spillages impacting soil, groundwater, and adjacent water bodies. Mitigation
measures to prevent spillage will include proper handling and disposal as well as installation of
appropriate hazardous storage facilities, in accordance with relevant standards.

Oil, fuel and chemicals (including bitumen, bridge deck water proofing agents and concrete) are
hazardous which could endanger life and would be detrimental to the environment. Spillage of
toxic substances could lead to pollution of groundwater and/or water course. During
construction, these should be stored properly and labeled directly in appropriate containers.
Bitumen, oil and fuel should be stored in tanks with lined bunds to contain spillage. Thus, the
construction camp should have a spill contingency plan. Stored waste oil, fuels and chemicals
could be periodically transported for disposal at the hazardous disposal site in Sumqayit, which
was constructed under the WB Urgent Environmental Investment Project. 3

The transport of hazardous materials from the construction site or contractor’s work camp need
to be regulated and monitored by the CSC and the ESS, with possible restrictions on routes and
time of travel to minimize, if not avoid, contact with populated areas. Transport vehicles should
certified by MENR with the proper qualification of the hauling contractor. Clear markings should
be conspicuous on the transporting vehicle. The transporting personnel should be trained to
handle emergency spills on the road for their own safety, as well as for the community and the
environment. Proper coordination and communication should be arranged between the
transporting company the local authorities and the MENR, especially during transporting
process.

The residues of toxic and hazardous materials or chemicals shall not be discharged to the
environment but shall be contained and packaged properly to be transported to approved and
appropriate disposal facilities. Such approved facility is located in Sumqayit City which is around
30 km northwest of Baku.

The materials or chemicals should be placed or stored in non-corrosive, non-reactive and
structurally stable containers for proper containment. These materials and chemicals should be
handled by trained personnel wearing proper protective gears for safety. They should be loaded
in vehicles with appropriate containment, preferably double skinned and equipped with
necessary systems according to the relevant regulations in Azerbaijan. These required systems
shall consist of heating, ventilation, isolation, lightning conductor or arresters, alarm and fire
extinguishing. Notifications on sides of the vehicles shall be made by appropriate warning signs
in languages understandable to the local population (Azeri, English or Russian) and
conspicuously displayed for easy recognition. The hazards that might arise during loading, and
unloading as well as the corresponding precautions against these hazards shall be posted on
the vehicles. The materials and chemical on the vehicles shall be properly labeled with the
accompanying Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).

During transport, the transporter should choose the safest and shortest distance from the
project site to disposal facility. Preferably the route should avoid populated areas where traffic
and congestion might occur. The transporter should obtain appropriate clearance from relevant
agencies and should coordinate with local officials as precautionary measures against spills.
Communication between the transporter, the source of the materials or chemicals as well as the
staff of the receiving disposal facility should be maintained during transport.

In case of spill or any accident, the transporter should execute proper action as soon as
possible to contain the contamination. It is incumbent upon the transporting company to provide
sufficient training to their personnel to adequately respond to the spill at the shortest possible
time. Tools, devices and protective gears should be available inside the vehicles compartment
for the transporting personnel to effectively execute containment measures. Guidelines should
be clear to the transporters putting public safety as their priority.

5.1.2    Ancillary Facilities
The ancillary facilities to the construction works are the material sources, work camps and
processing plants. Impacts will be generated by activities in these areas and they have to be
considered as part of the roadwork construction.

          (1) Borrow and Quarry Areas
The four-laning will entail usage of materials in the existing road and additional volumes for the
new two lanes and two service road lanes. After comparing the New Project Design with the
Existing Road for the 1.5km section, it is likely that for the reconstruction of existing pavement,
new materials would have to be imported from quarries. The volume of materials that will be
used for the road substructure can be estimated by simplified computations base on the road
geometry as shown below:

                   Table 12: Computation Table for Road Material Requirements

                                                                       Designs (cm)

The excess milled materials from the asphalt layers of the Existing Road can be used in the
New Project Pavement layers, after verification in accordance with specified parameters. From
the environmental point of view the recycling of old asphalt as raw materials in new asphalt mix
proves to be beneficial. Savings in the bitumen can likewise be realized with the reuse of old
asphalt pavement. As shown, the amount of materials will not be a lot and this will not
significantly impact the existing quarries near the project road.

If materials from the old road will not be sufficient or if unsuitable materials are found along the
new carriage ways, suitable materials will have to be transported from borrow or quarry areas.
Materials from borrow areas and will be used for fill, capping layer, granular subbase, crushed

base course, and bituminous base course. Several potential borrow areas already being used in
the on-going construction can also be used or other areas used by previous road construction
such as those used in R6 Road (Tagiyev-Sahil Road). The prospective Contractor can identify
his source of materials. However, the materials need to be approved by the Construction
Supervision Engineer prior to using them for the project road. Should the Contractor be sourcing
the materials from existing and operational quarry site, he will be required to exert influence on
the operator that proper operational and management measures be instituted to minimize
impacts to the general environment. Should the Contractor decide to open a new borrow site,
the guidelines below should be followed in order to minimize impacts associated with the
operation of borrow areas:

                  All of the required environmental approvals should be secured and extraction and
                   rehabilitation activities consistent with the requirements of MENR and/or permit
                   conditions be carried out;

                  Prior to operation of the borrow areas, the contractor should submit to ESS and
                   construction supervision consultant (CSC) the following:

                             1) A plan indicating the location of the proposed extraction site as well as
                                rehabilitation measures to be implemented for the borrow areas and
                                access roads upon project completion;

                             2) A dust management plan which shall include schedule for spraying
                                water on access road and schedule of the equipment to be used;

                             3) A schedule of regular dust suppression on all unpaved access roads
                                during the construction period, particularly in sections where critical
                                receptors, such as settlements, are located;

                             4) Location map of stockpiles which should be away from watercourses
                                to avoid obstruction of flow and siltation;

                             5) Cover on haul trucks to minimize dust emission and material spillage;

                             6) Plan to undertake regular maintenance and repair of access roads to
                                their original condition whenever necessary.

The EMP will provide specific guideline to ensure that these prevention and /or mitigating
measures are carried out and the proper authorities will undertake regular monitoring of its
implementation and compliance by the Contractor.

         (2) Asphalt Plant Operation
An asphalt plant is where aggregate materials and asphalt are heated, mixed and combined to
produce a paving mix. The primary ingredient in the process consists of crushed stone, sand,
and asphalt oil, which is a by-product of petroleum. The entire mixture is heated to
approximately 300 degrees Fahrenheit in a revolving tubular drum. Generally, the resulting
emissions are:

                   a) Steam from moisture naturally contained within the sand and/or stone;

                   b) Heat due to the temperatures;

                   c) Minute dust particles from the aggregate during mixing;

                                                             34

 Azer Road Service, Min. of Transport, Gov’t of Azerbaijan                                           IBRD
Environmental Impact Assessment Report For Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15)                   August 2015



                   d) Gaseous odour.

Due to the above reasons, a number of considerations need to be followed in determining the
site for a prospective asphalt plant to minimize impact to the environment and the adjacent
communities such as:

    1) Asphalt plants must be located downwind of settlements at a distance of 500 meters or
       more and ensure that the prevailing winds will not carry solid emissions to the
       community ;

    2) The Contractor shall secure approval from the MENR for installation and operation of
       asphalt plants;

    3) Asphalt plants shall not be located close to plantations and productive land.

    4) Petroleum products stored at batch plant sites are to be contained properly and
       appropriate measures must be taken to ensure the protection of surface and ground
       water;

    5) Dust control measures should be performed on gravel roads used for the transportation
       of material to and from temporary asphalt plants;

    1) Any discarded asphalt, tar mix, heavy oil, etc. must be disposed of in an environmentally
       friendly manner and/or reused wherever possible.

    2) the Contractor shall have provisions for spill and fire protection equipment and shall
       submit an Emergency Response Plan (in case of spills, accidents, fires and the like) to
       the ESS and CSC prior to operation of the plant; and

    6) Prior to dismantling the facility the asphalt plant site shall be left in an aesthetically
       acceptable condition.

One of possible concerns relating to asphalt plants is the contamination of surrounding water
bodies, which may be caused by spilled bitumen or any petroleum products used to thin the
bitumen. Long periods of storage can increase the propensity of leakages which can cause
contamination. Precautionary measures should be exercised to prevent bitumen from spilling
into running or dry streambeds, ditches, or solid waste disposal sites prepared by the contractor.
The storage and mixing areas for bitumen must be protected against spills and all contaminated
soil must be properly handled according to the requirements of the MENR. These areas must be
contained, such that any spills can be immediately mitigated and cleaned up as soon as such
incident arises.

            (3) Contractor’s Work Camp
The impacts from Contractor’s work camp become significant especially when there are a lot of
people staying at the camp. The main concerns for water contamination are the sanitary
facilities or ablution including toilets, urinals, showers, washstands and a laundry area. Water
should be provided in adequate quantity and acceptable quality complying with the national
standards. Provisions of such facilities should conform to local and cultural traditions of the
project site. In addition, safety and security of the area should be maintained at all times. Areas
to be used as work camps or for purposes of the project should be approved by the local
authorities and the construction supervision engineer.




                                                             35

The civil works contract will require the Contractor to be responsible for temporary acquisition
and reinstatements of all lands needed outside the road reserve – for construction camps,
offices, borrow pits, material storage/processing sites and haul roads. The Contractor will select
the land parcels required and negotiate directly with the landowner.

Within the work camp, the Contractor should exercise reasonable measures to prevent harm
and to minimize the impact of his operations on the environment and socio-economic conditions
along the road, and shall ensure that his employees do likewise. The Contractor shall make his
employees aware that the hunting, trapping or dealing in wildlife will not be tolerated and shall
take all possible steps to ensure that his employees and those of his sub-contractors do not
engage in these activities. The contractor is expected to provide means to minimize work camp
environmental problems as follows:

    1. The Contractor shall prepare a layout of the work camp and details of the proposed
       measures to address adverse environmental impacts resulting from its installation. Such
       plans shall be submitted to the ARS/PIU-ESS and construction supervision engineer
       prior to establishment of the work camps and implement provisions of such plans. Prior
       to establishment of the work camps, conduct consultations with local authorities to
       identify sources of water that will not compete with the local population.

    2. The Contractor shall establish a solid waste management plan covering provision of
       garbage bins, regular collection and disposal in a hygienic manner, as well as proposed
       disposal sites for various types of wastes (e.g., domestic waste, used tires, etc.)
       consistent with appropriate local and national regulations. In addition, spoil from
       earthwork, and general construction wastes are the responsibility of the contractor to
       collect and dispose of in conformance with local standards. Spoil disposal sites will be
       identified prior to the start of construction.

    3. To control dust nuisance within the work camp and to minimize impact in the
       surrounding community the contractor shall undertake measures such as watering of the
       areas, covering of any nearby stockpiles and provision of any re-vegetation measures.

    4. All water used in the work camp shall be discharged in a manner which does not cause
       erosion, pollution or nuisance to landowners, or other persons within or adjacent to the
       work camp. The Contractor shall take all measures necessary to prevent the discharge
       into rivers, streams or existing irrigation or drainage systems of any water containing
       pollutants or visible suspended matter. The contractor shall not interfere with the natural
       flow of rivers, streams, or existing irrigation or drainage systems for any purpose without
       the prior consent of the construction supervision engineer.

    5. The Contractor shall come up with sewage management plan for provision of sanitary
       latrines and proper sewage collection and disposal system to prevent pollution of
       watercourses and subsurface waters.

    6. The Contractor shall provide a description and layout of equipment maintenance areas
       and lubricant and fuel storage facilities including distance from water sources and
       irrigation facilities. Storage facilities for fuels and chemicals will be located away from
       watercourses. Such facilities will be bounded and provided with impermeable lining to
       contain spillage and prevent soil and water contamination.

    7. In terms of erosion and siltation concerns, the Contractor shall take all precautions to
       prevent the erosion of soil from any land used or occupied by him, and from the bed or
       banks or any river, stream, irrigation or drainage system. Likewise, the contractor shall


                                                             36

         take all precautions to prevent the deposition of excavated or eroded material in any
         river, stream, irrigation or drainage system.

    8. In the interests of preserving native vegetation, the contractor is prohibited from using
       tree parts from the site for any aspect of the construction of his facilities or those for the
       Engineer. This includes props and other items needed to cast lintels and the like. Further
       the contractor shall not use wood burning stoves for cooking or heating.

    9. The Contractor shall realize that local markets will not be able to supply bulk food
       supplies for his labor force without causing severe shortages for the local population.
       Bulk food supplies shall only be purchased from towns approved by the construction
       supervision engineer.

5.1.3    Community Social Impacts
           (1) General Community Impacts
To avoid any conflicts between construction workers and nearby communities with respect to
social amenities, the Contractor shall provide temporary worksite facilities such as health care,
eating space, and praying places preferably within the work camp. Likewise, in anticipation of
effectively handling social issues, the contractor shall also submit to ESS and CSC a plan
(mechanism and organizational structure) for handling and resolution of communities’
grievances arising from the construction processes – Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).
Avenues for dialogues and consultations should be provided at all times to deal with community
issues.

Whenever possible, the Contractor shall employ local labor to benefit local communities and to
promote the overall acceptance of the project. For Baku-Shamakhi (km13.5-15) Road the
Contractor shall look into the possibility of hiring local groups to undertake cleaning of drains
during this construction period. As part of the maintenance of the road the ARS should also look
into the possibility of employing the local people for the maintenance of roadside drains upon
completion of rehabilitation works.

During the construction phase, it may be inevitable that existing traffic will be disrupted and local
accessibility will be impaired, which can cause problems with the local community. To mitigate
this situation the Contractor should: (1) Submit a traffic management plan to local traffic
authorities prior to mobilization; (2) Provide information to the public about the scope and
schedule of construction activities and expected disruptions and access restrictions; (3) Allow
for adequate traffic flow around construction areas; (4) Provide adequate signalization,
appropriate lighting, well-designed traffic safety signs, barriers and flag persons for traffic
control; and (5) Provide temporary access where accessibility is temporarily restricted due to
civil works.

Should the Contractor use any areas for borrow materials, any access roads should be
maintained during the construction phase and rehabilitated at the end of construction by the
contractor and his workers to the satisfaction of the local authorities and in compliance with the
contract. Compliance shall be monitored by the construction supervision engineer.

Since there are a number of establishments along the road, the Contractor should be able to
maintain accessibility to these establishments to minimize economic impacts on such
businesses. Along the alignment itself, no impacts on cultural property, e.g. graveyards and
cultural monuments, adjacent to the ROW are anticipated. However, access by the local
community to these areas should be maintained by the contractor.

            (2)    Health and Safety


                                                             37

Work camps and construction sites need to be properly managed in terms of general sanitation
in order to avoid any health and safety hazards to surrounding communities. The Contractor
should designate a qualified environmental, health and safety personnel who will anticipate and
address hygienic issues in coordination with the MOH’s Regional Disinfection Centre and the
local health and safety officer. Extra precautions should be exercised to prevent the entry and
transmission of diseases into the work camp and the surrounding communities. It will be the
responsibility of the Contractor to provide the following:

      (i)     Adequate health care facilities (including first aid facilities) within construction sites
              and work camps;

      (ii)    Training of all construction workers in basic sanitation and health care matters, and
              on the specific hazards of their work;

     (iii)    Issuing personal protection gadget, gears, clothing and equipment for workers, such
              as safety boots, helmets, gloves, protective clothing, goggles, and ear protection in
              accordance with SNIP III 4-80;

     (iv)     Clean drinking water to all workers at all times;

     (v)      Adequate protection for the general public, including safety barriers and marking of
              hazardous areas in accordance with safety regulations for construction, rehabilitation
              and maintenance, 1978;

     (vi)     Safe access through the construction site to people whose residences/shelters and
              routes are temporarily severed by road construction;

    (vii)     Adequate drainage throughout the camps to ensure that stagnant water bodies and
              puddles that may serve as breeding ground for any disease vectors do not form; and

   (viii)     Sanitary latrines and garbage bins in construction site, which will be periodically
              maintained and cleared for safe disposal by the contractors to prevent outbreak of
              diseases. Where feasible the contractor will arrange for safe disposal of waste
              generated at the work sites into existing waste collection systems and disposal
              facilities of nearby communities.

As part of the general health preparation, the Contractor should coordinate this with the AIDS
Centre in Baku to obtain practical advice regarding general health care. Awareness campaign
on the avoidance of HIV/AIDS and STD involving both the local community and the construction
workers should be undertaken in conformance to the requirements of the Department of
Hygiene and Environmental Protection.

Applicable HIV/AIDS prevention activities recommended in the Scott Wilson Report for the Alat
Astara Motorway Project shall be adopted as part of the Baku-Shamakhi (km13.5-15) Project
intervention and incorporated as EMP activities. These activities will focus primarily on
information campaign, condom distribution for the contractor’s workers and staff as well as
liaison and coordination with the local and national health authorities especially the AIDS
Monitoring Centers for monitoring and appropriate action.

         (3) Land Acquisition
To minimize property impact the proposed four-laning will be undertaken with the existing ROW.
The road is relatively straight and without need for curvature correction. No private properties
were affected but only ornamental plant boxes installed by the local authority.

5.1.4    Biological Aspects - Impacts on Flora and Fauna
For the short segment of the Baku-Shamakhi (km13.5-15) Road the impacts to vegetation and
wildlife is not expected to be significant and sizeable since the rehabilitation work will be
confined within the ROW. In addition, the vicinity of the road is already highly built-up with
commercial establishments and residences such that anthropogenic activities dissuade the
occurrence of wildlife.

Direct impacts to trees, except those planted in ornamental plant boxes, will be minimal. Only
one tree seem to be affected – a mature willow tree in the vicinity of chainage 0+100 – 0+250 at
the right-hand side of the road. An artificial tree plantation is found adjacent to both sides of the
road at chainage 0+400 – 0+600 LHS and at 0+450 – 0+650 RHS. However, these are outside
of the construction strip and no tree will be felled by the construction.

Disturbance on flora and fauna can occur at the ancillary facilities. The Contractor should follow
guidelines on protecting and not disturbing any flora and fauna in the vicinity of his ancillary
facilities.


5.1.5    Socio-economic Impacts

During the site inspection along the road certain observations indicate foreseeable potential
direct and indirect impact during the construction of phase of the road. These should be taken
into consideration by the Contractor in his works with the supervision of the Construction
Supervision Consultant or the Engineer.

At the right side of the project road direct impacts can be expected on
    - Landscaping plant boxes planted with grass cover and small decorative bushes and
        young Cypresses;
    - Bus stop,
    - Artificial plantation of Pines and Cypress trees,
    - Street lamps; and
    - Natural canyon with permanent water stream.

Indirect impacts can be anticipated on the following structures and establishments:
    - Agro-market; selling various agro-technical devises;
    - Water pumping station;
    - Road Police Station;
    - Market;
    - Wedding palace; car service boxes;
    - Natural canyon with permanent water stream; and
    - 38 private houses
    - To be affected indirectly during construction works.

At the left hand side of the road, direct impact will be expected on
    - Landscaping plant boxes planted with grass cover and small decorative bushes and
        young Cypresses;
    - Bus stops;
    - Trees;
    - Parking area;
    - Natural canyon with permanent flow; and
    - Semi-desert landscape.



                                                             39

Environmental Impact Assessment Report For Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15)                 August 2015



Indirect impacts to will be on:
     - A number of trees;
     - Mini market for construction materials;
     - Water-pumping station;
     - Markets;
     - Car repair shops;
     - Thirty-seven (37) private houses;
     - Natural canyon with permanent flow; and
     - Semi-desert landscape.

The table below summarizes these potential socioeconomic impacts.

Mitigation of impacts may not be so straightforward at times because options may be limited.
Along the short stretch of the Baku-Shamakhi (km 13.5-15), the directly affected objects
generally consist of community social amenities such as landscaping plant boxes, bus stops,
some trees in the artificial tree plantations, lampposts, 1 mature tree, natural canyon and semi-
desert areas. Minimization will consist of providing for a four lane road with minimal impact, by
avoiding as much as possible these objects along the construction strip. Currently, the design is
yet to be finalized; hence, the avoidance should be considered by the designers.
If in case, certain objects cannot be avoided, these affected objects should be relocated or
reconstructed to other relocations outside of the construction strip.

In general, the following measures can be applied accordingly:

        landscaping plant boxes – relocate or replace in kind; or if not possible compensate the
         municipality;
        bus stops - relocate or replace in kind;
        some trees in the artificial tree plantations – replace them at least 1:2 ratio in designated
         areas;
        lampposts relocate or replace in kind;
        1 mature tree - – replace them at least 1:2 ratio in designated areas;
        natural canyon and semi-desert areas – maintain or ecologically improve by revegetation

Indirectly impacted objects are outside of the construction strip but their proximity causes the
impacts to be felt. These consist of structures, houses, utilities, businesses and a police office.
Mitigation measures for these identified objects include ensuring that levels of dust and noise
are kept minimum, access is not impaired, businesses are not disrupted, structures are not
damaged and residents and the general public sufficiently notified of safety hazards. The
Contractor should ensure that complaints from the residents, owners, occupants and operators
of these objects are responded to promptly. The objective is to avoid any impact; followed by
minimization and compensation if the impacts cannot be minimized.

These indirect impacts are mainly due to the construction activities and they will diminish once
construction is completed.

Environmental Impact Assessment Report For Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15)               August 2015




5.2     Impacts & Measures during Operation and Maintenance Period

Over the operations period of the road segment, along with the entire Baku-Shamakhi Road, the
impacts to the environment are rather viewed as cumulative on account of the functions of the
road components and can be in conjunction with other activities. Time-wise these impacts can
also be long-term as they may manifest after construction and continue to persist for the entire
usage and operation of the road. Considering the short stretch of the road most of the impacts
anticipated will be on the social environment, as the physical and environmental features are
shielded by the cluster of settlements alongside the alignment.

5.2.1    Effects on Biodiversity
As mentioned, due to prominent presence of the settlement, animals tend to avoid the area. The
road itself is in the middle of Mushfiq and & Ashagi-Gusdak such that before any animals will
reach the location of the road, the residential settlements will be encountered. Hence, the
chances that animals will reach the road are diminished. Some animals may use the
Sumgaitchay River tributary as this can be attractive to some amphibians and reptiles. To
minimize migration up the road, the designers should install some barriers along the waterway
to discourage reptiles and amphibians from getting onto the roadway.

5.2.2    Water Quality
Concerns on water contamination and pollution arise when effluents and discharges leach into
waterways and water bodies. During the operational phase of the road, it is expected that traffic
will increase and businesses along the roadside will flourish such as small shops, restaurants,
vehicle repair shops and other service-related establishments. Production and manufacturing
businesses will also intensify in the area due to improved accessibility other similar
establishments will be set up along the road or close to the road. It can be expected that with
the construction of a better road the population will also increase and the current settlement can
expand or new settlements and villages will be established. With the increase in population and
intensification of economic activities, wastewater from these establishments, if unmanaged and
uncontrolled properly, will eventually cause pollution of existing water bodies. This will translate
to adverse effects on the ecosystem and on the welfare of the people.

To mitigate this, the national and local government should work together to implement programs
and projects that would curb water contamination and pollution. This will entail formulation of
environmental policies and regulations on proper wastewater management. In addition,
wastewater infrastructure should be constructed and operated properly, especially in the
populated areas and where commercial activities are concentrated along the project road.

To improve safety, traffic management should be implemented such as regulation of speed and
checking of vehicles carrying toxic and hazardous substances by responsible traffic personnel
to see if adequate safety measures are being adhered to during transport. Spills along the road
should be promptly reported to proper authorities, who should be able to respond quickly in
removing deleterious substances from the road.

5.2.3    Air Quality and Noise
With the four-laning of the Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15, the vehicular traffic is expected
to increase. Because of this, vehicular emissions and noise levels are anticipated to heighten.
Attenuation measures against exhaust emissions and noise pollution should be implemented in
areas with sensitive receptors such as residential areas, particularly schools, health centers,
and hospitals. This can be done by planting trees and shrubs with dense leaves to deflect noise
and provide absorption capacities for exhaust emissions. Certain species of trees, that can


                                                             43

thrive in the study region should be planted and cared for until maturity by the community.
Planting of trees in the general vicinity, wherever possible, should be encouraged.

In the future should the noise level reach intolerable levels, some structural noise barriers can
be constructed along the edge of the road to deflect traffic noise and minimize nuisance in the
populated areas. Areas where structural measures may be needed, subject to the design
specifications, shall be in the vicinity of vicinity of the sensitive receptors like schools, hospitals,
etc.

5.3      ‘Without Project’ Scenario

The Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15) serves at the connecting link between the four-lane
stretches of the Baku-Shamakhi road. If this road will not be reconstructed to a four-lane, in the
future, this can be a traffic chokepoint. Congestion of vehicles will occur and heavy traffic may
be experienced on both sides. With heavy traffic, delays will be incurred and can result to
economic loss. The continuous burning of fuel when vehicles are idle because of the traffic can
cause degradation of air quality and elevation of noise. In the end, whatever gains that would be
garnered by the entire Baku-Shamakhi Road can be diminished by the non-upgrading of the Km
13.5-15 segment; hence, this project is essential.

6.      ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) identifies the mitigation measures, monitoring
activities and institutional arrangements to be implemented to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to
acceptable levels any adverse environmental and social impacts of the road rehabilitation
project. The following subsections discuss the EMP for Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15).

6.1    Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Program

The environmental mitigation and monitoring programs summarized in Annexes A and B have
been devised to ensure proper response with the identified project impacts, which may arise
during the construction and operation phase of the project road. Prior to the construction, the
ESS with the assistance of the Construction Supervision Consultant will do the following for the
Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15):

             Establish baseline information on the existing environmental conditions and
              parameters for the specific road project;

             Develop an environmental auditing protocol for the construction period as well as a
              detailed monitoring and management plan;

             Provide guidance and formulate a report outline that will be used by the contractor as
              a guide in the preparation of monthly environmental progress reports; and

             Undertake regular and periodic monitoring of contractor’s implement ation of the
              mitigation measures during the construction stage, consistent with the monitoring
              program, and submit to PIU-ARS quarterly monitoring reports. Special separate
              reports should be prepared in the event a significant environment related incident will
              arise.

             The PIU will provide the WB a summary of the monitoring results on a quarterly
              basis.



                                                             44

In addition, environmental management activities should form part of the Internal Monitoring
System. The purpose of such system is to track progress of as well as changes in civil work
activities as well as monitor effects and impact of the road construction and rehabilitation on the
households and communities along the road. The ARS OJSC will be responsible for the
establishment of the monitoring system with the assistance of the Supervision Consultant and
the Civil Works Contractor, whose scope will be specified in the terms of reference for the work
contract.

6.2    Institutional Arrangements and Reporting

To ensure that the proposed mitigation measures will be implemented by the contractor/s during
the construction stage, the detailed engineering consultant will undertake the following:

             Clearly define in the tender and contract documents the contractor’s obligation to
              undertake and implement environmental mitigation measures as specified in the
              Environmental Mitigation Plan outlined in Annex A. The same shall be appended in
              Contract Specifications;

             The cost for the recommended environmental mitigation measures will, where
              possible, be itemized as cost items in the Bill of Quantities. Such allocation of a cost
              item to specific environmental mitigation measure will be crucial to assure their
              actual implementation. During procurement or bidding, the bidders will be specifically
              instructed to include these cost items as line items in the Bill of Quantities to form
              part of their financial bids; and

             Explicitly require the Contractor to recruit an environmental, health and safety (EHS)
              personnel who will be specifically responsible in handling environmental issues of the
              project.

The Contractor will be responsible for the implementation of environmental mitigation measures
during construction and shall employ an EHS personnel who will supervise implementation of
the Contractor’s environmental responsibilities as stipulated in the contract and liaise with the
ESS and the district ARS on such matters. Likewise, the EHS personnel will also be responsible
for health and safety aspects of work sites and shall submit monthly reports to ESS on the
status of implementation of mitigation measures, including complaints received and actions
taken as well as other environmental issues relating to the project. The Contractor, in
coordination with the construction supervision consultant, shall set-up a grievance redress
committee that will deal with any complaints during project implementation.

Also, during project implementation, the ESS with the assistance of the CSC shall monitor the
compliance of the Contractor in accordance with the EMP provisions. The ESS shall submit
quarterly reports to ARS and the MENR describing the status of implementation of
environmental mitigation measures by the contractors. Included in the reports are additional
mitigation measures that may need to be implemented, incidents of non-compliance with
applicable environmental permits, complaints received from local residents, NGOs, etc. and
ways and means by which, they were addressed or settled.



It is advisable that the CSC shall employ an expatriate environment specialist (with civil
engineering/environmental management background) to assist the ESS in the monitoring the
progress of the construction on its environmental aspect. The CSC, through its environment
specialist, shall provide hands-on training to the ESS throughout various stages of the
construction. The CSC shall also assist the ESS in preparing monitoring reports regarding the

                                                             45

performance of the contractors in terms of compliance with the relevant national environmental
regulations, quality standards and the implementation of environmental specifications in
accordance with the contract provisions. The Terms of Reference (ToR) for the environmental
specialist shall be drawn-up by the detailed engineering consultants for the road project.

During project implementation, the ARS (through the PIU) will report to the World Bank-IBRD
every three (3) months on the progress of the project based on the monitoring reports submitted
by the ESS/CSC and the contractor.



Upon project completion and subsequent acceptance by the ARS, the same will be responsible
on the operation and maintenance of the Project Road. Routine and random environmental
monitoring will be undertaken by ARS district offices as scheduled in the monitoring plan (Annex
B). Parallel to this the MENR will conduct random monitoring of the project to assess
compliance with the required mitigation measures and applicable environmental laws and
regulations. Should the ARS plan for full public participation activities, a detailed action plan
should be devised with adequate funding from Azerbaijan government.

6.5    Institutional Strengthening

In the implementation of projects, often one major issue is the incorporation of the requirements
for environmental mitigation and monitoring in the contract documents even though the EMP
was adequately prepared. Accordingly, it becomes difficult to enforce the needed environmental
mitigating measures in projects, particularly due to lack of reference of these items in the project
contract. It is important that this item be adequately emphasized on the part of ESS for
compliance by the Contractor. Furthermore, the level of expertise of ESS to undertake
environmental management and monitoring should also be upgraded.

In the past some training had been formulated and implemented in line with institutional building
and capacity building of staff from various agencies dealing with environmental regulations and
control, especially the ESS-ARS OJSC. The topics elaborated in the training covered a range of
environmental management and related issues relevant to the road construction sector in
Azerbaijan such as Introduction to Construction Noise, Ecology, Environmental Good Practice,
Waste Management; Good Practice on site – Dust, Ecology, Noise, Smoke & Odours, Trees,
Water Management, Map Reading, Borrow Pit/Quarry, Oils & Chemicals; and Traffic Impacts on
Air Quality.

                                                                48

Environmental Impact Assessment Report For Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 13.5-15)               August 2015




To respond to the requirements of the environmental monitoring activities, the gaps in the
previous training should be assessed. Accordingly, based on these identified gaps, it is
proposed that additional measures be provided to address these gaps, as guide to good
practices in ensuring compliance by Contractors to the environmental regulatory measures.
On this note the assistance of an international environmental specialist will be useful. The
matter of capability and capacity building on the part of the ESS should form part of the
proposed Terms of Reference of the international environment specialist who will conduct the
ESS/district ARS training and orientation for contractors. The following are the basic scope of
the international environment specialist among others:

        Assess the capacity of the ESS and district ARS and determine the specific additional
         training needs to respond to the requirements in conducting environmental monitoring
         and implementation of mitigation measures of road projects;

        Prepare a short-term staff training prospectus and associated materials to meet
         immediate needs;

        Undertake training workshops that will include the following topics:

               Establishment of baseline data at the start of the project for reckoning project
                environmental impacts.

               Preparation of EMPs and incorporation of the mitigating measures in contract
                documents and specifications for Consulting Services and Works contracts;

               Procedures for monitoring the implementation of mitigating measures including
                target parameters, frequency, responsibilities and means of monitoring;

               Health and safety procedures in project implementation.

        Conduct orientation/workshop for contractors on construction-related environmental
         issues on road projects, implementation of mitigation measures and monitoring, and
         preparation of monitoring reports;

        Evaluate the effectiveness of the training measuring improvements in attitudes and skills
         achieved through a combination of feedback questionnaires and performance
         evaluation; and

        Prepare outline proposals for the longer-term organizational and capability development
         of ESS and district ARS.

A typical ESS/ARS staff training will consist of lecture-type presentation of the general
procedure and requirements for effective environmental monitoring. This will be followed by a
more detailed on-the-job and hands-on training at the construction site where the trainees will
participate in the activities of the international environmental specialist/construction supervision
staff in reviewing the contractor’s reports, periodic monitoring inspections, and deliberation of
environmental issues involving the contractor and the project stakeholders, and finally the
accomplishment of environmental reports. The field trainings should coincide with peak work
activity at the site to provide a first-hand observation of the following environmental issues:

        Erosion and slope stability issues;
        Discharges to water bodies;

                                                             49

         Disturbance on biodiversity;
         Dust suppression;
         Exhaust emissions;
         Noise abatement measures;
         Protection against oil spillage;
         Quarry, borrow pits and asphalt plant operations;
         Site health and safety, sanitary facilities, etc.;
         Public safety, traffic management, child safety, etc.
         Documentation in dealing with public complaints and conflict resolution.
