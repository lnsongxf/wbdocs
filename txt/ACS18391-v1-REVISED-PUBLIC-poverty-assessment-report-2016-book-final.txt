            1.	   Uganda’s progress in reducing poverty from 1993 to 2006 is
                  a remarkable story of success that has been well told. Annual
                  reductions in the national poverty rate of 1.9 percentage points a year
                  resulted from the restoration of peace and stability to much of the
                  country after Yoweri Museveni came into power in 1986, the series of
                  economic liberalization reforms that were implemented in the 1990s, and
 OVERVIEW         the investments of households and firms that these encouraged (see for
                  example, Collier and Reinikka 2003; World Bank 2007).


            2.	   The narrative of Uganda’s continued, albeit slightly slower, progress
                  in reducing poverty since 2006 is less familiar. Uganda reduced the
                  proportion of people living on less than US$1.90 per person per day
                  by 2.7 percentage points per year, the second fastest percentage point
                  reduction in extreme poverty per year in Sub-Saharan Africa during this
                  period.1 The national poverty rate continued to fall by 1.6 percentage
                  points per year. However, during this time the national poverty line, set
                  using data from 1993, became an increasingly poor standard against
                  which to measure who was poor.


            3.	   This was a period in which growth slowed as the gains from reforms
                  years earlier had been fully realized, and weak infrastructure and
                  increasing corruption increasingly constrained private sector
                  competitiveness (World Bank 2015). How, in this context, was Uganda
                  still able to secure inclusive consumption growth for many of its citizens?
                  Understanding the drivers of recent poverty reduction is important
                  for offering lessons on how to reduce poverty further in the future not
                  only in Uganda, but also for other countries in the region that have not
                  experienced such progress.


            4.	   This report examines Uganda’s progress in reducing poverty, with
                  a specific focus on the period 2006 to 2013. The report shows that
                  high growth from 2006 to 2010 benefited poverty reduction. Although
                  growth slowed for all households from 2010, poor households were able
                  to maintain above average consumption growth and poverty reduction
                  did not falter. Agricultural income growth particularly benefited poor
                  households aided by peace in northern Uganda, improved regional
                  markets, and good weather. Modest gains in education also appear to
                  have contributed to the growth for poor households, as did urbanization.
                  However there was little fundamental change in the nature of production
                  that benefited poverty reduction—either in agriculture or in other sectors.
                  In addition, persistently high dependency ratios held back poverty
                  reduction, and limited spending on safety nets resulted in fiscal policy

                  Chad, which reduced the extreme poverty rate by 3.1 percentage points per year. This is using

cost-of-basic-needs approach. Consumption expenditure data is collected on food and non-food items through the UNHS conducted every three to
four years. The poverty line was set in 1993 by calculating the cost of consuming 3,000 calories per adult equivalent and then adding an amount (the
amount depending on the region) to capture non-food expenditures. The poverty line has only been updated for the cost of inflation since then and is
low by international standards.

 This appears to have been the case for both rural-urban migration and rural-rural migration in which migrants
 often came from remote, conflict affected rural areas. Migration can also aid poverty reduction through the
 remittances that it allows. Currently little is known about the role of remittances in bringing about poverty
 reduction in Uganda.

                                               (henceforth referred to as 1993, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010, and 2013), and (b)

                                               The UNHS is a nationally representative cross-section and it is from this series

   BOX 1: Use of Panel Data for Poverty Analysis

   This report draws on the nationally representative UNPS to analyze the drivers of welfare changes in
   Uganda over time. Panel data provides a number of advantages for the analysis of welfare outcomes.
   It allows the same household to be followed over time, making it possible to calculate the income and
   consumption growth of a given household over time. Panel data also allows for regression analysis to
   look at how changes in the characteristics or behavior of the household or individual over time have
   contributed to changes in welfare. This is arguably a stronger basis for identifying what has caused welfare
   improvements than just looking at the characteristics of those that are poor or non-poor.

   However, caution is still warranted in drawing causal conclusions from panel analysis, as it is possible
   that a characteristic of the household not captured in the analysis allowed the household to both change
   behavior and experience welfare gains. Inferring that the behavior change caused this improvement would
   be erroneous. The core pieces of analysis in Chapters 4 and 6 thus rely on changes that can be considered
   exogenous.

   In addition, the attrition present in panel surveys—and in the UNPS in particular—makes it less
   representative of Ugandan households over time. Households that stay in their original location are more
   likely to be found in a successive visit, but households that have moved or new households that have formed
   from old households are less likely to be found. Controlling for attrition in the analysis is difficult. This has
   been addressed in this report by: (a) not using the UNPS to develop descriptive statistics if the same variable
   is available in the UNHS, (b) focusing analysis on households that have not moved (Chapter 4) or specifically
   analyzing the splits and moves (as is done in Chapter 6).

                UGANDA’S PROGRESS IN
    CHAPTER:

      1
                REDUCING POVERTY
                Uganda has recorded impressive rates of poverty reduction
                in the last two decades. The proportion of the Ugandan
                population living in poverty—whether measured using the
                national poverty line or the international poverty line—more
                than halved from 1993 to 2013.




               1.	   The Ugandan economy has experienced high growth through much
                     of the last two decades. Peace and stability were restored in much of
                     the country in 1986 when Yoweri Museveni came into power and then
                     in the north of Uganda in 2008. Stability and the series of economic
                     liberalization reforms that were implemented in the 1990s contributed
                     to high growth (see for example, Collier and Reinikka 2003, World Bank
                     2007). Growth started to slow in 2010 as the gains from peace and the
                     reforms years earlier had been fully realized, and weak infrastructure
                     and increasing corruption increasingly constrained private sector
                     competitiveness (World Bank 2015).


               2.	   This chapter documents that Ugandan households have also
                     experienced progress in monetary well-being during the last two
                     decades, including during the period of focus for this report, 2006
                     to 2013. Although consumption growth has been lower, on average,
                     in recent years, it has become increasingly pro-poor. The period from
                     2010 to 2013 was the only period in the last twenty years in which
                     consumption growth benefited the poor more than the rich and
                     inequality fell. The national poverty rate fell by 1.6 percentage points a
                     year since 2006 (compared to 1.9 percentage points a year before then)
                     and the international poverty rate fell by 2.7 percentage points per year
                     (much higher than the regional average of 0.74 during this period).

7. The national poverty line ranges from US$0.88 to US$1.04 2005 PPP per capita depending on the region. Poverty in Uganda is calculated using
a cost-of-basic-needs approach. Consumption expenditure data is collected on food and non-food items through the UNHS conducted every three to
four years. The poverty line was set in 1993 by calculating the cost of consuming 3,000 calories per adult equivalent and then adding an amount (the
amount depending on the region) to capture non-food expenditures. The poverty line has only been updated for the cost of inflation since then and is
low by international standards.

8. This measure reflects the depth of poverty as well as its incidence. The indicator is often described as the per capita amount of resources needed to
eliminate poverty or reduce the poor’s shortfall from the poverty line to zero, through perfectly targeted cash transfers.

13. Households were asked the values and quantities of items they consumed, and dividing the value by the quantity provides the unit price.
Quantities were often reported in nonstandard units and the quantities measured in nonstandard units were converted into kilograms using
conversion factors reported in the survey as well as the conversion factors used in the consumption module of the Living Standards Measurement
Study–Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). Not all nonstandard units were converted, but enough to provide unit values.


14. The two most common types of consumption recorded are ‘consumption of own produce’ and ‘consumption in the household’ of produce that is
purchased. Prices imputed from own consumption are consistently lower across almost all items, and there is a valid concern that households might
systematically undervalue consumption from own production. Therefore, the price from purchased ‘consumption in the household’ is used. This is
also done when calculating the official household food consumption aggregate.

     5 percent increase in non-food consumption. This                                closer to the international extreme poverty line.
     is very close to the poverty line re-estimation done                            This would increase the national poverty rate in
     by Appleton (2003). However, given households                                   2013 to 32.7 to 35.2 percent. Although higher, this

in terms of demographic characteristics and the coefficients of these demographic characteristics (in a regression of non-food share) are not large
compared to the constant term and region dummies. The weighted demographic characteristics, weighted by the corresponding coefficient, of the
food poor and the bottom 50 percent of households is 0.077 and 0.081, respectively. The weighted difference in demographic characteristics of the
two groups is 0.004 only, and this minor difference results in 0.01 difference in non-food share in Central Rural, Central Urban, and Northern Rural
categories. In other locations, the use of a different reference group does not affect non-food share.

     BOX 1.1: How poverty is measured in Uganda

     The poverty line was set in 1998 using 1993 data by estimating the amount of expenditure needed to
     satisfy the minimum daily calorie requirements and basic non-food needs. Appleton et al. (1999) identified
     the 28 commonly consumed food items and the corresponding amount consumed to meet 3,000 calories
     per adult equivalent. Calorie requirement varies by age and gender, and hence the 3,000 calories is per
     adult equivalence. Based on the population structure then, the average per capita calorie need was 2,283
     calories.

     The minimum expenditure on basic non-food needs was estimated using the classic approach of Ravallion
     and Bidani (1994) by identifying the non-food expenditure of households that are just on the food poverty
     line. The justification for using these households’ non-food expenditure as a reference is that the poor
     have sacrificed some of their need for calories to buy the non-food items. Therefore, these non-food
     expenditures should also be regarded as meeting essential needs. The non-food expenditure was allowed
     to vary by region and rural/urban areas to account for spatial differences prices (Appleton et al. 1999).

     The poverty line is the sum of expenditure on basic food and non-food items. Since 1993, the CPI has been
     used to update this poverty line.

     reduction of 1 percentage point in the Gini per year.



    BOX 1.2: Inequality Measures

    While poverty measures absolute deprivation with respect to a given threshold, inequality is a relative
    measure of poverty indicating how little some parts of a population have relative to the whole population.

    In the context of monetary poverty, equality can be defined as an equal distribution of consumption/
    income across the population. This means that each share of the population owns the same share of
    consumption/income. The Lorenz Curve compares graphically the cumulative share of the population
    with their cumulative share of consumption/income. A perfectly equal consumption/income distribution
    is indicated by a diagonal. The other extreme is complete inequality where one individual owns all the
    consumption/income. These two (theoretical) extremes define the boundaries for observed inequality.

    The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure for inequality. A Gini coefficient of 0 indicates
    perfect equality while 1 signifies complete inequality. In relation to the Lorenz Curve, the Gini coefficient
    measures the area between the Lorenz Curve and the diagonal.

    The Theil index measures inequality based on an entropy measure. A parameter α controls emphasis
    to measure inequality for higher incomes (larger α) or lower incomes (smaller α). The Theil index with
    parameter α = 1 is usually called Theil T while using α = 0 is called Theil L or log deviation measure.

    Relative and absolute income differences can be used to compare inequality dynamics over time. Usually,
    percentiles are used to compare incomes of different groups. For example, p90/p10 is the ratio (for relative
    incomes) or difference (for absolute incomes) of the average income in the 90th and 10th percentile.

BOX 1.3: Spatial Dimensions of Poverty

Households in Uganda’s Northern, Eastern, and Western regions have much lower levels of human
capital, fewer assets, and more limited access to infrastructure than households in the Central region. The
Northern region is the worst, largely because the conflict took lives, damaged communities, destroyed
assets, and had lasting effects on the aspirations of many individuals. Households in the north are larger
and more likely to be headed by a woman and are more likely to have a household head with no education
(Table 1.6). Most households own land but they are less likely to own other assets and have lower access to
infrastructure services. The Eastern region also lags behind the Central and Western region in nearly all of
these measures.

Households in the Northern region also have more limited access to markets and services. For households
in these regions, distances to schools and health services are much larger as are distances to markets. The
provision of agricultural extension and veterinary services is much lower and this is of concern given the
reliance of these households on agriculture and livestock income. Rural financial institutions are almost
entirely absent in the north. These constraints have limited the accumulation of human capital and the
extent to which households can use their assets to earn a return in these regions.
Household income among the bottom 40 percent is low in the Eastern and Northern regions and heavily
reliant on food crops and livestock farming. Livestock income comprises 39 percent of the agricultural
income of the bottom 40 percent who live in the north. In addition, rainfall is lower and more volatile
in the north increasing the vulnerability of households in this region, while households in the east are
particularly vulnerable to the collapse of maize prices (Chapter 4).

             NON-MONETARY DIMENSIONS
 CHAPTER:

     2
             OF POVERTY IN UGANDA
             Uganda’s progress in reducing income poverty is strongly
             reflected in some non-monetary indicators of welfare,
             although the country still has a long way to go on some
             dimensions.




            51.	 Chapter 1 highlighted the impressive performance in reducing
                 monetary poverty over the last decade. The proportion of the
                 population living under the national monetary poverty line declined from
                 56.4 percent in 1993 to 19.7 percent in 2013.


            52.	 Poverty is multidimensional in nature and there are some limitations
                 to relying solely on the monetary poverty measures. It has been well
                 documented in literature that well-being is a broad description of the
                 state of people’s living conditions (for example, McGillivray and Clarke
                 2006; Saunders 2005). Beyond monetary poverty, it is important to have
                 a more comprehensive understanding of how the country has performed
                 on other dimensions of well-being. Socioeconomic indicators of well-
                 being can provide a valuable complement to existing monetary measures
                 of poverty, and this would allow to better target programs and policies

 CHAPTER:

            Agriculture was the main driver of poverty reduction.
            Other important factors that contributed to poverty
            reduction include increased peace and stability in the
            North, urbanization and education.




            90.	 This chapter examines the factors behind Uganda’s success
                 in reducing poverty from 2006 to 2013. It relies on analysis of
                 the panel survey that has followed the same households through
                 this period (UNPS) and decomposition analysis using the UNHS.
                 The advantages of panel analysis for assessing drivers of poverty
                 reduction are outlined in Box 1 and the decomposition methods used
                 in this chapter are summarized in Box 3.1.


            91.	 The findings highlight the importance of agriculture, urban
                 migration, and modest gains in education. It also highlights the
                 limited role of structural change since 2006, the persistently high
                 dependency ratios which held back poverty reduction, and limited
                 spending on safety nets, which have resulted in change in the
                 distribution of household consumption having little direct impact on
                 poverty reduction or on improving vulnerability.

BOX 3.1: What does decomposing changes in poverty entail?

In this chapter, the results of two decomposition methods are presented. The first method is the
Recentered Influence Functions (RIF, Firpo et al. 2009) in which traditional Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions
are applied to different percentiles of the consumption distribution. This allows an assessment of the
amount of poverty reduction that can be accounted for by changes in the characteristics of households
and individuals (‘endowments’) compared to the changing nature of the Ugandan economy and poverty.
The second method, the Ravallion and Huppi (1991) inter-sectoral decomposition method quantifies how
much poverty reduction among different groups or movement between different groups accounts for
national poverty reduction.

Both decomposition methods rely on defining a counterfactual scenario and estimating what would have
happened to poverty had the counterfactual scenario occurred. By defining a counterfactual scenario, the
changes that have been important to overall poverty reduction can be quantified. Figure 3.3 depicts how
this can work for two different counterfactual scenarios.

In the Ravallion and Huppi method, the focus is on a counterfactual of no change in the proportion of
population in different sectors; and a counterfactual of no change in poverty among people in a given
sector. These counterfactuals are used to examine the amount of poverty reduction that took place within
sectors (as if sectors had not changed) and the amount of poverty reduction that took place because of
people moving between sectors.

In the RIF analysis, the focus is on a counterfactual of a constant relationship between endowments
and poverty in Uganda over 2006 to 2013. This counterfactual is used to determine which changes in
endowments could have contributed to poverty reduction, and how much poverty reduction could have
changed because of a changing relationship between poverty and endowments. The latter is sometimes
referred to as changes in the returns to endowments, but really it represents how the conditional
correlation between a given endowment and consumption has changed.

The RIF decomposition is carried out at five points of the distribution, representing five different welfare
groups: the 10th percentile, the 25th percentile, the 50th percentile (median), the 75th percentile, and the
90th percentile. This exercise can be done robustly only at the national level because of the small sample
size in urban areas.

In all decomposition approaches, there is an interaction effect which can be interpreted as a measure of
the correlation between population shifts and inter-sectoral changes in poverty in the Ravallion and Huppi
method and changes in endowments and returns in the RIF analysis. In the decompositions shown here it
is quite small.

 BOX 3.2: Expanding fiscal policy: How can oil revenues accelerate poverty reduction in
 Uganda?

 The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) recently produced by the World Bank, highlighted the
 importance of oil as a source of fiscal revenue when production starts. It argued that to maximize the
 socioeconomic impact of its new revenue, Uganda should increase public investment gradually and save
 some of its oil revenue in the early years of production to finance countercyclical policies (given the volatile
 nature of oil prices) and to mitigate Dutch Disease effects.

 However, how should public investment best be allocated to facilitate sustainable, inclusive growth and
 aid poverty reduction?

 Economic simulations undertaken for the CEM indicate that, initially, investment in transport and energy
 infrastructure would aid private sector development and have a stronger impact on growth. In the
 long-term, however, education and health spending will be more effective. Manufacturing and modern
 services—and the success of the government’s diversification strategy—depend on a healthy and well-
 educated labor force. The CEM also highlighted that future infrastructure development programs should
 give priority to the poorest/underdeveloped regions of the country to promote economic and political
 stability.

 In addition, social programs focused on the poor should be designed and implement to reduce poverty.
 Specifically, the CEM suggests that direct cash transfers to poor households, linked with changes in health
 and education practices should be considered and tested.

straightforward. Much self-employment income comes from trade and taking only gross sales does not give an idea of how much was earned. To
account for this net self-employment income in the analysis, which is gross self-employment income net of raw materials, operating expenses, and
wages paid to others. Raw materials account for 81 percent of these expenditures. Operating expenses and wages paid to others account for 12–13
percent of gross income, suggesting that self-employment income would be a marginally more important source of income were these expenses not
netted out.

      average and 6 percent for the bottom 40 percent.35



     BOX 3.3: Agricultural growth in national accounts and survey data

     Table 3.3 indicates substantial growth in real per capita agricultural incomes from 2006 to 2012 based
     on household survey data. In contrast, limited agricultural growth was recorded in the national accounts
     from 2006 to 2012. The national accounts suggest agricultural growth in Uganda has been consistently
     low, averaging only 2 percent over the past five years (see Figure 3.6) and below the performance achieved
     by other regional economies (see Table 3.2).

     It is difficult to explain why there is this divergence between the national accounts estimates of
     agricultural growth and those found in the survey data. The national accounts estimates are not based on
     any additional sources of survey information (such as agricultural sample surveys which are often used in
     other countries to underpin estimates of agricultural value added) and it has been a number of years since
     an agricultural census was undertaken so it is difficult to assess what underpins the national accounts
     estimates and thus what might cause the divergence.

     The UNPS may be biased to households that have stayed in agriculture, as households that attritted over
     time are probably more likely to be those that have moved out of agriculture. However, given that the
     nationally representative cross sections suggest that many households have stayed in agriculture during
     this time, this is unlikely to be a large source of bias.

35. It is worth noting that the panel analysis may overestimate national average per capita agricultural growth (and underestimate national
average per capita non-agricultural growth) as households that attritted over time are probably more likely to be those that have moved out
of agriculture. However, the nationally representative cross sections undertaken during this time show that many households have stayed in
agriculture, so this is unlikely to be a large source of bias.

36. Specifically, a fixed effects model was estimated using the log of per capita consumption and the log of per capita income, allowing an analysis
of the relationship between changes in income and changes in consumption. Interview year and month fixed effects were also included. The analysis
was conducted only for 2005/06 and 2009/10 as there is a marked reduction in the consumption aggregate after 2009/10 that is hard to explain and is
inconsistent with the national poverty trend. It may result from methodological differences in the collection of consumption data in the 2010/11 and
2011/12 survey rounds. Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) was introduced in the UNPS for the 2010/11 and 2011/12 rounds and this may
have resulted in a reduction in reported consumption. CAPI was not introduced in the nationally representative cross-sectional survey, the UNHS.

125.	This chapter has documented the importance           126.	This chapter also highlights three factors
    of agricultural income growth, urbanization                that did not contribute to poverty reduction:
    and improvements in human capital—albeit                   demographic transition, structural change,

             AGRICULTURAL GROWTH
 CHAPTER:    AND POVERTY REDUCTION

     4       IN UGANDA 37
             Agricultural incomes grew because the government got
             some key fundamentals right that provided the incentives to
             invest in agriculture. Luck was also on Uganda’s side: good
             weather benefited many households and positive price trends
             in international and regional markets aided real crop price
             increases.




            127.	Chapter 3 highlighted the important role that agricultural income
                 growth has played in reducing poverty in Uganda from 2006 to
                 2013. Half of all poverty reduction occurred within households whose
                 only income source was in agriculture. This increased to nearly 80
                 percent when considering households with other income sources, but
                 the main occupation is in agriculture.


            128.	This chapter assesses the factors that have contributed (and those
                 that have not) to growth in agricultural income of households
                 in recent years. The focus of the analysis is on crop income earned
                 through self-employment, as this constitutes two-thirds of household
                 agricultural income. Changes in production practices of households as
                 well as changes in the external environment that may have had a direct
                 impact on crop income or affected how households decided to produce.


            129.	The analysis shows that Uganda was able to get many of the
                 fundamentals right. The government secured stability in the north
                 and enabled private markets for agricultural produce to develop across
                 the country, resulting in real relative price increases for agricultural

     weather benefited many households and the                  some cause for concern. When prices are poor

     real crop price increases. As a result, a favorable        gains in poverty reduction. This is indeed what
     external environment (some of it policy induced            happened in the Northern and Eastern regions in
     and some of it not), accounted for two-thirds of           2011. Households need to be able to both benefit
     the change in agricultural income among poor               from good prices and weather and have access
     households, contributing to higher household               to coping mechanisms to be protected from low

     in the use of improved inputs and as a result
     modernization of agricultural practices contributed   134.	Diversification of income offers households
     very little to crop income growth. Understanding           the ability to protect consumption from

     constraints needs to be a key area of action going         households to diversify and better-educated
     forward. Recent research suggests that poor quality        households had consumption that was better

39. Only those variables that can be considered to represent the external environment are included in these regressions. This is done for two reasons.
First, given these variables have an impact on production practices, a regression that includes production practices as independent variables does not
allow the full impact of changes in the external environment to be captured. Secondly, given these variables are exogenous to household production
decisions, they provide more robust estimates of drivers of changes in income. It is possible that changes in distance to market and provision of
extension services in the community are not fully exogenous, with investments in infrastructure and services being targeted to communities that are
more (or less) agriculturally productive. Regressions are also run in which distance to market and provision of extension are excluded, leaving only
prices, weather, and conflict. The regression results presented do not include year fixed effects given the objective of the analysis is to explain changes
in crop income across years. However, it is possible that other differences across years, correlated with changes in the external environment, are
driving the results. To test this, a regression model including year fixed effects is also estimated. The results show the continued significance of weather,
prices, peace, and extension provision.
40. As a final robustness check, a specification was run in which prices of regional crops—matooke in the center and west, and cassava in the north
and east—were included instead of beans prices (results not shown). These results also showed the same findings: production practices played a role,
but changes in the external environment were the main drivers of changes in crop income in Uganda.

             NON-AGRICULTURAL
 CHAPTER:    GROWTH IN UGANDA

     5       High growth in value-addition in industry and services has not
             been accompanied by a higher share of the workforce being
             employed in these sectors, limiting the degree to which these
             sectors contributed to poverty reduction.




            180.	Uganda has experienced high growth in industry and services
                 when compared to the regional average. Between 2003 and 2014,
                 the mean annual growth rates of industry and services were 12.2 percent
                 and 8.2 percent, respectively, which were higher than the average of
                 developing Sub-Saharan Africa (3.5 percent for industry and 7.5 percent
                 for the service sector, Figure 5.1). On the other hand, Uganda’s mean
                 annual growth rate of agriculture value added was 2.0 percent during the
                 same period, which is lower than the average of developing Sub-Saharan
                 Africa (5.4 percent).


            181.	The growth of services was largely driven by the expansion of posts
                 and telecommunication services, which reflects the rapid growth
                 of the ICT sector. As shown in Figure 5.1.4, the fastest growth within the
                 services sector came from post and telecommunication services.


            182.	High growth in value-addition in industry and services has not
                 been accompanied by a larger proportion of the workforce
                 employed in these sectors, suggesting that the job creation
                 brought about by non-agricultural growth has only just kept
                 up with population growth. Table 5.1 summarizes the source of
                 household income in 2006 and 2013. In 2006, 60 percent of households
                 had income from non-agricultural sectors, while only 49 percent of the

     bottom 40 percent households had income from                 associated with higher consumption growth (Table
     non-agricultural sectors. In 2013, the proportion            3.3). In addition, Chapter 4 provides evidence that
     of households with non-agricultural income was               the ability to diversify into non-agricultural income
     very similar, decreasing slightly to 59 percent for          sources when agricultural conditions are less

             MOVING OUT AND UP :
 CHAPTER:    MIGRATION AND POVERTY

     6       IN UGANDA 43
             Most of Uganda’s rural migrants tend to move within their
             own region or to another rural area. Migration generates
             substantial welfare gains—with even larger gains accruing to
             those who migrate to urban areas.




            200.	While the bulk of Uganda’s 35 million inhabitants live in rural
                 areas, the country is urbanizing at a considerable pace. According
                 to recent census data, the country’s overall population density grew
                 by 41 percent between 2002 and 2014 and the share of Uganda’s
                 population living in urban areas increased by more than 50 percent (from
                 12.1 percent to 18.4 percent) over the same period (UBOS 2014b). An
                 alternative measure of urbanization that is comparable across countries,
                 the agglomeration index, suggests that Uganda’s urban share is actually
                 higher than these rates would suggest, at 25 percent (World Bank 2012).

            201.	Urbanization has been an important driver of poverty reduction
                 from 2006 to 2013, because of the much lower rates of poverty
                 present in urban areas. Chapter 3 highlighted that urbanization
                 accounts for 10 percent of the poverty reduction achieved from 2006 to
                 2013.

            202.	Migration, in addition to demographics and redistricting,
                 contributes to urbanization. In Sub-Saharan Africa, lower mortality
                 rates in urban areas result in higher natural population growth rates
                 in urban areas, even in the presence of lower fertility rates (Jedwab

206.	The findings of this chapter suggest that                                      are associated with migration to rural areas. The
     migration generates substantial welfare gains—                                 findings suggest that policies to capture the welfare
     with even larger gains accruing to those who                                   gains from migration to cities should focus on
     migrate to urban areas. Rainfall shocks serve as a                             investments in education for men and women in

     violent conflict, and weak urban migrant networks                              rural households.



44. While economic considerations lead many of Uganda’s migrants to move, other factors also drive migration decisions. For example, insecurity
and conflict, particularly in the North of the country during the 2000s, prompted the displacement and forced migration of large segments of the rural
population (Mulumba and Olema 2009). A period of reverse migration then followed, with an influx of displaced residents returning to the North (World
Bank 2012).

  CHAPTER:    SERVICES: QUALITY OF

              LEVELS 50

              Poorer communities tend to have services of lower quality,
              but are more satisfied with the services that they are receiving.




             244.	A better-educated and healthy population is more likely to
                  transition from subsistence agriculture to more productive jobs.
                  Chapters 2 and 5 highlighted the importance of human capital for
                  poverty reduction. In Uganda, education is a key predictor if earnings as
                  well as household consumption (see, for example, Fox and Pimhidzai
                  2011; and Tsimpo and Wodon 2014a). Apart from its impact on
                  livelihoods, the case for investments in education can also be made on
                  the basis of its impact on health outcomes, among others.

             245.	Since 1997, the GoU has implemented a series of policies as well as
                  made substantial budget investments to improve education and
                  health services as well as the demand for those services. On the
                  supply side, key policies include building and renovating schools and
                  health centers; purchasing adequate instructional materials; training,
                  hiring, and retaining teachers and health workers; improving the drugs
                  policy under the national medical store (NMS); reducing teacher and
                  health worker absenteeism; and serving areas that are hard to reach and
                  hard to stay in. On the demand side, important policy reforms have been
                  adopted as well, including for UPE, USE, school feeding programs, mama
                  kits, and national immunization days, among others.


             50. This chapter draws on the background paper: “Education and Health Services in Uganda:
             Quality of Inputs, User Satisfaction, and Community Welfare Levels,” by Clarence Tsimpo, Alvin
             Etang, and Quentin Wodon.

staff. Staff who are not in the facility because it is not their shift are not considered absent. Health workers who are not in the facility because they are

conditions and management of maternal and newborn complications—as measured in the vignette interviews) and one indicator of outcomes
(diagnostic accuracy in the five tracer conditions at the end of the vignette interviews). Three of the tracer conditions were childhood conditions
(malaria with anemia, acute diarrhea with severe dehydration, and pneumonia), and two were adult conditions (PTB and diabetes mellitus). Two
other conditions were included: post-partum hemorrhage, the most common cause of maternal death during birth; and neonatal asphyxia, the most
common cause of neonatal death during birth (World Bank 2013).

attempt to collect such information. This section therefore focuses on student outcomes only. The objective of the pupil assessment was to assess
basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills. The test was designed by experts in international pedagogy and based on a review of primary curriculum
materials from thirteen African countries, including Uganda (see Johnson, Cunningham, and Dowling 2012). The pupil assessment also measured non-
verbal reasoning skills on the basis of Raven’s matrices, a standard IQ measure that is designed to be valid across different cultures.

ANNEX 1: EXPLORING PATTERNS OF FOOD AND NON-FOOD CONSUMPTION
OVER TIME, METHODOLOGY

1.	    Appleton et al. (1999) examined spending on basic non-food items to estimate the share of food in the national
       poverty line following an approach adopted from Ravallion and Bidani (1994). Appleton et al. investigated the
       expenditure patterns of people who are at the food poverty line by regressing the food share of household i
       (si) on region/urban-rural dummy, demographic characteristics, and the ratio of adult equivalent consumption
       expenditure (Yi) to food poverty line zf (and its square):


              si = b0 + b1 ln(Yi / z f ) + b2 ln(Yi / z f ) 2 + ∑ j = 2 f j D j + b3wi + ei
                                                                                 8
                                                                                                                                (1)



	...where ei is the error term, Dj is dummy for the four regions urban/rural (central urban is excluded and serves as
 a reference group), wi is the demographic characteristics of household i including household size, head’s gender,
                                                                               zf
 and proportion of boys/girls of different age groups in the household, and is the food poverty line, which is U
 Sh 21,258.


2.	    The estimation result for equation 1 is presented in Table A1.1. Column 2 of Table A1.1 shows the estimated
       coefficient by Appleton et al. (1999), using 1997/98 data. Column 3 of this table presents estimates of equation 1
       using UNHS 2012/13 data.


3.	    Table 1.4 presents the share of spending on basic non-food items in total consumption expenditure using the
       national average demographic characteristics of these households ( wm ). For households residing in region j, the
       predicted non-food share is given by 1 − (b + f + b w ) .62
                                                                0   j   3   m




62. In equation 1, Central Urban is omitted. The interaction between the demographic characteristics of the ‘food poor’ households and the
                                                                                                                     9 = 1 − ( b0 + b3wm )
corresponding coefficients in Table A1.1, that is, b3wm , is 0.071. Therefore, non-food share for Central Urban is 0.5                     . In other regions, the
share of non-food expenditure is estimated by 1 − ( b0 + f j + b3wm ) .
