2   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2014
I.          Introduction
This document should be read together with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (IBRD)
Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013
(FY13). IBRD undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Box 1 provides IBRD’s selected
financial data as of, and for the nine months ended, March 31, 2014 and 2013, as well as for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2013. Certain reclassifications of prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation. (For further details see Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies in the Notes to the
Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements).

Business Model
IBRD, an international organization owned by its 188 member countries, is the largest multilateral development bank in
the world. As part of the World Bank Group,1 its two main goals are to end extreme poverty and promote shared
prosperity. To meet these goals, it provides loans, guarantees, and technical assistance (including through reimbursable
advisory services) for economic reform projects and programs. In addition, IBRD also provides or facilitates financing
through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors. IBRD’s ability to intermediate the funds it raises in
international capital markets to its developing member countries is important in helping it achieve its development goals.
IBRD’s financial goal is not to maximize profits, but to earn adequate income to ensure its financial strength and sustain
its development activities.
IBRD’s financial strength derives from its capital base, through the support of its shareholders as well as its financial and
risk management policies and practices. Shareholder support takes the form of capital subscriptions from members and
their strong record in servicing their debt to IBRD. Financial policies and practices have enabled IBRD to increase its
capital adequacy, diversify its funding sources, hold a portfolio of liquid investments to meet its financial commitments,
and limit its risks – including credit and market risks.

Basis of Reporting
Financial Statements
IBRD prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis.” Under the reported basis, all instruments
in the investment, borrowing, and asset-liability management portfolios are carried at fair value, with changes in fair
value reported in the income statement, except for the Available-for-Sale (AFS) portfolio. The securities in the AFS
portfolio are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in equity. The loan portfolio is reported at
amortized cost, except for loans with embedded derivatives, which are reported at fair value. The financial statements
provide a basis upon which Management derives its allocable income and analyzes fair value results.
Fair Value Results
IBRD makes extensive use of financial instruments such as derivatives in its operations. The fair value of these financial
instruments is affected by changes in the market environment (e.g., interest rates, exchange rates, and credit risk).
Management uses fair value results to assess the performance of the investment trading portfolio, monitor the results of
the equity management framework, and manage certain market risks including interest rate risk and commercial
counterparty credit risk. Under the fair value basis, in addition to the instruments in the investment, borrowing, and
asset-liability management portfolios, all loans are reported at fair value.
Allocable Income
Management uses allocable income for making distributions out of its net income. Unrealized mark-to-market gains and
losses associated with instruments that are not held for trading purposes, as well as other adjustments for such items as
Board of Governors-approved transfers and pension, are excluded from net income to arrive to allocable income.

    Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
    Disputes (ICSID).

       II.             Summary of Allocable Income and Income Allocation
       The primary drivers of IBRD’s allocable income are interest earned on the loan and investment portfolios (net of funding
       costs), revenue generated from IBRD’s equity, net non-interest expenses, and provision for losses on loans and other
       exposures2 (Table 1 summarizes IBRD’s net income and provides a reconciliation to allocable income).

4   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2014
Lending Highlights
IBRD’s principal assets are its loans to member countries.                       Figure 2. Commitments and   Figure 3. Net Loans
                                                                                 Disbursements Trend         Outstanding

                                                                                                             155
billion, 21% above the same period in FY13. This year’s                           50
commitments consist mainly of $3.6 billion to the East Asia and                                              150

As of March 31, 2014, IBRD’s net loans outstanding were $151.1                                               130
billion, an increase of $9.4 billion from June 30, 2013. The increase               Commitments              125
was mainly due to $7.8 billion in net loan disbursements made in the                                                  Jun-12        Jun-13   Mar-14

billion, consistent with the appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar during the period.
Gross disbursements during the first nine months of FY14 were $14.8 billion, 25% above the same period in FY13. This
year’s gross disbursements consist mainly of $5.1 billion to the Latin American and Caribbean region, $4.9 billion to
Europe and Central Asia, and $2.6 billion to East Asia and Pacific.
Investment Highlights
As of March 31, 2014, IBRD’s net investment portfolio totaled $35.7 billion, of which $34.7
                                                                                                             Figure 4. Liquidity Asset

                                                                                                             36

                                                                                                             35
The objective of the liquid asset portfolio is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flow to         34
meet all IBRD financial commitments, as reflected in the prudential minimum liquidity level.                 33
The prudential minimum liquidity level is set at $24.5 billion for FY14, an increase of $2.5                 32

billion over FY13, reflecting the anticipated higher net loan disbursements. The liquid asset                31

portfolio remained at 142% of the prudential minimum liquidity level on March 31, 2014,                      30
                                                                                                                     Jun-12         Jun-13   Mar-14
within the targeted range of 100%-150%.
The maturity profile of IBRD’s liquid asset portfolio reflects a high degree of liquidity, with $20.8 billion (or more than
60% of total volume) maturing within six months, of which $15.8 billion is expected to mature within one month.

Borrowing Highlights
To raise funds, IBRD issues debt securities to both institutional and retail investors in a variety          Figure 5. Borrowing Portfolio
                                                                                                             Billion U.S. dollars
of currencies. During the first nine months of FY14, IBRD raised medium- and long-term
                                                                                                             150
debt of $33.4 billion in 15 currencies.
                                                                                                             145
As of March 31, 2014, the borrowing portfolio totaled $147.2 billion, an increase of $10.2
                                                                                                             140
billion relative to June 30, 2013 (Note E: Borrowings in the Notes to the Condensed Quarterly
Financial Statements). This was due mainly to net new borrowing issuances of $8.6 billion to                 135

support the increase in loan disbursements and currency translation losses of $1.2 billion,                  130
consistent with the appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar during the period. This was             125
                                                                                                                      Jun-12        Jun-13   Mar-14
partially offset by net unrealized mark-to-market gains of $462 million.


Capital Highlights
Following the Board of Governors’ approval of the General and Selective Capital Increase resolutions in FY11,
subscribed capital is expected to increase by $86.2 billion over a five-year period, of which $5.1 billion will be paid-in.
As of March 31, 2014, $40.9 billion was subscribed (including shares subscribed under the Voice Reform for which no
paid-in capital was required), resulting in additional paid-in capital of $2.4 billion, of which $470 million was received
during the first nine months of FY14. In addition, $63 million of members’ national currency paid-in capital, subject to
certain restrictions, became usable in IBRD’s operations during the first nine months of FY14.




                                                              IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2014 5
       IV.         Financial Risk Management
       In an effort to maximize IBRD’s capacity to lend to member countries for development purposes, IBRD limits its
       exposure to market and counterparty credit risks. In addition, to ensure that the credit risks associated with its loans and
       other exposures do not exceed its risk-bearing capacity, IBRD uses a strategic capital adequacy framework as a key
       medium-term capital planning tool.
       On February 11, 2014, IBRD’s Executive Directors approved a set of measures to enhance IBRD’s financial capacity to
       meet its borrowing member country needs. These measures include:
       (i)         The Single Borrower Limit (SBL) was increased to $20 billion for India and $19 billion for other SBL-eligible
                   borrowing countries. A surcharge of 50 basis points a year was introduced on loan exposure exceeding the
                   previous SBL ($17.5 billion for India and $16.5 billion for other SBL-eligible borrowing countries) in order to
                   help support the increase in the SBL;
       (ii)        The minimum equity-to-loan ratio was lowered to 20% from 23%, reflecting improvement in the portfolio’s
                   credit quality since 2008, when the previous target was adopted;
       (iii)       Commitment fees of 25 basis points a year on undisbursed balances on IBRD loans will be restored; and
       (iv)        The maximum maturity for most IBRD loans and guarantees will be extended from the current limits of 30 year
                   terms/18 years average to 35 year terms/20 years average. The maturity premium charges will increase, with the
                   application of a revised maturity premium schedule, with the starting point for these charges beginning at 8
                   years average maturity rather than 12 years previously.
       While the first two measures were effective immediately, the third and fourth measures take effect from July 1, 2014. In
       addition to the above measures, an expenditure review is underway to identify cost savings that will also contribute to an
       increase in margins, capital adequacy, and lending capacity.
       The Executive Directors also gave Management more flexibility in implementing the EMF relative to the previous
       strategy, but with the same goal of stabilizing income from equity within an appropriate risk and governance framework,
       as discussed further below.

       Capital Adequacy
       IBRD’s capital adequacy is the degree to which its usable equity is sufficient to absorb              Figure 6: Equity-to-Loans
       unexpected credit shocks from its loan portfolio and to continue lending for development              Ratio (%)
       purposes. The Executive Directors monitor IBRD’s capital adequacy within a Strategic Capital             60

       Adequacy Framework and use the equity-to-loans ratio as a key indicator of capital adequacy.             50
                                                                                                                40
       IBRD’s equity-to-loans ratio decreased to 25.9% at March 31, 2014 from 26.8% on June 30,                 30
       2013, and was above the 20% minimum ratio (Table 3). The decrease was due mainly to the                  20
       larger increase in loan exposure relative to the increase in usable equity during the period. The        10
       higher loan exposure mostly reflected the net positive loan disbursements during the period,              0
                                                                                                                      Mar-09
                                                                                                                               Mar-10
                                                                                                                                        Mar-11

                                                                                                                                                            Mar-13
                                                                                                                                                                     Mar-14
       while the increase in usable equity was due to the receipt of paid-in capital and existing
       national-currency-paid-in capital becoming usable during the period.

       currency and liquidity risks is minimal because of its risk management policies. In addition, IBRD faces two types of
       credit risk: country credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
       Interest Rate Risk
       Under its current interest rate risk management strategy, IBRD seeks to match the interest rate sensitivity of its assets
       (loan and investment trading portfolios) and its liabilities (borrowing portfolio) by using such derivatives as interest rate

swaps. These derivatives effectively convert IBRD’s financial assets and liabilities into variable-rate instruments. While
this strategy helps manage IBRD’s interest margin on debt-funded loans against interest rate volatility, the interest
revenue on loans funded by equity, if left unmanaged, would be highly sensitive to fluctuations in short-term interest
rates. To manage this exposure, IBRD implemented in 2007 an equity-duration-extension strategy to reduce the
sensitivity of IBRD's income from equity to fluctuations in short-term interest rates by extending the duration of its
equity from three months to about 4.5 years.
In response to the changes in the market environment, on February 11, 2014, IBRD’s Executive Directors approved the
EMF. The EMF shares the same objective as the equity- duration-extension strategy approved in 2007, but provides
more flexibility to manage income from equity within an appropriate risk and governance framework. In particular, the
EMF permits shortening the duration of IBRD's equity, when warranted by market and macroeconomic conditions. In
line with this, IBRD reduced the duration of its equity to about one year as of March 31, 2014 from 4.5 years as of June
30, 2013. The Executive Directors approved Management's recommendation to maintain a short duration for equity in
the short term, with the authority to enter into other approved investment strategies, or combinations thereof, as market
conditions warrant.
Country Credit Risk
This risk reflects potential losses arising from protracted arrears on payments from borrowers on loans and other
exposures. IBRD manages country credit risk by applying individual country exposure limits. These limits take into
account creditworthiness and performance of borrowers.
Portfolio Concentration Risk
Portfolio concentration risk, which arises when a small group of borrowers account for a large share of loans outstanding,
is a key concern for IBRD. It is carefully managed, in part, by applying an exposure limit for the aggregate balance of
loans outstanding, the present value of guarantees,     Figure 7. Country Exposures as of March 31, 2014

Probable Losses, Overdue Payments, and Non-Performing Loans
As of March 31, 2014, only 0.30% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and all were related to Zimbabwe.
Effective July 16, 2013, all loans made to, or guaranteed by, Iran were placed into nonaccrual status. On September 27,
2013, Iran cleared all its overdue principal and charges due to IBRD; on that date, the loans to, or guaranteed by, Iran
were restored to accrual status. IBRD’s total provision for losses on accrual and nonaccrual loans accounted for 1.11%
of the total loan portfolio. (For further information, see Notes to Financial Statements, Note D: Loans and Other
Exposures).
Counterparty Credit Risk
Commercial Counterparty Credit Risk
The effective management of commercial counterparty credit risk is vital to the success of IBRD’s funding, investment,
and asset/liability management. The monitoring and managing of this risk is continuous, given the changing market
environment. Commercial counterparty credit risk is managed by applying eligibility criteria, volume limits for
transactions with individual counterparties, and using mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap transactions
(Table 4).
IBRD’s overall commercial credit exposure rose during the first nine months of FY14, in line with the higher liquidity
levels. Increased holdings in the A and AA rating categories reflect increased investments in bank deposits for short-term
operational liquidity purposes. Sovereign exposure in AAA rating categories, which largely reflects longer-term
investments, declined modestly over the year. Sovereign exposure to the BBB-rating category increased during the

       period, as Management broadened the universe of investment assets to achieve greater diversification and a better risk-
       adjusted investment performance.

       The credit quality of IBRD’s portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with 77% of the
       portfolio rated AA or above, reflecting IBRD’s continued preference for highly rated securities and counterparties across
       all categories of financial instruments. Total commercial counterparty credit exposure, net of collateral held, was $38.1
       billion as of March 31, 2014.

       Non-Commercial Counterparty Credit Risk
       In addition to the derivative transactions with the commercial counterparties, IBRD also offers derivative-intermediation
       services to borrowing member countries, as well as affiliated and non-affiliated organizations, to help meet their
       development needs or to carry out their development mandates.
       Borrowing Member Countries: Currency and interest rate swap transactions are executed between IBRD and its
       borrowers under master derivative agreements. As of March 31, 2014, the notional amounts and net fair value exposures
       under these agreements were $9.7 billion and $947 million, respectively. Probable losses inherent in these exposures due
       to country credit risk are incorporated in the fair value of these instruments.
       Non-Affiliated Organizations: IBRD has a master derivatives agreement with the International Finance Facility for
       Immunisation (IFFIm), under which several transactions have been executed. As of March 31, 2014, the notional
       amounts and net fair value exposures under this agreement were $7.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. IBRD has the
       right to call for collateral above an agreed specified threshold. As of March 31, 2014, IBRD had not exercised this right,
       but it reserves the right under the existing terms of the agreement. Rather than calling for collateral, IBRD and IFFIm
       have agreed to manage IBRD’s exposure to its derivative transactions with IFFIm by applying a risk management buffer
       to the gearing ratio limit. The gearing ratio limit represents the maximum amount of net financial obligations of IFFIm
       less cash and liquid assets, as a percent of the net present value of IFFIm's financial assets.
       Affiliated Organizations: Derivative contracts are executed between IBRD and IDA, under an agreement allowing IBRD
       to intermediate derivative contracts on behalf of IDA. As of March 31, 2014, the notional amount under this agreement
       was $4.1 billion and IBRD has no net fair value exposure to IDA. Under its derivative agreement with IBRD, IDA is not
       required to post collateral as long as it maintains liquidity holdings at pre-determined levels that are a proxy for an AAA
       credit rating. As of March 31, 2014, IDA had not posted any collateral with IBRD.




8   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2014
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)
IBRD calculates a CVA that represents the fair value of its commercial counterparty credit risk and non-commercial
counterparty credit risks from IFFIm and IDA in connection with derivative-intermediation activities. As credit risk is an
essential component of fair value, IBRD includes a CVA in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit
risk. The CVA is a function of exposure, which is calculated by using the fair value of the derivative contracts, net of
collateral received under credit support agreements, and the probability of counterparty default based on the Credit
Default Swaps (CDS) spread and, where applicable, proxy CDS spreads. The CVA on IBRD’s balance sheet at March
31, 2014, was $36 million and on June 30, 2013, $67 million.

V.         Summary of Fair Value Results
Fair Value Adjustments
An important element in achieving IBRD’s financial goal is its ability to minimize the cost of borrowing from capital
markets for lending to member countries by using financial instruments, including derivatives. The fair value of these
financial instruments is affected by such changes in the market environment as interest rates, exchange rates, and credit
risk.
Given IBRD’s intention to hold its primary assets and related funding to maturity (loan and borrowing portfolios), fair
value results are not used for income allocation decision-making purposes by Management. Rather, they are primarily
used to assess the performance of the investment-trading portfolio, to monitor the results of the equity management
framework, and to manage certain market risks-including interest rate and commercial credit risk for derivative
counterparties.
For the first nine months of FY14, IBRD experienced net unrealized gains of $141 million (Table 5).

Effect of Credit
The net unrealized gains on the borrowing and loan portfolios mainly reflect changes in credit. For the first nine months
of FY14, IBRD experienced $224 million of unrealized gains on the borrowing portfolio, of which $155 million was due
to the widening of its credit spreads. In addition, IBRD experienced $937 million of unrealized gains from the loan
portfolio, of which $1.2 billion was due to the net tightening of CDS spreads for several of its borrowing member
countries during the same period. (See the June 30, 2013, MD&A for a detailed discussion on how the credit risk of each
portfolio is managed).
Effect of Interest Rates
IBRD uses derivatives in its loan and borrowing portfolios to arrive at LIBOR-based floating rate instruments, as part of
its risk management strategies. The sensitivity of these portfolios to interest rate movements is therefore low, resulting in
relatively small unrealized gains/losses in income.
The net unrealized losses on equity management relate mainly to the reclassification of net realized gains associated with
the liquidation of the AFS portfolio and the termination of certain derivatives in the portfolio. In line with changes made
under the EMF, the dollar change in fair value corresponding to a one- basis-point upward shift in interest rates
decreased from $18 million at June 30, 2013, to $3 million at March 31, 2014 (Table 5).

       Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
       In addition to the unrealized gains/losses on the loan, borrowing, and EMF portfolios, IBRD’s fair value net income also
       reflects changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). The $81 million increase in AOCI relates
       primarily to net positive currency-translation adjustments resulting from the appreciation of the euro against the U.S.
       dollar during the period.

       Fair Value Results
       As non-financial assets and liabilities are not reflected at fair value, IBRD’s equity does not reflect fair value. Under the
       fair value basis, in addition to the instruments in the investment, borrowing, and asset-liability management portfolios, all
       loans are reported at fair value and all changes in AOCI are also included in fair value net income. (Tables 7 and 8
       provide a reconciliation from the reported basis to the fair value basis for both the balance sheet and income statement.)

16     IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2014
NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2013
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2013 audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management, the
condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IBRD’s financial
position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for losses on loans and other exposures, valuation of certain
instruments carried at fair value, and valuation of pension and other postretirement plan-related liabilities. The
results of operations for the first nine months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results that
may be expected for the full year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation. In particular, effective July 1, 2013, accrued interest on borrowings and derivatives (Client operations,
Borrowings and Others), which was previously shown as part of other assets and other liabilities, is now included in
the corresponding line items under borrowings, derivative assets and derivative liabilities. As a result, borrowings,
derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of June 30, 2013 have increased by $906 million, $1,461 million and
$1,322 million, respectively. Correspondingly, other assets and other liabilities have decreased by $227 million and
$994 million, respectively. There was no net effect on IBRD’s equity. In addition, effective from the quarter ended
March 31, 2014, all unrealized gains or losses, net associated with loans, borrowings, equity management and client
operations (non-trading portfolios) were reclassified from the Fair value adjustments on non-trading portfolios, net
line to the respective revenue and expense lines on the Condensed Statement of Income. As a result, for the nine
months ended March 31, 2013, total revenue decreased by $353 million, total expenses decreased by $579 million
and fair value adjustments on non-trading portfolios, net line of $226 million gains is no longer a part of the
Condensed Statement of Income. There was no effect on IBRD’s equity and net income.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IBRD continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of March 31, 2014. IBRD believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its business.
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets
and Liabilities. The ASU requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about instruments
and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position, and instruments and transactions subject to
a master netting agreement and agreements similar to master netting agreements. Subsequently, in January 2013, the
FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets
and Liabilities which has clarified that the scope of ASU 2011-11 applies to derivatives accounted for in accordance
with Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, as well as repurchase
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are
either offset in accordance with US GAAP or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar
agreement. For IBRD, the ASUs were effective from the quarter ended September 30, 2013, and resulted in
additional disclosures, which are reflected in Note C-Investments and Note F-Derivative Instruments.
In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts
Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). The ASU introduces new presentation
requirements about the amounts reclassified out of AOCI. It requires an entity to present information about the
reclassified amounts by component and to provide additional details about such reclassifications. The ASU does not
change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements
or which items could be reclassified from other comprehensive income into net income. For IBRD, the new
requirements were effective from the quarter ended September 30, 2013 and resulted in additional disclosures,
which are reflected in Note H-Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits and Note J-Comprehensive Income.

IBRD uses derivative instruments to manage currency and interest rate risks in the investment portfolio. For details
regarding these instruments, see Note F–Derivative Instruments.
As of March 31, 2014, there were no short sales included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet (Nil—
June 30, 2013).
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, IBRD’s Investments – Trading revenue included $15 million
and $56 million of unrealized losses, respectively (unrealized gains of $10 million and $67 million—three and nine
months ended March 31, 2013, respectively).
At June 30, 2013, due to the intent to sell, IBRD determined that the government obligations included in its AFS
portfolio were other than temporarily impaired (OTTI). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, IBRD recorded
OTTI losses of $160 million on these securities in the Statement of Income. These losses, which were due to interest
rate increases, represented write-downs to fair value.
During the nine months ended March 31, 2014, the AFS portfolio was liquidated, resulting in $240 million of
realized losses included in Equity management, net on the Condensed Statement of Income. The total proceeds from
the sale of these securities were $2,484 million.
The following table presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value by major type of
AFS security, at June 30, 2013:

22          IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2014
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair value of investments.
Investment securities
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include
most government and agency securities, mutual funds, futures contracts, exchange-traded equity securities and ABS.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and constant prepayment rates.
Where applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default and loss severity are
used. Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits, given their short-term nature, are reported at face value
which approximates fair value.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities sold under repurchase agreements, and Securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are short-term and are reported at face value which approximates fair value.
Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IBRD is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible nonperformance
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IBRD limits trading to a list of
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, IBRD receives collateral in connection with resale agreements as
well as swap agreements. This collateral serves to mitigate IBRD’s exposure to credit risk.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through the application of eligibility criteria and volume limits for
transactions with individual counterparties and through the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap
transactions. IBRD may require collateral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual
counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.
IBRD has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions see note F-Derivative Instruments.
The following is a summary of the collateral received by IBRD in relation to swap transactions as of March 31, 2014
and June 30, 2013.

As of March 31, 2014, IBRD received total cash collateral of $3,518 million ($4,366 million—June 30, 2013), of
which $2,447 million was invested in highly liquid instruments ($2,076 million—June 30, 2013).
Securities Lending: IBRD may engage in securities lending and repurchases against adequate collateral, as well as
securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations, and corporate and
ABS. These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow
IBRD to reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. For balance sheet presentation purposes,
IBRD presents its securities lending and repurchases, as well as resales, on a gross basis. As of March 31, 2014 and
June 30, 2013, there were no amounts which could potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master
netting arrangements.

Transfers of securities by IBRD to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as the accounting criteria for the
treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase
date.

In the case of resale agreements, IBRD receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to
repledge these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the
securities received are not recorded on IBRD’s balance sheet as the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have
not been met. As of March 31, 2014, securities purchased under resale agreements included $1,733 million of
securities which had not settled at that date (Nil—June 30, 2013). For the remaining purchases, IBRD received
securities with a fair value of $1,026 million ($1,711 million—June 30, 2013). None of these securities had been
transferred under repurchase or security lending agreements as of that date (Nil—June 30, 2013).
NOTE D—LOANS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
IBRD’s loans and other exposures (exposures) are generally made to, or guaranteed by member countries of IBRD.
In addition, IBRD may also make loans to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an affiliated organization,
without any guarantee. Other exposures include: Deferred Drawdown Options (DDOs), Irrevocable Commitments,
Exposures to Member Countries’ Derivatives, and Guarantees. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, with the
exception of one loan which is carried and reported at fair value, because it contains an embedded derivative.
Of the total loans outstanding as of March 31, 2014, 82% were to Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and
Central Asia, and East Asia and Pacific regions, combined.
Based on IBRD’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of loans outstanding are in the medium-risk and
high-risk classes.
As of March 31, 2014, only 0.30% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and were all related to one borrower.
The total provision for losses on accrual and nonaccrual loans accounted for 1.11% of the total loans portfolio.
Credit Quality of Sovereign Exposures
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s exposures, management has determined that IBRD has one portfolio segment –
Sovereign Exposures. IBRD’s loans constitute the majority of the Sovereign Exposures portfolio segment.
IBRD’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IBRD on time and
in full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The components considered in the analysis can be grouped broadly into
eight categories: political risk, external debt and liquidity, fiscal policy and public debt burden, balance of payments
risks, economic structure and growth prospects, monetary and exchange rate policy, financial sector risks, and
corporate sector debt and vulnerabilities. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IBRD’s exposures,
these exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the

24        IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2014
likelihood of loss: low, medium and high-risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status. IBRD considers all
exposures in nonaccrual status to be impaired.
IBRD’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provision for losses. Country risk ratings are
determined in review meetings that take place several times a year. All countries are reviewed at least once a year,
or more frequently, if circumstances warrant, to determine the appropriate ratings.
IBRD considers loans to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal, interest or other
charges due to IBRD on the dates provided in the contractual loan agreement.

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Loans and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provisions for losses, which reflects the probable
losses inherent in IBRD’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of potential losses arising from default and
nonpayment of principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Delays in receiving loan payments result in
present value losses to IBRD since it does not charge fees or additional interest on any overdue interest or charges.
These present value losses are equal to the difference between the present value of payments of interest and charges.
according to the related instrument’s contractual terms and the present value of its expected future cash flows. It is
IBRD’s practice not to write off its loans. All contractual obligations associated with exposures in nonaccrual status
have eventually been cleared, thereby allowing borrowers to eventually emerge from nonaccrual status. To date, no
loans have been written off.
Notwithstanding IBRD’s historical experience, the risk of losses associated with nonpayment of principal amounts
due is included in the accumulated provision for losses on loans and other exposures.

Effective July 16, 2013, all loans to, or guaranteed by Iran were placed into nonaccrual status. The aggregate
principal balance outstanding on these loans at July 16, 2013 was $697 million, of which $79 million was overdue
on that date. Subsequently, on September 27, 2013, Iran cleared all of its overdue principal and charges due to IBRD
and the loans to, or guaranteed by Iran were restored to accrual status on that date. Interest revenue for the nine
months ended March 31, 2014, increased by $8 million, $7 million of which represents revenue that would have
been accrued in previous fiscal years had these loans not been placed in nonaccrual status.

In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2014, interest revenue recognized on loans in nonaccrual
status was less than $1 million, while during the nine months ended March 31, 2014, the interest recognized was $2
million (Nil—three and nine months ended March 31, 2013).
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, no loans were placed in nonaccrual status or restored to
accrual status.

Guarantees
Guarantees of $1,892 million were outstanding at March 31, 2014 ($1,881 million—June 30, 2013). This amount
represents the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that IBRD could be required to make
under these guarantees and is not included on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These guarantees have original
maturities ranging between 5 and 20 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2029.
At March 31, 2014, liabilities related to IBRD's obligations under guarantees of $57 million ($59 million—June 30,
2013), have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the accumulated
provision for guarantee losses of $24 million ($22 million—June 30, 2013).
During the nine months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, no guarantees provided by IBRD were called.
Waivers of Loan Charges
IBRD provides waivers on eligible loans, which include a portion of interest on loans, a portion of the commitment
charge on undisbursed balances and a portion of the front-end fee charged on all eligible loans. Waivers are
approved annually by the Executive Directors of IBRD.
The reduction in net income during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, and March 31, 2013, resulting
from waivers of loan charges is summarized below:

Segment Reporting
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s operations, management has determined that IBRD has only one reportable
segment since IBRD does not manage its operations by allocating resources based on determination of the
contribution to net income from individual borrowers.
Loan revenue comprises interest, commitment fees, loan origination fees and prepayment premia, net of waivers.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2014, loans to 3 countries generated an excess of 10 percent of total loan
revenue; this amounted to $184 million, $173 million, and $172 million, respectively.

Fair Value Disclosures
The loan carried at fair value is classified as Level 3. This loan has an embedded derivative and its fair value is
estimated on a matrix basis against the related bond. As IBRD’s loans are not traded, the yield which is used as a
key input to determining the fair value of this loan is not observable. The yield applied in determining the fair value
of the loan at March 31, 2014 was 4%. An increase (decrease) in the yield would result in a decrease (increase) in
the fair value of the loan.
The following table provides a summary of changes in the fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 loan during the three and
nine months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
All IBRD’s loans are made to or guaranteed by countries that are members of IBRD, except for those loans made to
IFC. IBRD does not currently sell its loans.
As of March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013, except for one loan which is reported at fair value, all other loans are
carried at amortized cost. The fair value of these loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow method. This
method incorporates Credit Default Swap spreads for each borrower. Basis adjustments are applied to market
recovery levels to reflect IBRD’s recovery experience.
NOTE E—BORROWINGS
IBRD issues unsubordinated and unsecured fixed and variable rate debt in a range of currencies. Some of these debt
instruments are callable. Variable rates may be based on, for example, exchange rates, interest rates or equity
indices.
Borrowings issued by IBRD are carried and reported at fair value. As of March 31, 2014, 97% of the instruments in
the portfolio were classified as Level 2, within the fair value hierarchy.

During the nine months ended March 31, 2014, IBRD’s credit spreads widened. The estimated financial effect on
the fair value of the debt issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2014, were unrealized gains of $155 million.
Conversely, during the three months ended March 31, 2014, IBRD’s credit spreads tightened, resulting in estimated
unrealized losses of $89 million. These amounts were determined using observable changes in IBRD’s credit
spreads.
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2013, IBRD’s credit spreads remained largely unchanged.
IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings primarily relate to structured bonds. The fair value of these bonds is estimated using
valuation models that incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs, and unobservable inputs. The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of structured bonds are correlations and long-
dated interest rate volatilities. Generally, the movements in correlations are considered to be independent from the
movements in long-dated interest rate volatilities.
Correlation is the statistical measurement of the relationship between two variables. For contracts where the holder
benefits from the convergence of the underlying index prices (e.g. interest rates and foreign exchange rates), an
increase in correlation generally results in an increase in the fair value of the instruments. The magnitude and
direction of the fair value adjustments will depend on whether the holder is short or long the option.
Interest rate volatility is the extent to which the level of interest rates change over time. For purchased options, an
increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the fair value. In general, the volatility used to price the
option depends on the maturity of the underlying instrument and the option strike price. For IBRD, interest rate
volatilities are considered an unobservable input for maturities greater than ten years for certain currencies.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Techniques applied in determining the fair values of debt instruments are summarized below:
Discount notes and vanilla bonds
Discount notes and vanilla bonds are valued using the standard discounted cash flow method which relies on market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and funding spreads, where available
quoted marked prices are used to determine the fair value of short-term notes.
Structured bonds
Structured bonds issued by IBRD have coupon or repayment terms linked to the level or the performance of interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity indices or commodities. The fair value of the structured bonds is derived using
the discounted cash flow method based on estimated future pay-offs determined by applicable models and
computation of embedded optionality such as caps, floors and calls. A wide range of industry standard models such
as one factor Hull-White, LIBOR Market Model and Black-Scholes are used depending on the specific structure.
These models incorporate market observable inputs, such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads,
funding spreads, interest rates volatilities, equity index volatilities and equity indices. Where applicable, the models
also incorporate significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-dated interest rate volatilities.

a.Exchange traded instruments are generally subject to daily margin requirements and are deemed to have no material
  credit risk. All swaptions, options, and futures contracts are interest rate contracts.
b.These relate to TBA securities.

IBRD is not required to post collateral under its derivative agreements as long as it maintains a AAA credit rating.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that are in a liability
position on March 31, 2014 is $1,635 million. IBRD has not posted any collateral with these counterparties due to
its AAA credit rating.
If the credit-risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered to the extent that IBRD
would have been required to post collateral on March 31, 2014, the amount of collateral required to be posted by
IBRD would have been $428 million. Subsequent triggers of contingent features would require posting of additional
collateral, up to a maximum of $1,635 million. In contrast, IBRD received collateral totaling $5,774 million as of
March 31, 2014, in relation to swap transactions (see Note C-Investments).

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IBRD enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IBRD the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.
The following table summarizes information on derivative assets and liabilities (before and after netting
adjustments) that are reflected on IBRD’s Condensed Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013. Total
derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the cash and
securities collateral received.

38        IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2014
The fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings related derivatives is estimated using valuation models that
incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs and unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable
inputs used in the fair value measurement of these derivatives are correlations and long dated interest rate
volatilities. See Note E – Borrowings for details on these unobservable inputs.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, TBAs, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Currency
swaps and interest rate swaps are either plain vanilla or structured. Currency forward contracts and plain vanilla
currency and interest rate swaps are valued using the standard discounted cash flow methods using market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and funding spreads. For structured
currency and interest rate swaps, which primarily consist of callable swaps linked to interest rates, foreign exchange
rates, and equity indices, valuation models and inputs similar to the ones applicable to structured bonds valuation are
used. Where applicable, the models also incorporate significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-
dated interest rate volatilities. 
NOTE G—RETAINED EARNINGS, ALLOCATIONS AND TRANSFERS
IBRD makes net income allocation decisions on the basis of reported net income, adjusted to exclude the unrealized
gains or losses on non-trading portfolios, net, restricted income and Board of Governors-approved transfers, and
after considering the allocation to the pension reserve.
On August 7, 2013, IBRD’s Executive Directors approved the allocation of $147 million out of the net income
earned in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 to the General Reserve. In addition, the Executive Directors also
approved a reduction in the Pension Reserve by $99 million and an increase in Restricted Retained Earnings by $7
million.
On October 11, 2013, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved an immediate transfer to IDA of $621 million and $200
million to Surplus. The transfer to IDA was made on October 16, 2013.
Retained earnings comprise the following components at March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013:

NOTE H—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
IBRD, IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) participate in a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and PEBP that cover substantially all of their staff
members.
All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these pension plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA
based upon their employees’ respective participation in the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between
IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio. The net periodic pension cost (credit) for the SRP, RSBP and
PEBP is included in Administrative Expenses, in the Condensed Statement of Income.
The following table summarizes the benefit costs associated with the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP for IBRD and IDA for
the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013:

settled quarterly. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, IBRD’s administrative expenses are net of
the share of expenses allocated to IDA of $371 million and $1,142 million, respectively ($378 million and $1,111
million, respectively—three and nine months ended March 31, 2013).
Revenue jointly earned by IBRD and IDA is allocated based on the same agreed cost sharing ratio that is used to
allocate administrative expenses. Amounts are settled quarterly. For the three and nine months ended March 31,
2014, IBRD’s other revenue is net of revenue allocated to IDA of $68 million and $180 million, respectively ($63
million and $160 million, respectively—three and nine months ended March 31, 2013).
At March 31, 2014, the amount receivable for administrative services was net of IDA’s share of investments
associated with PCRF.
