       The World Bank's calculation of the Government's interest payments-to-revenue differs from the Government's numbers in two aspects: first, the World Bank separates out
     interest payments from the debt service (which includes principal payments); and second, the World Bank's calculation of revenues excludes inflows in the fiscal accounts,
     which it considers to be financing items. IMF further excludes unbudgeted revenues and estimates debtservice-to-revenue ratio at 66 percent (IMF Article IV 2017).

       The forecast for oil production of 2.1 mbpd in 2017 is based on the current efforts of Government to restore peace and stability in the Niger Delta region, which has reportedly
     yielded some result so far – oil production has been restored from 1.5 mbpd in August 2016 to almost 2.0 mbpd in January–February 2017. Furthermore, the recent agreement
     between the Government and the international oil companies (IOCs) to settle joint venture (JV) cash call arrears and establish a new funding mechanism for JV arrangements is
     expected to stabilize production from the JV contracts.

     The Ministry of Power, Works and Housing and the Ministry of Finance are committed to taking urgent
     and decisive actions that are needed to put the power sector on a track of sustainable development. Three
     years after privatization, the power reform program has not yet delivered substantial improvement in electricity
     services and the sector is in a state of emergency. The privatized Generation Companies (GENCOs) and
     Distribution Companies (DISCOs) may be insolvent. Unless power sector market failures are addressed, there
     could be further deterioration in power supply and the power sector reform program itself may not deliver the
     anticipated results. This would have a calamitous impact on the country's ability to revive growth and restore
     confidence for private investments. In view of the urgent need to address the dire challenges within the power
     sector, a Power Sector Recovery Program (PSRP) has been developed.

     The Federal Executive Council (FEC) of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) approved the Power
     Sector Recovery Program on March 22, 2017. The PSRP approved by FEC will be further elaborated in the
     coming months as implementation details are defined. It will be adjusted as necessary to take account of
     changing circumstances during its implementation.

     Key objectives of the Program
     The objectives of the PSRP are to restore the sector's financial viability; to improve power supply reliability to
     meet growing demand; to strengthen the sector's institutional framework and increase transparency; to
     implement clear policies that promote and encourage investor confidence in the sector; and to establish a
     contract-based electricity market.

     Components of the Recovery Program
     The plan outlines specific strategies for achieving the above objectives. These are presented under the
     following components:
     ·        Eliminate of cash deficits that have accumulated in the past through to December 2016, including
     through the full disbursement of the Central Bank's Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilization Facility
     (“NEMSF”)
     ·        Implement an end user tariff trajectory that ensures cost reflective tariffs in the next 5 years
     ·        Funded payment of future sector deficits
     ·        Ensure DISCO performance and accountability, including through the enforcement of commitments
     made in Performance Agreement signed with the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and reflected in the tariffs
     at privatization
     ·        Ensure grid stability by attaining effective and dependable generation and distribution of at least
     4,000MW in order to build confidence with consumers
     ·        Ensure that accumulated MDA electricity debts are paid and implement payment mechanism for future
     bills, including through the introduction of a system where bills are paid centrally on behalf of MDAs and
     deducted from their budgetary allocations
     ·        Improve sector governance, including through the appointment of vacant boards in all the sector
     institutions
     ·        Increase electricity access by implementing off grid renewable solutions
     ·        Develop and implement an FX policy for the power sector
     ·        Make contracts effective where penalties are imposed on sector participants that fail to fulfill their
     contractual obligations
     Implement a comprehensive communication strategy that results in buy-in of all sector stakeholders and
     Nigerians into the PRSP

        Shui and Voneuxkull, 2014, describe this methodology, which estimates the prices of final, intermediate, and capital goods under the current tariff structure and a zero-tariff counterfactual. These price
     variations imply changes in firm profitability based on the technology involved and the type of good or service being produced. The changes in profitability are short-run static gains derived using a partial
     equilibrium model. The same methodology was previously used to quantify the impact of Nigeria's adoption of the Common External Tariff.
