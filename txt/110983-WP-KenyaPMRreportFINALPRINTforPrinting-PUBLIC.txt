                             BOX 1: KENYA’S COMPETITION ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK

       Kenya has made significant progress in strengthening its competition enforcement framework to enable
       the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) to promote competition and to protect consumers from
       anticompetitive market conduct and potentially harmful mergers. An important step in this direction was
       the enactment of the Competition Act 2010, which came into effect in August 2011 and established the CAK
       as an independent body, whose principal functions include applying, promoting and enforcing compliance
       with the Act. It also established the Competition Tribunal which hears appeals against decisions of the
       Authority. The Act contains provisions covering restrictive trade practices (including agreements and abuse
       of dominance), mergers, and control of unwarranted concentration of economic power. The CAK currently
       operates with around 33 technical staff and, in the last two years, has concluded four cases relating to
       restrictive trade practices, reviewed 178 mergers, and provided several advisory opinions.


       Recent amendments to the Competition Act through the enactment of the Finance Act, 2014 went some
       way towards addressing a number of outstanding issues in the competition law framework. Amongst the
       amendments were provisions to allow for the development of a leniency program, whereby firms could
       be incentivized to disclose cartel behavior or to cooperate with a CAK investigation in exchange for being
       granted reductions on fines that are set out by the Act. The amendments also mandate all professional
       associations to apply for exemptions to horizontal agreements in case their rules could amount to a restrictive
       trade practice. The CAK has published various guidelines on restrictive trade practices and mergers to
       increase the transparency and predictability of the legal framework. The CAK has also recently launched
       an anti-cartel compliance program for business associations - initially targeting financial and agribusiness
       sectors - to encourage compliance with the law and eliminate horizontal agreements.


       Despite these advancements, there remain areas which could be addressed in order to improve competition
       enforcement. The most important amendment is raising sanctions to enhance their deterrent effect. Fines
       are currently capped at KSH 10 million for restrictive trade practices, particularly horizontal agreements,
       regardless of the size of the firm involved or the nature of the offence. A common international practice is to
       the set the maximum fine at 10 percent of the turnover of the firm involved. Furthermore, since it is currently
       a criminal offence to engage in prohibited restrictive practices, it is recommended that it should be clarified
       precisely which practices are offences and who will be subject to pecuniary sanctions versus imprisonment.
       This is especially important since criminalization would impact on the leniency program.

         Toulouse School (see Laffont and Tirole, 1991).

         Annex 6 provides an example of a set of questions and issues applied to the case of strict licensing requirements that can be
         used by policy-makers to optimize regulatory design or identify appropriate pro-competitive alternatives. Further guidance on
         identifying the most appropriate suitable alternative regulatory and non-regulatory measures that remove, or at least reduce,
         potential anticompetitive distortions are laid out in the forthcoming Guidelines on the Assessment of Regulatory Impact on
         Competition prepared by the Competition Authority of Kenya. It is worth noting that the outlined principles and best practices
         outlined are consistent with other existing tools and checklists. For example, the OECD market openness principles are intended
         to be built into the domestic regulatory process to ensure that domestic regulations, procedures and administrative practices are
         in line with trade and investment openness.
     	
    18
         It should be noted, however, that caution should be exercised in facilitating information exchange amongst competitors since
         this has the potential to facilitate collusion. In particular, information exchange of disaggregated/firm-level information on future
         variables should be avoided.

         Two criteria are used to allocate countries into stages of development: (i) GDP per capita at market exchange rate; and (ii) share of
         exports of mineral good in total exports. Countries that export more than 70 percent mineral products (measured using five-year
         average) are considered factor-driven. Moreover, stages of development are dictated only by income for countries that export
         less than 70 percent minerals (World Economic Forum, 2013). According to World Economic Forum (2013), the following are
         factor-driven countries (stage one of development): Bangladesh, Benin. Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, Cote

                                              BOX 2: PMR METHODOLOGY: ECONOMY-WIDE SCORE

     Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators form a comprehensive and internationally-comparable set
     of indicators that measure the degree to which policies promote or inhibit competition in areas of the
     product market where competition is viable.21 PMR indicators have proven to be extremely useful to monitor
     the regulatory achievements of OECD countries and to evaluate the effectiveness of policies introduced
     throughout the years. Moreover, PMR indicators have been widely used to help policy-makers to draw a
     clear picture of regulations in different countries, with the objective of identifying gaps in regulations and/
     or room for improvements.


     The OECD PMR indicators rely on information collected through the OECD regulatory indicators
     questionnaires. Figure 1 hereunder summarizes how the economy-wide score is calculated. For further
     details on the questions, scores and weights used for the OECD methodology, see the OECD website, the
     Indicator Schemata (http://www.oecd.org/eco/reform/Schemata_PMR.xlsx), and Koske et al (2015).

              According to the PMR, an SOE is defined as a company in which state or provincial governments (not including local governments
              or municipalities) hold, either directly or indirectly through a government-controlled company, the largest single share of the firm’s
              equity capital. Public ownership is measured by the extent to which the government participates and intervenes in markets through
              the scope and scale of its SOEs. Publicly controlled firms also include government entities that are not organized as companies,
              but operate in business or market activities.

                                           BOX 3: PRICE CONTROLS IN KENYA

     Among the possible regulatory tools instituted by governments, there are price control rules that are often
     adopted in traditional monopoly sectors such as utilities (e.g., water and electricity distribution), with the aim of
     protecting consumers from excessively high prices. Economic theory suggests, however, that in most cases the
     negative effects of such policies outweigh the benefits. In general terms, there will be an inefficient allocation of
     resources and high costs for governments to sustain the policy and to tackle the economic consequences. The
     sections below will shed some light on the two types of price control: price ceilings and price floors.


     Price ceiling

     In Kenya, the 2011 Price Control Act lays down the following in Article 2(1):


     The Minister may, from time to time, by order in the Gazette, declare any goods to be essential commodities
     for the purposes of this Act and determine the maximum prices of the commodities in consultation with the
     industry. (Emphasis added)


     This provision entails what economic theory calls price ceilings. The government may be willing to set price
     ceilings, which prevent prices from exceeding a certain maximum, for those goods and services that are
     believed to be sold at a price that is excessive. However, the policy might generate counterproductive
     effects. Indeed, when the ceiling is placed below the price that would otherwise arise in the market under
     normal competitive conditions, then there would be a lack of supply or excess demand. That is, producers
     will not produce as much at the lower price, while consumers will demand more because the goods are
     cheaper. Therefore, this type of price policy, very common in the agriculture sector as well as in the utilities,
     might lead to reduced production that would harm consumers rather than be beneficial to them. Moreover,
     those producers who are willing to differentiate their products, offering higher quality or more innovative
     goods, are discouraged to do so as they will not be able to charge higher prices to cover for the higher costs.
     In addition, price ceilings present a further drawback: The price set as price ceiling by the government is
     likely to become the focal price. Therefore, low-cost producers that would be willing to charge a lower price
     and serve the most price sensitive part of the demand will nevertheless charge the price at the ceiling level,
     thereby harming consumers as well as competition in the market.


     In Kenya, the price ceiling provision neither specifies extreme situations when the Act should be applied (for
     instance, crisis situations, major imbalance between demand and supply, and obvious market malfunctioning)
     nor does it state a maximum period for the applications and re-evaluation of the need of price controls. In
     this case, the Minister of Finance enjoys discretion over the implementation of the law and might become
     a target of interested groups that might benefit from such controls. Furthermore, the decision on the prices
     to be regulated does not entail any opinion of the Competition Authority regarding market conditions that
     could merit temporary price controls. In other countries such as Romania, the Romanian Competition Law
     requires the government to seek the Competition Council’s advisory opinion before instituting price-control
     measures. Such a practice ensures that government intervention does not run counter to the competition
     policy objectives, and that the policy option selected is the ‘least restrictive’ of competition in the market.

1. Economy-Wide Regulatory Obstacles to Competition




     It is also important to highlight that the participation of the industry in determining maximum prices by the
     government creates platforms that encourage price and cost information exchange among competitors,
     facilitating the creation of instruments that can later on facilitate cartels.


     Nonetheless, it should be noted that to date, the above-quoted provision of the Price Control Act has never
     been enforced in Kenya, as no good has been declared by the Minister to be an ‘essential commodity’. However,
     the government currently sets price ceilings for fuel at the retail level.28


     Price floor

     Price floors are the lowest legal price at which goods or services can be sold. The reasoning behind
     governments imposing price floors is to prevent prices from being too low. For example, in the agriculture
     sector, price floors could be justified on the ground of protecting farmers from unfavorable harvesting
     conditions in special situations. Another sector where minimum prices are introduced is professional services.
     In this case, minimum price limitations are often justified by professional associations due to the intention of
     maintaining certain quality standards in the provision of the services that would be impaired with extremely
     vigorous price competition.


     Price floors have drawbacks and the impact of such price regulations should be carefully evaluated. In fact,
     imposing minimum prices above the market-equilibrium price is likely to translate into higher prices for
     consumers and to generate unserved demand that could have been cleared at the market-equilibrium
     price. Moreover, minimum prices restrain competition as producers are unable to compete over the price
     dimension.

                                           BOX 4: INVESTMENT INCENTIVES

     Incentives are policy instruments that governments can use to encourage particular activities so as to foster
     economic or social development in certain areas.


     The implementation of incentive schemes might be conducive to anticompetitive effects when not properly
     designed. Economic theory suggests that the benefits that the incentive brings about should outweigh
     the costs, in terms of negative effects on trade and competition in the markets. In assessing the effects
     of investment incentives one should not only consider the welfare of the recipients, but also the potential
     impact on competitors, consumers, and other stakeholders such as input suppliers (e.g. labor).


     As a rule of thumb, incentives should have the following features to be effective and to minimize distortion
     of competition:

     Fit for purpose: Incentives should be such that they are apt to achieve the purpose they have been designed for.


     Non-discriminatory: Incentives should not favor one specific company in the market or one specific
     technology/production as this would distort competition.


     Non-selective: All players within a particular market (for which the incentive is designed for) should be able
     to benefit from the incentive.


     Time-bound: Incentives should respect time-bound limits to allow for reassessing their rationale.
     Some exceptions might apply;for instance, there might be social reasons driving the implementation of
     discriminatory incentives that support the development of green energy plants rather than traditional plants,
     but this intention has to be explicitly considered as the policy objective.


     In Kenya, the Investment Promotion Act, 2004 (IPA) established a corporate body known as the Kenya
     Investment Authority (KenInvest) with the purpose “to promote and facilitate investment by assisting
     investors in obtaining the licenses necessary to invest and by providing other assistance and incentives”.
     Under the IPA, investment is defined as “the contribution of local or foreign capital by an investor, including
     the creation or acquisition of business assets by or for a business enterprise and includes the expansion,
     restructuring, improvement or rehabilitation of a business enterprise.”KenInvest was designed to be a ‘one
     stop shop’ for investors.


     However, the Kenyan framework encompasses different incentives covering various sectors of the economy.
     The main incentives available in Kenya consist of tax exemption or regulatory exemption. For instance,
     the Investment Deduction Allowance permits tax-free capital investments; Export Processing Zones (EPZs)
     benefit from a 10-year tax holiday and VAT exemption. For EPZs there is no minimum level of investment and
     any proportion of foreign or local shareholding is permitted.


     A recent report on tax incentives by the Kenyan Institute of Economic Affairs showed that in Kenya low
     rates of taxation may promote investment; however, there is minimal evidence that discriminatory tax
     incentives are better placed to promote investment than simple, uniform regimes with low to moderate
     rates of taxation. According to section 13 of the Income Tax Act, the Minister may, by notice in the Gazette,

     provide income tax exemptions. However, the basic criteria for such exemptions are not specified in the
     legal framework. In the past, exemptions have been granted on a case-by-case basis with potential negative
     effects on competition in some markets. Section 23 of the old VAT Act provided for discretionary powers
     that would allow taxpayers to be granted VAT waivers by the government. Nonetheless, it is important to
     note that this section or a mirror of the same was removed and the current VAT Act 2013, addresses,to some
     extent, discretion in granting tax remissions, another potential source of distortions.


     Moreover, according to the IPA, investors may be granted an Investment Certificate, which entails such
     benefits as entitlement to all licenses required for his or her operations, and work permits for three members
     of management or technical staff and three shareholders or partners valid for two years each. Obtaining the
     Investment Certificate at KenInvest’s “one-stop” is beneficial because Kenya has rather extensive licensing
     requirements. It is important to note that the IPA sets the criteria for granting a certificate, but one of the
     criteria (an investment being beneficial to Kenya) could be subject to discretion.

                                                BOX 5: THE ROLE OF THE NCPB

     The NCPB was established by the Government of Kenya in 1979 by merging the Maize and Produce
     Board with the Wheat Board of Kenya in order to stabilize grain markets through the control of prices, the
     purchase of domestic maize production and the management of a public buffer stock, called the Strategic
     Grain Reserve (SGR). After liberalization in 1993, NCPB reduced its maize purchases and left greater scope
     to private operators. However, since 2000, the government has gradually increased NCPB’s purchases
     again in an attempt to protect farmers from aggressive competition coming from the COMESA region and
     temporarily address drought and food crises.

     The NCPB’s core business consists of commercial grain trading. In this respect, the NCPB deals with various
     products (e.g. rice, beans, and agricultural inputs) and offers related services to its clients (such as weighing,
     drying, grading, and leasing equipment), in competition with other players in the industry. Besides its
     commercial role, the NCPB also carries out social functions such as procuring, storing, and maintaining an
     SGR stock of up to 8 million bags (more than 700,000 tons) on behalf of the government to be used for price
     stabilization purposes. The NCPB also manages the National Famine Relief Program on behalf of the GoK.

     Considering the price stabilization mechanism, since liberalization, the government contracts the NCPB to
     purchase a given quantity of bags of maize to form the SGR. According to the NCPB, the price of purchase
     is based on market analysis. Indeed, the NCPB continuously monitors the market through a network of
     approximately 80 officials scattered around the country. The NCPB claims that, since their purchases need
     to comply with very high quality standards as per the Kenya Bureau of Standards grades, purchasing
     imported grain is very unlikely. In addition, the purchase of maize is not carried out under competitive
     conditions. The NCPB directly purchases maize from farmers (mainly on a large scale) but lacks a clear,
     systematic tendering procedure according to stakeholders.

     Influence on prices
     The NCPB currently purchases a significant percentage of locally produced maize grain at a fixed price,
     frequently higher than the competitive market price. Purchased grain is mostly sold on to millers, with some
     excess sold outside of the country. From 1995 – 2004, NCPB actions are estimated to have contributed to
     an increase in the price of maize grain by approximately 20 percent on average during the period (Jayne
     et al., 2008).45 Regarding the maize market, the NCPB remains an important player, purchasing in normal
     years around 25-35 percent of the total domestically marketed maize, most of all from large-scale farmers.

     Since liberalization, the NCPB has been considered by policy-makers as a buyer of last resort, although it is
     often unable to timely meet financial commitments towards farmers. The role of the NCPB has often been
     in the headlines as well as been discussed during parliamentary assemblies.46

     The current policy framework is likely to alter the competitive conditions in the market. First of all, farmers’
     production decisions during growing seasons will be influenced by expectations of NCPB’s post-harvest
     activities. Moreover, while the NCPB operations have a direct impact on the upstream market only, its
     activities will indirectly affect prices and expectations in the downstream market.

     Reform of the NCPB: focus on competing with the private sector on a commercial basis
     In July 2013, a Presidential Taskforce on Parastatal Reform was established to conduct a policy review of the
     parastatal framework in Kenya. The aim was to design the most appropriate institutional arrangements for
     the country’s parastatals, taking into account governance needs as well as the viability and duplication of
     mandates, amongst other objectives.

       and raised average price levels by roughly 20% between 1995 and 2004.

Dismantling Regulatory Obstacles to Competition                                                                                              25

      One of the key recommendations emanating from this taskforce was that the NCPB should be restructured
      to separate its commercial and social functions by transferring the SGR mandate to the relevant Ministry of
      Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, whilst NCPB would be retained as a purely commercial entity under the
      Government Investment Corporation.

      Following an assessment of the restructuring plan completed by Ernst and Young in 2014, it was announced
      that the NCPB would be restructured to form the Grain Corporation of Kenya (GCK). The GCK will continue
      to be active in all aspects of grain trading but with an enhanced focus on commercial operations. Moreover,
      it has been proposed that the GCK’s mandate should be expanded to allow it to deal with a wide range of
      products, rather than only the crops to which the NCPB is currently restricted (maize, sorghum, wheat, rice).
      The GCK will be divided into two main business units, a trading operations unit and a warehousing
      operations unit. The report recommends amendment of the NCPB Act to allow NCPB to fully realize its
      commercial mandate. It has also been proposed that the GCK would be exempted from provisions of the
      State Corporation Act (which would imply that it would not be required to comply with legal provisions on
      public procurement) to enable it compete more effectively with the private sector.

      Meanwhile, the report proposes that the SGR be managed by a new National Food Security Agency, and a
      commodity exchange would be created as a private company in order to increase efficiency in grain trading.
      In addition, the creation of a grain sector regulator, under the Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Authority, to
      supervise and license market players in the grain industry, has also been proposed.

      The reform process is currently ongoing, but it has been observed that it will likely to face some challenges
      in the form of the need to restructure the NCPB’s balance sheet following losses incurred in recent years
      through the sale of subsidized maize and fertilizer, as well as restrictions on borrowing and selling core assets
      due to its status as a parastatal.

       Commodity exchanges are organized marketplace where buyers and sellers come together to trade commodity-related contracts
       following rules set by the exchange. Exchanges might be organized in different ways, but they tend to have the following elements
       in common: (i) an exchange provides a trading platform (e.g. physical location or electronic trading system); (ii) it provides standard
       contracts; (iii) in an exchange, users will not interact directly, but through brokers; (iv) it provides security on the quality and quantity
       of the commodities traded; (v) it guarantees logistics; (vi) it is strictly regulated (Mbeng Mezui et al., 2013).

                                                      BOX 6: THE WAREHOUSE RECEIPT SYSTEM

       Warehouse Receipt Systems (WRSs) are an important and effective tool for creating liquidity and easing
       access to credit. Such schemes also offer additional benefits such as smoothing the supply and prices in the
       market, improving growers’ incomes, and reducing food losses.


       The WRS, also known as inventory credits, can facilitate credit for inventory or products held in storage.
       These receipts, sometimes known as warrants, when backed by legal provisions that guarantee quality,
       provide a secure system whereby stored agricultural commodities can serve as collateral, be sold, traded,
       or used for delivery against financial instruments including futures contracts. These receipts are documents
       that state the ownership of a specific quantity of products with specific characteristics and stored in a specific
       warehouse.


       Currently in Kenya, there are two certified WRSs: the Eastern Africa Grain Council (EAGC); and the National
       Cereal and Produce Board. At the moment there is no legal framework guiding the certification process.
       Moreover, the Kenya National Federation of Agricultural Producers (KENFAP) study revealed that there is little
       awareness of this system among farmers and current requirements, in terms of quality standards and minimum
       quantity, make it mainly accessible to large-scale producers and, to a lesser extent, small farm holders.

     The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries has recently published a Draft National Tea Policy (May 2014). The policy has
     not yet been implemented and it outlines the government’s intended measures in the tea industry. The objective of the policy is
     “to make the Kenyan tea industry sustainable and globally competitive in order to enhance its contribution to the Kenyan economy
     and improved livelihoods through employment creation and increased incomes.”

                                                      BOX 7: SUBSIDIES IN THE INPUT MARKET

     A subsidy is defined as a payment, generally made from public resources, that reduces the price that a buyer
     pays for a good or service below the price at which the seller provides it. The difference between the seller’s
     price and the buyer’s price is the amount of the subsidy (Takeshima and Lee, 2012).


     Governments may be willing to subsidize agricultural inputs with the economic aim of increasing agricultural
     productivity, which may be linked to social policy objectives such as poverty reduction and food security.
     The purpose of such subsidies is therefore to allow farmers to access lower cost inputs (such as seeds and
     fertilizers). Reducing farmers’ costs and raising their productivity is expected to increase their incomes, which
     can be invested in better equipment, for instance.


     However, when designing subsidies, one should not overlook the costs and the distortive incentives
     associated with the subsidy program.


     First of all, subsidies are very costly for governments, especially when these are managed by bodies with
     limited efficiency, not subject to market forces, and prone to political capture. Therefore, optimal subsidies
     are designed, bearing in mind their opportunity cost (i.e., redirecting those public funds to investments
     with higher rates of return). Moreover, targeting subsidies at more vulnerable groups is often complicated.
     Hence, subsidies may heighten inequality by mainly beneﬁting the larger farmers rather than small-scale
     farmers or subsistence farmers.


     In addition, improperly designed subsidies may distort the private sector input market, artificially driving
     the market price down and preventing the private sector from competing with subsidized products on a
     level playing field. Low costs may also induce farmers to overuse, or switch to inefficient input-intensive
     production systems.


     There are situations where inputs can be productively subsidized, but they need to be carefully identified
     and the subsidy program should be temporary and have a clear exit strategy. For instance, breeding of new
     crop varieties is usually an activity carried out by the government. Properly designed subsidies can help
     temporarily address market failures and minimize distortions on the market.


     Governments, moreover, might consider adopting less distortive tools to support farmers’ income. For
     instance, governments might encourage and support farmers to team up in order to enjoy the benefits
     of bulk purchases of inputs. Alternatively, the government could set up a demand-side voucher system in
     order to provide for subsidized inputs. If properly administered, such schemes are generally less distortive of
     market systems than direct subsidies since they provide consumers with a greater degree of choice in terms
     of choosing their suppliers and allow supplier outcomes to be better linked to performance. This has proven
     successful in some other countries.58

       the following information: Thank you for your SMS. Your porting request is being processed; OR your porting request has failed.
       Please contact your new Operator. When the automated switching process is complete, one will receive, within a few minutes (but

       Ideally, porting fees should be eliminated. A less efficient alternative consists in imposing cost-based porting fees. This latter
       solution is not the first best option, but it does represents an improvement from the current set-up.

                                                  BOX 8: RENEWABLE ENERGY- FEED-IN TARIFFS

       Developing a reliable system for energy production is one of the pillars of the Kenya Vision 2030. In particular,
       the 2030 strategy has put forward the importance of creating an efficient system for electricity generation
       from renewable resources. For example, the Vision has flagged the relevance of mobilizing private sector
       capital for generation of electricity from renewable energy.106


       Kenya has followed international examples and introduced feed-in-tariff (FiT) schemes to support the
       development of renewable energy (small hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, biogas and biomass) and to
       support the country’s great need for electricity generation. Feed-in tariffs are mechanisms designed to
       speed up investment in renewable energy technologies by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy
       producers and tailoring these contracts to the costs of the generation technology. In Kenya, they were
       introduced in 2008.107


       Feed-in-tariffs are granted on a first-come first-served basis but the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum is
       now exploring the introduction of an auction system to allocate these tariffs. The adoption of an auction
       system is expected to create more competitive conditions for entering the generation market.108 Without a
       market-based solution for FiT allocation, entry conditions are altered, with the least efficient players having
       equal probability of entry as the most efficient ones. A case of best practice comes from Europe, Brazil
       and China, where governments have slowly started to move away from FCFS allocation of FiT, promoting
       a more competitive process. The need for change has often been supported by stakeholders. In the UK,
       for example, stakeholders indicated that due to budget limitations, it was desirable to rapidly switch to a
       competitive-constraint allocation process.109 Even small countries like Rwanda use a competitive process
       to select renewable energy projects. In Peru and Brazil, the use of competitive selection processes has
       substantially reduced the FiT paid by consumers (24% in Peru in the first tender carried out in 2009).

      BOX 9: INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICES- EC REVIEW ON COMPETITION IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

      In 2004, the European Commission (EC) analyzed the professional service market and identified five main
      categories of rules that are most likely to restrict competition:

      1.	 Fixed prices – According to the EC, these instruments are likely to have the most detrimental effect
            on competition. They reduce the benefits that competitive markets deliver onto consumers, severely
            limiting consumers’ choice. In most Member States of the EU, fees are negotiated between the service
            provider and the client.

      2.	 Recommended prices – This kind of practice has a negative effect on competition as it might facilitate
            coordination of prices between practitioners.

      3.	 Advertising restrictions – Advertising facilitates competition, to the extent that it provides information
            to consumers and allows them to make better-informed decisions. Furthermore, the EC recognizes that
            comparative advertising can be a crucial competitive tool for new firms entering the market and for
            existing firms wanting to launch new products.

      4.	 Entry restrictions and reserved rights – Excessive licensing regulation is likely to reduce the supply
            of service providers, with negative consequences for competition and quality of service. These can
            take the form of minimum periods of education, professional examinations, and minimum periods of
            professional experience. In many cases, entry restrictions are coupled with reserved rights to provide
            certain services. Entry restrictions, combined with reserved rights, ensure that only practitioners with
            appropriate qualifications and skills can carry out certain tasks.

      5.	 Regulations governing business structure and multidisciplinary practices – Business structure regulations
            may have a negative economic impact if they prevent providers from developing new services or cost-
            efficient business models. For example, these regulations might prevent lawyers and accountants from
            providing integrated legal and accountancy advice for tax issues or prevent the development of one-
            stop shops for professional services in rural areas. These regulations can restrict the ownership structure
            of professional services companies, the scope for collaboration with other professions and, in some
            cases, the opening of branches, franchises or chains.

                                              BOX 10: THE EUROPEAN UNION ON SLOTS ALLOCATION

           The EC has recently acknowledged the necessity of modifying the current airport slots allocation policy.
           An analysis carried out between 2010 and 2011 showed that the current slot regulation system prevents
           optimal usage of the scarce capacity of airports. In 2011, the Commission presented the Airport Package,
           proposing to change the current regulation and allow for a market-based mechanism for slots distribution.
           The package also calls for greater independence of the slot coordinator and for allowing airlines to trade
           slots in a transparent manner. Currently, when an airport expands, coordinators distribute the additional take-
           off and landing slots, saving 50 percent for new entrants, while the remaining 50 percent goes to incumbents
           on a first-come first-served basis.


           Specifically, the Airport Package proposal on airport slots allocation (December 1st, 2011) foresees:

           1.	 Allowing airlines to trade slots with each other at airports anywhere in the EU in a transparent way;

           2.	 Reforming the rules designed to help new entrants access the market at congested airports. This will
                 allow a greater number of carriers to challenge more effectively the ‘dominant’ carriers which have a
                 large presence at busy airports;

           3.	 Tightening the rules requiring airlines to demonstrate that they have used their slots sufficiently during
                 the season;

           4.	 Tightening the rules on the independence of the coordinator and increasing the level of transparency
                 on slots transactions, in order to make the market work better.


           According to the research carried out by the EC, these changes would be worth €5 billion to the European
           economy. Negotiations on the adoption of this package are under discussion.131

                               BOX 11: COMPETITION AS A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT

  All market participants try to influence the regulatory environment so that their interests are promoted and
  protected. In doing so, they do not take into account the impact that some regulatory measures may have
  on other market participants and on the overall economy. This is the responsibility of political institutions
  that have to mediate among the various, and sometimes conflicting, interests of all actors. A possible
  equilibrium of this political process is one in which some groups of citizens are willing to accept the negative
  consequences of protecting the interests of others if they can benefit from the same form of protection of
  their own interests. Although this is a possible political solution, it is not the most efficient one. Moreover,
  economic interests that are dispersed, such as those of consumers, are not normally adequately represented
  in the political arena and they risk being neglected.

  Establishing competition in the economy should be seen as a new social contract whereby all market
  participants accept to give up the measures that unduly shield their interests in exchange of similar reforms
  in other markets. Although each group of stakeholders may perceive this move as risky or unsafe, in the
  medium-run all will take advantage of lower prices, a wide variety of products, innovative services and, in
  general, a more dynamic and prosperous economic environment where new business opportunities can arise.
  It is therefore crucial that all sectors of the economy undergo such a transformation, so that competition is
  ensured in the economy as a whole, and across the board.

       The weights reflect the relative importance of each good in household consumption in a given period. In light of the methodology
       adopted, it seems reasonable to look at the CPI weight in order to understand which are the goods and services (and the related economy
       sectors) that are likely to affect consumer spending the most. Data source: KNBS, CPI and inflation rates for February 2015, available at
