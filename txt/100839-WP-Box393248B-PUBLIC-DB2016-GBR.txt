THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on t he
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      GBP 30 for software incorporation, and GBP 100 for paper
      incorporation.

      In case the company chooses to retain incorporation agents to file for
      registration, in addition to the above documents, the application file
      must include the agents’ name and address. Note that in case the
      company wants to amend model articles of association or company
      memoranda it cannot file for registration online via
      www.gov.uk/register-a-company-online. Instead, the company must use
      professionals to compose incorporation documents and submit them
      via specialized software to Companies House.

      Registration is typically completed within a few hours.

      Contact HMRC and register for VAT

      A business will need to register for VAT if its taxable goods and services
      supplied within the UK for the previous 12 months is more than the
      current registration threshold of £82,000, or the business expects it to
      go over that figure in the next 30 days alone, it must register for VAT.
      However, the business may also voluntarily choose to register for VAT if
      its VAT taxable goods fall under the £82,000 threshold.

      Most businesses, including Limited Companies, can register for VAT       Less than one day

      account online at: https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration or send paper (online procedure)
      forms through the post. Most applications for VAT registration can be
      completed online but there are some circumstances where a business
      has to apply by post. To register online for VAT or use other VAT online
      services, a business will first need to sign up for HMRC Online Services
      or the Government Gateway.

      * Contact HMRC and register for PAYE

      The company must contact the HMRC to set up a contribution scheme
      for national insurance and pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax, which deducts        3 days,
      tax from employee wages or salary. The company will be issued with an simultaneous with

      company will use the PIN to register and enroll online. For security
      reasons, a check is run on the data provided. A small percentage of
      registrations who fail the security check can take longer. Otherwise,
      activation is instant.

        Since 6 April 2013, companies will need to report their PAYE in real
        time. This means that companies must either report online or require

        employees.

        Sign up for employer’s liability insurance

        The Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act of 1969 requires all
        employers in the United Kingdom to maintain employers’ liability
        insurance from an approved insurance company. The minimum legal
        requirement for employers’ liability insurance is a limit of indemnity of
        GBP 5,000,000.

        know how and where to find the certificate and have reasonable access
        to it.

        Hire an Approved Inspector

        BuildCo signs a contract with an Approved Inspector. Approved
        Inspectors (AI) are companies or individuals authorized under the
        Building Act 1984 to carry out building control work in England
        and Wales.

        An Approved Inspector will:
        • Advise BuildCo on how the building regulations apply to its
        work (to a degree)
        • Check plans for compliance with building regulations
        • Issue a planning certificate (if requested)
        • Inspect the work as it progresses
        • Issue a final completion certificate (if requested)

        The building control process was extended under the Building
        Act 1984 to include AIs as well as Local Authorities. Currently,
        there are 91 AIs on CICAIR Limited's register covering England             1 day               GBP 2,964
   1
        and Wales, accounting for about 60% of all building control
        work. AIs are licensed by CICAIR Limited for every 5 years. A list
        of AIs is available from the Construction Industry Council
        website.

        Local Authorities have statutory time limits of 6 to 8 weeks for
        approving plans while AIs do not have any time limits so may
        provide a faster turnaround. By hiring AIs it eliminates need for
        companies to deal with the Building Control Department at the
        Local Authority. However, the Local Authority is still responsible
        for the enforcement of the regulations. AIs usually operate
        nationally and bring consistency of interpretation of the Building
        Regulations.
        While the planning permission (consent) is being obtained from
        Planning Department in Local Authority, the AI sends an Initial
        Notice to the Building Control Departement of Local Authority to
        inform them that it will take responsbilty over the building
        control process. The Local Authority Building Control

                                                                              complete
      Departement has 5 days in which to reject the notice.

      If the Initial Notice is not rejected within 5 days construction
      work may begin. AI, for BuildCo's case, would conduct
      approximately 8-9 inspections at various stages of construction
      on a risk assessment basis.

      AIs are in competition with local authority building control and
      have no restrictions on how much they can charge. AI fees are
      usually lower than local authority building control who are
      covered by the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations
      2010 which requires local authorities to fix their charges by
      means of a scheme, full cost recovery and the fact that the user
      should pay for the actual service they receive. The cost for the
      services of AI is comprised of several elements and is mostly
      charged on a hourly rate. The below estimate is a sample of what
      an average cost breakdown by an AI looks like:

      • Plan checking: (16 hours x GDP 60) = GBP 960.00
      • Inspections: (9 sessions x 2h x GBP 60.00) = GBP 1,080.00
      • Structural checking: (2 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 120.00
      • Consultations: (0.5 hrs x GBP 60) = GBP 30.00
      • Electronic/Internet drawings GBP 75.00
      • Meetings: (3.75 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 225.00
      • Administrative: (0.5 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 30.00
      • Inspections petrol fee: (40 miles x GBP 3.60) = GBP 144.00
      • Contingency: (5 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 300.00

      Total: GBP 2,964

      Agency: Approved Inspector



      Obtain planning permission

      BuildCo must obtain planning permission from the local planning
      authority. In London, the decision-maker is the relevant London
      borough where the site is located. There are 33 boroughs in
      Greater London.

      The planning application must be accompanied by a plan of the
      site, drawings showing the proposed development, and any
      other information the local authority considers necessary. The
      local authority publishes a list with the information it considers
2     necessary on its website, so that applicants know what is               56 days       GBP 6,676
      required of them. The relevant legislative framework is the
      Development Management Procedure Order (2010). If BuildCo is
      submitting a paper application, it must also provide at least 3
      copies of the accompanying documents. Alternatively, BuildCo
      can apply online via the Planning Portal, which accepts electronic
      planning applications on behalf of all London boroughs, using a
      standard application form that was introduced across England in
      2008. If it applies electronically, no further copies are required. A
      fee is charged for the planning application, based on the amount
      of floor space that would be created by the scheme.

      The size of BuildCo's proposed development falls below the
      threshold for a “major application”, which means that the time
      frame for a decision is 8 weeks rather than 13. During this period,
      the local planning authority will publicize the application in the
      surrounding area and consult a number of statutory consultees -
      - bodies with a specialist responsibility such as nature
      conservation, heritage protection, highways -- who may wish to
      comment on the acceptability of the proposal from their
      perspective. The local authority accepts these comments and the
      comments of any local people who wish to comment on the
      application. They will be taken into account in the decision to
      grant or refuse permission. If no decision is made within 8 weeks,
      or if the authority decides to refuse permission, the applicant is
      entitled to appeal to the Secretary of State.

      Additionally, in April 2010, the Government introduced new
      'permitted development' rights for businesses who seek to
      extend their existing premises. This means that minor extensions,
      which would previously have required planning permission, may
      proceed without it, thereby saving time for the business owners
      and enabling the local planning authority staff to concentrate on
      larger and more important projects. In May 2013, the
      Government further extended these rights to allow for larger
      extensions of pre-existing agricultural buildings and warehouses.

      Approved Inspector files the initial notice to the Local
      Authority

      Once the contract is signed and the terms of reference are
      outlined, the builder and the AI jointly notify the local authority
      of their intention to build -- also called an initial notice. This
      initial notice will inform the Local Council that the AI has been
      retained. Once this notice has been accepted by the local
      authority, the responsibility for plan checking and site inspection
      will be formally placed on the AI.

3     The local council has 5 days to accept or reject the initial notice     5 days       no charge
      in writing (via email, fax or post). Acceptance is given by default
      if the local authority does not respond within the 5-day period.
      During that period of time, no work can be done.

      Once construction work commences, the AI would conduct at
      least 8 -- 9 inspections at various stages of construction and risk-
      based factors (for BuildCo’s case).

                                                                              complete
      Safety Office to ensure that the building is compliant with the
      latest fire safety legislation and that the appropriate fire and life
      safety systems are in place. By law, the Fire Safety Office must
      respond within 15 business days (21 calendar days) and send its
      comments and approval. This is done as part of plan approval
      process and is recorded as an independent procedure since AI
      interacts with a Fire Officer.

      Upon the completion of the building, BuildCo used to obtain a
      Fire Certificate from Fire Safety Office. However, the Fire
      Certificate is no longer required following the reforms in the
      Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO 2005) which
      came into effect in October 2006, and replaced over 70 pieces of
      fire safety laws.

      The FSO applies to all non-domestic premises in England and
      Wales, including the common parts of blocks of flats and houses
      in multiple occupations (HMOs). The FSO 2005 is a tool for self-
      regulation of businesses for the fire risk of the premises.

      Under the FSO, the responsible person must carry out a fire
      safety risk assessment and implement and maintain a fire
      management plan. The companies have to carry out a risk
      assessment by completing a 5-step fire risk assessment survey
      online:
      (http://www.fire.gov.uk/Workplace+safety/WhatTheLawRequires/
      )

      According to this survey -- FSO 2005 the warehouse of BuildCo
      would be classified as medium risk object. Since there will be
      more than 5 people occupying/working in the building, BuildCo
      would need to file the copy of completed FSO 2005 to the local
      Fire Safety Office. BuildCo does not need to wait for the approval
      or any other consent before using the premises. This risk is with
      the building operators, as they are deemed liable for any
      problems.

      The Fire Safety Office may conduct an inspection under a risk-
      based scheme: whether there was a similar track record of
      companies with fire, or neighbors complain, etc. Small scale and
      standard objects would be seldom inspected. Also, given that
      this would be a new building it would be assumed by the Fire
      Safety Office that the latest techniques of fire safety prevention
      would have been considered during the planning process.

      Upon approval the engineer instructs Thames Water’s contractor
      to assess the physical work involved to make the connection.
      This includes a site survey, size of site gang/workforce,
      equipment and materials needed, plus any involvement with the
      local highway department as to whether there is any significant
      impact on the public road network. This element takes
      approximately 2-3 weeks.

      The contractor will then send their report to the engineer with
      the scope of work, survey and technical proposal. The engineer
      will prepare and authorize the quote and send it out to BuildCo
      within 5 days of receipt of the contractor’s report.

      * Request and receive energy performance certificate from
      Accredited Energy Assessor

      Following the nationwide implementation of the "Energy
      Performance of Buildings Directive" adopted, on December 16,
      2002, as of October 1, 2008 all commercial buildings whenever
      built, rented or sold require an Energy Performance Certificate.
      The certificate records how energy effcient a property is as a
      building and provides A+ to G ratings. It is the responsibilty of
      the builder/constructor to give the Energy Performance
      Certificate to the Purchaser on physical completion of the
      building and notify the local authority Building Control officers
      or approved inspectors, who will not issue a Certificate of
      Completion until the issue of an EPC has occurred.

      They are produced using standard methods and assumptions
      about energy usage so that the energy effciency of one building
      can easily be compared with another building of the same type.
      This allows prospective buyers, tenants, owners, occupiers and
      purchases to see information on the energy effciency and carbon
      emissions from their building so they can consider energy
      effciency and fuel costs as part of their investment.

      An EPC always includes a recommendation report that lists cost
      effective and other measures (such as low and zero carbon
      generating systems) to improve the energy rating. A rating is
      also given showing what could be achieved if all the
      recommendations were implemented.

      The fee for producing an EPC is determined by the market and

        Once the building is completed, BuildCo would notify AI about
        the completion. AI completes the final inspection within 24 hours
        and prepares the final certificate of completion. AI will send a
        copy of the final completion certificate to the Building Control

        The application can be submitted online, in person or by mail. The
        connection requestor has to attach with the application: completed
        application form and site drawings.

        At this stage the applicant can choose either UK Power Networks or an
        Independent Connection Provider to design the network extension while
        only UK Power Networks can design the point of connection and any
        upstream reinforcement works.

        The connection may also be provided by an Independent Distribution
        Network Operator (IDNO). With this option the IDNO would continue to
        own and operate the distribution system assets installed. The majority of
        the clients customers choose UK Power Networks to complete all parts
        of the connection for this type of project.

        Since September 2008 UK Power Networks has not required assessment
        and design charges to be paid in advance of quotation and these costs
        are now included in the quotation such that the customer will pay only if
        the quotation is accepted. This follows a consultation by the GB energy
        regulator.

      Some of the external connection works which are contestable (not all
      works are contestable) can be performed by an approved contractor or
      by UK Power Networks. In the majority of cases for this type of
      connection customers choose UK Power Networks to carry out all the
      external connection works. Given the case assumptions the most
      common arrangement would be the installation of a 200 amp TP & N

      accepted by the customer (normally within 1 calendar day). UK Power
      Networks will issue a MPAN to the customer before the connection

      energized date. The supplier will need to receive an estimate, or could
      work with the applicant to develop a load profile to be able to provide a
      supply contract.

        UK Power Networks is required to install the connection in the time scale
        it has agreed with the customer (mandatory requirement: the Electricity
        (Connection Standards of Performance) Regulations 2010). This means
        that the customer may arrange with the supplier for the meter to be
        installed and supply to commence immediately following the installation
        of the connection.

        * Receive meter installation and internal wiring inspection by meter

        The metering industry in the UK is an open competitive market, and the
        applicant can choose their own Meter Operator or can choose to use the
        Meter Operator services provided by the electricity supplier. The
        electricity supplier normally appoints the meter operator. Requirements
        regarding the conclusion of the meter operation contract vary. The
        applicant can sign a separate contract with the chosen meter operator or
        cost can be passed on through the supply contract .
        The internal wiring must be completed by the electrician to BS7671
        standards. The electrician must carry out a full inspection and testing of
        the internal wiring and then provide a BS7671 certificate to both the
        meter operator and to the electricity distributor before the connection    14 calendar days        GBP 0

        can be energized. The inspection of the internal wiring is done when a
        meter is installed. Inspection of internal wiring is done through a visual
        inspection by a meter operator. It is a good practice that somebody is
        present during the installation of the meter/internal wiring inspection.

        The metering must be installed before a supply of electricity can be
        provided. The electricity can start flowing on the same day the external
        connection works are finished providing the supplier and the metering
        operator have sufficient notice.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       Commercial Property Standard Enquiries (CPSE) are used by solicitors to
       find out details that cannot be inferred from the searches, eg. who is in

       use. Most solicitors use the commercial property standard enquiries
       prepared by members of the London Property Support Lawyers Group
       and endorsed by the British Property Federation. Depending on the               1-4 weeks

       would be completed in around 1 week after the results of all the

       Land Registry and know what interests affect this land and if there are
       any limitations. If the land is unregistered, the solicitor would have to
       look at the deeds and correspondence between the persons that appear

      on those deeds. This will be decreasingly the case as registration is now
      compulsory.
      2. Conveyancing searches, which would include:
      • Local Authority Search
      • Planning history (eg. permissions)
      • Desktop environmental search (to determine any environmental issues,
      such as flooding or contamination)
      • Public highway search
      • Chancel repair liability search (in this case the solicitor does not search
      the property itself, but the area in which the property is. If the area turns
      out to be affected by the liability to contribute to chancel repairs, then
      the property has to be insured against any future chancel repair claims.
      The amount of the insurance depends on the value of the property)
      • Other searches depending on the area, eg. coal mine shaft search or
      underground search (these issues affect the value of the property)
      3. Seller company search: to see the articles of association and what
      powers the representatives have

      For a property in London, solicitors usually request most of these
      searches through a search portal. These search portals are the one stop
      shop for most searches, and solicitors need a user name to access them.
      The search portals will pass on to the solicitor the information that they
      acquire from the relevant authorities.

      In total, these searches are usually 300 to 1000 pounds, depending on
      the number of searches requested, the amount that each local authority
      charges, and whether the solicitor requests the standard searches or is
      adding additional questions, which increase the cost. The results of the
      searches take from one day to 2/3 weeks to come back, depending on
      the search. The local authority search is the lengthiest one.

      Once satisfied with the results of the searches, the information provided
      in the standard enquiries and the title pack, the buyer's solicitor will
      prepare a report for the buyer on the title and other matters affecting
      the property.

      transactions are usually conducted by solicitors. The seller's solicitor will       1 day
      prepare a draft of the contract and submit it to the purchaser's solicitor                          included in

      draft and suggest any suitable amendments. Once the two parties
      agree on the contract, contracts are exchanged. The solicitors acting for
      the buyer and seller can meet to exchange contracts, but that is rare. The
      exchange is usually done over the telephone in accordance with a
      specific formula for exchanging contracts over the phone. The most

      by his client. The solicitors agree over the phone specific terms of the
      contract (e.g., the amount of the deposit, completion date, etc.) and
      record the time of exchange and other details. Each solicitor sends their
      client's part contract to the other solicitor in the post that day. The
      buyer's solicitor will also send a check for the deposit (usually 10% of the
      purchase price). It is usual for there to be a gap in time between
      exchange of contracts and completion of the transfer of the property.

      Complete and lodge a Land Transaction Return and pay the Stamp
      Duty Land Tax (SDLT) (available on-line)

      The buyer's solicitor would usually prepare the Land Transaction Return
      for the approval of the buyer (as SDLT is a self-assessment tax) prior to
      completion. For every land transaction the purchaser must complete,
      sign and send the land transaction return to be received by HM Revenue
      & Customs before the end of 30 days following the effective date of the
      transaction. The return includes a self-assessment of the stamp duty land
      tax chargeable on the transaction returned. The completed Land
      Transaction Return must be sent by post to the Revenue's Rapid Data
      Capture center in Netherton (near Liverpool) or submitted electronically
      (functionality available since 2006). When the Return is submitted, the
      correct amount of SDLT must also be paid either by cheque, through the Less than a day
5     CHAPS automated payment system or via direct bank transfer. Once the            (online  GBP 13 + 4% SDLT
      Return has been processed by the Revenue the Revenue will issue a Land        procedure)
      Transaction Return Certificate. If the Return has been submitted
      electronically, the Certificate is typically received within two hours (since
      2009). If the Return has been submitted in the post, the Certificate is
      typically received within one month. The issue of a Land Transaction
      Return Certificate merely evidences that a Return has been filed at the
      Revenue; issuance of a Certificate does not necessarily mean that the
      information contained within the Return and/or amount of SDLT paid is
      correct. The Certificate must be sent to the Land Registry when an
      application for registration of the transfer is made. If the buyer acquires
      the property with financing, any legal charge created by it (if it is a
      company) must be registered at Companies House within 21 days of its
      creation, failing which the charge is void against a liquidator or another
      creditor of the company.

        The transfer and any legal charges are registered at the Land
        Registry

        The buyer's solicitor drafts a Transfer Deed and sends it to the seller's
        solicitor for approval. Once approved, it is signed by the parties. The
        Transfer deed makes the transfer of the property to the buyer effective
        on completion.

        Parties register the transfer deed (and any legal charges) at the Land
        Registry by submitting the appropriate documents and paying the Land
        Registry's fees. A cheque made payable to "Land Registry" must
        accompany the application for registration to the correct office of the
        Land Registry (unless there was a prior authorized agreement with the
        Registry to pay by direct debit)
        On completion of the registration the Land Registry will send to the
        buyer's solicitor a title information document.

        The documentation shall include:
        - Completed Land Registry form AP1
        - Original and certified copy of transfer deed                                  Less than a day

        - Original and certified copy mortgage if the buyer acquires the property        (paper-based)
        with financing

        The law requires conveyancers, from 10 November 2008, when they
        submit an application to register the interest of their client in a property,
        to provide details of the conveyancers who acted for all other parties
        involved in the transaction. If any involved person (including a company)
        is not represented by a conveyancer, the person lodging the application
        must either confirm that they are satisfied that sufficient steps have been
        taken to verify the identity of the unrepresented person or otherwise
        lodge evidence of the unrepresented person's identity. If confirmation
        of identity is required for an application, but is not provided, the Land
        Registry will reject the application. Identification requirements extend to
        buyers, sellers, landlords, tenants, borrowers and lenders.

Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes

consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                            BizBank will most likely apply for the administration procedure. The directors
                               could file for administration or else BizBank could put the company into
                           administration since it appears to have a floating charge over substantially the
                             whole of the company's property. Administration would be the most likely
                           procedure to be chosen since it is a rescue procedure, designed to save all or
                           part of the business. It would be more likely to preserve value for the creditors

g
                          property. An administrator's first objective is to rescue the company as a going
                            concern, if possible. If this is not possible, his objective is to achieve a better
                         result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company
                         were wound up, or failing that he must realize property to make a distribution to
                                                    secured or preferential creditors.

                               The administrator will be focused on achieving the best outcome for the
                            creditors as a whole and in this case, this would be achieved by the sale of the
                          business as a going concern. The administration moratorium provides protection
                            for the company from various creditor enforcement actions: - enforcement of
                                security- repossession of hire-purchase goods- forfeiture by landlords-
                             commencement of legal proceedings against the company. This moratorium
                             gives the company a breathing space in which to implement a solution to its
Outcome     going concern     financial difficulties. The administrator takes over from the directors in the
                           management of the company and has broad powers to carry on the business of
                          the company so that it can continue to operate as a going concern. He can enter
                              into new contracts on behalf of the company and pay the expenses of the
                           administration in priority to all other creditors (apart from fixed charge holders)
                            so that the business can continue to operate. The hotel is likely to be sold as a
                              going concern. The administrator may continue to trade the business from
                                                 administration while seeking a purchaser.

                               The administration procedure will take approximately one year. BizBank, the
                            company's directors (probably with BizBank's approval), or (less likely in practice)
                             the company acting on a majority resolution of its shareholders could apply for
                            the company's administration. If BizBank puts the company into administration, it
                               would give notice of intention to appoint administrators to any prior ranking

                             BizBank is silent and takes no action, the directors/company would file a notice

                               The administrator would take control of the management of the company and
                                     continue to run the hotel whilst seeking a buyer for the business. The
                              administrator's duty on any sale is to achieve fair market value at the time of the
                                sale, although he is not obliged to wait to sell in case more favorable market
                                conditions materialize. The administrator is not obliged to seek the creditors'
                               consent before concluding a sale but he would likely discuss any potential sale
                              with BizBank as the secured creditor who stands to recover its loan from the sale
                               proceeds. Within the first 8 weeks, the administrator must send a statement of
                               his proposals to all creditors and shareholders detailing, amongst other things,
                               (a) how he envisages the purpose of administration will/has been achieved (in
                              this case, sale of the business) and how the administration will be brought to an
                               end; (b) a statement of the company's affairs; and (c) the basis upon which his
                                remuneration will be fixed. The administrator must hold a creditors' meeting
                              within the first 10 weeks to approve his proposals. This creditors' meeting is not
                                  required if the company has insufficient property to make a distribution to
                                 unsecured creditors (which may be the case here), although in this situation
                                 creditors with at least 10% of the total debts can order the administrator to
                                    summon a creditors' meeting if they wish. The administrator would also
                                 investigate the affairs of the company, in particular (a) directors' conduct to
                               establish whether there are any grounds for a potential disqualification action;
                                and (b) recent transactions to determine whether he should apply to court to
                                 challenge any as transactions at an undervalue, preferences or transactions
                               defrauding creditors. The administrator would pay out BizBank after receiving
                                     the sale proceeds and deducting the expenses of the administration.


                                   Major expenses include remuneration of the administrator (up to 4%),

greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
