Introduction
This document provides detailed instruction on how to complete the country assessment and
application and infrastructure assessment.


Scope
The purpose of the assessments is to help countries determine how ready they are to move to a
cloud platform, both at a country level and at an application level. By completing the
Government Cloud Readiness Toolkit, government agencies will gain an understanding of their
current information technology (IT) landscape and the feasibility to migrate to a cloud platform.
This toolkit is meant to be a conversation starter and provide a country a high level overview of
where they are and some recommendations around migrating to a cloud platform.

The assessments are designed to assist countries by:
   - Identifying policy and regulatory gaps
   -   Providing recommendations around next steps to take towards implementation of a
       cloud computing system that meets a country’s specific needs
   -   Recommending a deployment model (private, hybrid, public, or local public)
   -   Providing recommendations around applications that might be good candidates for
       migrating to the cloud
These assessments are not designed to:
   - Replace an in depth assessment or business case
   -   Provide steps for building a private data center or selecting a public cloud provider
   -   Provide estimates for migrating to the cloud
   -   Provide guidance on budgeting for migrating to the cloud
   -   Recommend a specific cloud provider
   -   Recommend a service model
Both the country assessment and the application and infrastructure assessment provide
recommendations on multiple factors. The country assessments evaluates the following:
   - Overall readiness

                                                                                                     Page 4 of 23

   -   Private cloud readiness
   -   Hybrid cloud readiness
   -   Public cloud readiness
   -   Local public cloud readiness
The application and infrastructure assessment evaluates the following:
   - Cloud fitness
   -   Migration effort
   -   Recommended platform


Assessment Scoring
The scoring approach across both assessments is very similar. Each question has the following
attributes:
    - A weight
   -   A category
   -   Possible responses

Weight
Each question has a maximum possible score. It is always possible to get the maximum score
for a question. Each question has a drop down containing the possible responses. Each
response has a value for each attribute being evaluated. For example, a response to a question
in the country assessment has a score for overall readiness, a separate score for private cloud
readiness, etc. These scores have been assigned based on market and industry research and
standard practices and have been extensively reviewed by both the World Bank and global
companies with extensive experience providing cloud services. The score for an individual
question cannot be updated.

For many questions, an answer of unknown is an option. However, this option should be
selected as infrequently as possible. Unknowns typically result in an average score. Having a
large number of unknowns might lead to a score that is higher than it should be, thus hiding a
lack of readiness or other areas of weakness. Such a score would thus decrease the overall
value of the resulting recommendations. The more complete the questionnaire, the more
accurate the recommendations and the final score.

There are some responses that make a particular approach impossible. In these situations the
readiness score on the assessment tab is highlighted in red to emphasize that the approach is
not feasible. The question is also identified on the recommendations tab in case the answer
should be re-evaluated.

Category
Questions have been grouped into categories. The country assessment has seven categories:
   - General

       Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

   -   Resources
   -   Security
   -   Regulations
   -   Governance of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Systems
   -   Data
   -   Infrastructure

The application and infrastructure assessment has four categories:
   - Architecture
   -   General
   -   Operation Optimization
   -   Security
The sum of the scores for all questions within a category adds up to 100%.

Customization
The categories have a default weight, but can be customized based on the needs of the
country. In both assessments, the total weight across all categories must equal 100%. The
weight takes into account a country’s priorities and focus for migrating to a cloud environment.
While it is recommended to keep the defaults, the weight can be customized and curtailed to
the individual government in country assessment. Please keep in mind that any adjustment to
the weight of the categories will alter the results and recommendation of the assessment to
varying degrees.

Country Assessment
Weights can be changed on the ‘assessment’ tab. The weights that are highlighted in gray are
the only values that can be adjusted to fit the country’s priorities.

Application and Infrastructure Assessment
Driver
The primary reason for moving to the cloud is very important information when making
decisions regarding which applications to move to the cloud. In this toolkit, this reason to
consider the cloud is referred to as the “driver”. The driver is used to weight the application
and infrastructure assessment categories.

Drivers Defined
Faster Development of Applications
Cloud computing allows applications to be created and implemented faster. For many
governments and organizations it can take weeks, if not longer, to order new servers, set them
up, and then build a new application. A cloud system would enable resources to be available
within hours instead of weeks.

Cost Saving
Infrastructure is expensive to purchase, to operate and to maintain. Cloud services are typically
pay as you go, or “on-demand”, which allows end-users to utilize IT resources as needed. It
maximizes the utilization of resources and reduces the operation and maintenance costs
especially during non-peak times. Cost savings are impacted by current IT expenditure and
which deployment model is chosen.

Improve Operations (Agility and Scalability)
Limited computing resources can prevent applications from running as quickly as they could or
from running at all if the resources are needed for other applications. For example, say that a
government has a processor intensive census program that runs once every ten years and runs
on the same server as an application that shows who is eligible to vote. It may not be possible

       This paper, created by The World Bank in collaboration with Accenture, is available under the Creative
       Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.
                                                                                                     Page 7 of 23
Cloud Readiness Toolkit Assessment Instruction Guide


to generate a list of voters and process the census results at the same time. The cloud can help
with that by automatically supplying additional resources during heavy system use.

Growth can also exceed a system’s capabilities. Perhaps in the past most citizens went to their
local government office to apply for benefits or get a driver’s license, but with the growth of
mobile phones, they can now reach these applications online. This sudden spike of usage may
require more processing power than was originally planned for or purchased. Without the
cloud, such a spike of usage might cause the system to crash or become inaccessible. With the
cloud, additional resources are added as needed and removed when no longer required.

Disaster Recovery and High Availability
Many public cloud service providers have data centers located in multiple locations. This
provides a failover location in the event that the primary location becomes unavailable due to a
security event, natural disaster, or human error. This capability keeps the government
operating seamlessly.

Modernization
Many governments have servers with a variety of software components on them. There may
be multiple versions of Linux or Windows operating systems, the same for different versions of
databases, or even programming languages. Moving to the cloud typically gives governments
the opportunity to standardize their technology architecture across the government or across
department. This increases the ease of maintenance and the ability to add additional features
and functionality to applications going forward.

Technological Advantage or Competition
Governments have a mandate to provide services to their citizens. As part of pursuing this
mandate, government may consider implementing a cloud strategy. Alternatively, a
government may consider implementing a cloud strategy in order to gain or maintain a
perceived technical advantage. This advantage could be in either the public or private sector.
A government may work to build demand or skills in the area of cloud computing in order to
encourage the development of certain skills or products in the private sector.

Security
Major public cloud service providers have their own security protections against internal and
external threats. They also support top-line security protocols commonly used. While anything
you put on a public server is at higher risk than a computer not connected to an external
network, public cloud service providers have security expertise, operation expertise, and are
typically up to date on the latest security technologies.

Private clouds have a certain level of security, especially if they are directly connected to the
users they serve rather than accessed via the Internet. However, organizations using private
clouds generally have a smaller skilled security team than a public cloud provider would.

Changing the Weight
The driver is first identified in the country assessment (question 12). Once this has been
answered, the identified driver will be used as part of the application and infrastructure
assessment. The driver can be changed within the application and infrastructure assessment by
going to the ‘assessment’ tab. Once a new driver is selected, the weights in the red highlighted
column will change and the assessment’s results and recommendations will be adjusted
accordingly.




These values can also be customized, but must add up to 100%.


Tips
General
   1. When considering who should complete the questionnaire, keep in mind that it is
      important to make sure responders understand the importance of completing the
      questionnaires as accurately and completely as possible. Responders should make sure
      there is plenty of uninterrupted time available to complete the survey.
           a. The critical resources for getting the best results from the assessment are likely
              to be:
                     i. IT Director (or equivalent)
                    ii. Application owners
                   iii. Infrastructure leads
           b. Incomplete or inaccurate responses will skew the results. As a result, the
              roadmap and recommendations provided by the toolkit may not be applicable.
   2. There are two possible approaches to completing the questionnaire. Which approaches
      works best will vary by country.
           a. Mass Distribution:
               [RECOMMENDED] Each responder gets a blank assessment. The responder than
               completes their section and returns the assessment. This approach requires the
               identification of a key individual to facilitate the distribution, completion, and
               consolidation of the multiple assessment documents.
           b. Round Robin:
               Once a responder completes their section they pass the partially completed
               assessment on to the key contact who will pass the assessment on to the next

                                                                                                     Page 9 of 23

               responder. Alternatively, the partially completed assessment could be directly
               passed to the next responder as long as the key contact is informed.

Scoring
   1. ‘N/A’ and ‘Unknown’ have different impacts on the final recommendations. “Unknown”
      should only be chosen if the responder is unsure of the answer and cannot find out the
      answer. If the question is not applicable or not relevant to the current government
      situation, then ‘N/A’ or ‘not applicable’ should be chosen.
           a. For example, in the case of the question ‘For a packaged solution, do you have
              customization that must be maintained?’, choose ‘N/A’ if the application is
              custom and choose ‘unknown’ if you don’t know if the packaged application was
              customized.
           b. Both the country assessment and application and infrastructure assessment can
              be reviewed for completeness by looking at the ‘assessment’ tab.

Completing the Assessment
   1. In the application and infrastructure assessment, an application must have an
      application name and an application ID. An application ID is a unique number tied to
      the application used for tracking and reporting purposes. If application IDs are not used
      by the government, for the purpose of this toolkit, please create a unique ID for each
      application. For example, the first application listed would be application ID 1001 and
      each subsequent application be assigned the next value (1002, 1003, etc.).
               a. For the application and infrastructure assessment, make sure you’re mapping
                  the ‘application ID’ correctly between the applications and servers
   2. To respond to a question, use the drop down feature within Excel. This enforces data
      validation and allow the assessment to be scored.




   3. If there are not enough columns for applications or servers, right click on column G and
      select ‘insert’.

Enabling the Macro
There is a macro in the country assessment which generates the Recommendation tab. This
macro is compatible with Microsoft Office 2010 and later. To enable the macro, go to File ->
Options -> Trust Center and click Trust Center Settings.

Mass Distribution Approach
Overview
This section outlines the high level process for completing the assessments using the mass
distribution approach. More detailed instructions can be found for each assessment in the
subsequent sections.
    1. Identify a key individual to facilitate the distribution, completion and consolidation of
        the multiple assessment documents.
   2. Identify the assessment responders
   3. Provide each responder with a blank copy of the assessment(s).
   4. Responders will complete the relevant sections.
   5. Responders will return their questionnaire to the key contact with their section
      completed.
   6. The key contact will copy and paste (as values) the answers into a master copy of the
      assessments.

Country Assessment
The purpose of the country assessment is to identify gaps in a country’s policies, regulations, or
current IT infrastructure that would impact a migration to the cloud or prevent a country from
fully realizing the benefits of such a migration. This section explains how to complete the
assessment.

The percent of the questionnaire completed can be seen at the top right of the ‘questionnaire’
tab.

Instructions
    1. Identify a key contact, to track completion of the entire assessment.
           a. This individual can be the same as the key contact for the application and
              infrastructure assessment or can be a different individual
   1. Identify all the appropriate individuals who should complete each section in the country
      assessment. The recommendation is:
                            Section                        Best Person to Complete
                General                            IT Director or Equivalent
                Resources                          IT Director or Equivalent
                Security                           IT Director or Equivalent
                Regulations                        Legal
                Governance of ICT Systems          IT Director or Equivalent
                Data                               IT Director or Equivalent
                Infrastructure                     Ministry or Department of
                                                   Telecommunications
   2. Distribute the questionnaire to all identified responders. Provide the responders with
      the below instructions:
           a. Go to the ‘questionnaire’ tab and fill in the questions as accurately as possible. If
              you cannot find the exact answer in the list then select the closest answer. If the
              answer is not known, please attempt to identify an individual who might know
              the answer.
           b. Some questions have multiple parts. For those questions, the answer to the
              initial question determines whether additional questions need to be answered.
              All of the additional questions must be answered for the entire question to be
              counted as complete.
                       If the additional questions do NOT need to be answered, they will change
                        color to black and there is no need to answer the question.
                       If additional questions need to be answered, the questions will change
                        color to yellow.
           c. Once completed, return the assessment to the [INSERT KEY CONTACT NAME],
              [INSERT KEY CONTACT EMAIL].

   3. The key contact will track the responses received and facilitate the identification of
      additional responders as needed.
   4. The key contact will copy and paste the answers into a master copy of the assessment.
   5. When all answers have been entered, click on the recommendation tab to run the
      macro and generate the recommendations.

Application and Infrastructure Assessment
The application and infrastructure assessment is a questionnaire used to assess the
government’s overall application landscape. The assessment helps determine the feasibility,
effort and recommended deployment type for each application by incorporating both server
and application level information.

The questions in the assessment cover both functional, application level questions, as well as in
depth infrastructure, server level questions. It is important to have individuals who can
understand and fully answer the questions complete the questionnaire. If individuals only
moderately familiar with the applications completes the questionnaire, the results and the final
roadmap will be of limited value.

The key contact can validate completeness using the “assessment” tab.

Round Robin
Overview
This section outlines the high level process for completing the assessments using the round
robin approach. More detailed instructions can be found for each assessment in the
subsequent sections.
    1. Identify a key individual to facilitate the distribution and completion of the assessment
        documents. There are two options:
           a. The key contact will pass the assessment onto the next responder.
           b. The key contact will facilitate the distribution of the assessment by indicating
              who each responder should send the assessment to next.
   2. One version (master copy) of the assessments.
   3. The master copy will be sent to a responder who will complete the relevant section(s).
   4. Based on the decision in step 1:
           a. The responder will send the assessment to the key contact who will then send
              the partially completed assessment on to the next responder.
           b. The responder will send the partially completed assessment to the next
              identified responder and notify the key contact.

   5. The key contact will review the finished assessment to confirm the assessments’
      completeness.

Country Assessment
Once a responder completes their section they pass the partially completed assessment on to
the key contact who will pass the assessment on to the next responder. Alternatively, the
partially completed assessment could be directly passed to the next responder as long as the
key contact is informed.
Instructions
    1. Identify a key contact, to track completion of the entire assessment.
           a. This individual can be the same as the key contact for the application and
              infrastructure assessment or can be a different individual

Application and Infrastructure Assessment
The application and infrastructure assessment is a questionnaire used to assess the
government’s overall application landscape. The assessment helps determine the feasibility,
effort and recommended deployment type for each application by incorporating both server
and application level information.

The questions in the assessment cover both functional, application level questions, as well as in
depth infrastructure, server level questions. It is important to have individuals who can
understand and fully answer the questions complete the questionnaire. If individuals only
moderately familiar with the applications completes the questionnaire, the results and the final
roadmap will be of limited value.

The key contact can validate completeness using the “assessment” tab.
