The Gender Gap in the Use of Financial Services in Turkey


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. The reach of the financial sector in Turkey is wide—as measured by account penetration,
use of electronic payments, and credit card ownership —relative to both developing and
high-income countries. For instance, according the Global Financial Inclusion (Findex)
database, 58 percent of adults report having a formal account and 45 percent of adults
report having a credit card (in comparison, 43 percent of adults in middle-income countries,
on average, report having an account and 7 percent having a credit card). However, a closer
look at disaggregated data reveals that while there is very high account ownership among
men, the rate is comparatively low for women. The gender gap in Turkey for account
ownership is 49 percentage points, the highest rate among all middle-income countries.
Multivariate regressions estimate that women in Turkey are 38 percentage points less likely
than men to have an account, after controlling for other individual characteristics, such as
income, employment, education, and age.


2. Savings, both formal and informal, and among both men and women, is very low in
Turkey—only 10 percent of adults report saving in the past year —consistent with low
national savings rates. Even among adults that report having an account, only eight percent
of banked adults report saving in a formal financial institution and anther six percent of
banked adults report saving using other modes of. Access to formal credit from banks is low
(5 percent), especially among women (2 percent). However, there is a very high reported
use of store credit, which is likely debt incurred on store-issued credit cards (as collaborated
by data collected on credit card ownership). 81 percent of men and 55 percent of women in
Turkey report using bank or store credit or having a credit card, which is double the reported
use of credit in comparable ECA and middle-income countries.

3. We explore reasons for the large gender gap in financial inclusion in Turkey and find that female
workplace participation is an important factor in explaining financial inclusion among women.
Men are more than three times as likely as women to report using an account to receive money
from work and/or the government. Although only 16% of women report being in the workforce,
97 percent of wage- and self-employed women in Turkey are banked, as compared to 23 percent
of women who report being out of the workforce. In comparison, 70 percent of Turkish men that
report being out of the workforce have an account

The Gender Gap in the Use of Financial Services in Turkey


1. INTRODUCTION

4. At the 2014 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings, World Bank President Kim spoke of the 2.5
billion adults worldwide excluded from the formal financial system. He used the statistic to
illustrate the Bank’s commitment to expanding financial inclusion among the poor and to launch
a new initiative to provide universal financial access to all working-age adults by 2020. A key
component of the World Bank pledge is towards inclusive financial growth, including greater
access to financial services by women, youth, and the rural poor.

5. Financial inclusion, defined broadly as a measure of access to and the use of financial services
by individuals and firms, is a topic closely tied to overarching goals of economic development and
inclusive growth. Research on the subject has been advanced by the recent availability of detailed
micro data for individual and firms to complement earlier country level financial infrastructure
and service statistics. In large part due to cross-country individual level data from the Global
Financial Inclusion Database (Findex), the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, and other country-led
data collection efforts, a gender gap in financial inclusion has been identified and studied. For
instance, the Findex data has been used to show a persistent gender gap in developing countries,
after controlling for other individual characteristics, such as employment and income (Demirguc-
Kunt and Klapper, 2013).

6. Turkey, an upper-middle income country, is one of the founding member of OECD and a
member of the Group of Twenty (G-20) major countries. At first glance, Turkey, where 58 percent
of individuals use a formal financial account, ranks favorably in comparison to its regional and
economic comparison groups. A more nuanced examination of the data, however, reveals a large
gender gap— 82 percent of men own an account, as compared to only 33 percent of women.
This gender gap compares poorly to other countries in the ECA region, the emerging BRIC
countries, and among the larger sample of all middle-income countries. In addition, the data
show that savings rates, both formal and informal, among both men and women are
comparatively low, though this is consistent with national data. The use of credit card debt
(reported as store credit) is much higher than its use in other middle-income countries, though a
significant gender gap exists.

7. Globally, around 50 percent of adults have a bank account (Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper, 2013).
It is important to note that using an account does not necessarily mean a lack of “access” to
financial services, i.e. some people might have affordable access, but have no need for financial
services and choose not to use them. However, many of the estimated 2.5 billion adults without
a formal account lack access in the sense that costs are prohibitively high or banks and other
financial institutions are located too far away, or financial services are not available because of
legal barriers, regulatory constraints, information impediments or cultural deterrents. The poor,
women, youth, and rural residents are more likely to report greater barriers to access to financial
services (Allen, et al., 2013). In particular, women are more likely to report not having an account
because they use someone else’s in the family.

8. However, the evidence found in previous literature points to many benefits of personal
account ownership and the use of accounts to make formal payments and save, particularly for
women and the poor. For instance, having a bank account increases savings (Aportela, 1999),
female empowerment (Ashraf et al., 2010), and consumption and productive investment of
entrepreneurs (Dupas and Robinson, 2009). Furthermore, remaining unbanked can result in
higher costs associated with money order or check-cashing services (Lusardi, 2010), increase the
risk of stolen assets (Gross, Hogarth and Schmeiser, 2012), and decrease financial security after
retirement (Rhine, et al., 2006).

9. More generally, a wide range of studies find that expanding access to financial services can
help reduce poverty and increase economic development (see Rodrik and Rosenzweig, 2009).
Earlier theoretical models suggest that financial market frictions can lead to ‘poverty traps’ by
restricting investment in education or occupational choices (for example, Aghion and Bolton,
1997; Galor and Zeira, 1993; and Banerjee and Newman, 1993). For instance, greater
occupational choices may in turn affect saving and borrowing behavior, and thus lead to greater
income mobility.

10. Empirical studies support these models, for instance, Aportela (1999) and Prina (2012) find
that the exogenous provision of accounts to poor households in Mexico and Nepal, respectively,
led to a significant increase in household savings. Burgess and Pande (2005), and Bruhn and Love
(2009) find significant increases in income, output and employment as a consequence of bank
branch expansion in India and Mexico, respectively.

11. Furthermore, the inability to smooth consumption during shocks also causes poor households
in financially underdeveloped countries to make suboptimal choices. Jacoby and Skoufias (1992),
Funkhouser (1999) and Jensen (2000) provide evidence from India, Costa Rica and Côte d’Ivoire
respectively, showing that kids drop out of school in the face of adverse income shocks. Mudroch
(1995) makes an extremely important observation that households and enterprises might be
making inefficient employment and production choices ex ante, simply because they entail a
smaller risk (income smoothing, as against the more commonly reported consumption
smoothing).

12. Demirguc-Kunt, Klapper and Singer (2012) use the Findex database to document and analyze
gender differences in the use of financial services. Even after controlling for a host of individual
characteristics including income, education, employment status, rural residency and age, gender
remains significantly related to usage of financial services. This study also finds that legal
discrimination against women and gender norms may explain some of the cross-country variation
in access to finance for women. For instance, in countries where women face legal restrictions in
their ability to work, head a household, choose where to live, and receive inheritance, women
are less likely to own an account, relative to men, as well as to save and borrow. The results also
confirm that manifestations of gender norms, such as the level of violence against women and
the incidence of early marriage for women, contribute to explaining the variation in the use of
financial services between men and women, after controlling for other individual and country
characteristics.

The Gender Gap in the Use of Financial Services in Turkey


13. In this paper we discuss environmental factors that might help explain the significantly low
use of financial services by women in Turkey. For instance, The Gender Gap Report (2013)
provides a cross-country rank and score across several socio-economic dimensions. Turkey ranks
poorly - 120 out of 136 countries overall. In addition, associated employment data from the
Gallup World Poll Survey shows a large gender gap in workforce participation in Turkey and
suggests important implications for female workplace participation—98 percent of wage
employed women in Turkey are banked, as compared to 23 percent of the majority of women
who report being out of the workforce.

14. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 summarizes account ownership and usage in Turkey.
Section 3 analyzes formal and informal saving rates, Section 4 discusses the use of formal and
informal credit and the high use of store credit cards. Section 5 examines gender differences in
enterprise financing. Section 6 concludes. An Appendix includes detailed information on our
regressions analysis.

2. FORMAL ACCOUNT OWNERSHIP

15. Findex is a public database collected with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
and in partnership with Gallup, Inc. on how people in 148 countries around the world report using
formal and informal financial services.1 The database includes nationally representative samples
of at least 1,000 randomly selected adults per country. In Turkey, 58 percent of adults report
having an account at a formal financial institution—a bank, a credit union, cooperative, post
office, or microfinance institution.

16. Financial inclusion in Turkey is high as compared to a wide range of comparison groups -
Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries (ECA), middle income countries (MIC), countries
where a majority of individuals are Muslim (Islamic), the emerging quartet of countries Brazil,
Russia, China and India (BRIC), and members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD)2. Turkey is second to only the sample of OECD countries (Figure 1).

17. Yet the gender gap in account penetration for Turkey - 82 percent of men report owning an
account compared to 33 percent of women - is significantly larger than all other comparison
groups, including MIC, ECA, and Islamic countries (Figure 2). In multivariate regression analysis
(Appendix A) we find that after controlling for other individual characteristics, being female in
Turkey decreases the log odds of having a formal account by 1.84. Holding all individual
characteristics at their means, this translates to a 38 percentage point decrease in the probability
of owning a formal account if the adult is female rather than male.

18. Next, we examine the relationship between income and account ownership (Figure 3).
Multivariate estimations also find that both relative income quintiles and absolute (log) income
in Turkey is insignificantly related to account ownership, whereas in a pooled regression of
middle-income countries (including country fixed-effects), both measures are largely and
significantly related to account ownership.

19. Before proceeding with our analysis of the gender gap, it should again be noted that the
sample for Turkey is only 1,000 observations, and therefore some sub-samples (e.g. by gender
and income, education, or age) have fewer than 100 observations.

20. With this caveat in mind, we also find that poor women in Turkey are less likely than wealthy
women to have an account, but an ‘income gap’ does not exist among men (Figure 4). 55 percent
of women in the wealthiest 20 percent of earners report owning an account, compared to 22
percent of women in the poorest income quintile, compared to 71 percent of men in the poorest
income quintile and 85 percent of women. In other words, within the sample of female
respondents, as well as among both men and women, on average, across middle-income
countries, we see a relationship between income and financial inclusion, but not among Turkish
men.

21. Figure 5 shows the relationship between education and financial inclusion. Among adults with
only a primary education, 85 percent of men report having an account, as compared to only 23
percent of women. Interestingly, in our multivariate analysis (Appendix A), we find that after
controlling for employment, age, income, etc., women with more than a primary education are
more likely to be banked (as compared to women with only a primary education), but we do not
find a significant relationship between education and financial inclusion among men.

22. Next, we examine account ownership over the life-cycle (Figure 6). Among men, we do not
find significant differences across age categories, although young men (age 18-24) are less likely
to have an account than older men, who would have an account to receive wages or manage
their household or business finances. However, we find an interesting trend of increasing use of
bank accounts among young women—44 percent of women age 18-24 report having an account,
as compared to 33 percent of women age 25-64, and 29 percent of women age 65 and older. This
might suggest that younger women have greater need or access to financial services, and might
suggest an improving trend in financial inclusion among women.

23. We include in our multivariate analysis (Appendix A) age and age-squared (to test for
curvature in the relationship). We find that age is significant for both men and women, however,
age-squared is significant only for women. In other words, after controlling for education,
employment, income, etc., the ‘typical’ female account holder is younger than the respective
male.

24. Labor force participation is also highly correlated with the gender gap in account ownership.
As shown in Table 1, Panel A, waged and self-employed women are as likely as men to own an
account. However, only 11 percent of women (compared to 34 percent of men) in our sample
report wage employment, while only 3 percent of women (compared to 22 percent of men)
report self-employment, which includes both formal and informal enterprises. 84 percent of
women report being out of the workforce (compared to 37 percent of men), but a large gender
gap exists within this group: 23 percent of women out of the workforce report having an account,
as compared to 70 percent of men.

25. It is interesting to note that these trends are not observed in the pooled sample of middle-
income countries. For instance, among those that report being out of the workforce (21 percent
of men and 48 percent of women), reported account ownership is 33 percent and 28 percent,
respectively.

26. In Appendix A, we show estimation results of multivariate Logit regressions for the complete
sample and split by gender. We find that after controlling for other individual characteristics,
being wage employed in Turkey increases the probability of owning an account by 17 percentage
points for men—but 74 percentage points for women.

27. We return to this important relationship between wage employment and account ownership
in Section 2.3.

28. Finally, we examine the use of financial services by rural versus urban residents. Among men
in our sample, we do not find a significant difference between the use of financial services
between men living in rural versus urban residences, perhaps because of the relatively high ATM
penetration of 30 per 1000 Km (compared to the regional average of 19 in ECA). In comparison,
we find 27 percent of rural women are banked, as compared to 35 percent of urban women —
although this difference is not significant after controlling for income and other individual
characteristics.

2.1 HOW ARE ACCOUNTS USED?

29. The majority of Turkish account owners access their accounts once or twice a month to
deposit or withdraw money (Figure 7). 90 percent of account holders deposit money into their
account 1-2 times a month, while only 9 percent deposit more than 3 times per month. Self-
employed Turkish adults (13 percent of the population), are more frequent depositors – 21
percent make 3 or more deposits per months. Similarly, 77 percent of account holders withdraw
money 1-2 times a month, though 21 percent withdraw money more than 3 times per month.
The rate of high frequency withdrawals is relatively high compared to other middle income
countries (17 percent) and BRIC countries (15 percent).

30. In our sample of Turkish respondents, 98 percent of banked adults report having a debit card,
higher than the average across middle income countries of 57%. Adults in turkey are most likely
to withdraw money from their accounts using an ATM. 89 percent of Turkish account holders
report using an ATM when they needed to get cash (paper or coins) out of their account. The
corresponding proportion of account holders that use an ATM to withdraw money in ECA and
MIC countries is 64 and 38 percent, respectively.




                                                                          12

2.2 WHY ARE ACCOUNTS USED?

31. Not only are adults in Turkey more likely than adults in other middle-income countries to
have an account, they are also more likely to use their accounts to send and receive money and
receive wages and/or government payments. The Findex data asks banked adults whether they
use their account for a variety of purposes (Figure 8). Among banked Turkish adults, 52 percent
of account holders use their accounts to receive wages or payments from the sale of goods or
services, which corresponds to 32 percent of all adults in our sample. In addition, 29 percent of
banked adults use their accounts to receive government payments, which corresponds to 18
percent of all adults. Adults in Turkey are more than twice as likely to use their accounts to receive
wages or government payments as adults in middle-income countries, on average, and on-par
with the use of electronic payments in high-income countries.

32. Furthermore, 29 percent of Turkish account holders (16 percent of all adults in our sample)
use their account to receive money from family and friends, and 13 percent of account holders
use their account to send money (8 percent of all adults). Comparatively, the use of account to
receive money is more than twice as high as reported in middle- or high-income countries.

The Gender Gap in the Use of Financial Services in Turkey


33. Figure 9 reports the gender gap in the use of accounts to receive and/or send money. Both
men and women, in Turkey and in comparative country groups, are most likely to use their
accounts to receive wages. Strikingly, 34 percent of women also report using their account to
receive domestic and/or international remitted money from family and friends, which is almost
three times as likely as women (or men) in MIC or OECD countries, on average.

34. As discussed earlier, the widespread use of electronic payments appears to help explain bank
penetration rates in Turkey, particularly among women. In Figure 10, we investigate further the
potential role of electronic wage accounts. As shown, in a cross country sample of middle and
high income economies, labor force participation rates are significantly positively correlated with
account penetration for women—but not for men. We can only speculate that regardless of wage
employment, men open accounts to manage household (and enterprise) finances. In contrast,
women are more likely to have an account in their own name only if the account is needed to
receive payments, such as wages (or remittances). Another explanation might be that only
women with wage employment need or can afford their own account.

2.3 BARRIERS TO ACCOUNT OWNERSHIP

35. In this section we use Findex data on self-reported barriers to account ownership to better
understand the low use of accounts by women, relative to men. As shown in Figure 11, the most
commonly reason reported globally for not having an account was a lack of money to use it: 15
percent of unbanked adults in Turkey said this was the only reason they did not have an account
and 47 percent of the unbanked listed lack of money as one of the reasons (multiple responses
were permitted). Yet in comparison, 67 percent of non-account holders in the rest of developing
world cited as lack of money as a reason not to have an account. Notably, lack of trust (26
percent) are higher for Turkey than the average of other middle-income countries. Cost and
documentation are also cited as reasons for not having an account, as well as ‘indirect’ usage
through another family member’s account.

                          Note: Multiple responses were permitted to this question

36. Figure 12 illustrates barriers to account ownership disaggregated by gender. The most
common reported single reason for not having an account by both men and women is a lack of
money to use it, although this reason is more typically reported by men. Women are over twice
as likely as men to report distance as a barrier, which may reflect the greater barriers in traveling
to a bank branch. Women are also more likely to report a lack of trust in banks.

2.4 LEGAL AND CULTURAL NORMS

37. Institutional factors and gender norms are important determinants of cross-country variations
in the gender gap for financial inclusion (Demirguc-Kunt, Klapper, and Singer, 2012). The World
Bank Women, Business and the Law (WBL) dataset includes variables indicating laws restricting
women’s ability to earn an income, either as an employee or entrepreneur.

38. Following Demirguc-Kunt, Klapper and Singer (2012), we construct a simple index ranging
from -2 to 5 using the 7 WBL variables.3 Turkey has the highest possible score of 5 in each of the
seven codified laws promote gender equality. Figure 13, Panel A shows a weak relationship
between legal restrictions to female employment and a gender gap in financial inclusion.4 This
figure also shows that Turkey has the highest gender gap in account ownership among the set of
countries with a WBL index of 5.


3 Can a married woman get a job or pursue a trade or profession in the same way as a married man? Can a married woman be
“head of household” or “head of family” in the same way as a married man? Can a married woman choose where to live in the
same way as a married man? Are married women required by law to obey their husbands? Do sons and daughters have equal
inheritance right immoveable property from their parents? Do female and male surviving spouses have equal inheritance rights
to immoveable property? Separation is default marital property regime

39. An important consideration is that the WBL is based on de jure laws and regulations, and does
not judge the effectiveness or enforcement of the law. To complement the de jure WBL data, we
consider a de facto measure of gender inequality. The World Economic Forum publishes the
annual “Gender Gap Report” by scoring the gender gap in economic opportunity, education,
health and political participation. In the 2013 Gender Gap Report, Turkey ranked 120 out of 136
countries, with a sub-index ranking above 100 in all but the health sub-index. It is the lowest
ranked country in the ECA region. It appears that the socio-economic gender gap outcome
indicators in Turkey are more aligned with the observed gender gap in financial inclusion. Figure
13, Panel B shows the correlation between the gender gap report score and the gender gap in
account penetration. Here, we find a significant relationship between gender differences in
account penetration and gender norms. The gender gap in Turkey remains an outlier, even as
compared to other countries that rank low in gender inequality ‘in practice’.

40. The Global Findex survey questions are administered by Gallup as part of the Gallup World
Poll. Gallup, for reasons unrelated to the questions relevant to Global Findex, oversampled
Istanbul during its 2011 survey of Turkey. Sample weights issued by Gallup to make the survey
sample nationally representative should in theory mute the issue of oversampling Istanbul. For
the sake of thoroughness and as a check of robustness, we further breakdown account
penetration into Istanbul and the rest of Turkey for all respondents and by gender. Overall
account penetration in Istanbul and the rest of Turkey are similar at 62 percent and 56 percent.
Table 2 shows that the gender gap is slightly higher in the rest of Turkey than in Istanbul. A
breakdown by rural and urban location within these areas shows no major differences (except

                                                    18

rural Istanbul with only 3 surveyed adults). Further analysis finds that rural areas in Turkey have
the largest gender gap in account penetration while urban Istanbul has the lowest. This suggests
that the oversampling of Istanbul should not pose any biases in our analysis of the gender gap on
the national level.

3. SAVINGS

42. Overall, only 10 percent of Turkish adults report saving (Figure 14). This compares to 22
percent of adults that report saving in ECA countries, and 31 percent and 26 percent, on average,
in MIC and OECD countries, respectively. This relatively low reported rate of personal savings is
consistent with national statistical data showing that domestic savings in Turkey declined
significantly in the 2000’s—from an average of 23.5 percent of gross national income in the
1990’s to an average of 17 percent over the 2000-2008 period, and down to 12.7 percent in 2010
(World Bank report , 2011).

43. The Findex questionnaire surveys both formal and informal modes of saving. This includes
formal, ‘semi-formal’, and ‘other’ modes of saving. ‘Semi-formal’ savings includes informal
savings clubs or someone outside the family. Whereas in most developing cou ntries, the ‘other’
category is primarily informal sources, such as gold, livestock, or in the home, in Turkey,
developed capital markets might offer additional formal modes of savings and investments (such
as equity and mutual funds).

The Gender Gap in the Use of Financial Services in Turkey


44. Among the 10 percent of adults who report saving in Turkey, 44 percent say they used a
formal account (Figure 14). This compares to a formal savings rate of 59 percent and 77 percent
of adult savers in MIC and OECD countries, respectively. 5 percent of adults in Turkey (50 percent
of savers) report saving somewhere other than a bank or formal financial institution. A negligible
percentage of adults report saving using community savings groups.

45. Figure 15 shows that across comparative country groups, women are (insignificantly) less
likely than men to save in the past year. For instance, in Turkey, 8 percent of women saved, as
compared to 11 percent of men. Women are also (insignificantly) less likely to formally save—2
percent of women in Turkey saved in the past year at a bank or other formal financial institution,
as compared to 6 percent of men.

46. Figure 16 highlights that even among Turkish adults with an account, only 13 percent report
any form of saving. Almost 50 percent of both male and female savers with accounts save in ways
“other” than a bank or formal financial institution. Although this might include equity or real-
estate, it might also include money saved informally or "under the mattress", which suggests a
missed opportunity for banks to provide appropriate savings products.

4. CREDIT

47. In the Findex database, 45 percent of adults in Turkey report having a credit card, which might
be used as a substitute for formal short-term credit (Figure 17). This is in comparison to 50
percent of adults in OECD countries and a much lower credit card ownership in the rest of ECA
and middle-income countries, 10 and 7 percent, respectively. Even among OECD countries, only
58 percent of account owners have a credit card; much lower than the 78 percent in Turkey.

48. It is likely that adults using store-issued credit cards reported using “store credit” in the Findex
survey, rather than “from a bank or other formal financial institution”. Only 5 percent of adults
in Turkey report borrowing from a bank, credit union or MFI in the past year, which is
comparatively low. But the low use of bank financing might be explained by the very high use of
store credit (or likely credit cards), reported by 43 percent of Turkish adults. This is in comparison
to less than 5 percent of adults that report using store credit across all developing countries, and
12 percent in the OECD. If we include adults that report having a credit card (information is not
collected on the use of credit cards), then the use of (or access to) formal credit in Turkey is
comparable to OECD countries.

49. As shown in Figure 18, Turkish men are more than twice as likely as Turkish women to use
formal credit (the sum of the blue bars), 36 percent and 29 percent, respectively. However, it
should be noted that the use of credit by women in Turkey is greater than the use of formal credit
by men or women in all comparative groups except OECD countries.

50. The gender gap in the use of formal credit in Turkey is significant after controlling for other
individual characteristics (Appendix A4). However, we do not find gender to be significantly
related to the use of credit in middle-income countries, on average, likely because the overall
formal borrowing rates are very low. We also find age and age squared to be significant in both
samples, for men and women, pointing to middle-age men and women most likely to use credit.
Widowed women are significantly less likely to use credit, but not widowed men. Most strikingly,
wage- and self-employment appear to be the strongest predictors of using formal credit, both
for men and women. For example, among women in our sample , being self-employed in Turkey
increases the log odds of using formal credit by 3.77, which translates to a 70 percentage point
increase.

51. Figure 19 examines the use of informal credit from family and friends: 43 percent of adults in
Turkey report borrowing from family and friends, as compared to 25 percent of adults across all
developing countries and 12 percent of adults in the OECD.5 Furthermore, 28 percent of women
and 16 percent of men report using only informal sources of credit, such as family and friends,
which is higher than the average of ECA and MIC countries. Notably, a comparatively high
percentage of adults— 29 percent of men and 14 percent of women report—using both informal
and formal credit.




5   Other informal sources of credit (not shown) include employers (3 percent) and other private lenders (0.5 percent).

52. The most common reported reasons for taking out a loan in Turkey include emergencies or
health purposes (44 percent), to pay school fees (31 percent), or to extend or repair one’s home
(18 percent).

5. FIRM FINANCING

53. To gain a better understanding of formal firms’ access to finance, we use data from the World
Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES), which cover more than 130,000 formally registered firms in 127
countries.6 90 percent of firms in Turkey report having access to a checking or savings account
(Figure 19). 89percent of formal small and medium sized enterprises (SME’s) in Turkey report
having a bank deposit account. In comparison, 70 percent of firms in Turkey report having access
to finance, defined as access to either a loan, line of credit or overdraft facility (Figure 20).

54. The World Bank Enterprise Surveys identifies the gender of the firm owner(s). 656 firms in
the sample (24 percent) in Turkey are female owned, with a distribution of 28 percent small, 38
percent medium, and 66 percent large. Figure 21 shows that, contrary to summary statistics from
individuals (in Section 2), female owned firms have higher access to finance than male owned
firms in Turkey. Out of 2,024 male owned firms surveyed in Turkey, 65 percent report access to
a loan, line of credit or overdraft facility. For the 656 female owned Turkish firms in the sample,
over 80 percent have access to finance. This includes 72 percent of small, female-owned firms
report access to formal credit (compared to 81 percent and 86 percent of medium- and large-
sized firms, respectively). Both male and female owned firms have better access to finance in
Turkey than both the ECA region and the full sample of developing countries. These findings
might suggest that only women who can access formal financing formally register firms (or that
only owners that need formal financing operate in the formal sector).

APPENDIX A: REGRESSION ANALYSIS
In this section we use more rigorous statistical analysis to test the significance of gender in
predicting ownership of a formal account and use of formal credit, after controlling for other
individual characteristics (Appendix 1). We follow the methodology used in Demirguc-Kunt and
Klapper (2013) and estimate a logit model where we predict having an account and, separately,
use of formal credit on gender and a series of control variables: income quintiles, completed level
of education, rural or urban residence, marital status, being head of household, employment
status, age (and its squared term), and the household dependency ratio (children under age 15
as a fraction of total household size). Definitions and mean summary statistics for all variables
are shown in Table A1 and univariate summary statistics, by gender, in Table A2. The result of
logit regressions predicting ownership of accounts and the use of formal credit (plus ownership
of a credit card) are shown in Tables A3 and A4, respectively.


To compare Turkey with all comparison groups, we ran an identical Logit regressions with country
fixed effects over those comparative country groups (the results for MIC countries are shown in
Table A3, other comparative country groups not shown). The log odds coefficient for the gender
dummy variable show that the gender gap in account ownership is statistically insignificant for
the sample of ECA and OECD countries. For other comparison country groups, the gender dummy
variable is statistically significant after controlling for individual characteristics, but the
magnitude is much smaller than that found in Turkey.

The Gender Gap in the Use of Financial Services in Turkey


We find similar results for multivariate regressions on the use of formal credit, including store
credit and credit card ownership (Table A4). We find significant gender differences in only Turkey
and OECD countries, in part because the use of formal credit in many other middle-income
countries is very low (on average, 25 percent of adults in MIC report using in the past year formal
credit or store credit, or having a credit card) .
