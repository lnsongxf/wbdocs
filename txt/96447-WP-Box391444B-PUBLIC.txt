Executive Summary

1.      Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has a critical shortage and maldistribution of its
health workforce. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Lao government have developed and
endorsed a number of policies, Decrees and regulations to address this situation. However, it is
acknowledged that enforcement, implementation, and monitoring of these policies needs to be
further strengthened.

2.       This study is part of multi-country study on rural retention policy analyses covered by AAAH
to provide a qualitative analysis of recent supply-side policies designed to improve availability and
access of human resources for health (HRH) in remote areas. It provides a chronological inventory of
current government policies for improving rural retention of health workers with reference to the 16
recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) in their 2006 Working Together
For Health, which contains an expert assessment of the then crisis in the global health workforce and
ambitious proposals to tackle it over the next 10 years. This study uses a policy analysis tool that
focuses on policy formulation and implementation to analyze and compare three selected rural
retention policies, with reference to their formulation, implementation and the outcomes achieved.
The study recommends options for improving rural retention strategies including assessment of their
relative effectiveness with a view to strengthening their content, overcoming implementation bottle-
necks, and identifying opportunities for up scaling.

3.       Majority of the sixteen recommendations of the WHO except a recommendation on better
living conditions of the health workers have at least a policy, strategy and/or grey documents related
to them.The three selected policies offer a comprehensive incentive benefit package to health
workers including admission of students with rural backgrounds to health institutes; provision of
financial incentive, career promotion and opportunity for continued education for those who work in
rural areas. However, the implementation of these policies varies between training institutes on the
admission side, and between the central and provincial level on the deployment side; only 10 of 17
Provinces have been enforcing and implementing the 2010 Decree Number 468/PMO on the
provision of financial incentives for civil servants.

4.       The analysis reveals a critical gap between policy intent and implementation. The reasons for
this include: (a) insufficient human resources with capacity to effectively interpret and apply the
policy into practice at all levels; (b) insufficient budget allocation (especially for Decree Number
468/PMO) resulting in unfunded mandates; (c) inadequate basic infrastructure for new staff at the
rural facilities (housing, working environment); (d) absence of timely updated HRH database for
supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the policies; (e) no unit in the concerned
ministries or provinces tasked with the specific responsibility of implementing the policies. In
addition, the consultative workshop held with key policy makers, managers and implementers noted
that the absence of unity in reinforcing and implementing these policies might be attributable to the
lack of awareness on the part of the policy makers and management in the concerned agencies.

5.      Given such obstacles in implementation and enforcement of the retention policies, the study
recommends approaches for bridging the gap between policy formulation and implementation. This
includes: (a) including in policy formulation analysis of the financial and human resource
requirements of the decrees being recommended in order to ascertain the feasibility of
implementation; (b) having guidelines for implementation of the policies, and a reliable
arrangements for M&E to monitor policy implementation; and (c) strengthening the health
management capacity for policy enforcement.
Introduction

1.      Worldwide, Lao PDR has been identified among 57 countries with a critical shortage and
skewed distribution of its health workforce, especially in remote and rural areas (Guilbert 2006,
World Bank 2015). Healthcare education is provided by the public sector through nine public health
training institutes in the country: The University of Health Sciences (UHS) in Vientiane Capital
provides medical related programs including medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, medical technology,
nursing basic sciences and post graduate studies, with the other institutions located at provincial
levels: three Regional Public Health Colleges, four Provincial Public Health Schools and one Nursing
School. The annual output from these institutions is approximately 2,000 (Department of
Organization and Personnel (DOP), 2013).

2.       More than 70% of the population in Lao PDR resides in the rural areas, where 88% of the
workforce consists of mid- to low-level trained workers. According to the 2013 DOP data, there
were 5.4 health workers per 1,000 population in urban areas, compared to 1.3 per 1,000 population
in rural areas. The DOP’s 2013 statistics show that there were 14,964 health staff under the Ministry
of Health (MOH), of which 5,405 were mid- and high-level health workers who were actually
providing health services in health facilities nationwide. This is equivalent to 0.8 qualified health care
providers (medical doctor (MD), medical assistant (MA), nurse, and midwife) per 1,000 population
nationally, a gradual increase from 2007 where the ratio was approximately 0.5. The WHO 2006
World Report: Working Together for Health which contained an assessment of the crisis in the
global health workforce and ambitious proposals to tackle it over the next 10 years, recommends a
ratio of 2.3 qualified health workers per 1,000 population;         ratio is much lower than that. Table
1 shows the distribution of health workers by province and facilities level. Box 1 compares health
worker (physicians and nurse and midwives) density per 1,000 population across countries in the
Region.

3.      This study focuses on supply-side policies to determine the key challenges and policy
implications regarding improved availability and retention of staff in remote areas. This possibly
stems from, among other reasons, the following: (a) limited government quotas to recruit and place
health workers in rural areas (i.e. in 2013 1,045 recruitment quotas were allocated to MOH, of which
882 (84.4%) were given to provinces, districts and health centers nationwide); (b) health workers’
preference to work in urban areas with better income and professional career development
opportunities; and (c) low self-confidence of new graduates to work independently in rural areas
which is attributable to insufficient clinical practice during training, due in part to the excessive
number of student intakes to training institutes. The shortage of middle and high level health
workers at primary and secondary health care facility levels leads to a major gap in access to quality
health care services between urban and rural areas.

4.       Correspondingly, the Government of Lao PDR and the MOH have developed policies and
strategies to retain and mobilize health workers to work in the rural areas. This study reviews the
policies on promoting and retaining, as well as better distribution of, qualified health workers in
rural areas. The policies selected for deeper analysis are (a) Prime Minister Decree Number
468/PMO on provision of financial incentives for civil servants to work in rural and difficult to reach
areas; (b) Prime Minister Decree Number 82/PMO on civil service of the Lao PDR which highlights
the two year compulsory service in rural areas for newly promoted civil servants, including health
workers; and (c) the Instruction of the Ministry of Education and Sport (MOES) on recruitment of
students with rural backgrounds that provides 30% special quota to outstanding students, ethnic
minorities, and students from rural areas. The research team found that the three selected policies
clearly recognize the need to improve the retention mechanism in order to solve the shortage and
mal-distribution of health workers in rural areas, and lay out actions that are needed to address
these issues. Notwithstanding these efforts, the lack of resources to fund, and capacity to enforce
and implement the Policies at provincial and facilities’ levels remains a major challenge.

Study concepts and objectives

5.       This study applies and follows the framework developed by Huicho et al., in 2010 (see Figure
1 below) to map the legislation, policies, strategies, regulations and official documents related to
retention and attraction of certain categories of the health workers to work in rural and underserved
areas in Laos. It also identifies the key stakeholders involved in the implementation of existing
policies in order to answer the two research questions for Lao PDR: (a) what kind of policies have
been developed and endorsed by MOH and/or line ministries to increase the number of qualified
health workforce in underserved areas; and (b) what could be done to improve effectiveness of
Policy implementation.

                                                                                                        2
                   Figure 1: Conceptual Framework by Huicho et al., 2010




6.      In the final analysis, the study offers a better understanding of the content, process and
outcome of various existing government policies for retaining health workers in underserved areas
in Lao PDR. The study aims to:

   (a) Document a chronological inventory of all current government policies aimed at improving
       rural retentions of health workers against the sixteen recommendations made by WHO (see
       Annex 1);
   (b) Analyze and compare three selected supply-side rural retention policies, from their
       formulation to their implementation and outcome, using a policy analysis tool that focuses
       on policy formulation and implementation (see Annex 2); and
   (c) Recommend options for improving rural retention strategies, including assessing their
       relative effectiveness, strengthening their content, overcoming implementation bottlenecks
       and identifying opportunities for taking them to scale.

Methodology

7.      The healthcare services and training in Lao PDR are primarily provided by the public sector,
particular in rural areas. This means the public sector, or the government, is producing and
deploying health workers. The government is responsible for training, recruitment and retention of
health workers in rural areas, therefore the study is designed to explore and analyze supply-side
policies and their implications for attracting and retaining health workers in rural areas. The
research team applied a triangular research method by Gilson 2012 (see Figure 2 below).



                                                                                                  3

                                                                        qualified health

                                                                        underserved areas

8.      Following the triangular approach, the team conducted the research in three dimensions: (a)
a documentary review to explore and map policies based on the sixteen recommendations of WHO
to increase access to a qualified health workforce in underserved areas; (b) a qualitative method
including in-depth interviews of selected key persons at policy-making and management level, focus
group discussion (FGD) which target newly graduated medical students from representative public
health institutes in the central, northern, and southern part of the country, and a consultative
workshop to get consensus on the findings and recommendations; and (c) a quantitative method by
sending questionnaires to be filled in by the head of the Health Personal Unit at each of the
Provincial Health Offices (PHOs), analyzing existing data to explore the current status of
implementing the three selected policies (Annex 4 presents details of the study design and research
methodology). This report presents the findings and recommendations in two sections: in the result
section, the policy mapping addresses the first objective, and the policy analysis section addresses
the second objective. The discussion and policy implication section addresses the third objective.

Results

1.        Policy mapping

9.      The research team visited concerned departments under MOH, MOES and the Ministry of
Home Affairs (MOHA) to collect documents related to attraction and retention of health staff in rural
areas. This exercise gave the team a sense of the extent to which the policies were followed and


                                                                                                   4
enforced by the concerned departments and the ministries. Of the 43 documents reviewed, 25
related to the study objectives on attraction and retention of health staff in rural areas.

10.     Several attempts have been made by the Government of Lao PDR and the MOH to address
the shortage and skewed distribution of qualified health workers, especially in rural areas (at District
and health center levels) where the majority of the population reside. The followings documents
were selected for review due to their assumed importance for improving the supply of HRH in
remote areas:

        In 2003, the Government endorsed Prime Minister Decree Number 82/PMO on civil service
         of the Lao PDR which provided for the two years compulsory service in rural areas among
         newly promoted civil servants, including health workers;
        In 2005, MOH, in collaboration with the WHO, conducted the first HRH Analysis; the results
         were published in 2007, and provided the policy makers with evidence of a shortage of HRH;
        In early 2010, WHO published a report on health worker incentives in Lao PDR which found
         limited scope to manage and effectively administer any type of incentive scheme at both
         national and local level, and the need for a policy debate about the type of incentives that
         should be considered for use. The report also provided recommendations and a roadmap in
         determining and implementing incentives in Lao PDR.
        In 2010, MOH, in collaboration with WHO, organized a national workshop on rural retention.
         The workshop convened health policy makers and both national and international experts to
         discuss the Lao PDR health workforce and identify possible solutions;
        In 2010, MOH developed Health Personnel Development Strategy by 2020, endorsed by the
         Prime Minister, which focuses on five areas (pillars) for human resources in health
         (production, management, utilization, gender, and incentives-financial and non-financial);
        In 2010, the Government endorsed Prime Minister Decree Number 468/PMO on the
         provision of financial incentives for civil servants to work in rural and difficult to reach areas,
         indicating that civil servants (including health workers) who were assigned to work in
         geographically targeted areas of the Decree will receive, in addition to their salary, an
         amount equivalent to 30% to 50% of their basic salary;
        In 2011, the first large scale study on health worker incentives in Lao PDR was carried out by
         MOH in collaboration with the CapacityPlus of the United States; it recommended different
         incentive schemes for Lao PDR MDs, MAs, and mid and low level midwives – parts of this
         finding has been published elsewhere in a peer review journal (Rockers, Jaskiewicz et al.
         2012). The costing exercise of these incentive schemes was completed in late of 2011; and
        In 2012, the Minister of Health endorsed Ministerial Regulation Number 103/MOH on
         compulsory service of newly graduated medical/nursing/midwifery students in provincial
         and district hospitals, and/or health centers.

11.      As indicated above, Lao PDR has many policies to address the distribution of health workers
in rural areas. The key contents of the policy documents relate to education promotion, regulation
on new civil servants, financial incentive to health workers in rural areas, and professional/personal
support for productivity; Annex 1 shows a chronological arrangement of the relevant documents
based on the 16 WHO recommendations. However, according to the 2013 study on Health Systems
in Transition (HiT), these policies are often not enforced or implemented.

1.1.      Education

12.     The research team found five policy documents relating to recommendations in the
education domain. Two policy papers were identified relating to continuing education: Prime-
Minister Decree Number 468/PMO developed by the MOHA, and Regulation of Ministry of Health

                                                                                                          5
Number 103/MOH developed by the MOH which address the issue of continuous professional
development after completion of the condition for service in rural areas. There are three documents
relating to recruitment of students from rural backgrounds to health training institutes, including the
instruction of MOES, Education Law and Minute of the 7th National Health Meeting. Of these
policies, the instruction of MOES clearly indicated that 30% of the total number of annual student
intake in public academic institutes should be awarded to students with excellent performance,
students who are from an ethnic minority, and students who are from poor districts as defined by
the government. The instruction, however, gives priority on the education and agriculture sectors by
providing 50% of the allocated admission quotas for these sectors.

1.2.    Regulation

13.      Regarding recommendations on regulation of new civil servants, three policy documents
were identified: Prime-Minister Decree Number 82/PMO on rural compulsory service for newly
promoted civil servants, the Regulation of Ministry of Health Number 103/MOH, and the Minute of
the 7th National Health Meeting concerning compulsory service in rural areas. Article 16 of Decree
Number 82/PMO (developed by the Public Administration for Civil Service Authority, which is now
MOHA) stipulates that “newly recruited civil servants shall work at the district or village level for at
least 2 years within the first 5 years of their employment”. The MOH Regulation Number 103/MOH
requires that in order to obtain their professional working permit (professional license) and obtain a
permanent civil service contract (which will prioritize the person to receive opportunities for career
development (i.e. continuing education) with 95% of basic salary, the person must perform three
years of rural practice for newly graduated medical/non-medical students working for health sector.
In practice though, new graduates who are recruited as civil servants in the health sector are
required to serve three years in the rural areas and this service complies with the requirement of
two years’ service for newly recruited civil servants in accordance with the Decree 82. It is not clear,
however, if graduates who served the three years compulsory rural service in the health sector and
subsequently joined the civil service will be exempted from the Decree 82.

14.     There were two documents related to recommendation on subsidized education for return
of service. First, the Regulation of the Ministry of Health number 1948/MOH on provision of
scholarship to health staff and second the updated Regulation of the Ministry of Health number
094/MOH on provision of scholarship to health staff. The regulations indicated that for health staffs
who received opportunity for continue education must return and work at the same place where
they were posted for the period twice that of their training period. More investigations are needed
to understand the adherence and enforcement of this regulation.

1.3.    Financial incentive

15.      For financial incentives, two policy documents which were endorsed in 2010 were identified:
Prime-Minister Decree Number 468/PMO and Personnel Development Strategy by 2020. Decree
Number 468/PMO clearly indicates the financial incentives that civil servants will receive during the
period of their service in the rural areas would be between 30% to 50% depending on Government’s
classification of the area. The Personnel Development Strategy only mentions the need for financial
incentives to attract and retain health staff in rural areas.

1.4.    Professional/Personal Support

16.     The recently endorsed Personnel Development Strategy by 2020 of the MOH highlights the
importance of a safe and supportive working environment for health staff, but does not provide a
clear definition on safety and supportive working environment, nor specify areas for improvement

                                                                                                      6
or targets. There are no guidelines indicating how to translate the Strategy into practice, and/or a
roadmap and timeframe to achieve its goals. During the 7th National Health Meeting, the issue
related to recommendations on out-reach support was discussed; in particular the idea of rotating
staff from central level to technically assist the provincial level, the provincial level to assist their
districts, and the district to assist health centers and villages. The Minute also made
recommendations for a career development program.


2.      Policy analysis

17.      The policy analysis focuses on the three policy papers concerning retention of health
workers in rural areas in the Lao PDR. The selected policies are (a) Instruction of MOES on
recruitment of students with rural background issued in 2008; (b) Prime Minister Decree Number
82/PMO issued in 2003; and (c) Prime Minister Decree Number 468/PMO, endorsed in 2010. The
team selected these three policies for deeper analysis since these policies were considered the most
relevant policies on retention (in particular health staff in rural areas), and they had been endorsed
for a number of years thus enabling evidence of their impact to be studied. With inputs from
qualitative data, the team explored the awareness, implementation, and impact of these policies on
the recruitment of students with rural backgrounds, compulsory services for new civil servants, and
financial incentives provided for any civil servants working in rural areas.

2.1.    Recruitment of students with rural background

18.      The instruction of MOES on recruitment of students from rural backgrounds to training
institutions was introduced in 2008. The instruction clearly indicates that 30% of the annual intakes
into training institutions under the MOES (including the Faculty of Medicine of the National
University of Lao PDR now known as the UHS) should be provided to outstanding students, students
from ethnic minority groups, and students from the poor and rural districts nationwide. It aims to
promote equal access to higher/tertiary education to disadvantaged groups.

19.       The instruction has been applied to training institutions under the MOH by providing
approximately 15% of the annual intake in health training institutes (including UHS) to students with
a rural background. Students who are eligible under the quota should be from rural and/or poor
district (as defined by the government) and have completed the national entrance examination. This
means that 85% of the annual intake are for top achievers in the examination, regardless of socio-
economic, or geographic status. The remaining 15% of the admission places should be offered to
students from poor/rural districts who did not fall into the top 85%. The 15% quota is allocated on a
competitive basis among students from poor/rural districts, selected from the top entrance
examination scores. All students who are accepted into training will be exempt from fees for tuition
and dormitory only, but the costs relating to moving to the school, or any daily allowance during the
period of study, are not covered. This might be one of the barriers for students from families with
low socio-economic status.

20.     The results from quantitative analysis using administrative data covering 2009-2013 from all
of the health institutes (UHS, 4 public health colleges, 3 public health schools, and 1 nursing school)
indicates that the UHS (located in the capital city in the central part of the country) had the lowest
percentage of rural student intake annually (12.1%) while Oudomxay Public Health School in the
north had the highest percentage (27.4%) (See Figure 3). In UHS, among five faculties where data
were available, the highest percentage of rural student intake was found in the Faculty of Dentistry
(14.8%), while the Faculty of Nursing, and Faculty of Medicine were found to have the lowest
percentage (9.6% and 11.0%, respectively) (see Figure 4). The research team also looked at the
percentage of rural student intake by professional degree and found that the percentage of rural

                                                                                                       7
student intake into diploma courses (two-year curriculum) was the highest (19.5%), and intake into
high diploma courses (three-year curriculum) was the lowest (7.7%) (see Figure 5)

2.1.1. Awareness and perception of the policy

21.      Only a few of the key informants (KI) who participated in this study were aware of the
instruction of MOH to provide special admission quotas into training institutions to students from
rural and poor districts. The rationale given by the KIs for developing the policy were grouped as
follows: extension of health services network to cover remote and rural areas; increasing rural
students’ opportunities for admission in health education institutions; and expectation of returning
to work at the hometown in quota recipients.

22.     Dissemination of the instruction content seems to have concentrated on the policy makers
at central and provincial level. None of the students from medicine or nursing who joined FGDs were
aware of this instruction, nor reported having classmates admitted under this special quota. The
majority of the KIs believed that information regarding this instruction had not reached all priority
areas of the MOH, while others said that they are not sure if the information already reached
everybody.

        “I am not sure but I think distribution of instruction is not covered because of limited budget
         from the government for dissemination” [KI02]

        “It is not covered because it relates to transparency and accountability in selection of
         students, and insufficient budget” [KI16]

23.     Inaccessibility to information of this instruction among rural and/or poor students,
therefore, might have some negative impact on selection rural students.

        “I think it does not cover, and allocation admission quota to students is not based on the
         local need” [KI04]

       “I think it is not covered because some poor districts did not send students to our school”
         [KI17]

24.      Positive perception on the instruction is observable from the majority of the KIs who
thought the instruction is relevant to the Lao HRH situation and believe that it can contribute to
solving the problem of the shortage of health workers in Laos. However, some KIs indicated that this
instruction alone can only partly contribute to HRH development in Laos, and that it should be
implemented in combination with other measures.

        “It can improve only quantity of human resources for health but quality is another issue;
         there is variation in basic knowledge between urban and rural students. We sometimes give
         them an exception” [KI04]

       “It could not solve a problem without transparent and accountable selection mechanism”
         [KI05]

       “It can solve a problem of shortage of health staff if quotas are really allocated to rural
         students, not students from big cities or from elite families” [KI11]

        “It can solve a problem because they will return to their hometown after graduation but my
         concern is on skill and experience of graduates” [KI18]



                                                                                                     9
2.1.2. Policy implementation: what are challenges?

25.     Most of the KIs recognized that the instruction has been enforced and implemented by all of
the health training institutions under the MOH, as well as public universities and colleges under the
MOES nationwide. However the KIs pointed out some potential challenges relating to
implementation of the instruction during in-depth interviews in response to questions posed to
explore constraints or challenges relating to four domains: (a) human resources (teachers); (b)
training facilities; (c) appropriate training curricula for rural students; and (d) the existing HRH
database. Not surprisingly, most of the KIs agreed that low admissions of students from rural
backgrounds are due to (a) inadequate preparation for higher education so many students from
rural backgrounds cannot pass the entrance exam; (b) low capacity of training institutions to
accommodate students due to faculty constraints and quality of teachers; (c) the location of most
training institutions in urban areas, which add more transportation and living cost to students from
rural areas; and (d) limited financial support to poor students from rural areas discourages them
from accessing higher education. It was also noted that the HRH database needs to be updated in a
timely manner to ensure the accuracy of the database in order to place new graduates to areas with
severe shortages of health workers.

        “The database is very important for producing information and providing updates on health
         staff. We also need to map out areas with severe shortage of health staff” [KI15]

        “We should have a database to use for monitoring and evaluation of the instruction
         implementation” [KI21]

26.      Students from poor/rural districts who are admitted to health training institutions will use
the same curricula and be graded in the same manner as those who passed the national entrance
examination. While limited access to secondary education in rural areas leads to a low supply of
quality secondary students, and these students require extra support to reach the standard of other
students, such support is currently not available. In this regard, the research team explored whether
the existing curricula was appropriate for rural students with a weaker education background. The
response of the KIs to this question was varied; some believed that the current curriculum was
suitable and should not be adjusted for rural students, while others expressed the need for
special/additional curricula for rural students (i.e. intensive pre-university preparation program, in
particular for basic sciences, foreign language, and computer sciences) to minimize the educational
gap between urban and rural students.

        “MOES planned to develop intensive courses on the weekend for rural students to improve
         their basic education level” [KI06]

        “I think there should be special intensive courses for rural students to improve their foreign
         language knowledge” [KI09]

        “I think there should be preparatory courses for rural students to improve their basic
         education level” [KI12]

        “We need to develop and improve proper curriculum for rural students, especially on basic
         sciences and foreign language” [KI15]

        “If possible we should develop special curricula for rural students who have lower basic
         science knowledge than urban students. The new curriculum should reflect local need”
         [KI33]


                                                                                                   10
        “Rural students don’t have foreign language knowledge, especially in English, and they learn
         slower than students from urban areas” [ST3-1]

        “We cannot compare rural students with urban, especially in foreign languages; many of the
         rural students have had no foreign language at their schools; for example myself, I did have
         English class at my school” [ST3-3]

2.1.3. Measurement of impact of policy implementation

27.     As reported earlier, many KIs noted the absence of accurate and timely updates to the HRH
database, particularly at sub-national level, making it difficult to use for M&E of impact of policy
implementation. Some also mentioned the need to improve or strengthen their organization
database in order for its M&E system to function for implementing the policy. The lack of an up-to-
date database, along with no specific organization, department, division and/or unit under the KIs’
organization being responsible for policy implementation as well as M&E of its implementation was
noted.

        “There is no monitoring and follow up for this policy implementation so far” [KI09]

        “I think monitoring and evaluation is not well functioning and there is a lack of continuity of
         this exercise, and many times there is no evaluation report” [KI10]

        “There is monitoring and evaluation but not regular and systematic” [KI24]

2.2.    Compulsory services in rural areas among new civil servants

28.      Decree Number 82/PMO on civil service of the Lao PDR does not stipulate any incentive for
compliance or penalty for non-adherence to the Decree. The Decree was developed by the MOHA,
and was endorsed in 2003. The general purpose of this Decree is to define the principles, rules and
responsible organizations for civil service management in the Lao PDR. Article 16 in Chapter IV of
the Decree clearly states that newly recruited civil servants shall work at the district or village level
for at least 2 years within the first 5 years of their employment. The Decree applies to all public
sectors (Prime Minister's Office 2003). While the Decree requires at least two years’ compulsory
services in rural areas for a public sector to issue the permanent civil servant contract, the MOH
Regulation Number 103/MOH requires at least three years for a health worker to obtain the
contract. This seems to confuse relevant departments in the MOH as to whether they should follow
the MOH regulation or the Decree 82/PMO.

29.      The results of quantitative analysis show the reinforcement and implementation of the
Decree varies across provinces, making it unclear if the Decree is being adhered to or complied with.
To calculate the percentage of staff with rural experience, the research team surveyed among staff
that were recruited from 2003 to 2010, the year when the MOH Decree was endorsed. Additional
questions were added to the HRH database report format of the DOP, and sent out to the division of
personnel of the PHO. The length of rural experience was defined as a cumulative period of time
spent in rural service. Figure 6 to Figure 10 show the percentage of health staff with and without
rural experience; Phongsaly Province had the highest percentage of health staff with rural
experience (91.3%), while Vientiane capital had the lowest percentage (2.9%). The percentage of
health staff with rural experience by ethnic group was examined and a higher percentage of health
staff with rural experience among ethnic minority groups than Lao was remarkable; male health staff
were more like to have rural experience than female staff. The proportion of staff with rural


                                                                                                      11
experience in low and mid level staff is higher than higher level staff, and a higher proportion of staff
with rural experience was observed in the nurse, community midwife and medical assistant cadres.
Having rural experience should not be attributed solely with this compulsory mandate, as it is known
that many other factors play a role in whether health workers ending up in the rural areas.

2.2.1. Awareness and perception of the policy

30.     The majority of KIs indicated that they were aware of this Decree; however, there were a
few KIs who just said that: “I have heard”. The rationale they gave for the development of the
Decree can be grouped into three: (a) to gain rural experience among new civil servants; (b) to tackle
the shortage of civil servants in rural areas; and (c) to improve the quality of health services in rural
areas.

31.     Similar to the views expressed about the MOES instruction, the majority of the KIs had a
positive perception about the Decree, expressing that the Decree is appropriate in the Lao
socioeconomic development and the situation of the Lao health workforce, and believed that it will
contribute to HRH development in Laos. Nevertheless, some KIs pointed out that the Decree alone
would not have much influence the HRH development and more work was needed to effectively
implement the Decree.

        “It can be applied to districts with well-developed infrastructure to receive new staff; for
         poor districts though, it is difficult to apply, especially providing daily allowance for staff”
         [KI05]




                                                                                                      14
        “It is not appropriate to apply this Decree to all health cadres e.g. to reallocate a surgeon to
         a hospital without surgery capacity” [KI11]

        “It is difficult to apply to all cadres of health staff and we should consider the work place and
         equipment for reallocated staff to use their skill and knowledge” [KI10]

        “We are currently implementing this Decree but it is difficult because there is no regulation
         to strongly enforce; I think we need a specific law on it” [KI17]

        “The Decree is appropriate for the current situation but it should be revised from time to
         time to adjust to the situation” [KI15]

2.2.2. Policy implementation: what are challenges?

32.      Despite the high awareness and positive perception toward the Decree, the research team
identified some challenges based on results from in-depth interviews of KIs. These include:
insufficient number of health staff to replace staff that are allocated for rural service in accordance
with the Decree; insufficient infrastructure, in particular dormitory, vehicle (motorbike) and
supportive work place (building and equipment); limited government budget to finance the
implementation of the Decree; absence of or outdated HRH database; and lack of coordination
between central (MOH) and provincial (PHO) levels.

        “There should be a dormitory at district hospital and health center, and a vehicle for
         allocated staff during their length of stay” [KI15]

        “It is all about a salary that is supposed to come on time and on a regular basis, and needs
         community participation” [KI09]

        “Allocation of financial support to the Decree implementation should be a priority of the
         government; salaries should come on a regular basis and on time; and there should be
         more incentives” [KI15]

        “The human resources for health database is the weakest point; moreover, there is no
         system for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Decree” [KI10]

        “Provincial Health Office responds by sending new staff to districts and health centers every
         year but the recruitment process, including examination, is done by the MOHA for the
         general examinations and MOH for health related tests; therefore, many volunteer staff,
         who have been sent for many years, could not pass the civil servants recruitment
         examination (to be a civil servant?) ” [KI05]

33.     In fact, the biggest failure of the Decree is that it is not enforced. KIs provided different
suggestions for how to effectively reinforce the Decree. They by and large had the same opinion that
punitive actions should be avoided against those who refuse to temporally accept rural posts in
accordance with the Decree Number 82/PMO. Instead, a number suggested positive reinforcement
such as social support, development regulations and/or policy implementation guidelines, and
having civil servant contracts with terms of reference that clearly indicate the conditions of service,
such as compulsory service in rural areas, would be an alternative way of convincing and attracting
new staff.




                                                                                                      15
        “It should have some actions against those who refuse to accept rural post e.g. halting their
         career promotion” [KI15]

        “We should provide some incentive to encourage them to accept rural posts with their
         willingness instead of strong action against them” [KI18]

        “A good way would be making a contract with them before recruitment because they may
         have different backgrounds and difficulty in accepting rural posts even for a short period”
         [KI26]

2.2.3. Measurement of impact of policy implementation

34.     Again, the absence of an updated HRH database for Decree 82 seems to have strong links
with the ability to implement the policy. Most of KIs mentioned that there is no specific organization,
department and/or unit other than the DOP or personnel department/division responsible for
implementation of this Decree.

        “HRH database is the weakest point; moreover, there is no system for monitoring and
         evaluating the Decree implementation” [KI10]

        “Monitoring and evaluation of the Decree implementation is not a routine exercise; we
         noted that when health staff accepted rural posts, it was difficult for them to get the
         incentives referenced in the Decree, e.g., training opportunity and other type of incentives”
         [KI14]

        “There is the human resources for health database used for this Decree implementation but
         it is not regularly updated” [KI22]

        “There is a monitoring and evaluation mechanism but it does not function well” [KI15]

2.3.    Financial support to civil servants to work in rural areas

35.      While many health workers or new graduates prefer to work in urban areas, the policy on
financial support to civil servants working in rural areas was developed to encourage them to move
to serve in the rural, remote, and difficult to reach areas. The Prime Minister Decree Number
468/PMO on the provision of financial incentives was developed by the MOHA and was endorsed in
late 2010. The Decree stipulates that an additional 30% to 50% of the basic salary is to be paid to
civil servants who work in rural areas classified by the MOHA. The Decree not only applies to health
staff but also the civil servants in all the public sectors in Lao PDR, except the military. Aside from
financial incentives, the Decree also offers training opportunities, including political and professional
trainings. The main source of funding for the implementation of this Decree is allocated by the
central government through the Provincial Governor. It is understood that the Decree was initially
implemented in 10 provinces: Luangnamtha, Huaphanh, Oudomxay, Luangprabang, Vientiane,
Bolikhamxay, Khammouane, Savannakhet, Champasak and Salavan. However, there has been a
delay in implementing the Decree nationally, and there is no official explanation for this; there has
also been no study on the impact of this delay. Given the limited data, the team is unable to provide
the causes of the delay in this study. Therefore the team suggests further study to understand the
reasons and impact related to the delay in implementing the Decree.




                                                                                                      16
2.3.1. Awareness and perception of the policy

36.     Many of KIs said that “I have heard about the Decree”, however a few of them were not
even aware of this Decree prior to the interview. The majority of the KIs described relevant
rationale for the development of the Decree, including encouraging, attracting or motivating civil
servants to work in rural areas by giving them incentives.

37.     Although the Decree has only recently been endorsed, few of the participating KIs were
involved in the development process. Most of them perceived that the Decree is appropriate for the
current situation and contributes to the Lao HRH development. However, some expressed that the
provision of financial incentive as addressed in the Decree cannot make much contribution to the
HRH development.

        “It can only solve the problem of shortage of health staff when other interventions or policies
         are in place” [KI02]

        “This Decree is linked to the Decree Number 82/PMO on civil service of the Lao PDR. If
         Decree Number 82 is enforced, it will support implementation of the Decree Number
         468/PMO” [KI04]

        “The Decree can temporarily contribute to the human resources for health development; it
         depends on changing socioeconomic circumstances, and what other types of incentive are
         needed for health staff” [KI15]

        “Financial incentive is just one of a number of incentives for health staff” [KI23]

2.3.2. Policy implementation: what are the challenges?

38.      As mentioned above, the Decree is currently being implemented in 10 provinces and there is
no document assessing the outcomes of its implementation. By asking for the opinions of
participating KIs, the research team identified some challenges such as (a) the limited budget
allocations from the central and provincial government to support Provincial implementation of the
Decree; (b) the incentive provided is based on geographic conditions, but due to the weakness of the
M&E system (including the lack of an up-to-date HRH database at national and sub-national level), it
is not possible to accurately capture the number of health workers in rural areas; and (c) lack of
standard procedures and instruction on how to request the budget for the incentive from provincial
and central governments.

39.     Indeed, there is high opportunity cost for a health worker to remain serving in rural areas,
because living in rural areas prevents him/her from opportunities for upgrading, being able to have a
larger private practice, the ability to carry out social networking, better living conditions, and better
education for his/her children. Although the participating KIs did not point to those opportunity
costs directly, the answers below confirmed that they are missing the opportunity to maintain
and/or upgrade their professional skills due to work environment constraints, including working in
health facilities that cannot accommodate their professional improvement.

        “The quality of district hospitals and health centers should be improved and well equipped to
         attract and retain new staff, and it should have dormitories for them” [KI15]

        “We should consider the quality of the health facility to attract health staff” [KI26]



                                                                                                      17
2.3.3. Measurement of impact of policy implementation

40.     Similar to the MOES’s instruction and Decree Number 82/PMO, an accurate HRH database is
required at national, provincial and district level in order to monitor enforcement of the Decree
(468/PMO) nationally. Administratively, MOHA is responsible for M&E of the implementation of this
Decree, consequently there is no department, division or office under MOH assigned to monitor and
evaluate implementation of the Decrees concerning attraction and retention of health staff in rural
areas.

Discussion and policy implications

1.       Discussion

41.     The Lao Peoples Democratic Republic Health System Review which was recently published
by the WHO Asia Pacific Region (WPRO 2014). The study recognized that the government strategies
and policies are often not fully implemented and enforced, and proposed recommendations to scale
up implementation of developed policies in Laos as follows:

        Strategies, policies and related plans should be well-defined, realistic and doable.
        Capacity and commitment are needed to translate research findings into evidence-based
         policy, and to translate policy into programme implementation.
        Implementation plans must be fully aligned with relevant policies and strategies.

42.     The primary objective of this study was to map out existing policies, strategies, ministerial
regulations and instructions, and other unofficial documents which are related to attraction and
retention of health staff in rural areas and to systematically study current situation of reinforcement
and implementation of the selected policies.

43.      Sixteen WHO recommendations on health worker attraction and retention were used as a
stencil of the policy mapping. Of these recommendations, except better living condition, we found
at least there are some policy, strategy and/or grey documents. In regard with number documents
(policy, strategy, regulation, instruction, etc.) related to sixteen recommendations of the WHO, Laos
seems to have the highest number of documents than other five countries participated in the multi-
countries rural retention policies analysis by the AAAH in 2012. Nevertheless, density of qualified
health workforce (MD, Nurse and Midwife) in Laos was not different or lower than those countries
(WHO 2009). This might provide evidence to confirm the observation by the Lao PDR HiT study
above on problems of reinforcement and implementation of existing policies in Lao PDR; there are
still gaps between policy and implementation.

44.     Under the second objective, the research team explored in detail three selected policies.
These three policies together provide a comprehensive health worker incentive benefit package,
including admission of students with rural background to health institutes, financial incentives,
career promotion and opportunities for continuing education. However, the implementation of
these policies varied across health professional training institutes and provinces, e.g., the proportion
of students with a rural background who were admitted differed among the institutions, courses and
degrees; the percentage of health staff who had undertaken rural service differed between
provinces (since 2010, only 10 out of the 17 Provinces were enforcing and implementing Decree
Number 468/PMO on provision of financial incentives for civil servants).




                                                                                                     18
45.      Lack of consistency in reinforcing and implementing these policies might be attributable to
the result lack of awareness of the beneficiaries about the policies (policy implementers, local
authorities and potential beneficiaries); insufficient human resources with the capacity to manage
the policy implementation at national and sub-national level; insufficient budget allocation,
especially for Decree Number 468/PMO; inadequate basic infrastructure (such as housing/
dormitory) for new staff who accepted rural posts, and poor working environment at the district
hospitals and health centers; absence of an up-to-date HRH database for supervision, and M&E; no
specific unit within the organization of the concerned ministries and provinces charged with the
responsibility for implementing these policies; and no, or unclear, policy implementation guidelines
for the implementers, as mentioned during the consultative workshop.


2.        Study limitations

46.      This study had some limitations that should be taken into account in interpreting its findings.
Firstly, the research team mainly interviewed policy and decision makers (such as directors of
departments and centers under MOH, rectors and deans of the UHS, and directors of provincial
health offices, provincial hospitals and schools), therefore the findings of this study might not
completely reflect the reality at the district level. Secondly, the response rate of the participating KIs
was 59.3%, which is low, however, from a qualitative point of view, it seems to have had little impact
on the study’s findings. Finally, although the research team applied both qualitative and quantitative
approaches in this study, it is not possible to make a scientific link between the findings from the
two approaches.

3.        Policy implication

3.1.      General recommendations

47.     The research team proposes the following recommendations to strengthen the policy
reinforcement and implementation in the Lao PDR based on findings from this study and
consolidated results of consultative workshop:

      (a) Ensure that policy formulation is based in sound analysis and includes the resource
          requirements for implementation. . The types of policy packages to be supported or
          improved should be identified based on a solid labor market assessment, looking at both the
          demand and the supply side dynamics. Such an assessment would also show what policies
          might be needed for the different cadres, and an updated and more rigorous assessment
          may be needed in Laos to prioritize the policies. Often supply side policies are
          recommended, without taking into account labor market demand challenges (i.e., a
          disproportionate amount of financing for the recruitment of health worker flows to urban
          areas, secondary and tertiary level hospitals, as opposed to primary care facilities in rural
          areas). Prior to endorsement of a new policy, the feasibility study and costing should be
          completed in order to provide a concrete overview and inform on its implementability. It is
          important to have participation, not only from the MOH, but also from relevant sectors, in
          developing health worker retention related policies. This will not only ensure the awareness
          among them but can also help to identify challenges, especially financing, for implementing
          the policy after endorsement.

      (b) Develop implementation guidelines for all the existing health worker retention policies.
          Such guidelines should include a roadmap and action plan for policy implementation, which
          is well defined, indicates the responsibility of various organizations, along with the
          committed funding sources. Departments charged with the responsibility to implement

                                                                                                       19
          policies need to have sufficient resources to reach all levels of implementation and target
          professional groups.
    (c)

    (d) Strengthen the the M&E system, including an up-to-date HRH database at national and
        sub-national level, to effectively enforce the policies. More investment in this area is
        needed to strengthen the current database of the Department of Organization and Planning.
        Any efforts to implement policies (or improve the effectiveness of implementation) should
        not only take into account the required costs, but also the possibility of opposition from
        medical and political associations; for example, reforms in health worker education (to make
        it more applicable to rural needs for example) often receives opposition from medical and
        nursing associations.


    (e) A more comprehensive approach to policy development and implementation is critical so
        that different policies can reinforce each other. Global evidence suggests that an isolated
        policy is unlikely to affect the picture on the rural/urban distribution of health workers.
        Policies that are implemented should be accompanied by an assessment to determine their
        impact on labor market dynamics. More long-term efforts are needed to obtain adequate
        evidence; for example a study that follows a cohort of students out of university and tracks
        them through their career and links their choices to different policies and interventions,
        could be a useful tool for assessing the impact of policies on the supply-side behavior of
        health workers.

3.2.      Specific recommendations

48.      In addition to the general recommendations, the research team also proposes the following
specific recommendations for each of the policies reviewed.


3.2.1. Recruitment of students with rural background

49.     More attention should be given to dissemination of the instruction of MOES ensuring
students and authority of poor target districts receiving appropriate information. Dissemination
should be specific for districts with severe shortage of health staffs and should be based on real
need of the districts.

50.    Selection of students with rural background is done through the entrance examination.
Although MOH increased the number of examination centers from 7 to 14, it is still difficult for poor
students from rural and remote districts to overcome financial barrier such as transportation and
accommodation fee during the examination. This issue was raised during a consultative workshop.
Therefore, for priority districts or districts with severe shortage of health staff, selection process
should be done in these districts in close collaboration with local authorities including district
education office.

51.      Based on our findings and discussion in consultative workshop, some areas should be
improved to effectively implement the instruction such as student intake database of the MOH and
health institutes, appropriate or pre-university curriculum or bridging course to improve basic
scientific knowledge and foreign language of rural students; strengthen M&E system with assigned
organization to responsible for this instruction; and the scholarship for rural students should cover
the cost of tuition fee, study materials, food and accommodation.

                                                                                                   20
3.2.2. Decree on civil service of the Lao PDR

52.     To effectively and equally reinforce and implement the Decree on civil service of the Lao PDR
on rural compulsory service among newly promoted civil servants, it requires specific HRH database,
well assigned responsible unit and individual at national and sub-national level as well as a M&E
functioning system. For this, it is necessary to add few selected proper indicators for tracking
implementation of the Decree implementation into the HRH database of DOP and provincial health
office. Means, condition or positive reinforcement for staff that refuse to accept rural post as
addressed by the Decree should be appropriately defined, endorsed and enforced to all civil servants
equally. It still needs to continue to disseminate or orientate the Decree especially to new civil
servants. Making labor contract with new civil servants would be an alternative way to ensure the
Decree’s reinforcement.

53.      The policy is deemed important, potentially for recent graduates on a time bound basis in
order to obtain the permanent civil servant contract. Some of the suggested strategies by the
research team could be withholding confirmation of actual degree until rural service is carried out
(making this rural training a mandatory part of the path towards becoming a health worker),
rewarding health workers with rural placements with an extra certification/specialization matched
with a salary increase or bonus, or allowing such workers preferential allocation in continuous
professional development training opportunities. Furthermore, health workers who do not carry out
rural services could be asked to pay back a proportion of the cost that they were provided by the
government for their training (i.e. health workers would be able to buy themselves out of the
obligation). Overall global experience shows that mandatory placements do not always work very
well, unless accompanied by many other policies. Evidence from countries including Ethiopia has
shown that many of the better-connected health workers are often able to bypass mandatory
service, and that this can lead to demotivation of others. More evidence should be provided before
agreeing to invest into this policy over others.


3.2.3. Decree on financial incentive for civil servants

54.      Dissemination of this Decree should be strengthened and accelerated by the MOHA in
collaboration with all concerned ministries especially MOF. The dissemination should be focused on
priority area of the government. For health sector, more effort should be done to identify health
worker cadre and targeted areas based on reality of health worker shortage and health related goals
highlighted in the health sector master plan. It is necessary to have specific unit within concerned
departments especially DOP under the MOH to respond for the Decree implementation. M&E
system and supportive supervision should be well developed and systematically implemented.
Lesson learnt from 10 provinces currently implementing the policy should be carefully reviewed
before expanding to other provinces. Unfunded mandate is one of the major bottlenecks for
effective implementation.

55.      There are indications from the KIs that the financial incentive policy alone may not be
sufficient to motivate health workers to move from urban to rural areas. Indeed, some of the
discussions with the KIs indicated that “financial is just one of the other incentives (needed) for
health staff”. Overall, the global literature has shown that interventions at the educational level
(such as implementation of rural pipeline policies) tend to be far more effective than financial
incentive policies given the extremely high opportunity cost that comes with rural practice (and the
lack of funding to adequately offset that).




                                                                                                  21
56.     Given that the young are both cheaper, and generally more willing to work in a rural area
than older health workers (in part because they are also more altruistic but also because they have
less to loose), the incentive policy could be targeted to recent graduates only, to incentivize
immediate rural work placements. Doctors and nurses who are already established in the labor
market in urban areas will require a far greater incentive to offset the opportunity cost that comes
from 1) leaving a family and education for children, 2) leaving opportunities for professional
development and specialization, 3) and loosing additional income that comes from teaching or
working in the urban private sector (i.e. dual practice, moonlighting etc.).


3.2.4. Other recommendation to move forward

57.       In moving forward, the research team would recommend that the government carries out a
comprehensive, up to date labor market assessment, looking closely not just supply side labor
market dynamics, but also demand side dynamics (i.e. what are the challenges of rural primary level
facilities in hiring health workers even if there is a sufficient supply) before identifying the policy
package to prioritize and improve. And before they are invested into, a detailed assessment on
costing these policies as well as potential opposition from associations should be carried out and
managed appropriately. Once these policies are implemented (with strong involvement from MOH,
MOES, MOF etc.), they need to be accompanied by evidence generation from the start to monitor
and determine their effectiveness.

Annex 4: Methodology
2.1.       Study site

59.     To better understand the retention policies for health workers in rural areas and how it is
implemented, the study selected are five public health institutes from the central, northern,
southern part of the country, which admit students with rural backgrounds. These were the
University of Public Health Science (UHS), Public Health Colleges in Luangprabang, Champasak, and
Savannakhet Provinces, and the Nursing School in Vientiane Province.

2.2.       Study Design

60.      This study analyzed Government policies for a deeper understanding of health workforce
retention and attraction legislation, policies, strategies, regulations and official documents endorsed
by MOH and concerned ministries such as MOHA, and MOES. It looked at the implementation of
these documents to identify strengths and weaknesses, pros and cons, constraints and challenges to
their implementation, and explored policy implications with a view to increase the effectiveness of
their implementation in order to increase the number of qualified health workforce in rural and
underserved areas nationwide. This study applied a triangular research method to provide
comprehensive and scientific evidence to Lao MOH (Figure 2), which included document review,
qualitative research, and quantitative research as follows:

Method 1:        A document review was carried out by the research team and assigned data
                 collectors. The review focussed on the national policy, strategy, regulation and law,
                 ministerial formulation, department guidelines, and other related grey documents
                 which relate to promoting better access to quality health care in rural and
                 underserved area by increasing the number of qualified health workers. The study
                 applied the WHO health policy and system research method to ensure the highest
                 quality of research findings.

Method 2:        Qualitative research method such as in-depth interviews were applied to interview
                 selected key persons and policy-makers e.g., Directors of Departments under MOH,
                 MOHA, and MOES for a better understanding of how the above-mentioned
                 documents were developed; what is the current situation of their implementation;
                 and focus group discussions of key players such medical and nursing students to
                 confirm if they received proper information about the documents reviewed, and what
                 their perception was towards these documents. A consultative workshop was
                 conducted to share the results of the research to selected key policy makers in the
                 MOH, MOES and MOHA, and to hear their opinions relating to the relevance and
                 applicability of this research for the Lao context.

Method 3:       Quantitative research method: Secondary data analysis was performed, using
                administrative data from all the health institutes and the HRH database of the DOP, to
                describe the current situation of selected policy implementations.

2.3.       Study process

61.      This study consisted of three steps to answer the study objectives ensuring reliability and
validity of the findings aimed at providing scientific evidence to Lao policy makers and to be
comparable with findings from three other countries. Three steps were:

          Step 1: Policy mapping (addressing objective 1). This consisted of a documentary review.
           Investigators visited various government offices in and outside of the MOH to gather



                                                                                                    30
       documents related to health workforce retention and attraction. All documents were copied
       and brought to UHS and/or DTR where the review processes took place. The review was
       based on sixteen recommendations of the WHO to increase access to qualified health
       workforce in underserved areas using an agreed matrix from the AAAH workshop in Bangkok
       (see table 1).

      Step 2: Policy analysis (addressing objective 2). Based on result of the policy mapping, the
       three most relevant policies were selected for the policy analysis. The research team
       members agreed upon the following three documents on health workforce retention and
       attraction for further analyses: (a) Instruction of the MOE on recruitment of student with
       rural backgrounds; (b) Prime-Ministry Decree Number 82/PMO on compulsory service in
       rural area; and (c) Prime-Minister Decree Number 468/PMO on provision of financial
       incentive for civil servants. In addition to these documents, the research team also included
       a newly endorsed ministerial regulation of MOH, Number 103/MOH on compulsory service
       in rural area among new graduates, which has been enforced and implemented since 2012,
       for our deep analysis.

      Step 3: Policy recommendations (addressing objective 3). A consultative workshop with all
       relevant stakeholders such as policy makers, health professional council representatives,
       international partners, etc., was conducted to solicit recommendations given the results of
       the in-depth assessment of three selected rural retention policies plus one. Such active
       engagement by policy makers ensures ownership and policy actions to improve policies and
       effectiveness of interventions.

62.     A qualitative method was applied using the three selected policies plus one by applying the
policy analysis tool (Gilson 2012; Gilson, Erasmus et al. 2012), reviews of literature, in-depth
interviews of KIs and focus group discussions of medical and public health students. These were
convened to investigate the following questions:

      Assess the problem stream: why these policies emerged?
      Assess the policy formulation processes: how different actors (MOH, MOES, MOF, MOHA),
       medical and nursing schools, politicians, civil society, health professional councils, health
       professional associations, academia, student bodies, public and private healthcare
       providers), and in what context, exert their powers, defending their positions (either
       supportive or defensive) and influencing the final policy decision. Were the affected
       beneficiaries consulted and engaged in the policy formulation?
      Analyze the policy contents: did the intervention respond to the problem stream and was it
       guided by evidence? Is it feasible (political, financial, social, programmatic), acceptable by all
       stakeholders in particular the front line health workers, and effective enough in solving the
       identified problems? How did the policy evolve over-time?
      Analyze implementation: how policies were implemented, the scope (national/sub-national)
       which is responsible for implementation--are they credible, equipped and capable to
       implement the policy? Are policy communications effective? Are interventions relevant to
       health workers? Were all stakeholders engaged to ensure acceptability? Were resources
       secured and adequate to support implementation? Are there adequate and continued
       political and financial commitments? Is the M&E system put in place? What are the
       indicators for measuring progresses and achievement against what baseline data? What was
       the resistance and enabling factors by different actors? Any evaluation research conducted
       to guide policy reorientation?
      Outcome assessment: what are the main outcomes of implementation? Are outcomes in
       line with the objectives and targets? Any deviation from the original plan and what are the
       unintended outcomes? What progress indicators were used e.g. increased number of health
       workers staying in rural areas, mean duration (in years) of stay in a rural post, turnover rates,


                                                                                                      31
         rate of unfilled post, density of health workers in rural and rural areas; job satisfaction of
         rural health workers, patient satisfaction in remote and rural areas, coverage of health
         services.

63.     The quantitative method using secondary data analysis was also used to analyze the current
situation of three selected policies implementation to accomplish findings from qualitative method
explained earlier.


2.4.      Study participants:

64.     To achieve the study’s objectives a wide range of KIs, from policy-making level down to
medical, nursing and midwife students, were identified and invited to participate in the study. At the
beginning of this research design process, the research team aimed to recruit approximately 126 KIs,
of which 41 were policy makers, 25 were medical educators from University of Health Science and 8
provincial colleges and schools, and 60 medical, nursing and midwife students with rural
backgrounds.

2.5.      Study implementation:

Study preparation:

65.     Research proposal, data collection matrix and questionnaires were translated from English
into Lao language by the researchers. A set of proposals was consequently submitted to the MOH for
its approval. The research team obtained official approval from the Health Minister on 26 April 2013
to implement this research.

66.    The translated research proposal, data collection matrix and questionnaires were circulated
among researchers to double check its consistency of translation and wording. Minor wording
changes were made ensuring that it was understandable for data collectors.

67.     Data collection teams were formed in tandem with the submission of the research proposal
to the MOH. Data collectors were trained subsequently on research protocol, data collection matrix
and questionnaires.

68.      A set of proposals was again submitted to the National Ethic Committee for Health Research,
and the National Institute of Public Health for ethical clearance. The research team gained the
ethical clearance on 8 May 2013.

Data collection:

69.       Data collection is divided into three phases as follow:

      Documentary reviews: Research assistants visited all departments and centers under MOH,
       and MOHA from 8 May to 31 May 2013 to initially screen existing official documents related to
       retention and attraction of civil servants, including health workers, in rural areas. All identified
       documents were copied and brought back to the DOP, and UHS where documentary reviews by
       investigators took place.

      In-depth interviews: In-depth interviews of KIs was carried out between 10 and 21 February
       2014. Invitations and in-depth interview questionnaires were sent to selected KIs prior to
       making an appointment to conduct the actual survey. According to our original plan, 59
       invitations for an appointment were sent out to KIs from MOH, UHS, directors of provincial


                                                                                                        32
       health office, Directors of Public Health College (Champasak, Savannakhet, Vientiane province
       and Luangprabang) and line-ministries; however only 35 (59.3%) of the KIs were interviewed.

      Focus Group Discussions: These were also conducted at the same time as the in-depth
       interviews of KIs. The focus group discussions of MDs and Nurses was carried at DOP while
       those of midwives was carried out at Champasak Public Health College. Two focus group
       discussions were conducted for each health worker cadre. In total, 6 focus group discussions
       were conducted which included 37 MDs, nurses and midwives.

      Quantitative survey: Two quantitative approaches were applied in this study:
        Questionnaires were sent out to the provincial health offices nationwide by DOP. Provincial
         health personnel completed questionnaires and sent them back to the DOP by the end of
         May 2013. The data obtained was merged with the HRH database of the DOP for further
         analyses.
        The research team obtained data on medical and public student recruitment from 2009 to
         2013 from DOP, UHS and Provincial public health schools.

      Consultative workshop: A workshop was held on 13 March 2014 at Lanxang Hotel in Vientiane
       capital with participation of 25 selected policy-makers from MOH, MOES and MOHA; Directors
       of central hospitals, provincial health offices and provincial hospitals; rector/directors/deans
       from the University of Health Science, and provincial public health colleges and schools; and
       representatives of key development partners. The workshop began with a presentation by the
       research team leader on preliminary results of the study and recommendations, followed by
       questions and answers, and discussion to solicit the realism and applicability of the study’s
       recommendations for the Lao context. This was an informative and participatory workshop
       which fed into finalization of the study’s recommendations.

2.6.      Data analysis

Qualitative

70.     In-depth interviews of KIs were taped where consent was granted and were transcribed in
Lao language within 24 hours after the interviews and then translated into English for analysis and
report writing. One interview assistant attended the interviews and took note of conversion. Focus
group discussions were carried out by one facilitator and an assistant. Conversations during the
focus group discussions were recorded and noted down by the assistant.

71.     Content analysis was applied to identify dominant themes and sub-themes raised by
interviewees. The qualitative data was analyzed based on a matrix agreed to during the AAAH
workshop in Bangkok (see Annex 1 and 2).

72.     Interpretation of the content and themes which emerged and other results of qualitative
analysis were done by consensus among research team members.

Quantitative

73.      The research team analyzed to estimate percentage of annual admission of students with
rural background by total annual admission from all the health institutions using administrative data
from individual institutions. The research team also analyzed to determine percentage of permanent
health staff in central and provincial health departments with rural experience by sending out a data
collection matrix to all concerned departments. The data obtained was merged with the HRH
database of the DOP. Data cleaning and analyses were done in Microsoft Excel for Windows.



                                                                                                    33
2.7.    Ethic consideration

74.     This study was approved for research ethic from the National Ethical Committee for ethics
and permission to conduct this study was obtained from the MOH. Written or verbal inform consent
was obtained from KIs and students before in-depth interviews and focus group discussions,
respectively. Participants were advised that this was an anonymous study and data, especially voice
recordings, would be used for purposes of the study only, and would be deleted after finalization of
report. Participants were also advised of their rights of participation and that they could terminate
or stop an interview at any time if they felt uncomfortable or did not want to continue their
participation.

2.8.    Dissemination of Results and Publication Policy

75.     The deliverable consists of publication in international and national journals, policy briefs
and a dissemination workshop to relevant policy makers. The Alliance will publish a technical report
and present the results on the Alliance website.
