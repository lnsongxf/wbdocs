1.3.1 - IMPROVING WOMEN’S LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION
IMPACT EVALUATION OF NORTHERN AREA REDUCTION OF POVERTY INITIATIVE (NARI) - The
NARI project is the World Bank’s first gender focused project in South Asia. It facilitates access to employment
opportunities in the garment sector for poor and vulnerable women from lagging areas of Bangladesh, through
access to information, technical and life skills training, transitional housing, and other support. The impact evalu-
ation (IE) will assess the project’s impact on the income and socio-economic conditions of the beneficiaries.
Based on this evaluation, the project will be scaled up to include other areas and sectors in Bangladesh.

GENDER ANALYSIS OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (MSME) IN INDIA - This ac-
tivity informs the Bank’s ongoing policy dialogue with the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in
India regarding a potential Bank funded operation led by South Asia’s Finance and Private Sector Develop-
ment Unit. The study is expected to contribute to either a component of this project or to a separate interven-
tion on women and MSMEs in India.

INDIA GENDER AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REPORT - This work is a follow up to the WDR
2012’s report on India. It will examine the factors behind the low labor force participation of women. It will
also identify policies, programs and approaches that could enhance women’s labor force participation. The
work has strong client support from several ministries that look at the impact of women’s labor force participa-
tion on the economy and is expected to inform government policy and discussions on the next Five Year Plan.

SRI LANKA GENDER ASSESSMENT - Though Sri Lanka performs better on gender equality than most
countries in South Asia, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) is keen on addressing the remaining gender
disparities in the country. The study will provide recommendations on narrowing the gender gap in eco-
nomic participation. It examines the opportunities available to both men and women to participate in the
economy, including access to and use of labor, land, financial and product markets. Close attention is being
paid to issues faced by youth in both gender groups. Regional variations in labor force participation due to
the conflict in the North East region of the country will also be taken into account.

SOCIAL OBSERVATORY FOR THE NATIONAL RURAL LIVELIHOODS MISSION - The task aims to
create a new environment for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) within the world’s largest rural women cen-
tered livelihoods program - India’s National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM). The mission is supported by Bank
lending of $500 million. Support from SAGE went towards the setting up a Social Observatory (SO) within the
mission, which is utilizing more scientific techniques for M&E, with increased attention to the processes of
change. The SO will facilitate learning and subsequent changes to the design of the program with a view to
reducing gender inequalities in livelihoods projects. It follows the principle of open data access.

PINK BUSES IN PAKISTAN - This activity aims to improve women’s mobility and security in the city of La-
hore, Pakistan through a study of the women only Pink Buses Scheme. Analytical work including an activity
based survey is being undertaken to understand women’s mobility under the pilot scheme. It will assist Lahore
Transportation Corporation in understanding key issues linked to the feasibility and sustainability of scaling up
the program.

STUDY OF THE WOMEN ONLY BUS SERVICE IN DHAKA - To address the increasing set of issues that
female commuters face, many cities around the world have introduced women only services. These have
included women only rail cars in Tokyo, New York, Sao Paulo, Mumbai, and women only bus service in Mexico
City, Guatemala City, and Lahore. This women only bus service has been introduced before in Dhaka but
the service was stopped as it was not financially viable. The study addresses the issues faced by women in
accessing transport and the sustainability of the women only bus service.




                                                                                                           9
1.3.2 - SOCIAL INCLUSION AND GENDER RELATIONS
SOUTH ASIA YOUTH AND GENDER ACTIVITY MAPPING - The activity provides a strategic focus to
the World Bank’s work on youth issues in South Asia, specifically on the vulnerabilities and needs of adoles-
cent girls and young women. It builds and disseminates knowledge on youth and gender issues in the region,
and aims to provide recommendations for youth and gender programming in SAR

YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND GENDER IN THE MALDIVES - There is little information at present on the
overall status of male and female youth in the Maldives and the gender issues they face. This study will increase
the understanding of positive youth behaviors that lead to productive adulthoods in the Maldives through
youth mapping exercises and interviews undertaken by youth of other youth and organizers of youth programs.

BUILDING CAPACITY FOR GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN BANGLADESH - The task facilitates gen-
der mainstreaming within the Ministry of Housing and Public Works. It builds the capacity of the ministry to
address gender differences within housing programs. It will contribute to the design of a Bank funded project
to improve the housing conditions of women in urban slums.

MEN, MASCULINITY AND DEVELOPMENT IN SAR - The Bank is exploring options for supporting a re-
gional initiative aimed at understanding men’s attitudes and practices, as well as women’s opinions of men’s
roles and practices, on a variety of topics related to gender equality. The study is also exploring how migra-
tion, unemployment and changes in the labor market impact the perceptions of masculinity in the region.
More details are available in the Highlight box.

MOVING TO A MALE INCLUSIVE GENDER APPROACH IN SAR (JIT) - This activity will create video/
photo blogs and presentations on a male inclusive approach to gender equality that will contribute to a radi-
cal shift in on how gender is addressed by the Bank. It will strengthen the approach to gender equality and
empowerment in Bank’s operational work.



1.3.3 - GENDER AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
BHUTAN GENDER POLICY NOTE - Bhutan fares better on many gender related parameters than most
South Asian countries however disparities remain in economic and political participation by women. The policy
note will provide recommendations to support the economic and political empowerment of women in Bhutan,
with a focus on improving school enrollment. Gender issues in Bhutan are unique and, therefore, provide an
opportunity for innovative analysis. Bhutan is one of the few South Asian countries where men and women are
relatively equal and the study could offer an overall positive story on gender equality from the region.

SAGE SEMINAR SERIES - A SAGE seminar series has been organized to disseminate the results and out-
comes from tasks funded, within the Bank. The seminar series has included presentations on the Social Obser-
vatory for the NLRM, and the study on Youth and Development in the Maldives among others.

         HIGHLIGHT
MASCULINITY AND DEVELOPMENT
‘Gender’ deals with more than women’s issues. Expanding our understanding of male
gender roles can provide a more nuanced perspective on gender relations and how
they impact society and economic development. Though much is talked about regard-
ing this issue it has not been examined in any depth. The SAGE funded study on Mas-
culinity and Development in South Asia will narrow this analytical gap. It will build upon
an earlier study done in partnership with students of George Washington University in
the US. It will explore how migration, unemployment and changes in the labor market
impact the perceptions of masculinity in the region. It also looks at the impact of mas-
culinity and femininity on exposure to risk factors and adoption of risky behaviors, for
example, dropping out of school, drug consumption, and unprotected sex. It examines
how gender based violence is connected to constructions of masculinity. By focusing on
examples of how ‘masculinity’ is defined and the challenge of what it means to be male
in a variety of contexts in contemporary South Asia. The activity highlights the diverse
ways in which boys and men are both challenging and perpetuating gender norms,
and impacting South Asia’s performance on gender equality indicators. The report,
will address the impact of masculinity on development outcomes, including the well-
being of males, females and children within a household and at the community level.

    SUMMARY
1.4.1 - DISBURSEMENTS & COMMITMENTS
All but $300,000 of the AUD 2 million available under the SAGE window has been allocated to 14 activities.
Disbursement and commitments which indicates funds under contracts are indicated in Figure 1. The window
is disbursing well with 56.10% of total allocations either committed or disbursed. Since rounds are funded at
different times it is useful to look at these figures by each round. In Round 1, 65.57% of the funds allocated
have been committed and disbursed. The figure for the more recent Round 2 is 41.73%.

1.5 PRELIMINARY
    RESULTS
1.5.1 - LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION
SOCIAL OBSERVATORY FOR THE NATIONAL RURAL LIVELIHOODS MISSION - A Social Observa-
tory (SO) has been created within the NRLM in India. It has led to increased attention on the processes of
change, rather than just outcomes. Livelihoods projects are now being assessed and monitored by mea-
suring their impact on a multi-dimensional set of indicators; income, nutrition, health, empowerment, and
agency. An international workshop is planned for June 2013 to disseminate the findings more widely.

SRI LANKA GENDER ASSESSMENT - The draft of the final report has been completed. Recommenda-
tions based on the study include the importance of school and community based outreach campaigns to
change perceptions of education and types of jobs for men and women. The assessment also emphasizes
the importance of improving women’s access to job information and child care, especially for the jobs within
the intermediate and services sectors, and of addressing biases against leaving children with child care pro-
fessionals instead of family members. Workshops to share the findings of the report will be organized shortly.

INDIA GENDER REPORT - Papers commissioned for the study to ascertain the factors leading to women’s
continued low participation in the labor force vis-à-vis men in India, and to identify policies, programs and
approaches that could contribute to enhancing women’s labor force participation have been completed
and reviewed. As a result of this work, an Inter- Ministerial Task Force has been set up by the National Mission
for the Empowerment of Women, Government of India. The report will be finalized and disseminated shortly.

1.5.2 - SOCIAL INCLUSION AND GENDER RELATIONS
SOUTH ASIA YOUTH AND GENDER MAPPING - This activity has been completed. A number of com-
munication materials have been developed. A phase II activity is looking at youth and ICT as an effective way
of reaching youth in South Asia. The region has one of the fastest growing cell phone markets in the world.



1.5.3 - GENDER AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
BHUTAN GENDER POLICY NOTE - The report has been completed. However dissemination is awaiting
the outcome of elections in Bhutan. A workshop to disseminate the findings will be held after August 2013
when a new government is in place. The work will feed into Bhutan next Five Year Plan.
