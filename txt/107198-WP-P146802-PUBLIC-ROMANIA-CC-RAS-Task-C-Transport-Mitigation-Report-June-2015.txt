                                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction

The Europe 2020 Strategy and the legislative package from the European Commission provide EU
member states a framework and means for moving towards a greener and more competitive low carbon
economy that makes efficient use of resources and is resilient to climate risk. As a member state of the
EU, the Government of Romania is committed to fighting climate change and pursuing a low carbon
development. The integration of both mitigation and adaptation actions into Romania’s national policies,
programs, and strategies will be a critical step in shifting its development path towards a climate resilient,
low carbon and green economy.

This Report has been prepared by the World Bank for the Government of Romania, as part of an Advisory
Services program on climate change and low carbon green growth. This component assists the
Government of Romania in identifying climate change action mitigation actions through extensive
greenhouse gas (GHG) modelling work. The objective under Task C is to model mitigation scenarios up
to 2050 for the transport sector—Business as Usual, Green, and Super Green Scenario—through the
development of a strategic model and to develop a marginal abatement cost (MAC) analysis of mitigation
measures proposed, measured in terms of marginal abatement cost or net present value of costs and benefits
per ton of GHG abated. The outputs are an Excel based Strategic Mitigation Model and this Report.

This Report’s scope was to consider appropriate Government policy interventions and scenarios up to
2050 that would help minimize GHG emissions from the transport sector in a cost-effective way. To do
that, the following tasks were undertaken:

           Development of an agile, flexible spreadsheet-based Strategic Mitigation Model that draws
            on the best available data sources and emission relationships appropriate to Romania;
           Definition of a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario for Romania, incorporating data from the
            GTMP, national data sources and other international trends;
           Identification of a range of policy interventions that show potential for emission reduction and
            complement and enhance some of the planned GTMP major infrastructure interventions;
           Use of the Strategic Mitigation Model to test the potential transport demand impacts and the
            consequent GHG emission impacts of all interventions versus the Business-as-Usual scenario;
           Preparation of broad cost estimates for the various interventions, drawing on international
            experience, but taking account of Romanian costs relative to international levels;
           Preparation of a marginal abatement cost curve, taking into account government costs
            associated with the modelled interventions; and

           Emission reduction potential, likely costs and broader implementation issues to define a
            preferred future Green Scenario that groups together the most promising interventions, as well
            as the development of a more ambitious Super Green Scenario.
Consideration of institutional arrangements for implementation of individual interventions and alternative
financing arrangements for proposed investments were outside of the scope of this study.

GHG emissions generated from transport are among the fastest growing in Europe, posing a challenge in
creating a low-carbon future, as economic development has been paralleled with a modal share
increasingly dominated by roads. This modal shift has been driven by a number of factors, including
growing affluence, suburbanization, and falling land use densities in urban areas, which have translated
into more widespread vehicle ownership, increasing trip numbers and lengths, while reducing the financial
viability of public transport and non-motorized transport. On the freight transport front, while a number
of East European countries had relatively high rates of rail modal share, these have generally been
declining and have been approaching EU levels. Thus, Eastern European countries are moving toward EU
motorization rates for passenger transport—with much higher GHG growth than in the EU-28, although
overall levels remain lower—while trucks are making significant inroads vis-à-vis rail. Without any
changes to transport policy, these trends in Eastern Europe, and in Romania, are likely to continue unabated
in the next decades.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Transport in Romania

Figure ES1 shows the annual GHG emissions from the domestic transport sector in Romania and how it
has grown since 1990. The steady upward trend since the turn of the century is particularly noteworthy.
Figure ES2 shows how GHG emissions from transport have grown in Romania since 1990 in comparison
with the EU-28, growing significantly faster than the EU average. As a percentage of total GHG emissions
across all sectors, Romanian transport accounts for 12.7 percent (2012). While this is less than the EU’s
average of 19.7 percent, it is rising more quickly, driven in part by the declining modal share of rail and
increased motorization. Road transport is the source of the majority of GHG emissions in the transport
sector (93 percent of domestic transport emissions), similar to the EU-28 average.

Although car mode share in Romania is at a similar level to the EU average, the motorization (or car
ownership) rate in Romania is the lowest in the EU at 224 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2012, but has grown
significantly in recent years, up from 152 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2006 (Figure ES3). Experience
across the world suggests that as the Romanian economy grows, it will continue to grow in future. Without
intervention to provide better transport alternatives and encourage their use, as car ownership grows, car
use is also likely to grow. The reasons for the decline in rail passengers are linked to the decaying state of
the Romanian railway system.

Mitigation Challenges


In a do nothing scenario, Romania’s GHG emissions from transport are set to continue growing rapidly
compared to the EU, particularly if its motorization rates converges to the EU average. The challenges for
mitigating GHG in the transport sector are significant. This is illustrated by the recent European
Environment Agency (EEA) report on the State of the European Environment which highlights the fact
that ‘transport, including emissions from international transport, is the only EU sector to have increased
its GHG emissions since 1990’.1

A major overall challenge is decoupling economic growth from transport emissions. Figure Es4 presents
real GDP growth and GHG emissions from the transport sector in Romania over 2000-2012, suggesting

that they move in tandem, with an inflexion in 2009 when real GDP started growing more rapidly than
transported related GHG emissions. Over the 2000-2012 period, GHG emissions rose by 54 percent, while
real GDP rose by 55 percent. As noted in the EEA report, European demand for transport has increased in
line with GDP in recent years, reflecting the close interdependence of transport and economic
development. To mitigate GHG emissions, growth in demand needs to be either limited or managed in
some way or targeted on low emission travel modes, coupled with reducing GHG rates (g/km emitted)
from vehicles. The EEA report recognizes that while new engine technologies will help mitigate GHG, a
more holistic approach is required. This includes measures to encourage change in people’s travel behavior
and choices (as well as technological measures), which is in line with the broad range of policy
interventions examined in this Report.

Increasing motorization (car ownership) is a particular issue for the transport sector in Romania. Although
car mode share in Romania is at a similar level to the EU average, the motorization (or car ownership) rate
in Romania is the lowest in the EU at 224 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2012, having grown significantly
in recent years from 152 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2006. Experience across the world suggests that as
the Romanian economy grows, the motorization rate will continue to grow in future. Without intervention
to provide better transport alternatives and encourage their use, as car ownership grows, car use is also
likely to grow. The General Transport Master Plan projects rapid growth in car ownership, with the
motorization rate exceeding 350 cars per 1,000 inhabitants by 2030, which would represent an increase in
excess of 50 percent increase over 2012-2030.

Mitigation Modelling Approach

The overall objective of the transport mitigation modelling work was to develop a Green Scenario and an
associated Action Plan that would guide the Romanian Government in their decisions on how best to invest
in transport-related interventions that would contribute to climate change mitigation. The recommended
scenario would take account of GHG benefit, as modelled in the study, and cost to the Government of
                                                                iv
                                                       

                                                       

Romania of alternative interventions, as well as qualitative consideration of co-benefits and
implementation issues. A second, more ambitious Super Green Scenario is also developed, in order to
assess additional possible efforts, although measures.

The strategic mitigation model that has been developed for Romania, the Transport Strategic Emission
Prediction Tool (TRANSEPT) includes four modules which produce the input matrices for the emissions
engine which calculates the GHG emissions. The four modules are: (a) transport demand; (b) vehicle stock;
(c) vehicle and driving efficiency; and (d) fuel consumption. Only the direct impact on transport fleet,
vehicle activity and energy intensity have been modelled. Each module takes a number of baseline datasets
as input and applies the effect of relevant policy interventions to them. The adjusted datasets are then input
to the emissions engine which calculates the resulting GHG emissions. The process is outlined in Figure
ES5. The TRANSEPT tool has the following main dimensions:

           It takes account of both direct (tailpipe) and indirect emissions.
           It covers road, rail, waterborne and air travel modes.
           Modes are split into passenger and freight transport.
           Transport activity and consequent emissions are split by urban / non-urban / highway
            locations.
           Different powertrain and fuel options are modelled as appropriate to each mode.
           Time horizons modelled are 2011 (base year), 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045,
            2050.
The technical detail of the model including the source input data and basis for projections is included in
Annex 1. The assessment of potential interventions to reduce GHG emissions from the transport sector
were divided into five broad categories: (a) pricing instruments; (b) technology; (c) regulatory; and (d)
operational efficiency; and (e) urban planning, behavioral change, and low carbon infrastructure
investment. Modelling the impact of the various interventions makes use of the most relevant and
appropriate case study evidence and research literature from across the EU, applied to Romanian specific
baseline data in relation to vehicle fleet and transport activity. Where Romania specific evidence was
available, for example, from the sensitivity testing using the National Transport Model, this was compared
against the values selected from the literature review.

Abatement Potential of Alternative Mitigation Interventions

The range of potential interventions have been defined and costed and assessed in terms of carbon
abatement potential. The measures have been modelled individually to assess their relative mitigation
potential and value for money in terms of investment against estimated abatement potential. These metrics
sit alongside wider qualitative co-benefits to inform the ranking of those most appropriate for inclusion
within the Green Scenario. The interventions performing best in the multi criteria appraisal were included
in the Green Scenario, with explanation of why each should be pursued. An explanation of why the other
options were not selected for adoption. However, all interventions have been included in the Super Green
Scenario in order to assess an upper bound for slow GHG emission growth from the transport sector. No
specific pre-defined GHG saving targets were used to constrain the choice of interventions, as a bottom-
up approach was adopted. The identified measures have been drawn from a range of policy categories
including: (a) pricing instruments; (b) technology; (c) regulatory; (d) operational efficiency; and (e)
behavioral change and urban investments (Table ES1 and Table ES2).

Figure ES6 provide a summary of the cumulative abatement results for each intervention over 2015-2050,
while the table below provides a breakdown of the abatement potential per intervention in three different
time periods. The measures which have the potential to deliver the greatest absolute carbon savings over
the course of the modelled period are as follows: (a) the lowering of speed limits (speed restrictions); (b)
increasing the fuel tax (as a substitute to more sophisticated road user charging); (c) the implementation

campaigns targeted at private car users and training programs focused on the freight and public transport
sector.

Having identified the abatement potential for each of the interventions modelled, consideration needs to
be given to the most effective areas of investment to achieve emission reduction. Marginal abatement cost
                                                                       x
                                                               

                                                               

(MAC) analysis provides a framework within which to guide investment decisions, identifying the levels
of abatement possible and at what level of investment cost. A key component of the MAC analysis is the
cost of each intervention, in terms both of capital cost and ongoing operational and maintenance costs.
The implementation and ongoing costs of delivering the identified schemes have been estimated using
case study evidence and a variety of sources of estimated costs applied to the Romanian context. The
scope of the estimated costs are limited to those borne directly by the Government of Romania in terms of
capital investment costs and ongoing operational and maintenance costs. The potential costs or operating
cost savings borne by the private sector are not estimated or included within the MAC analysis. The basis
for the cost estimation has been set out for each intervention in the preceding chapter.2 Table ES3
summarizes the mitigation potential of each intervention against scheme value for money based on the
cost per ton of carbon abated. A summary of the qualitative assessment of the wider societal impacts and
deliverability issues (barriers to implementation) is also presented where relevant. The MAC can be found
in Figure ES7.

Development of the Green Scenario


The decision on which interventions to include in the Green Scenario were derived from a multi-criteria
analysis that took into account the following: (a) scheme investment cost to the government; (b) cumulative
                                                            
2Costs—capital and operational and maintenance costs—are discounted at a discount rate of 4 percent to provide the net present
value (NPV). The abatement cost is hence cost (NPV) divided by total undiscounted cumulative carbon reduction over 2015-
2050. The choice was made not to discount carbon savings as the resulting value is an abstract figure which cannot be directly
compared back to any graph and would not be easily cross-compared to other literature evidence of abatement costs.

emission savings; (c) carbon reduction cost effectiveness; (d) deliverability and economic important; and
(e) wider benefits. The wider benefits considered within the multi-criteria appraisal included local air
quality, decongestion, noise, safety, equity and health benefits. These were considered at a qualitative
level, and were not assigned a quantitative or monetary value. In order to achieve significant levels of
carbon abatement, two schemes stand out above others. The implementation of speed restrictions is
demonstrated to have significant potential to reduce vehicle emissions levels. Fuel taxation also can make
a significant contribution to reducing emissions, through a combination of market forces acting to reduce
the demand for travel and also in influencing purchasing decisions towards more efficient vehicles. Both
of these policies have significant wider implications for the economy, with costs in terms of increased
journey times in the case of speed restrictions and economic burden of higher taxation. In order to make
meaningful reductions in carbon emissions in the transport sector, it is likely that at least one of these
measures be adopted in some form. The wider costs and benefits will play an important role in determining
the most appropriate, but ultimately it is likely that the political acceptability of one or other measure
ultimately determines which may be more politically palatable.

In the near term, whilst politically challenging and economically burdensome in particularly on the lower
income households, applying increases in fuel taxation is more practicable. The requirements to change
speed restrictions, with the associated awareness campaigns and need for reminder signage and
enforcement would involve greater upheaval. It is therefore recommended that fuel taxation be considered
as a key tool in achieving significant carbon abatement over the period of the Action Plan and Strategy.
Of the ‘second tier’ intervention measures which may contribute valuable abatement to carbon emissions
in absolute terms, the new vehicle registration tax is identified as a tool which can bring significant carbon
savings through the influencing of purchasing decisions. Again, this measure has the potential to create
adverse political pressure, even whilst remaining fiscally neutral, and may have negative equity
implications in the increased taxation of older and less efficient vehicles. However, as seen in countries
across Europe, influencing the make-up of the vehicle fleet at point of purchase is an effective means of
encouraging evolution towards a lower emitting vehicle stock. The benefits of this continue to be realised
over time, and represent a particularly important opportunity in the face of a high projected growth rate in
motorisation levels and car ownership.

Eco-driving programs also offer significant potential for the reduction in vehicle emissions, and unlike the
previous interventions, there are no significant barriers to implementation or adverse impacts. In fact, eco-
driving offers significant potential wider benefits in the form of cost savings for motorists and enhanced
environmental and safety benefits. Investment costs will vary according to the nature of the program
implemented, but studies have highlighted the measures as performing strongly in terms of both overall
impacts and value for money.

The following interventions perform strongly in value for money terms and should also be considered for
adoption within the action plan, and as a feature of the Green Scenario.

         Smarter choices programs combined with investment in walking and cycling infrastructure have
          been demonstrated to lead to modal shift, achieving not only a reduction in emissions levels but
          also significant wider benefits including health and wellbeing, and decongestion. In cost-benefit
          analysis, these schemes typically perform strongly, with cost-benefit ratios in excess of 20 by
          comparison with highway and public transport schemes in the low single figures. This analysis
                                                          xiii
                                                      

                                                      

        demonstrates that with concerted and sustained investment over the strategy period, emissions
        savings realized at a reasonable level of cost effectiveness.

       Parking pricing is a further market based measure which offers the potential for emissions
        savings with a high level of cost effectiveness. Indeed, the measure would be expected to offer a
        stream of revenue which could facilitate some of the investment measures highlighted above.
        Parking pricing, in conjunction with tightened parking regulation and enforcement, may be
        considered to be a more cost effective more readily implementable solution to in town congestion
        instead of urban congestion charging and most European cities are following this strategy in
        preference to congestion charging; and

       Air travel taxation presents a mechanism for exerting some control over the growing demand for
        air travel at the margins, and also offers a revenue stream which may be put to useful purpose.
        The implications for the economy need to be considered, but there is are potentially positive equity
        impacts in what may be expected to be a strongly progressive form of taxation.

Based on the analysis of the abatement potential of the identified measures and on the results of wider
assessment, the following measures are proposed for consideration within the Action Plan period under
the Green Scenario:

           Fuel Price Taxation Increase
           New Vehicle Registration Tax
           Eco-Driving Program
           Smarter Choices/Personal Travel Planning Programs
           Investment in Walking and Cycling Infrastructure
           Parking Pricing
           Air Travel Taxation


Of the above measures, the market based policies where the taxation mechanisms already in place require
no significant capital investment. The combined undiscounted capital investment of the above
infrastructure dependent measures totals Euro 126 million over the timeframe of the Strategy under the
Green Scenario, but rise sharply for the Super Green Scenario (Table ES4). For the Green Scenario, Euro
93 million of investment is profiled to fall within the period of the Action Plan, with ongoing investment
in walking and cycling measures extending beyond 2022, based on a ten year investment profile. The
mitigation impact of the combined bundle of interventions included within the Green Scenario is presented
in Figure ES8, together with the mitigation potential of the Super Green Scenario. Note that the impact of
the bundle of measures is not identical to the sum of the individual measures due to the inter-relationship
between certain policies.

The remaining interventions modelled as part of the study have not been considered suitable for inclusion
within the Green Scenario, reflecting either the lower value for money based on the MAC analysis, or
deliverability challenges. Non-inclusion within the Green Scenario does not however mean that the
schemes have no value or that these should not be considered for implementation in Romania based on
wider appraisal criteria such as economic impact or local air quality. The high costs of the Super Scenario
are driven by the high cost of urban congestion charging scheme, both in terms of initial investment and
operating and maintenance costs.

The promotion of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) has a place within government policy, and
indeed incentives are currently offered for the purchase of low emitting vehicles both in terms of direct
subsidy and as an additional stackable incentive under the existing scrappage scheme. Take-up of electric
or plug-in electric vehicles to date has been low, which is likely to be a reflection of the limited existing
infrastructure for such vehicles. Large scale investment in charging infrastructure would have the potential
to increase take-up. However, this infrastructure has been seen to come at high cost, based on existing
technology and the current commercial suppliers operating within this market. The technology is evolving
rapidly, and already exposing mis-allocation of investment based on the approaches adopted by the
countries early to provide supporting infrastructure. Equally, the marketplace is changing, and new
business models relating to the provision of charging infrastructure are being developed, whether by
vehicle manufacturers or by private suppliers identifying commercial potential. As such, it is considered
that the high level of investment required to hasten the implementation of supporting infrastructure does
not represent best value for money or lead to sufficient emissions reduction savings or wider benefits to
merit immediate consideration.

Equally, whilst target setting relating to the acquisition of ULEVs within the public sector fleet and the
public transport fleet may be considered laudable as a means of promoting and raising awareness about
the technology, the cost of the new technology remains high by comparison with the emissions savings
achieved, and the technological barriers to effective integration within the fleets are also notable in the
near term. Speed restrictions have been rejected in preference to higher fuel duties due to the
implementation difficulties, the economic impact and the lack of revenue generated by such a measure.
                                                                        xv
                                                       

                                                       

Low Emission Zones are demonstrated to have carbon saving potential, although the driving force behind
implementation of such policies is typically local air quality. With its very poor air quality standards,
Bucharest would potentially benefit most significantly from such a measure, and the policy should be
considered within this context. However, with high implementation and operating costs, technological
and enforcement barriers and potential political resistance, the pursuing of such a policy in the
short/medium term is not considered cost effective as a means of carbon emissions saving. 
 

Impact of Measures on GHG Emissions from the Transport Sector


To demonstrate the scale of mitigation achievable under a high intervention or Super Green scenario, the
Green Scenario policies as well as policies which were not selected for inclusion within the Green
Scenario, but which nevertheless provide GHG emission saving potential amongst wider benefits have
been included. The Super Green Scenario therefore represents an all policy modelled scenario. The scale
of abatement potential achievable in the Super Green Scenario by comparison with the Green Scenario
and the BAU scenario is presented in Figure ES8.

Under the BAU scenario emissions grow by 34 percent over 2015-2050, while under the Green Scenario
emissions growth slows to 24 percent and under the Super Green Scenario growth slows to 17 percent. In
all cases GHG emissions from the transport sector rise. These results are in line with many studies which
suggest that reducing GHG emissions—as opposed to reducing GHG emission growth rate—is difficult
in the transport sector. In order to reach a low emission scenario in 2050 Romania’s transport sector has
to have close to zero emissions, which will need large changes in behavior and technology. However, this
growth in GHG emissions has to be seen in the context of a growing real economy. Figure ES9 reveals
that under a Green Scenario GHG emissions from transport are projected to grow more slowly than the
real economy.

                                      1    INTRODUCTION

1.1    Introduction

1.     The Europe 2020 Strategy and the legislative package from the European Commission provide
European Union (EU) member states a framework and means for moving towards a greener and more
competitive low carbon economy that makes efficient use of resources and is resilient to climate risk. The
European Council further determined in February 2013 that the Multiannual Financial Framework will
mainstream climate objectives. As a member state of the EU, the Government of Romania is committed
to fighting climate change and pursuing a low carbon development. The integration of both mitigation and
adaptation actions into Romania’s national policies, programs, and strategies will be a critical step in
shifting its development path towards a climate resilient, low carbon and green economy.

2.      In this context, the Government of Romania has requested the World Bank to provide Advisory
Services on climate change, including operationalizing its national climate change strategy and action plan,
identifying and integrating climate-related actions in new Operational Programs, building a solid analytical
base for impact assessment and climate-related decision making, and enhancing climate-friendly practices
and monitoring system. The Program development objective is to assist the Government of Romania to:
(i) develop a comprehensive national climate change and low carbon development strategy and action
plan; (ii) integrate associated climate-related actions into the 2014-2020 EU-funded Operational Programs;
(iii) develop the institutional tools necessary to inform climate change policies and monitor their economic
and environmental impacts; and (iv) identify future carbon trading opportunities.

3.     This Report is a deliverable under Component C of the Advisory Services, Support to the Recipient
to build strong and sustainable analytical capacity and a suitable knowledge base. This component assists
the Government of Romania in identifying climate change action mitigation actions through extensive
greenhouse gas (GHG) modelling work. The objective under Task C is to model mitigation scenarios up
to 2050 for the transport sector—Business as Usual, Green, and Super Green Scenario—through the
development of a strategic model and to develop a marginal abatement cost analysis of mitigation measures
proposed, measured in terms of marginal abatement cost or net present value of costs and benefits per ton
of GHG abated. The outputs are an Excel based Strategic Mitigation Model and this Report.

4.     The work presented in this Report builds on the Transport Rapid Assessment Report, which was a
deliverable under the Advisory Services. That report identified promising climate change mitigation and
adaptation actions for consideration for the country’s 2014-2020 Operational Programs that are supported
by European Union funding. These were based on a qualitative assessment drawing on international
evidence of potential effectiveness and consideration of applicability in the local Romanian context. This

Report, and associated model, is also intended to complement the National Transport Model (NTM)
developed for General Transport Master Plan (GTMP) for Romania.3

5.    The timeframe under consideration in this study extends beyond that of the Transport Rapid
Assessment Report (2014-2022) and that of the NTM (2012-2030). This Report’s scope was to consider
appropriate Government policy interventions and scenarios up to 2050 that would help minimize GHG
emissions from the transport sector in a cost-effective way. To do that, the following tasks were
undertaken:

                     Development of an agile, flexible spreadsheet-based Strategic Mitigation Model that draws
                      on the best available data sources and emission relationships appropriate to Romania;
                     Definition of a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario for Romania, incorporating data from the
                      GTMP, national data sources and other international trends;
                     Identification of a range of policy interventions that show potential for emission reduction and
                      complement and enhance some of the planned GTMP major infrastructure interventions;
                     Use of the Strategic Mitigation Model to test the potential transport demand impacts and the
                      consequent GHG emission impacts of all interventions versus the Business-as-Usual scenario;
                     Preparation of broad cost estimates for the various interventions, drawing on international
                      experience, but taking account of Romanian costs relative to international levels;
                     Preparation of a marginal abatement cost curve, taking into account government costs
                      associated with the modelled interventions; and
                     Emission reduction potential, likely costs and broader implementation issues to define a
                      preferred future Green Scenario that groups together the most promising interventions, as well
                      as the development of a more ambitious Super Green Scenario.


Consideration of institutional arrangements for implementation of individual interventions and alternative
financing arrangements for proposed investments were outside of the scope of this study. It needs to be
highlighted that the abatement cost analysis only takes account of government investment costs, with no
quantitative assessment of wider socio-economic impacts or benefits. The policy interventions `assessed
are ones which have precedent of adoption within other countries on the basis of their carbon reduction
impacts or wider benefits. The strategic modelling exercise forecasts the potential abatement impact of

                                                            
3 The Ministry of Transport commissioned AECOM Ingeneria SRL in April 2012 to develop a Transport Master Plan for Romania
(GTMP). An integral part of that commission was the development of a NTM for Romania (NTM). The NTM is a ‘classic 4-stage
transport model’ based on a well-known software package, EMME3, similar to those widely used for transport appraisal purposes
around the world. The NTM covers all modes and include inland waterway transport. Constanta Port also has its own freight
demand sub-model within the NTM, because of its national importance as a freight gateway. The GTMP involved extensive
appraisal and modelling of national scale infrastructure investments and complementary policies, including consideration of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission impacts. The GTMP covers a timeframe up to 2030, with delivery of some projects and
interventions continuing for up to five years beyond that date. 

                                                               2
                                                                

                                                                

individual interventions and bundles of interventions through the development of two scenarios. Whilst
abatement cost effectiveness is one element in the ranking and selection of interventions, it is not the only
criteria, and an analysis of qualitative wider impacts have played a role in preferring certain policies above
others, for example fuel taxation over speed limit reductions. Prior to deciding on the adoption of any
proposed intervention or bundle of interventions to reduce GHG emissions from the transport sector,
detailed cost-benefit analysis of likely impacts may be required.


1.2          EU Transport Strategy and Policies


6.     There are several formal documents adopted by the EU that are relevant for Romania’s transport
sector. Key among them is the European Commission White Paper “Roadmap to a Single European
Transport Area: Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system” (White Paper) adopted
in March 2011.4 This document sets targets and directions for transport sector development—EU transport
policy is focused on assuring sustainable mobility for people and goods with a strong emphasis on
contributing to a very ambitious GHG emission targets set for the EU as a whole. More specifically, the
policy and related activities are expected to significantly reduce Europe's dependence on imported fuels
(mostly oil) and cut carbon emissions in transport by 60 percent by 2050 compared to 2005. By 2050, key
transport strategic goals include:

       (a)    no new conventionally-fuelled cars in cities;
       (b)    at least 40 percent use of sustainable low carbon fuels in aviation;
       (c)    at least 40 percent reduction of emissions from maritime transport;
       (d)    at least 50 percent shift of medium distance intercity passenger and freight journeys from road to
              rail and waterborne transport.

7.      Several important interim goals are also included in the White Paper and have to be taken into
account when designing and implementing country specific transport strategies and programs. They are
grouped into three categories: (a) developing and deploying new and sustainable fuels and propulsion
systems; (b) optimizing the performance of multimodal logistic chains, including by making greater use
of more energy-efficient modes; and (c) increasing the efficiency of transport and of infrastructure use
with information systems and market-based incentives. The White Paper also includes 40 concrete
initiatives for the next decade, which are expected to result in a competitive transport system that will
increase mobility, remove major barriers in key areas, and stimulate growth and employment.

8.    In order to ensure complementarity, the country specific strategic and policy directions should be
coherent with the EU-level transport strategy, as well as country-wide specific programs and policy
measures. In practice this means that national-level strategy, programs or Master Plan(s) should
complement and “transpose” the guidelines from the European Commission White Paper and other

important components of EU transport sector policy framework into Romania’s transport sector. In
addition, any regional, local or municipal transport strategies or programs should complement and be fully
coherent with national level policies and EU policies. Therefore, Romania's transport strategy and policies
across all modes of transport and all levels of transport sector public governance (from the national level
down to the local level) should be internally coherent and should complement the EU transport strategy
and policies by “translating” EU level documents into Romania reality. While all EU member states have
to follow the general directions of the EU transport policy, they also have significant flexibility in
designing their own transport strategies, programs and implementation arrangements reflecting country-
specific needs in infrastructure development programs and policy measures. At the same time, country-
level strategies should be aligned with and contribute to EU-wide transport policy goals.

9.     The European Commission undertook a recent assessment of progress towards achieving the Europe
2020 targets, that is to say, to create 20 percent of energy consumption from renewables and increasing
energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020. For the transport sector, Romania needs to make significant
efforts to increase the share of renewable energy used, which has an EU wide target of 10 percent (Figure
2). There is a need for further efforts aimed at reducing the energy intensity of the transport sector, as well
as raising the use of renewable energy powering the transportation system. The low degree of efficiency
of Romania’s transport system was flagged in a recent European Commission assessment of Romania’s
progress with the national reform program.5

1.3          Transport and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

10. Transport is responsible for around a quarter of EU GHG greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions making
it the second biggest greenhouse gas emitting sector after energy. Road transport alone contributes about
one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas. While emissions
from other sectors are generally falling, those from transport have increased 36 percent since 1990. The
EU has policies in place to reduce emissions from a range of modes of transport, including aviation in the
EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and CO2 emissions targets for cars. The majority of domestic
transport-related greenhouse gas emissions are from road transport. However, there are also significant
emissions from the aviation and maritime sectors and these sectors are experiencing the fastest growth in
emissions, meaning that policies to reduce GHG emissions are required for a range of transport modes.

11. GHG emissions generated from transport are among the fastest growing in Europe, posing a
challenge in creating a low-carbon future, as economic development has been paralleled with a modal
share increasingly dominated by roads.7 This modal shift has been driven by a number of factors, including
growing affluence, suburbanization, and falling land use densities in urban areas, which have translated
into more widespread vehicle ownership, increasing trip numbers and lengths, while reducing the financial
viability of public transport and non-motorized transport. On the freight transport front, while a number
of East European countries had relatively high rates of rail modal share, these have generally been
declining and have been approaching EU levels. Thus, Eastern European countries are moving toward EU
motorization rates for passenger transport—with much higher GHG growth than in the EU-28, although
overall levels remain lower—while trucks are making significant inroads vis-à-vis rail. Without any
changes to transport policy, these trends in Eastern Europe, and in Romania, are likely to continue unabated
in the next decades.

12. Transport is a key facilitator of economic well-being worldwide and is likely to continue to grow to
meet continued demand and growing transport needs in Romania. Affordable transport services are crucial
for development. They connect rural areas to sales opportunities and inputs, and nations to export markets
and foreign technologies. Affordability refers not just to consumer prices but also to all costs to society:
the time losses due to congestion, the sometimes dramatic consequences of accidents, the health costs of
local pollution, and the damage that severe climate events inflict on the population. Transport decisions,
particularly those for infrastructure investments, will determine these costs for decades to come, offering
opportunities to countries whose transport systems are not yet mature.
         
13. Recognition of climate implications in transport, unlike other sectors, has had a slow start. One
reason is that the transition to a low-carbon context appears to be more costly than in other sectors. But
broadening the policy agenda to shift behavior changes the cost picture completely, especially measures


                                                            
7In the case of the EU-27 in 2007 CO2 emissions from the transport sector accounted for 25.1 percent of the total, up from 18.1
percent in 1990. Projections from the European Environment Agency estimate that the sector’s emissions will increase by 25
percent over 1990-2020, whereas they are expected to decline from industrial and energy sectors.

to reduce congestion, local air pollution, safety risks, and road safety.8 For example, a recent survey of 25
European cities found that Bucharest was the most polluted, and that air pollution reduced life expectancy
by 2 years, due to high concentration of fine particles, largely due to emissions from diesel engines and
heating.9 Policies to guide demand to low-emission modes and technologies must be part of investment
programs and projects. Such policies can reduce transport demand in the longer run by changing the
economic geography of cities and countries. But that will take close coordination of transport, urban,
environmental, and health policies.
          
14. Decoupling GHG emissions from the transport sector and economic growth or at least lowering the
GHG intensity of future transport growth represents the key challenge and will require departure from the
business as usual policies in the transport sector.10 As noted in the EU’s 2011 White Paper on transport,
the main issue facing the transport sector is how to reduce the system’s dependence on oil without
sacrificing efficiency and compromising mobility—curbing mobility is not an option. The World Bank’s
own climate change strategy for the transport sector adopts a similar approach, arguing that climate change
mitigation in the transport sector has to be seen in a broader context: sustainable transport should limit
GHG emissions from transport and minimize other externalities, without compromising economic
growth.11

15. Concerns about climate change are not likely to be the key driver of transport policies or investment
decisions. Instead local co-benefits—such as reduced traffic congestion and noise, improved air quality
and road safety, or enhanced energy security—are much more likely to drive the development of transport
policies.12 This is the same argument recently put forward in the World Bank’s transport climate change
strategy: attempting to sell measures to reduce GHG by marketing them as policies aimed at other social
costs of transport can be much more attractive to policy-makers, who may not be concerned about climate
change or who cannot gain political traction for policies if they are sold to the public exclusively on a
climate change angle.13 Looking at congestion levels in a city like Bucharest and trends toward increased
motorization, the issue is as much a classic problem of transport and urban planning as it is a GHG
emission problem. Co-benefits can motivate discussions on improved transport policies which are also
GHG friendly policies.

of road accidents involved a vehicle and a pedestrian, suggesting that much can be done in urban areas to make cities safer.

16. The financing of the transport sector needs to be supported by adequate pricing policies, which can
help change existing behavior and thus transport demand, allocate resources more efficiently, and raise
funds to invest in more sustainable forms of transport. This means interlocking discussions about financing
of transport infrastructure with pricing, as adequate financing needs to be supported by sound pricing
policies. However, at present pricing does not reflect the full costs of transport, including costs of negative
externalities, while investments tend to be heavily focused on roads, based on a motorization future which
assumes ever growing vehicle ownership and usage.

1.4          Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Transport in Romania

17. Figure 3 shows the annual GHG emissions from the domestic transport sector in Romania and how
it has grown since 1990.14 The steady upward trend since the turn of the century is particularly noteworthy.
Figure 4 shows how GHG emissions from transport have grown in Romania since 1990 in comparison
with the EU-28, growing significantly faster than the EU average. As a percentage of total GHG emissions
across all sectors, Romanian transport accounts for 12.7 percent (2012). While this is less than the EU’s
average of 19.7 percent, it is rising more quickly, driven in part by the declining modal share of rail (Figure
6) and increased motorization. Road transport is the source of the majority of GHG emissions in the
transport sector (93 percent of domestic transport emissions), similar to the EU-28 average.15

14 This includes emissions from transport (road, rail, inland navigation and domestic aviation) of the GHG regulated by the Kyoto

Protocol. Only three gases are relevant in the context of transport (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) and these have
been aggregated according to their relative global warming potentials. Some of the downward fluctuations of emissions reflects
slowdowns in economic activity.

18. The E-PRTR dataset is a register that provides accessible environmental data from industrial
facilities in European Union Member States and in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Serbia and
Switzerland.16 This data has been analysed to better understand the distribution of emissions between urban
and non-urban areas. The largest 20 cities (with populations over 100,000) were identified and their
respective emissions levels analysed. Bucharest’s road transport emissions, at 833 kt/year is higher than
that of the 19 next largest cities combined (596 kt/year). This is reflective both of the geographic size of
the city, with six communes amalgamated to form the emissions estimate for the city and also the intensity
of activity within the city. Figure 7 displays the emission density within each city by taking account of
physical land area. Bucharest can be seen as having the greatest carbon dioxide emissions density,
approximately 3.5 times that of the second largest city Cluj-Napoca. This would indicate that road
transport activity is most concentrated within Bucharest when compared with other cities and is also
reflective of a city which suffers from greater congestion pressures. As expected, urban areas in general
display a substantially greater emissions density than the national average. The annual road transport CO2
emissions from the 20 largest cities in Romania represent 10 percent of the national total for the road
sector.17


                                                            
16 To date, there are only four countries in the EU that have spatially disaggregated emissions inventories at a national level,

namely, the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. Meanwhile, the European Environment Agency in 2011 released a spatial
emission database as part of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) at a 5km resolution, making it
possible to estimate emissions for cities based on geographic boundaries.16 The EU Framework Seven project Carbon Aware
Travel Choices (CATCH) sets a goal of filling this information gap on city-level CO2 using these data, but there are issues relating
to the use of E-PRTR data. The main one is that the methodology is a top-down approach, based on the spatial disaggregation of
national emissions totals. Secondly, the resolution of the data is at a 5 km level, and CO2 emissions data are distributed into 5 km
by 5 km grids using geospatial-referenced datasets, such as road networks for the road transport emissions. As a result, the CO2
emissions captured through this database at a sub-national level are not as accurate as if a bottom-up approach was adopted. See

17 This reflects the fact that for the exception of Bucharest urban areas are actually relatively low density, covering a large number

of relatively small conurbations, the size of the haulage on Romania’s highway network—Corridor IV is an important transit
corridor--reflecting the importance of the ports and Romania's competitive advantage in haulage.

19. Passenger land transport. Figure 8 shows the modal split for passenger transport (in terms of
percentage of total person-km travelled) between the three main land-based modes of domestic travel –
private car, rail and bus/coach since 2000. This shows a marked rise in mode share of the private cars and
a significant decline in rail mode share (with 2012 rail mode share being approximately one third of the
2000 figure). Bus and coach travel mode share has grown slightly between 2000 and 2011. Figure 9 shows
how the modal split figures for Romania compare with the EU average. Private car mode share is now
approaching the EU average, having been considerably lower at the turn of the millennium. Passenger rail
mode share is lower than the EU average, having been above average in 2000.

20.   Although car mode share in Romania is at a similar level to the EU average, the motorization (or
car ownership) rate in Romania is the lowest in the EU at 224 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2012 (Figure
                                                                                                 9
                                                                             

                                                                             

10), but has grown significantly in recent years, up from 152 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2006 (Figure
11). Experience across the world suggests that as the Romanian economy grows, it will continue to grow
in future. Without intervention to provide better transport alternatives and encourage their use, as car
ownership grows, car use is also likely to grow. The reasons for the decline in rail passengers are linked
to the decaying state of the Romanian railway system. In its Position Paper on Romania in preparation for
the 2014-2020 funding round, the European Commission notes that the railway system is suffering from
underinvestment and poor maintenance, leading to slow and unreliable train services.18

21. Domestic air transport. Air transport is well known as being an intensive emitter of greenhouse
gases19 – although there are a number of industry initiatives to reduce emissions. Domestic air passenger
transport activity (internal within Romania) forms a small part (7 percent) of total passenger movements
through Romanian airports. This is a relatively low level compared to other EU countries (the EU-27
average is 18 percent), although it has increased in recent years, as shown in Error! Not a valid bookmark
self-reference., despite the international economic downturn in 2007. Passengers flying to and from other

1.6          Freight Transport

22. The modal split for freight movements in Romania, in terms of ton-km, and how it has changed in
recent years is shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14.20 This shows a marked fall in rail freight mode share in
recent years, together with a marked rise in road freight mode share. Also notable is the much larger
waterborne freight mode share since 2009.21 The reasons for the decline in rail freight and transfer to road
and inland waterways are likely to be similar to those set out above for passenger transport. Rail freight
mode share is higher than the EU average, in spite of its decline. Inland waterborne freight also has a
much higher mode share than the EU average, while road freight is still below the EU average, despite its
recent growth. It is important to stress that the growth of a clean transport mode, IWT, is an important
development, and that the decline in rail’s modal share has not translated into a one on one rise of road
modal share. Also worth stressing is that the green transport modes (IWT and rail), had in 2010 a modal
share of 51 percent in Romania, compared to only 24 percent for the EU-27.




                                                            
20 Eurostat data at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu. The amount of freight moved by air (which is excluded from the modal split
figures shown above) is very small - 28,523 tons in 2011, up from 19,229 tons in Romania’s first year of EU membership in 2007.
For comparison, some 65 million tons of freight were transported on Romania’s railways in 2007.
21 According to a recent report, the three most important port locations in terms of transshipment volumes on the Danube are

Izmail (Ukraine), Linz (Austria) and Galați (Romania). The seaport of Constanța in Romania is important as it is connected to the
Danube via the Danube-Black Sea Canal and plays an important role as a transhipment gateway to the Black Sea, facilitating trade
with Asia, the Middle East and the Black Sea region. See via Donau (2013), Manual on Danube Navigation. Available at:

1.7          Urban Transport

23. Urban transport forms a major part of overall transport movements in Romania. Some 54 percent
of the country’s population lives in towns and cities, according to the 2011 national census.22. Transport
within urban areas forms a vital part of the functioning of those areas as economic and social entities.
There are nine cities in Romania with populations in excess of 200,000. As well as Bucharest (by far the
largest city at 1.9 million), seven others (Constanta, Craiova, Ploiesti, Iasi, Brasov, Cluj-Napoca and
Timisoara) have been designated as regional “growth poles”. Galati is the other city of over 200,000
people. There are also 11 Romanian cities with populations between 100,000 and 200, 000 and a further
21 towns/cities with populations between 50,000 and 100,000.

24. However, readily available quantitative information on the urban transport situation across Romania
is limited, and consultation and information gathering with all the individual municipal authorities is
beyond the scope of the Transport Mitigation Report. Recent TRACE23 studies assessing the potential for
energy efficiency improvements undertaken by the World Bank in individual cities (Brasov, Cluj, Ploiesti)
have yielded information, and some further information is also available through the Sustainable Energy
Action Plans prepared by various Romanian towns and cities through the European Covenant of Mayors
program.24 In addition, the World Bank held an initial discussion meeting with the Executive Director for
Transport in the Municipality of Bucharest on challenges and ambitions in Bucharest. This section
presents information from these sources which, while not comprehensive, “paints a picture” of the urban
transport scene in Romania. As described later in this Report, eight of the main cities (the seven “growth
poles” plus Bucharest/Ilfov County) will soon be in the process of developing sustainable urban mobility
plans, which will each investigate the urban transport challenges in depth and develop an overarching
strategy for addressing them.

25. As noted in the TRACE study reports, there is limited reliable information on modal split in many
Romanian cities. The Brasov study sums the situation up as follows “Like in other growth poles, the city
lacks information on the transport mode split. The local government does not have information on how
many people use public transport, how many walk, and how many of them commute using their own cars.
City authorities should document information on trips, to understand exactly how many people complete
trips and commute in the city and by what means. Without documenting such information, it is almost
impossible to do proper transport planning.”

26. Traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is reported to be an increasing problem in a number of cities,
as vehicle ownership grows. For example, the rapid review of the situation in the TRACE studies in
Brasov,25 Cluj-Napoca26 and Ploiesti27 all identified traffic congestion as a problem issue. In Bucharest,
congestion is also a significant problem,28 as confirmed in our discussion with the Municipality of
Bucharest. Congestion, with the resulting start-stop nature of the driving cycle it imposes on vehicles,
significantly increases greenhouse and other gaseous emissions from road traffic. Bucharest has a traffic
signal and control system, which is currently in the process of being upgraded. Other cities are also known
to have traffic signal systems – but there is no readily available information on their type or operating
status.
          
27. Parking. With the rapid growth in ownership and use of private vehicles since Romania started the
transition to a market economy, the supply of designated parking spaces in Romania’s cities has come
under pressure and the number is often inadequate to meet demand. This often leads to “informal” parking
arrangements, with vehicles parking on footways, cycle tracks and public spaces as well as on every
available meter of legitimate roadside parking space. As well as causing difficulties for pedestrians,
cyclists and other road users, this also adds to the congestion problems noted above. Management of
parking in some Romanian cities is rudimentary or non-existent, with little or no enforcement of parking
regulations, nor any attempt to use parking restraint (through charging or enforcement of restrictions) as a
demand management tool. In other cities such as Brasov and Cluj-Napoca, new parking management
systems including use of parking meters, mobile phone payment, among others, are however taking hold.

28. Public transport. Public transport in Bucharest includes a metro system (operated by Metrorex), a
tram network, trolley buses, and an extensive bus network (all operated by RATB). RATB is an operating
company overseen by the Municipality of Bucharest, while Metrorex is an operating company under the
auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure. Rail lines also exist which could potentially
provide suburban transport services for commuting.29 In other Romanian cities and towns, public transport

consists of buses, minibuses, trolley buses and trams. The city of Brasov took the decision in 2005 to
abandon its tram line due to the prohibitive cost of upgrading and maintaining it. It now focuses on buses
and trolley buses. Cluj-Napoca has upgraded its tram system, while other cities have similar plans but
lack funding to implement them.
          
29. Although data is hard to obtain, it is understood that public transport patronage in many Romanian
towns and cities is in decline, with a corresponding increase in private traffic levels. For example, in
Ploiesti, public transport patronage fell from 7 million trips per month in 2011 to 6.7 million in 2012.
Ridership is going slightly down30. Some cities are making concerted efforts to reverse this trend through
modernization of infrastructure and services, although lack of funding remains a serious constraint. For
example, the Brasov Municipality and by operating company renewed its bus fleet with 109 new vehicles
in 2006, using an EBRD loan, and purchased a further 15 Euro V diesel buses in 201131. The whole fleet
purchased in 2006 is reaching the end of its life, however, and will need replacement by2015.

30. Taxis, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. There is a plentiful supply of taxis in most Romanian
cities. However, many of the vehicles are old and not fuel-efficient, mirroring the make-up of the national
vehicle park. Some cities have an age limit for taxi vehicles, but this varies significantly (Brasov has an
age limit of five years, while in Cluj-Napoca the age limit is 12 years). Pedestrian and cycling infrastructure
varies greatly in quality and quantity between different towns and cities, and within different city areas.
A number of Romanian towns and cities have recognized the value of these modes in improving energy
efficiency, reducing congestion and creating pleasant urban environments. For example, efforts to
improve walking and cycling facilities are reported in all three TRACE studies cited above, and mention
is made of encouraging these modes in some Sustainable Energy Action Plans.32 As with other modes,
however, data is hard to come by on the numbers of urban trips being made on foot or bicycle.
          
31. In Brasov in 2008, the Municipality developed a pedestrian area in the historical center with 10
streets closed to car traffic and streets repaved with cobblestones, using funding from the 2007-2013
Regional Operational Program. In Ploiesti, an EU-supported CIVITAS project promoted walking and a
pedestrian zone was created in the city center, backed by a campaign to encourage behavioral change. As
a consequence, there has reportedly been a 20 percent improvement in public transport speed, in addition
to a 15 percent reduction in pollution in the central zone of the city.

32. In terms of cycling, good cycling infrastructure exists in some cities but it is generally patchy and
does not form a coherent network, and is often poorly maintained. As noted above, parking on cycle lanes
is also a problem, reducing their usability further. However, there are examples where the cycling
environment is being improved. In Cluj-Napoca, the municipality is extending its cycle lane network by
18km (to 58km in total) in the city and out to the suburbs; 50 self-service bicycle docking stations in the

1.8          Mitigation Challenges

33. The previous section has reviewed GHG from the transport sector in Romania and presented a brief
overview of modal share, as well as some of the challenges facing urban transport. In a do nothing scenario,
Romania’s GHG emissions from transport are set to continue growing rapidly compared to the EU,
particularly if its motorization rates converges to the EU average. The challenges for mitigating GHG in
the transport sector are significant. This is illustrated by the recent European Environment Agency (EEA)
report on the State of the European Environment which highlights the fact that ‘transport, including
emissions from international transport, is the only EU sector to have increased its GHG emissions since
1990’. 34

34. A major overall challenge is decoupling economic growth from transport emissions.35 Figure 15
presents real GDP growth and GHG emissions from the transport sector in Romania over 2000-2012,
suggesting that they move in tandem, with an inflexion in 2009 when real GDP started growing more
rapidly than transported related GHG emissions.36 Over the 2000-2012 period, GHG emissions rose by 54
percent, while real GDP rose by 55 percent. As noted in the EEA report, European demand for transport
has increased in line with GDP in recent years, reflecting the close interdependence of transport and
economic development. To mitigate GHG emissions, growth in demand needs to be either limited or
managed in some way or targeted on low emission travel modes, coupled with reducing GHG rates (g/km
emitted) from vehicles. The EEA report recognizes that while new engine technologies will help mitigate
GHG, a more holistic approach is required. This includes measures to encourage change in people’s travel
behavior and choices (as well as technological measures) – which is in line with the broad range of policy
interventions examined in this Report.

35. Increasing motorization (car ownership) is a particular issue for the transport sector in Romania.
Although car mode share in Romania is at a similar level to the EU average, the motorization (or car
ownership) rate in Romania is the lowest in the EU at 224 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2012, having grown
significantly in recent years from 152 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2006. Experience across the world

35 Decoupling can be understood in different manners. One interpretation would be that transport emissions go down while real

economic activity is positive. This is a very ambitious target, but a more realistic one is ensuring that the growth of GHG emissions
from the transport sector is slower than the growth of real GDP.
36 The observed decoupling of transport GHG emissions to GDP may be in part attributable to the evolution I fuel prices which

rose rapidly in 2004 and 2006, before falling back by 2008. By 2010 fuel prices had bounced back, reaching new highs and
continued to rise rapidly, constraining travel demand and leading to a fall in emissions.

suggests that as the Romanian economy grows, the motorization rate will continue to grow in future.
Without intervention to provide better transport alternatives and encourage their use, as car ownership
grows, car use is also likely to grow. The General Transport Master Plan projects rapid growth in car
ownership, with the motorization rate exceeding 350 cars per 1,000 inhabitants by 2030, which would
represent an increase in excess of 50 percent increase over 2012-2030.37

36. The current state of the railway system in Romania is also a key issue when considering mitigating
GHG emissions in the transport sector. Both passenger and freight movements by rail have declined
dramatically in recent years. This is linked to the decaying state of the Romanian railway system. In its
Position Paper on Romania in preparation for the 2014-2020 funding round, the European Commission
noted that the railway system is suffering from underinvestment and poor maintenance, leading to slow
and unreliable train services.38 The GTMP report argues that Romanian railways ‘are in a crisis situation’,
and recommends:

                     serious structural reforms;
                     substantially increased spending on maintenance and renewals;
                     increased investment in rehabilitation to current design speeds; and
                     introduction of regular interval timetables, convenient for passenger needs.


37. These measures are built into the GTMP, and thus are included in the Business-as-Usual scenario
for this study. Inevitably, however, there will be a process of transition to go through, during which it

would be difficult to implement effective additional interventions aimed at encouraging greater rail use
(which would reduce emissions compared with road or air travel). At the same time, significant GTMP
investments in improved road infrastructure would increase demand for road travel.

38. Lack of infrastructure for alternative fuels is an issue that needs to be addressed if take-up of low
carbon vehicle technologies (with associated GHG emission savings) is to be accelerated beyond the
trajectory achievable by market forces alone. This has already been recognized in other countries where
governments have invested to provide such infrastructure. It is also recognized by the European
Commission—a directive for the deployment of the alternative fuels infrastructure was adopted in October
2014, requiring EU member states to provide a minimum infrastructure for alternative fuels such as
electricity, hydrogen and natural gas, as well as common EU-wide standards for equipment needed and
user information.39 Member States must set and make public their targets and present their national policy
frameworks by the end of 2016. At present, Romania has a low level of such infrastructure—there are
only 20 electric vehicle charging stations according to the Romanian Electric Vehicle Association 
(AVER)40. This clearly constrains the use of alternative fuel vehicles, even if the number of such vehicles
available on the commercial market is growing rapidly.

39. Finally, integrated land use and transport planning in urban areas is a key issue that needs to be
addressed if transport emissions are to be minimized in future. Although this aspect is covered under the
Bucharest modelling work undertaken by the World Bank urban sector team, it is worth noting that failure
to consider land use and transport in an integrated manner in Romania’s towns and cities in the future will
inevitably lead to unnecessary motorized travel and consequent GHG.

 2    METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO MODELLING TRANSPORT
                        EMISSIONS

2.1    Introduction

41. The overall objective of the transport mitigation modelling work was to develop a Green Scenario
and an associated Action Plan that would guide the Romanian Government in their decisions on how best
to invest in transport-related interventions that would contribute to climate change mitigation. The
recommended scenario would take account of GHG benefit, as modelled in the study, and cost to the
Government of Romania of alternative interventions, as well as qualitative consideration of co-benefits
and implementation issues. A second, more ambitious Super Green Scenario is also developed, in order to
assess additional possible efforts, although measures. This chapter will provide a succinct overview of the
general approach to GHG emission modelling adopted in the study—further details can be found in Annex
1—before turning to the intervention cost estimation and the marginal abatement cost curve analysis. This
sets the stage for the next chapter which provides an assessment of alternative interventions to reduce
GHG emissions in the transport sector.


2.2    General Approach to Transport GHG Emission Modelling

42. A fundamental task involved developing a flexible, agile and user-friendly modelling tool that could
be used for appraisal of the emission impacts of alternative interventions. Only the direct impact on
transport fleet, vehicle activity and energy intensity have been modelled. Second order impacts on the
wider economy would require further modelling. TRANSEPT (Transport Strategic Emission Prediction
Tool) is an Excel spreadsheet based tool, which draws on data and relationships from a variety of sources,
including:

           National Transport Model (NTM): The NTM was developed to appraise a wide range of
            potential interventions (both infrastructure and policy interventions) within the GTMP study.
            It has been designed to provide a robust tool for assessment of: (a) national and regional
            impacts of changes in population and its distribution; (b) national and regional changes in
            economic activity; (c) strategic inter urban highway schemes; (d) rail infrastructure and
            service proposals including major investment such as high speed rail; national and regional
            bus strategy development; and (e) national policy measures such differential pricing for rail
            and air; internalization of external transport costs; climate change policies (e.g. subsidy of
            low emission modes); implementation of a road tax; and car ownership and its linkage to level
            of taxation.
            The NTM includes modelling of both passenger and freight movements, by road, rail, air and
            inland waterways. It is based on the EMME3 transport planning software platform and has
            spatially detailed representation of travel demand patterns and transport networks. It has been
            calibrated using existing data and validated using internationally accepted standards. A
            number of transport policy interventions have been appraised using the NTM—including
                                                    18
                                                                  

                                                                  

                      GHG impacts assessed using the NTM in conjunction with the TREMOVE emissions module.
                      The NTM can be used directly to model alternative mitigation policy options and provide
                      outputs to TREMOVE that can calculate GHG impacts. Data inputs and outputs from the
                      model runs undertaken within the GTMP study and various modelling reports were used to
                      develop the transport mitigation modelling work.
                     TREMOVE: The publicly available EU wide policy assessment model, designed to study the
                      effects of different transport and environment policies on the transport sector. The model
                      estimates for technical and non-technical measures and policies such as road pricing, public
                      transport pricing, emission standards, subsidies for cleaner cars etc., the transport demand,
                      modal shifts, vehicle stock renewal and scrappage decisions as well as the emissions of GHG,
                      air pollutants and the welfare level. TREMOVE models both passenger and freight transport.
                      The model covers all inland urban and interurban transport modes - road, rail, water and air
                      transportation, from 1995-2030. Input databases are calibrated to feed the model for 30
                      countries (EU-28 plus Norway, Switzerland and Turkey).41
                     COPERT. COPERT 4 is a software tool used world-wide to calculate air pollutant and
                      greenhouse gas emissions from road transport.42 COPERT has been developed for official
                      road transport emission inventory preparation in EEA member countries. The COPERT 4
                      methodology is part of the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook for the
                      calculation of air pollutant emissions and is consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for the
                      calculation of GHG emissions. The use of a software tool to calculate road transport emissions
                      allows for transparent and standardized, consistent and comparable, data collecting and
                      emissions reporting procedure, in accordance with the requirements of international
                      conventions and protocols and EU legislation.
                     SULTAN. The SULTAN (SUstainabLe TrANsport) Illustrative Scenarios Tool has been
                      developed as a high-level calculator to help provide indicative estimates of the possible
                      impacts of policy on transport in the EU (primarily energy use and GHG emissions, also costs,
                      energy security, NOx and PM emissions). The purpose of the tool is to allow the quick scoping
                      of a wide range of transport policy options to help get a feel for what scale of action might be
                      required and will also be used as part of the analysis for the final written technical outputs of the
                      project. Many of the core inputs to the TRANSEPT model were taken from SULTAN as the
                      SULTAN emissions forecasting module as part of the model, including the fleet evolution
                      profile (technologies, survival rates), emissions factors, and fuel mix.43

42 The development of COPERT is coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), in the framework of the activities
of the European Topic Centre for Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation. The European Commission's Joint Research
Centre manages the scientific development of the model.
43 SULTAN was developed as part of the EU Transport GHG: Routes to 2050 II project, a 15-month project funded by the

European Commission's Directorate General Climate Action that started in January 2011 and was completed in July 2012.
                                                                19
                                                                

                                                                

                     Eurostat data. Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union situated in
                      Luxembourg. Its task is to provide the European Union with statistics at European level that
                      enable comparisons between countries and regions.
                     General Transport Master Plan (GTMP). The GTMP produced by AECOM for the
                      Romanian Government in October 2014, has formed a key input to the emissions modelling
                      process. The GTMP sets out the investment objectives over the period to 2030. The proposed
                      investment program covers a range of measures including highway infrastructure, rail network
                      extension and enhancement and the upgrading of ports.
                     E-PRTR. The CO2 emissions from road transport in the 20 cities in Romania with a
                      population in excess of 100,000 have been estimated using ArcGIS software with the E-PRTR
                      dataset in 2011 at the 5km by 5km grid level. This allowed factoring urban measure impacts
                      to that which would be likely to be achieved with the 20 largest cities appropriate for which
                      urban interventions were considered.
43. The impact of the planned investment as foreseen in the GTMP on travel demand, vehicle activity
and implicitly on transport emissions are tested within the NTM which underpins the development of the
GTMP. The outputs of the NTM have been utilized within the emissions modelling as the most thorough
and robust source of projections for future transport activity, taking account of planned investment. It
should be noted however that the NTM outputs are subject to the following constraints:

                     Only the strategic route network is included within the model. This includes all of the
                      motorways, expressways, major national routes and also the strategic urban routes. However,
                      local urban roads and smaller rural roads are not included within the modelled network. Urban
                      and non-strategic highway network emissions have been calculated based on COPERT vehicle
                      activity data.
                     The future year projections cover the period of the GTMP—up to 2030—with a further
                      modelled year of 2040. Beyond 2040 trends must be extrapolated.
                     The NTM includes representation of private vehicles, goods vehicles, passenger and freight
                      rail, maritime and air transport. However, travel activity is represented in terms of vehicle-
                      km with no detailed modelling of the characteristics of the vehicle fleet. Hence, the evolution
                      in vehicle fleet technology needs to be derived from other sources (with the exception of rail,
                      for which details of planned investment in new units is provided within the GTMP).
  The GTMP sets out two future scenarios, an economically efficient scenario (ES) and an economically
    and environmentally efficient scenario’ (EES), both of which are modelled within the NTM, and a
                     reference case, with slightly different phasing of investments.

44. Figure 16 highlights the increase in forecast vehicle activity under the projected scenarios, driven
primarily by investment in improved highway infrastructure which offers increased opportunity to travel,
with a marginal difference in trajectory of vehicle activity between the alternative scenarios.

45. For each input required by the model, the available data sources were reviewed, and the most robust
data selected to populate the model. The Romania specific COPERT dataset formed the preferred primary
data source for existing vehicle stock and vehicle activity, having consistency with the TREMOVE Routes
to 2050 modelling work. The NTM represents the most detailed set of projections for future vehicle activity
on the Romanian highway, rail and waterways network. SULTAN EU wide data formed a secondary
source of data, where Romania specific data was not available. The NTM focuses on the strategic highway
network and as such, much of the urban activity taking place on local roads, and activity on small rural
roads are not represented in the NTM outputs. To capture this missing activity, COPERT vehicle activity
data was used as the reference point for the split of urban, non-urban and expressway activity. This
COPERT data estimates the proportion of activity taking place in in urban areas, disaggregated by vehicle
type. This split formed the basis for baseline emissions estimates.

46. In determining the appropriate baseline scenario for the transport emissions model, the merits of the
three NTM modelled scenarios were considered. The reference case includes none of the proposed
investment and hence represents an unrealistic projection of future travel growth. Given Romania’s
objectives of delivering both an economically efficient and environmentally sustainable transport network,
the EES scenario and its modelled investment profile has been adopted within the baseline for the
emissions modelling. It should be noted that the proposed investments underpinning the EES scenario may
only materialize with significant delays and consideration was given to lagging transport demand growth
accordingly. However, the development of a hybrid profile to reflect this would require divergence from
the wide range of output statistics from the NTM, including vehicle and passenger activity and vehicle
speeds across different modes. In practical terms, this was considered to potentially undermine the integrity
of the data inputs, and therefore the inclusion of the EES scenario as modelled was adopted as the preferred
approach. It should be noted that if implementation of investments falls short of the investment profile
proposed within the GTMP, this would likely to lead to lower transport emissions across all scenarios. As
such, the modelled business as usual (BAU) represents a conservative projection of transport emissions to
the upper side.

47. TRANSEPT includes four modules which produce the input matrices for the emissions engine
which calculates the GHG emissions. The four modules are: (a) transport demand; (b) vehicle stock; (c)
vehicle and driving efficiency; and (d) fuel consumption. Each module takes a number of baseline datasets
as input and applies the effect of relevant policy interventions to them. The adjusted datasets are then input
to the emissions engine which calculates the resulting GHG emissions. The process is outlined in Figure
14. The TRANSEPT tool has the following main dimensions:

           It takes account of both direct (tailpipe) and indirect emissions.
           It covers road, rail, waterborne and air travel modes.
           Modes are split into passenger and freight transport.
           Transport activity and consequent emissions are split by urban / non-urban / highway
            locations.
           Different powertrain and fuel options are modelled as appropriate to each mode.
           Time horizons modelled are 2011 (base year), 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045,

The technical detail of the model including the source input data and basis for projections is included in
Annex 1. The assessment of potential interventions to reduce GHG emissions from the transport sector
were divided into five broad categories: (a) pricing instruments; (b) technology; (c) regulatory; and (d)
operational efficiency; and (e) urban planning, behavioral change, and low carbon infrastructure
investment. The model is able to forecast the impact on GHG emissions of individual interventions and
bundles of interventions, with the synergies between interventions reflected in the abatement results under
the scenarios. In other words, the sum of carbon savings from each individual intervention will not match
the combined impact under the Green or Super Green Scenario.


48. For all urban measures that are modelled, the intervention is applied to Romania’s largest 20 cities,
with the exception of urban congestion charging which has been costed for one major scheme in Bucharest,
as the only city appropriate for this intervention. For each intervention, the Report summarizes the key
issues associated with that intervention in a succinct format, as set out in subsequent sections of this Report.
This included the potential GHG emission reduction impacts, the costs involved, and implementation
issues. Taken together, this allowed us to reach conclusions on which interventions should be included in
the recommended Green Scenario. The TRANSEPT model was then re-run with all the constituent
scenario interventions included. To demonstrate the potential impact of adopting the full package of
identified measures, a Super Green Scenario was developed, which included all modelled interventions.

49. A large proportion of the population in Romania live in urban areas, with significant transport
activity concentrated in these areas accordingly. The COPERT Romania dataset suggests that 44 percent
of private road vehicle activity takes place within the urban areas.44 Whilst the scope of the project does
not extend to detailed modelling of individual urban areas, Bucharest is being covered by the Urban Report
under Task C, the scale of carbon emissions generated within the urban areas are sizable and therefore
form an essential component of national emissions estimates. Urban emissions are therefore included
within the baseline at a strategic level, through their inclusion as a single ‘urban’ area type—that is to say,
not broken down to the individual city level. The impact of urban intervention measures are also estimated,
based on assessment at the strategic level. Where the applicability of certain policies relate to only the
largest cities or only Bucharest (urban congestion charging for example), the relative scale of vehicle
activity within these locations is considered in assessing likely scheme impact. This strategic analysis
draws on the scale of vehicle activity within the major cities, data related to spatial coverage, population,
population density and also from the EU road transport emissions database (E-PRTR data).


2.3          Intervention Cost Estimation

50. In parallel with the emission modelling, broad cost estimates have been calculated for the
interventions under consideration. These were prepared at a level of accuracy that is appropriate to the
strategic nature of this study, and included both capital costs and operating costs relative to the business-
as-usual scenario. Costs considered were costs to Government in implementing the interventions under
consideration. Existing knowledge of the potential costs of the interventions was supplemented through
further research and investigation as required, including:

                     Published research and information on the costs of interventions (for example, from EU
                      research projects);
                     Consideration of the general level of Romanian cost in comparison to other European
                      countries;
                     Cost databases (where appropriate); and
                     Cost estimates used in the World Bank’s recent Macedonia Mitigation Study.
51. Where schemes generate ongoing revenues, these revenues have not been included within the
scheme cost projections. The revenues are typically transfer payments from the private sector, and without
inclusion of the corresponding private sector costs—which have been excluded from the analysis—would
paint an imbalanced picture of scheme merit.

2.4          Marginal Abatement Cost Analysis

52. A marginal abatement cost (MAC) analysis was made drawing on the emission impact forecasts
and the discounted cost estimates over the appraisal period to 2050. This was originally restricted to the
                                                            
44   COPERT vehicle activity data is broken down by Urban, non-urban and highway.

                                                               24
                                                      

                                                      

policy interventions associated with new transport technology options. This is because, within the transport
sector, planning a low carbon development pathway should generally involve more than choosing the
options with the largest GHG abatement potential per euro, as this forms a very narrow, one-dimensional
view. Outside the area of technological interventions, other transport interventions have impacts in many
other key areas such as economic, safety, social and other environmental impacts which may well be larger
in magnitude than GHG abatement potential. In order to inform the appraisal of alternative policies for
inclusion in the Green Scenario, a high level marginal abatement cost analysis was undertaken to provide
a means of comparison. The results of this analysis are also included within the MAC curve reporting,
although caveats are made in relation to the unquantified nature of the wider benefits of these schemes.

                        3        ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS

3.1          Introduction

53. A good way of thinking of mechanisms to reduce emissions in the transport sector is the avoid-
shift-improve (A-S-I) paradigm, associated with Holger Dalkmann:45

              (a) Avoid growth of CO2 emissions through urban and interurban development that reduces the
                  need for long-distance travel in passenger vehicles. Singapore is a good example of a coherent
                  and comprehensive set of land use and development policies aimed at reducing the
                  dependence on passenger vehicles, in contrast to the US suburbanization model. This is clearly
                  linked to urban development issues and transport policies developed in response to these.

              (b) Shift transport to modes with lower emissions, by shifting passenger traffic to buses, rail or
                  metro and freight to rail, and away from passenger vehicles and trucks. Given that cities
                  produce a large share of emissions, this would require developing policies to encourage modal
                  shift from passenger vehicles to mass transit, either to increase the modal share of public
                  transport or to slow down a declining modal share. Increasing the role of rail, particularly for
                  freight, is critical; a successful example that comes to mind is Switzerland.

              (c) Improve vehicles, fuels and operations in order to mitigation emissions with existing and
                  future vehicles technologies, fuel economy standards, and through traffic management
                  policies.

54. The set of policies aimed at dealing with A-S-I can be broadly considered to be pricing instruments,
regulatory, operational efficiency, and investments. Pricing policies, such as the introduction of a
congestion charge aimed at encouraging modal shift from passenger vehicles to public transport and non-
motorized transport, but could be combined with restrictive parking regulations and investing funds from
the congestion charge for improving and extending mass transit. All three sets of policies, pricing,
regulatory, and investment decisions are clearly needed, and in practice, it is a whole set of policies, rather
than one policy introduced in isolation, which has helped reduce the usage of passenger vehicles in a
number of European cities. In what follows a menu of individual policy options is presented, with a greater
focus on roads, as this is the sector which generates the most emissions in the transport sector. It goes
without saying that greater investments in public transport is needed in order to reduce vehicle use, and
this has not been elaborated in this section, as this is embedded into the BAU.

55. The range of interventions selected and tested within this study focus on measures which could
conceivably be implemented within the period of the Action Plan (2015-2022) or the preparatory studies
undertaken to allow implementation by 2030, consistent with the GTMP investment horizon. The impact
of the policies extends beyond 2030, with the majority of the modelled interventions continuing to have
an impact on vehicle activity and purchasing decisions through to 2050. A focus on policy measures which
would not be implementable or appropriate before 2030 was not pursued, as these would not have great
relevance to actions which could be taken by the Government of Romania within the action plan period,
and the evolving landscape would be likely to undermine the relevance of such long term proposals within
the extended timeframe.

56. This chapter begins by reviewing pricing instruments, then turns to regulatory and operational
efficiency, and ends with a review of urban planning, behavioral change, and low carbon infrastructure
investment. Each potential intervention is described, together with examples from around the world,
potential implementation timeframe, information on costs, how the intervention was modelled (where
applicable), and likely GHG benefits. With all interventions, implementation was assumed to take place
as early as is likely to be feasible in order to maximize benefits.46


3.2          Pricing Instruments

57. Road User Charging (RUC). When deciding to make a journey a driver will normally consider
the costs to him/herself, that is to say the cost of fuel, personal cost if delayed due to heavy traffic, and
parking costs, when in fact there are many other associated costs. Road pricing theory argues that the
socially optimal amount of transport in total and by mode requires that users be confronted with a price at
the point of use that reflects the full social cost of his/her trip at the margin or marginal social cost pricing.
Social costs are defined to include private marginal costs (fuel, vehicle maintenance, driver and passenger
time for a specific vehicle trip), together with any damage done to the infrastructure, the capital costs of
the infrastructure, the impact of exhaust emissions locally, regionally or globally in the form of CO2 or
GHG emissions, and the contribution to congestion, noise, and accidents. Internalizing these costs—
adopting the user pays principle—requires making each driver pay for their part of the general costs
generated.

58. Road pricing can be used as a flexible way of charging people and can help end the idea that one
can drive a vehicle without thinking about the external consequences to society. Pricing is critical to

                                                            
46 No direct intervention was modelled with regard to railways. Enhancements to the rail network are modelled within the GTMP,

in terms of extended network coverage and new units to provide greater service levels. If service levels are not achieved then the
mode share of the rail system may be expected to continue to decline and ultimately cease to function. Improvements to the rail
network are implicit to the business as usual forecasts. Additional measures, not modelled, would focus on ensuring greater
commercial orientation in the running of the state-owned rail companies, through for example, the hiring of commercially
orientated executives through a best practice international recruitment effort. Individual railway infrastructure projects need to be
implemented as part of a holistic package to improve the attractiveness of rail travel (including rolling stock, maintenance,
operational efficiency and customer service) on the relevant rail lines. Without such an approach, neither the economic nor the
GHG mitigation benefits will be realized. 

                                                                27
                                                                 

                                                                 

reducing GHG emissions and represents one of the key transport policies to reduce demand by raising the
relative price of vehicle use to alternative mass transit in cities or other modes outside of urban areas. This
section presents a brief overview of some of the pricing policy options available to policy makers wishing
to contain the growth of the modal share of vehicles, drawing on international experience. Road user
charging can be seen as an alternative to fuel taxation, which is also based on the ‘user pays’ principle.
However, the adoption of road user charging allows greater flexibility and adaptability, for example with
differential pricing on particularly congested roads or within cities for example.

59. A policy of making road users pay for their use of the highway network can be an efficient means
of internalizing the externality of carbon emissions in addition to contributing to the upkeep of the
highways as a public utility. Road user charging can be seen as an alternative to fuel taxation, which is
also based on the ‘user pays’ principle. However, the adoption of road user charging allows greater
flexibility and adaptability, for example with differential pricing on particularly congested roads or within
cities for example.

60. Extension and enhancement to the motorway network in Romania is forecast to generate increased
desire and opportunity to travel, leading to an increase in vehicle km. User charging on the motorway
network would allow the gathering of funds to contribute to the maintenance of the network and place
some constraint on the growth in travel. Currently, a vignette is payable to permit travel on national roads
and expressways in Romania. The cost varies by vehicle weight, and can be bought for periods ranging
from one week (daily for HGVs) to one year. The annual cost of the vignette is Euro 28 increasing to Euro
320 for 7.5 ton trucks and Euro 560 for heavier vehicles.

61. Some examples of road user charging are seen in Europe, for example in France in the form of
motorway tolls. Tolls have been generally used for specific roads, bridges and tunnels, although
increasingly they are being introduced for networks. There are two main types—a closed toll system,
where any vehicle entering the facility collects a ticket and pays a graduated fee at the exit point—as
occurs in motorways in the EU.47 The introduction of such a system requires that the road be fully ‘closed’
so no user can gain access to the road without collecting the ticket and paying the toll. The level of facilities
required increases, and the provision of a free alternative route is usually mandated by law. Open road
tolling (ORT), also known as free-flow tolling, is the collection of tolls without the use of toll booths. The
major advantage is that users are able to drive through the toll plaza at highway speeds without having to
slow down to pay the toll. ORT may also reduce congestion at the plazas, and hence GHG emissions, by
allowing more vehicles per hour per lane. A disadvantage is the increased risk of violators who do not pay.
Collection of tolls on open toll roads is usually conducted through the use of transponders or automatic
plate recognition. Both methods aim to eliminate the delay on toll roads by collecting tolls electronically
by debiting the accounts of registered vehicle owners without requiring them to stop. Given the
technological requirements, ORT is more expensive and may be appropriate for only some countries in
EU-12.
                                                            
47 The introduction of a closed system normally requires the availability of a free alternative route for road users who chose not

to use the tolled route.

                                                               28
                                                         

                                                         


62. Elsewhere, there has been much research into the potential for road user charging, but to date no
move has been made to implement such a system beyond the use of certain toll roads. Advancement in
technology including the more widespread use of black boxes and in-car advances with GPS technology
bring the potential for the implementation of accurate However, at present, the majority of EU countries
rely on a combination of road user licencing—for example the vignette—and fuel taxation which provides
a progressive means of linking taxation with the level of transport activity. The main area in which fuel
taxation is lacking is in the lack of differentiation between the location of the travel activity, and the
inability to fully capture the high ‘externality’ cost of travel activity in certain areas in terms of congestion
and local air pollution.

63. The cost of implementation of road user charging would be strongly dependent on the nature of the
scheme, with tolling on the expressways requiring different infrastructure to a national road user charging
scheme with costs varying according to the location in which travel is made. As technology advances
however, the feasibility of intelligent road user charging increases, and the cost of implementation is likely
to fall. Nevertheless, infrastructure costs of such a scheme are likely to remain significant, in terms of the
technological equipment necessary to accurately collect travel movements and the back office
infrastructure to support invoicing and payments. Given the existing mechanism of fuel taxation already
in place, the use of this lever to bring about similar impacts to road user pricing at much lower cost would
suggest that in the short to medium term, any move towards greater taxation of travel activity should be
focus on this. Consequently, modelling efforts have been focused on the fuel taxation level in preference
to national road user charging.

64. Fuel Taxation. Fuel pricing is a particularly effective policy instrument in that it can discourage
vehicle usage—although this is a function of the short, medium, and long-term price elasticity of
demand—and encourage the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, thereby reducing vehicle-fuel
intensity. Fuel taxes are relatively inexpensive to collect, easy to administer and reasonably equitable,
since the charge is broadly proportional to road use. They do not however discriminate between road type,
location of the road, or time of usage. On the latter point, this means that fuel taxes cannot tackle the issue
of high externalities associated with congestion in peak traffic times. Another weakness is that they do
not fully reflect the additional damage done and road space demanded by heavy vehicles. For this reason,
fuel taxes are frequently supplemented by additional charges on heavy vehicles. Taxes on fuel are also
used by governments for other purposes such as restraining fuel consumption or more commonly raising
revenues for the budget, reflecting weaknesses in revenue collection in developing and emerging
economies.

65. All EU member states levy excise duty on fuel. The fuel price payable is hence a combination of
the cost price of fuel in each nation state, and the level of taxation on that fuel. The level of the duty is set
nationally, but is subject to minimum levels as set by the EU. Most EU countries levy fuel duty rates well
in excess of the EU minimum. Until 2014, Romania’s fuel duty rate was one of the lowest in EU at 32
euro cents /liter for diesel and 35 euro cents/liter for gasoline, but in April 2014, an increase in the fuel
duty amounting to 7 euro cents/liter was applied. Increasing fuel taxes remains an option for Romania,

although issues of affordability need to be taken into account when considering fuel tax rises. Nevertheless,
gasoline and diesel prices remain significantly below the EU-28 average, using April 2015 data (Figure
18).

66. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. Adopting the proposal of increased fuel taxation
would be rapidly implementable, given the existing structures in place. The intervention has been modelled
an increase in fuel taxation, leading to a 10 percent overall increase in fuel prices. At current prices, this
amounts to an increase of around 12.5 cents/liter (including VAT) on petrol and diesel. Evidence of fuel
price elasticities, suggest values of -0.15 in the short term and -0.3 in the long term, an increase on this
scale will be expected to lead to a reduction in km travelled in the order of 3 percent over the longer term.49
One would also expect second order effects in terms of a move towards more efficient vehicles in response
to the higher fuel prices. A 5 percent increase in fuel price has been modelled for 2020 which increases to
10 percent in 2025 where it remains till 2050. Application of the 30 percent elasticity results in a 3 percent
reduction in trips in the long term for vehicles which use either gasoline or diesel. The profile of annual
GHG emission savings to 2050 is presented below when the policy is applied as part of the Green Scenario
package of measures. The policy reduces annual GHG emissions by 0.4 MtCO2e by 2025 and 0.6 MtCO2e
by 2050. The main barrier to implementation would be political. In 2014, a fuel tax increase of 7 euro
cents was enacted despite strong opposition.

49Unit elasticity refers to a 1.0 absolute value (1.0 or -1.0) elasticity, meaning that price changes cause proportional consumption
changes. Elasticities of less than 1.0 absolute value are called inelastic, meaning that prices cause less than proportional
consumption changes. Elasticity values greater than 1.0 absolute value are called elastic, meaning that price changes cause more
than proportional consumption changes. As normally measured, vehicle travel is considered inelastic, meaning that changes in
fuel, parking and road toll prices generally cause proportionately smaller changes in mileage and fuel consumption, but this reflects
the way these impacts are measured. People often focus on short-run (within a year) impacts, which are typically only a third of
long-run effects. See Todd Litman (2012), Changing Vehicle Travel Price Sensitivities, The Rebounding Rebound Effect, Victoria
Transport Policy Institute, 10 September 2012. Available at: http://www.vtpi.org/VMT_Elasticities.pdf. Analysis conducted as
part of the NTM work in Romania found an elasticity of fuel price increase of -0.29, which is within the range found elsewhere.

67. Vehicle scrappage scheme. Romania has had a vehicle scrappage scheme in place since 2005,
known as the ‘Rabla’ (clunkers) scheme. This has seen the scrapping of approaching 500,000 ageing and
high-polluting vehicles, and the subsidized purchase of around 250,000 more efficient vehicles. Uptake
of the scrappage scheme peaked in 2010, with almost 190,000 cars scrapped, and has since fallen to much
lower levels (c. 20,000). Whilst the impact of the scrappage scheme to date on vehicle fleet age and
characteristics are reflected in the baseline emissions forecasts, the business as usual scenario projects an
evolution in vehicle fleet which does not reflect a return to the high levels of new vehicle purchase achieved
by the scrappage scheme in its top performing years.

68. The objective of the scrappage scheme is to encourage the removal of the oldest and highest
polluting vehicles from the fleet, and the purchase of new lesser polluting models. The intervention
considered focuses on a renewed and re-invigorated scrappage scheme which adopts more stringent
standards and greater generosity in the level of subsidy for the purchase of the most efficient vehicles. The
rate of the incentive for vehicle scrappage is proposed to be increased to 7,500 lei (Euro 1,700), which
represents an increase of 1000 lei from the 6,500 lei in recent years (originally 3500 lei). The scrappage
vouchers remain transferable and 'stackable' as under the existing scheme, with the criteria for eligible
vehicles also remaining the same (over 8 years old as of 2014). However, the level of the emissions
requirements are tightened to achieve a new vehicle purchase average emissions level of 120g/km.
          
69. Romania is already familiar with the benefits and impacts which a scrappage program can bring,
with evidence collected from the historical scheme. There are many other examples of successful
scrappage schemes, with other European countries including Germany, Austria, France and the UK. The
                                                         31
                                                       

                                                       

level of the incentive is an important aspect of the scrappage program. Only vehicles with a lesser value
than the incentive may be expected to be scrapped. The conditions attached to the vehicles eligible for
scrapping and also those which may be purchased with the vouchers are also important determinants of
the overall impact as regards emissions reduction. The value of scrappage scheme incentives typically
ranged from Euro 1,000 to Euro 2,500 for European schemes. As such, the proposed 7500 lei (Euro 1,700)
is in line with other schemes, with the increase over previous years’ values reflective of the tightening
conditions regarding the emissions standards of the new vehicle purchased.

70. Costs. The cost of the scheme has been estimated based on historical scheme costs, increased to
reflect the higher level of the incentive. A take-up rate of 100,000 vehicles scrapped over the course of 5
years (20,000 in each year) has been adopted as the scheme target, based on the average annual scrappage
rate achieved under the historical scheme. The total cost of the scheme is estimated to be Euro 177.5
million. Note that this is the full cost of the program rather than the net cost of the increased incentive
value. Accordingly, the full impact of the scheme carbon savings are quantified against the counterfactual
of the scrappage scheme drawing to an end.
          
71. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. Ageing vehicles fitting within the scrappage criteria
are removed from the vehicle fleet. It is assumed that the target number of vehicles to be scrapped are
achieved over the five years of the modelled scheme period, 2016 to 2020. These vehicles are replaced
by  new vehicles meeting the emissions standards required, at a rate of one new vehicle to two scrapped
vehicles, based on the historical ratio of new to old vehicles (more than one scrappage voucher can be used
towards the purchase of a new vehicle). Older vehicles which are scrapped may be expected to have a
lower utilization rate, in terms of annual km travelled, than new vehicles. This is reflected in the
modelling, taking typical usage rates according to age as featuring in the fleet model. In practice, scrappage
schemes typically lead to the advancement of anticipated purchasing decisions and therefore the impact
relates to the quickening of fleet turnover compared to the natural rate of evolution under the counter-
factual. New vehicles purchased under the scrappage scheme are subject to the same survival rates as
other vehicles of the same vintage, and therefore fleet evolution continues to be affected beyond the period
of the scrappage scheme. The annual GHG emission savings are presented below. Overall the scheme has
a minimal impact, attaining a maximum annual saving of 0.1 MtCO2e in 2020. However due to the nature
of the scrappage scheme the impacts reduce over time. The mechanisms for implementing the scrappage
scheme are well set up and have undergone a number of revisions during the life of the current scheme.
Therefore, a reinvigorated scheme supported by increased funding is not seen to present any significant
technical barriers.

72. New Vehicle Registration Tax (Environmental Stamp). Romania currently has an ‘Environment
Stamp’ tax on new vehicle registrations, introduced in 2013 as an evolution from the pollution tax which
was deemed illegal under EU law. The Environment Stamp is levied under according to a vehicle’s Euro
standard, CO2 emissions, engine displacement, with a discount rate applied depending on the age of the
vehicle being registered. The amendment to the system from the pollution tax means that older vehicles
receive a significant discount to newer vehicles and that non-Euro standard vehicles and Euro 1 and 2
vehicles would pay less than under the previous system. In its present form, the cost of registration falls
for registering older vehicles, even if these are higher polluting vehicles. It is proposed that the rates
payable under the Environmental Stamp be reviewed and the potential for greater encouragement to
purchase more efficient lower polluting models be explored. Most European countries charge a vehicle
registration tax based on CO2 emissions, Euro standard or engine displacement. A gradual pre-announced
increase in the levy payable for registration of the most polluting cars has been a means of influencing
purchasing decisions. In the UK for example, the following rates are payable on first registration of a
vehicle, demonstrating the significant fiscal penalty applied for the purchase of higher polluting models.50

50 Note that after the first year, an annual road tax is levied. This is also a progressive tax related to the CO2 emissions of the

vehicle, but the scale of the annual payment for the highest polluting vehicles reaches a maximum of £500 (Euro 675)

73. Given the existence in Romania of a first year registration tax, the regulatory framework is already
broadly in place. As such, the cost of making changes to the rates payable under the scheme would be
negligible. In terms of wider costs to society, it is assumed that the change to tax rates is fiscally neutral
so that higher taxes for high polluting vehicles are offset by lower taxes for more efficient vehicles. As the
Environment Stamp rates are subject to regular review, changes to the rates payable could be quickly
implemented and able to influence the purchasing decisions of motorists within the Action Plan period.

74. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. The modelled intervention relates to evolution in the
Environment Stamp at a rate greater than the natural evolution in fleet technology within the BAU to
further incentivise the adoption of clean vehicle technologies. The adjustments to the scheme have been
modelled to lead to increased trajectory in greener vehicle technology uptake, with new trajectories taken
from the EU Transport GHG: Routes to 2050 work. The policy is applied to the purchase of new cars from
the years 2016 onwards as a shift in the powertrain of new vehicles purchased from gasoline and diesel to
plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) gasoline, PHEV diesel and electric vehicles (EV). The size of the
shift is presented in the table below. This is shared between PHEV gasoline, PHEV diesel and EV by the
following respective shares, 29 percent, 29 percent and 43 percent. The annual GHG emission savings are
presented in the graph below when the policy is applied as part of the Green package of measures. By
2050 the policy saves 0.6 MtCO2e. Although the policy is applied in 2020, interpolation from 2015 to
2020 presents the policy as if it were ramped up from 2015 to 2020.

75. The main barrier to significant change in the first registration tax regime is likely to be political.
The previous pollution tax was disliked due to the additional burden it placed on the purchase of older
vehicles, and was ultimately overturned leading to the new Environment Tax scheme.

76. Parking pricing. One pricing mechanism to discourage using vehicles is adopting a policy of high
parking pricing, particularly if parking is expensive in relation to mass transit public transport. An annual
survey on daily parking rates shows that Bucharest’s parking fees are quite low compared to other EU-12
cities, although this information is dated and the picture may be slightly different now (Figure 22).52 In the
EU, changing parking policies are part of larger goals, such as complying with air quality standards or
reducing GHG emissions. While London and Stockholm and a few other cities have introduced congestion
charging, this has not spread widely, whereas charging for parking is widespread, and thus raising rates
would be relatively straightforward.53 Parking pricing also represents a source of potential revenue for the
authority through the control of public parking provision.

77. The use of parking charges as a means of demand management is well established and can be an
effective means of promoting modal shift to more sustainable travel such as by public transport or walking
and cycling. Parking charging is fundamentally an urban measure, and can be flexibly applied in ways to
influence different categories of user whilst minimising the economic impact for commerce. The
intervention considered here does not relate to significant increases in parking charges but a widening of
the control of parking within the urban areas, and a reduction in the proportion of free on-street parking.
The policy is focused on the 20 largest conurbations, with the increase in the proportion of paid parking
intended to discourage private vehicle usage and promote modal shift.



                                                            
52 A critical aspect in Bucharest is enforcement of parking regulations—cars occupy sidewalks, forcing pedestrians on to streets.

Enforcement of parking regulations and recovery of penalties are essential steps, in addition to higher parking pricing.
53 Parking pricing policies are usually complemented with policies aimed at controlling the growth of parking spaces.

78. Parking charges are widely used as a means of demand management in cities across Europe. Best
practice examples typically combine the disincentive of high parking charges with an effective and
efficient public transport system, good walking and cycling facilities and other travel options such as Park
and Ride. Those which achieve the highest rates of modal shift are the cities perceived to be non-car
friendly, and for which the thought of talking the car into the city is considered to be more challenging
than the alternative options. Examples of such cities include most of the capital European cities. ITDP has
reviewed case studies of parking best practice in Europe and sets out the key principals and conclusions
in its report ‘Europe’s Parking U-Turn.55 It highlights the experience in Paris, where on-street parking
supply has been reduced by over 9 percent since 2003, and of the remaining stock, 95 percent is paid
parking. The result, along with other transport infrastructure improvements, has been a 13 percent decrease
in driving.
          
79. In Bucharest, there are both public and private parking facilities in addition to free on street parking.
The extension of paid-for parking across the city will require the implementation of new parking
regulations to the on-street parking within the main conurbations, and the need for stronger enforcement.
Other major cities will have varying levels of parking provision. The necessary signage and road markings
constitute the main capital costs. An allowance of Euro 2.5 million is estimated in order to cover the
associated capital costs in the major conurbations.56 Increase in enforcement personnel and parking fee
collection requirements would be funded by increased revenue generated by the wider measures.

56 The largest cities already have in place payment machines within the city centres. Therefore the investment is incremental

through widening the coverage, but also tightening up enforcement of existing provision/facilities

                                                                                              36
                                                                    

                                                                    

80. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. The modelling of the parking charges has been applied
to urban trips in the major urban areas (top 20 cities). The experience of Paris identified a 9 percent
reduction in car trips, whilst Munich saw a 14 percent reduction in car trips within the inner city resulting
from a combination of traffic demand measures which in addition to the parking management measures
included improving cycling infrastructure and enhancing public transport. The parking management
measures have been assumed to result in a reduction in urban car trips of 5 percent—the urban areas have
not been modelled separately in this study. However, the impact of the policy is felt incrementally, firstly
achieving a reduction in car trips of 2.5 percent in 2020, 3.75 percent in 2025 and finally 5 percent by
2030. The annual GHG emission savings are presented in the graph below when the policy is part of the
Green package of measures, achieving a maximum reduction in annual GHG emission savings of
0.07MtCO2e in 2030. The savings decline thereafter to the year 2050 as other policies act to reduce the car
mode share in urban areas.

81. Parking charges remain a contentious issue with city residents and commerce alike. The benefits
of an effective and strong parking policy are often not universally recognized, particularly by those who
are subject to penalty under the necessary enforcement measures. The revenue generation potential for
authorities under the extended parking charge scheme offers an opportunity to mitigate against the impacts,
for example by ring-fencing funding for the provision of improved walking and cycling infrastructure,
enhanced public transport provision and an improved cityscape environment.

82.      Urban Congestion Pricing. This a system of charging users of a transport network to reduce
traffic congestion. The application on urban roads is limited to a small number of cities, including London,
Stockholm, Singapore, and Milan. The London Congestion Charge is a fee paid by drivers travelling within
the Congestion Charge Zone and as its name suggests was introduced with the aim of reducing congestion,
as well as raise investment funds for London's transport system.57 The charge, standing currently at GBP
11.50 (Euro 16) generates significant revenues. During the first decade of the scheme, criticism was made
of the high proportion of the revenues taken up by operating costs. However, increases in the level of the
charge, and reductions in operating costs have occurred, due to the reduction in marketing and awareness
campaigns required with the maturing of the scheme mean that the operating costs have gone down as a
proportion of generated revenues. Implementing a congestion charging scheme can involve significant
capital costs and also ongoing operational costs. The scale of these costs are dependent on the nature of
the scheme and the technology adopted in the collection and monitoring of the charge. There are however
revenues generated by the scheme which should outweigh the cost of operation.

83.      The infrastructure costs involved in implementing the London Congestion Charge were estimated
to be GBP 197million in 2007 market prices (Euro 340 million in 2015 prices). An indicative infrastructure
cost estimate of Euro 150m is provisioned, based on the London experience, but accounting for falling
cost of the technology to implement the scheme. Ongoing operating costs of the scheme are estimated to
be Euro 50 million per annum. Whilst these would be covered by the expected scheme revenue, only
infrastructure and operating and maintenance costs are included within the MAC analysis as the scheme
revenues represent a transfer payment from motorists.

84.      Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. The model has assumed that this policy reduces
urban car trips in urban areas by 5 percent when fully implemented. The policy is scheduled to come into
full effect in 2025, however a ramp up between 2020 to 2025 has been modelled. The annual GHG
emission savings are presented in the figure below when the policy is implemented as part of the Super-
Green package of measures. The policy reduces GHG emissions by 0.14MtCO2e by 2050.




                                                            
57 The zone was introduced in central London in February 2003, and extended into parts of west London in February 2007,
although this was discontinued in 2008. The 2007 report prepared by Transport for London found that traffic entering the charging
zone was 21 percent lower than in 2002, creating opportunities over this period for re-use of a proportion of the road space made
available. Reduced levels of traffic mean that when compared to conditions without the scheme congestion charging continued to
deliver congestion relief that was broadly in line with the 30 percent reduction achieved in the first year of operation. Congestion
charging was also estimated to have led directly to reductions of about 16 percent in CO2 emissions from traffic within the charging
zone over 2002-2003, these more directly reflecting the overall traffic reductions and efficiency gains. Over the post-charging
period 2003-2006, vehicle fleet improvements are estimated to have reduced emissions from road traffic, both within the central
London charging zone and more widely, by 17 percent for NOx, 24 percent for PM10 and 3 percent for CO2, assuming a stable
traffic mix. In terms of revenues and costs, over 2006-2007, the London Congestion Charge generated GBP 213 million in total
revenues, compared to total operating and administrative costs of GBP 90 million, with revenues used for upgrades to bus
infrastructure and operations.

85.     The main barriers to implementation of a congestion charging scheme are political and technical.
Many cities have concluded that the positive benefits which congestion charging may bring about can
more cost effectively be delivered through the use of parking restrictions and increasing parking charges.
As parking charging is already in place in the majority of cities, this intervention can be delivered at much
lower cost whilst leading to similar impacts.

86.      Aviation Travel Tax. A number of countries in the EU apply aviation taxes to travellers on short
and long haul flights departing from the country. These are variously identified as a civil aviation tax,
airport tax, luxury tax or air passenger duty. In certain cases the tax is related to a particular impact such
as the tax on air transport noise pollution in France. Romania currently has no airport departure tax. The
emissions from aviation make up a small proportion of overall emissions in the transport sector but are
projected to increase in absolute terms over time at a slightly faster rate than overall travel activity.
Applying a departure tax to those travelling domestically or internationally would provide a stream of
revenue and may be expected to lead to suppression in the growth of air travel, which as one of the most
polluting forms of travel on a per-km basis, would contribute to the low carbon scenario. The table below
shows the rate of duty applicable in selected EU countries. The introduction of a departure tax at the rates



                                                               39
                                                                          

                                                                          

observed in Austria and Germany would generate significant revenues from 10 million or more passengers
each year travelling from airports in Romania.

87.      The cost of collection of the air passenger duty would depend on the mechanism and could either
be collected at the airport or as a supplement on the airline ticket. A capital cost of Euro 1 million is
allowed as the setup costs across the major airports in Romania as well as office back up costs for
processing the tax. Ongoing collection costs of Euro 150,000 per annum are allowed for. The ongoing
cost of collection would be far outweighed by the revenue generated by the departure tax which would be
expected to be in the order of Euro 125 million per annum, increasing in line with ticket price inflation.
This revenue is not included within the marginal abatement cost analysis as it is a transfer payment. The
tax could be rapidly implemented, following the necessary impact assessment, and could be in effect within
the Action Plan period. No barriers to implementation are expected, except pressure from airlines and
regular travellers.

88.      Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. An elasticity based approach has been used to model
the impact of the tax. The departure tax has been modelled as a 5 percent increase to the fare paid for a
return journey, noting that the tax only applies to outbound flights. Price elasticity information was derived
from IATA’s Air Travel Demand Briefing.59 The policy was modelled to be implemented in 2020. The
resulting impact is a reduction in EU aviation trips of 6 percent and 4.5 percent reduction in International
aviation trips. The policy has been applied from 2020, however interpolation between the years 2015 and
2020 present the policy as ramping up between these years. The annual GHG emission savings are
presented in the figure below when the policy is implemented as part of the Green package of measures.
Annual savings of 0.1 MtCO2e are forecast by 2050.

 3.3   Technology

89.      This section covers a number of interventions that have the potential to reduce carbon emissions
from the adoption of new more efficient technologies, including vehicle engine technologies and
alternative fuels. The encouragement of the more rapid adoption of new vehicle technologies is an
objective of many of the market based interventions and also on the regulation side. The potential for the
government to promote and encourage the uptake of more efficient technologies beyond fiscal or
regulatory measures is considered. The following interventions are considered:

           Roll-out of an electric charging network to support the uptake of electric and plug in hybrid
            electric vehicles;
           Adoption of ultra-low emissions vehicles within the public sector vehicle fleet; and
           Introduction of electric vehicles into the public transport vehicle fleet
90.      Electric Vehicle Charging Network. The vehicle fleet in Romania is older and less efficient than
elsewhere in Europe. The scrappage scheme has encouraged the purchase of newer vehicles, and further
incentives have been put in place to entice the purchase of the least polluting models. However, the
adoption of ultra-low emissions vehicles (ULEVs) such as electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid vehicles and
plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) is lagging behind that observed in other countries, and particularly
those which have in place programs to strongly promote and invest in supporting infrastructure for these
alternative technologies.

91.      In 2014 just 7 electric or hybrid electric vehicles were registered in Romania. By comparison, a
total of over 75,000 electric vehicles (all electric, range extender electric and plug in hybrid electric
vehicles) were registered across the EU. A factor likely to hamper the uptake of EV/PHEV vehicle
technology is the lack of public charging infrastructure. Investment in a rapid charging network which
focuses on the major urban areas and charging points interspersed across the strategic highway network
would facilitate much greater potential for the usage of electric vehicles. This intervention considers the
investment required to roll out a national charging network to complement the fiscal and regulatory
measures which encourage the take-up of electric vehicles.
          
92.      As well as early adopter countries such as Norway and Holland, there has been recent examples
of successful investment programs in other countries designed to boost uptake of alternative fuelled
vehicles. Estonia has become the first country to install a nationwide fast charging network for electric
vehicles. A network of 165 rapid charging posts have been located in urban areas with more than 5,000
inhabitants and on major roads throughout the country. These 50kW DC rapid charging posts have the
ability to charge vehicles in around 30 minutes as compared to 8-10 hours for conventional 3.3kW charging
points. The deal was financed through the sale of 10 million surplus CO2 emission permits to Japan's
Mitsubishi Corporation. This deal also included the provision of a fleet of 500 electric vehicles for use by
the public authorities to help kick-start EV usage, and also the funding for EV subsidies for private
purchasers.

                                                     41
                                                        

                                                        


93.      The modelled intervention takes costs from infrastructure roll-outs in Estonia and OLEV in UK to
estimate the cost of provision of strategic charging network. The costs are based on the installation of a
network of 500 rapid charging points in major conurbations and on the strategic highway network
throughout Romania, at a cost of Euro 50,000 each. In addition, a subsidy for up to 50,000 home charging
points has been costed, at a unit rate of Euro 3,500, reflecting the potential rate of electric vehicle take-up
given a concerted investment program. The ongoing costs in terms of electricity are assumed to be funded
by user charging tariffs/subscriptions. However, the maintenance of the charging points has been allowed
for in ongoing operations and maintenance costs as experience has demonstrated that inclusion of these
costs in user charging rates makes them uneconomic for electric vehicle users. The upfront cost of electric
vehicles is assumed to be offset by fuel efficiency savings, reflecting rational decision making on the part
of private purchasers.

94.      Potential implementation timeframe. Estonia was able to deliver a national charging network
within 2 years of tendering the contract. However, in a larger and more densely populated country with
greater numbers of charging points required, implementation in Romania may be expected to take a little
longer, and the preparatory studies required prior to contracting mean that delivery of the national network
within the 2015-2022 action period timeframe is likely to be challenging. However, implementation could
be phased, with a focus on the most strategic locations, including densely populated cities and selected
points along the most well used expressways. Barriers to implementation may include planning approval
issues relating to the identification of sites for the units, technical barriers regarding the supply of
electricity to the units and commercial barriers in identifying a suitable business model for the installation
and ongoing maintenance of the units.

95.      Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. The delivery of the charging network does not in
itself provide carbon emissions savings, but acts as an important enabler to the take-up of low emissions
vehicles. The impact of the provision of the charging infrastructure has therefore not been modelled in
isolation but in combination with the ultra-low vehicle emissions incentives. Purchasing profiles have
adjusted to reflect projected take-up rates bringing Romania’s vehicle electric vehicle adoption rates into
line with those observed in Estonia. Forward looking projections build on these relative rates, taking
reference from Sultan Green Scenario profiles regarding electric vehicle take-up. The annual GHG
emission savings are presented in the figure below when the policy is implemented as part of the Super-
Green package of measures. Annual savings of 0.09 MtCO2e are forecast by 2050.

96.      Adoption of Ultra Low Emissions Vehicles in the Public Sector. The uptake of ultra-low
emissions vehicles (ULEVs) and in particular the adoption of electric vehicles can be given a kick-start
through the promoted use of this technology within the state’s own vehicle fleet. Setting targets for the
proportion of the public sector fleet which are electric or plug-in hybrid is a means of accelerating the
trajectory of new technology uptake. For this scenario, we have taken a similar target to that adopted in
the modelling of Macedonia interventions, with electric vehicles making up 5% of the public sector fleet
in 2020, increasing to 10 percent in 2025. Again looking to the flagship case of Estonia with its national
charging network roll-out and strong promotion of electric vehicles through fiscal subsidies, the scheme
was kick-started with a large-scale demonstration project involving 500 electric vehicles adopted by
government agencies. These vehicles provided a conspicuous demonstration of the technology, a test-bed
for collection of research data and to test the infrastructure.

97.      The purchase of electric vehicles comes at a higher cost to standard vehicles. However, there are
ongoing operations and maintenance savings to be made resulting from the lower vehicle operating costs.
The scheme costings draw on achieving the target rates of 5 percent and 10 percent of the public sector
vehicle fleet of 75,000 vehicles by 2020 and 2025 respectively, with a cost premium on the purchase of
the electric vehicles of Euro 4,450 per vehicle. The cost of phased vehicle purchase from 2016-2025
equates to Euro 3.5 million per annum (undiscounted 2015 prices), with total investment costs of Euro 35
million.
          
98.      Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. Utilization of ULEVs within the governmental fleet
can be increased incrementally, supported by the necessary infrastructure, which will include workplace
charging points initially, whilst the wider infrastructure roll-out is underway. A target of 5 percent of the
vehicle fleet by 2020 is proposed, increasing to 10 percent by 2025. The modelling focuses on the targeting
of the introduction of electric vehicles to the public transport vehicle fleet at 5 percent in 2020 increasing
to 10 percent in 2025. This may be achieved through the setting of vehicle regulation for certain routes
within the regulated network. The additional investment cost relating to the purchase of electric vehicles,
be it by state owned operator or private bus company, is included within the costing of this intervention.

A resultant shift in new vehicle powertrain is modelled for cars from gasoline to EV from the year 2020
onwards. The annual GHG emission savings are presented in the graph below when the policy is
implemented as part of the Super-Green package of measures. Annual savings of 0.09 MtCO2e are forecast
by 2050.

99.     Implementation barriers. Budgetary pressure constitute the main barrier to implementation, with
the higher cost of vehicles incurring greater upfront capital costs. However, manufacturers have been keen
to promote the new technology and the cost premium over conventional vehicles has fallen recently. The
potential scope for preferential terms in the purchase of a fleet of electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
is strong given the quantity of vehicles in question. Technical barriers to adoption of the new vehicle
technologies might feature initially in the roll-out, with issues such as finding suitable charging locations
and ensuring that the vehicles are placed in usage best suited to their range limitations. These issues may
be expected to be overcome early in the roll-out and new generations of electric and hybrid electric vehicles
with increased range combined with the implementation of the supporting infrastructure will make the
vehicles more practical across the wider range of usage patterns exhibited by agency vehicles.

100. Electric Public Transport Fleet. The adoption of electric or hybrid electric vehicles is also
feasible within another key area of urban transport activity, which is the public transport sector. Diesel
powertrain buses contribute significantly to urban transport emissions, and in particular local air pollution.
                                                             44
                                                         

                                                         

As with the public sector vehicle fleet scheme presented above, this intervention focuses on the targeting
of the introduction of electric vehicles to the public transport vehicle fleet at 5% in 2020 increasing to 10%
in 2025. This may be achieved through offering subsidy for particular routes or by including the
requirement for electric or hybrid electric vehicle usage within the franchising on certain routes within the
regulated network. Many European cities have introduced hybrid powertrain vehicles into their public
transport fleets recently. Hybrid electric vehicles will be operating in Stockholm, Hamburg and
Luxemburg. In Milton Keynes, UK, a fleet of fully electric vehicles operates a busy route between the
city centre and the suburbs which is able to charge wirelessly on the stand at the beginning and end of each
trip. This allows the bus to remain in operation for the whole day with a full charge before leaving the
depot and top-up charges whilst in service.  

101. The additional investment cost relating to the purchase of electric vehicles, be it by state owned
operator or private bus company, is included within the costing of this intervention. The supplemental
cost of the purchase of hybrid-electric vehicles over conventional powertrains is Euro 100,000 per vehicle.
To meet the proposed targets, the purchase of an average of 285 hybrid electric vehicles per year is require.
This equates to an investment of Euro 28.5 million per annum, totalling Euro 300 million over the 10 year
time frame. The timeframe for implementation is phased roll-out to 2025, with an initial pilot of 100
vehicles commencing in 2016.

102. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. The policy is modelled by shifting the powertrain of
a proportion of new vehicles purchased from diesel to EV. The policy comes into full effect in 2025 when
the powertrain of 10 percent of new buses shifts from diesel to EV, with an intermediate step of 5 percent
shifting in 2020. The annual GHG emission savings are presented in the graph below when the policy is
implemented as part of the Super-Green package of measures. Annual savings of 0.12 MtCO2e are forecast
by 2050.

103. The purchase of hybrid vehicles is costly, and operators are typically unwilling to invest in such
vehicles without strong incentives, typically in the form of capital cost subsidy. In addition, the vehicles
require specialist maintenance regimes, and whilst the uptake is still in its infancy this is seen as
challenging in the bus operating environment. Operating cost savings are to a large extent offset by the
specialist maintenance required. However, as the technology becomes more widespread, and industry
knowledge in operations and maintenance increases, these concerns will diminish.

3.4            Regulatory

104. Traffic Management Measures. This intervention is outlined here as an identified measure for
consideration. As an urban measure, and one which is of most relevant to Bucharest in the first instance,
it is pertinent that a significant investment in this area has already been made recently. The modelling of
potential impacts are therefore not appropriate given the current context, as these form part of the baseline.
The historical policies of ‘predict and provide’ in terms of highway infrastructure provision to serve an
ever increasing demand for motorised transport have been replaced by those promoting achieving
maximum efficiency from the existing infrastructure. This is particularly pertinent in urban areas where
space constraints set against increasing traffic levels set a path for increasing congestion without measures
to facilitate efficient movement. Traffic cities across Europe to enhance the smooth flow of traffic on the
urban routes and to enable rapid response to incidents or issues which can lead to downstream congestion.

105. Bucharest has an Urban Traffic Control Centre recently implemented as a joint-venture of
SWARCO AG and UTI International, with funding from Bucharest Municipality and the European Bank
of Reconstruction and Development. The project delivered a new traffic control centre including an
adaptive urban traffic control and public transport management system which it is estimated has reduced
travel times within the controlled area by about 20 percent and achieved a 10 percent reduction in CO2
within the area.60 The extension and wider roll-out of such a system within the capital and in the largest
cities, and areas where urban congestion is most felt could bring about wider benefits.

106. The cost of implementation of urban traffic control systems with the control centres themselves
and the infrastructure which provide the intelligent traffic management functions are highly bespoke to
the situation and requirements. High capital costs combined with ongoing support mean that significant

investment must be made in the implementation of such systems. However, the benefits in terms of
decongestion, both time savings for highway users and operating cost savings, and the benefits to the city
environment and air quality are identified as key benefits. Further extension of traffic management systems
may be appropriate as other cities begin to experience significant congestion. As noted above, the impacts
of this measure were not modelled in this study.  
          
107. Parking Regulation. Effective parking regulation is important to a well-functioning urban
network. In addition to parking charging policies which have been set out earlier in the pricing instrument
analysis, effective regulation on existing parking places and the provision of parking under new
developments is critical. As previously referenced, ITDP has reviewed case studies of parking best practice
in Europe and sets out the key principals and conclusions in its report ‘Europe’s Parking U-Turn’.61 The
mechanisms and procedures for applying parking regulations are in place and can be used to extend
parking regulation wider across the urban areas, to tackle problem areas and to control new development
parking provision. Effective enforcement is however also important, which requires ongoing resources.
Parking regulations can be applied rapidly, subject to the necessary drafting of parking orders and
adherence to notice periods etc. The impact of parking regulation measures are considered to be
complementary to a logical parking charge regime and have not been modelled separately.
          
108. Low Emission Zone. A Low Emission Zone (LEZ) is an area in which vehicles entering are
restricted or deterred based on their emissions levels. This may take the form of a blanket ban on vehicles
with emissions higher than a certain level or by higher emitting vehicles incurring a charge for entering
the zone. These zones may be applied to heavy goods vehicles and or buses only, or to all vehicles. The
driving factor behind the introduction of these zones has typically been due to local air pollutant concerns
and meeting EU air quality standards rather than GHG emissions. More than a dozen EU countries now
have LEZs of some form in place in one or more of their major cities or in some cases to particular routes
or tunnels (eg the Mont Blanc Tunnel which is only accessible to Euro 3 and onwards lorries).62 City based
LEZ examples include Bergen, Durham, London and Oslo for which all vehicles, whether locally
registered or foreign are subject to the access regulations. The regulations vary by scheme and can be
quite complicated. For example, in Milan, from 15th October to 15th April each year, Monday to Friday
0930-1930, petrol vehicles not conforming to Euro1 and diesel vehicles to Euro3 are not allowed within
the zone. Two stroke motorcycles and mopeds not conforming to Euro1 are banned throughout the year.

109. In the context of Romania, Bucharest would represent the most likely target for implementation
of an LEZ, given the city’s reputation not only as the worst for air quality in Romania but in its ranking as
one of the worst in Europe.63 Bucharest already has access restrictions which apply to vehicles over 5 tons,
which are banned from the central area of Bucharest at certain times, and only allowed to circulate outside
of these times with a permit. Extending these restrictions to smaller vehicles, and those with greater

emissions levels, in the form of a Low Emissions Zone, could be strongly beneficial to local air quality.
The impact in terms of carbon emissions savings would be expected to be less marked, with little variation
in fuel consumption between the different Euro standards, although the purchase of newer more efficient
vehicles would lead to some gains. There may however be offsetting impacts, with trips by larger vehicles
replaced by a greater number of smaller vehicle journeys to maintain the city delivery requirements whist
conforming to the restrictions. The costs of implementing a Low Emission Zone would involve the
preparatory studies and impact assessments, the necessary awareness campaigns and signage, and
importantly the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the regulations. The scale of these costs may vary
significantly be nature and complexity of the scheme and by means of enforcement (for example automatic
number plate recognition).

110. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. It has been assumed that the LEZ influences affected
users to purchase more energy efficient vehicles. Affected users will be those who currently undertake
travel activity in the major urban areas. It has been assumed that 5 percent of car users will be affected.
The influence on purchasing decisions has been modelling by bringing forward the average emissions
factors of affected vehicles by 10 years, reflecting the purchase of more efficient vehicles within the
affected user fleet. The annual GHG emission savings are presented in the graph below when the policy is
implemented as part of the Super-Green package of measures. Annual savings of 0.16 MtCO2e are forecast
by 2050.

111. Speed Restrictions. Vehicle fuel consumption increases rapidly when speed progresses beyond
the optimally efficient speed of around 90 km/hour, with fuel consumption rising by up to 20 percent when
cruising at 120 km/hour. Limiting the speed of vehicles to more fuel efficient levels represents a powerful
means of reducing emissions. Romania’s speed limits are currently set at 130 km/hour on motorways, 110
km/hour on expressways, 90 km/hour on other non-urban roads for cars and motorcycles; trucks and buses
are limited to 110 km/hour, 90 km/hour and 80 km/hour respectively. A lowering of the speed limit for all
vehicle types to a speed of 100kph on all road types could be implemented to increase fuel efficiency
levels and reduce emissions.

112. Many European countries have similar speed limits to those in force in Romania. However, certain
countries have applied more stringent speed limits, such as Switzerland which introduced lower speed
limits in 1984 for the environmental benefits the new measures would bring. The Swiss have a speed limit
of 120 km/hour on motorways whilst the speed limit on national roads is just 80 km/hour. Other countries
which have a lower speed limits on motorways include Sweden (110-120 km/hour) and the United
Kingdom (70 miles/hour or 113 km/hour) and Latvia (100 km/hour). The most significant implementation
barrier to reduced vehicle speeds is the political dimension of enforcing the lower speeds and hence
extended journey times on road users. Strong political protest from interest groups including the freight
sector (both domestic and pan-European) may be expected.

113. The cost of implementing a change of speed limits would include the necessary revisions to
regulation and the sensitisation and awareness raising of the public through advertising campaigns.64 The
capital cost of implementing speed reminder signs in the period also need to be taken into account. It is
estimated that these costs could amount to Euro 10 million, which would be incurred within the period of
implementation. Enforcement of speed limits is also a key factor to the effectiveness of the policy.
Allowance has been made within the modelling for a lack of compliance. However, expenditure on
enforcement on high traffic roads enhance policy effectiveness. An allowance of Euro 1 million per annum
for speed limit enforcement has been made. It should also be noted that speed restrictions have wider
economic impacts, including disbenefits associated with longer journey times, which need to be taken into
account when assessing this intervention.

114. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. In the model motorways and expressways are
combined together into a single classification referred to only as motorway as the length of motorway in
Romania is very short, so we have used the expressway speed limit to estimate current average vehicle
speeds. The modelled change in average vehicle speeds which result from reducing the speed limit is
presented below. We have assumed there is 70 percent adherence to the new speed limits. Reducing the
speed limit acts to increase driving efficiency, but also reduce the demand for travel. The increase in
driving efficiency is measured in terms of the reduction in energy consumed. The reduction in trip demand
uses an elasticity between travel time and demand of 0.5 for cars and motorcycles and 0.25 for vans. The


                                                            
64 An alternative and related intervention which was not modelled was enhanced speed limit enforcement. To model this in detail

would require having data on present levels of adherence and an assumption relating to enforcement effectiveness.

3.5             Operational Efficiency

115. Eco-Driving. Eco-driving reduces emissions by reducing the amount of fuel consumed through
efficient driving techniques to reduce the intensity of engine activity to cover the same distance. Eco-
driving programs are well established within the freight sector, given the importance of minimising fuel
consumption to commercial performance. However, eco-driving techniques can equally be applied to all
road usage, to the benefit of drivers operating costs and to environmental objectives. A recent EU funded
study looked at the potential benefits of eco-driving amongst others. The stated aim of the eCoMove
project was to achieve fuel savings of 20 percent through a combination of intelligent transport systems
(ITS) and eco-driving measures.65 The cost of the eCoMove program was Euro 20 million, covering a

                                                            
65 The eCoMove concept is that of the “perfect eco-driver” travelling through the perfectly “eco-managed” road network, i.e. a

combination of cooperative applications for eco-driving and eco-traffic management can – for any given trip by a particular driver
in a particular vehicle – help to approach the theoretical least possible fuel consumption (and thus CO2 emissions), all without
compromising the quality of people’s and goods mobility. See: http://www.ecomove-project.eu/

                                                                              50
                                                        

                                                        

range of research streams. A similar budget is proposed for the implementation of a package of measures
to encourage eco-driving in Romania, including marketing campaigns and driver training programs
targeted initially at drivers of high polluting vehicles including those in the freight sector and public
transport vehicles.

116. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. This package of measures could be included within
the Action Plan timeframe, with a targeted campaign to promote eco-driving commencing by 2020. The
impact of eco-driving measures have been modelled based on evidence of fuel efficiency savings observed
in similar programs, which found that 8 percent efficiency improvements in private car and 4 percent
efficiency improvements in HGV movements (recognizing that eco-measures such as fleet monitoring are
already present in much of the freight sector). It has been assumed that the package of measures will
achieve a 25 percent coverage rate in terms of changing driving behavior, applicable across all journeys,
and as such has been applied as a 2 percent efficiency improvement in car activity and 1 percent in HGV
activity.  The policy has been modelled to reduce the energy consumption as measured in MJ/km. The
annual GHG emission savings are presented in the graph below when the policy is implemented as part of
the Green package of measures. Annual savings of 0.3 MtCO2e are forecast by 2050.

117. Freight Measures. A number of freight sector interventions were identified as potential schemes
for consideration. These included freight consolidation centres and vessel management systems. The
freight sector represents a significant source of road traffic emissions, reflecting the high polluting nature

                                                     51
                                                                

                                                                

of the vehicles and the high levels of transport activity undertaken by these vehicles. Logistics therefore
represents an area for potential carbon abatement. However, the freight industry has very strong incentive
to maximise efficiency, as lower fuel usage leads to cost savings. Given the competitive nature of the
logistics industry, operators are typically considered to be best placed to drive efficiency improvements.
Government intervention is best directed to areas in which the industry cannot deliver investment, or where
market failure is occurring within the competitive environment, such is in the area of air quality for
example. Government assistance to enhance efficiency within the freight sector may include investment
in consolidation centres or freight hubs linking road with rail for example.

118. Investment in freight hubs and logistics hubs forms part of the General Transport Master Plan, and
as such has been included within the baseline. Further proposals regarding the potential for specific freight
investment require more detailed examination than is possible at the strategic level. Given the inclusion of
freight investment proposals within the baseline, and the efficacy of the industry in making efficiency
savings where they are able to, further freight interventions have not been modelled, with preference placed
on other areas of policy in which Government investment can be better focused.

3.6          Urban Planning, Behavioral Change, and Zero Carbon Urban Investment

119. Integrated Land Use and Transport Planning in Urban Areas. Romania has seen large changes
in residential housing following the post-socialist transition, which have contributed to rising
suburbanization.66 While population growth has not been significant in many cities, this has been
compensated by a large reduction in the size of the average household, reflecting a response cramped
living conditions in former communist times. Other significant changes to the housing market have been
the privatization of the existing housing stock, development of residential mortgages, high demand for
residential property from international buyers, and a marked increase in average dwelling unit size. As a
result of these changes, there has been (a) a decrease of residential use in the urban core, as commercial
uses outbid other activities from central zones, leading to residential depopulation and gentrification; (b)
an increased rate of residential suburbanization; and (c) a relaxation of land development controls. The
high growth of vehicle ownership seen over the same period in the region has reflected in large part
suburbanization, which has been supported by large public investments. Thus, unlike many other
developing regions, suburbanization is taking place in the context of slow or negative population growth.
On the positive side, suburbanization patterns have tended to be much denser than in the US. Nevertheless,
the trend of rapid suburbanization over the last two decades is a worrying one if projected forward.

120. Once a country has developed an urban form characterized by extensive urban sprawl, it becomes
exceedingly difficult to control GHG emission growth. This is because low-density development where
there is separated land use, as is common in the US, makes a passenger vehicle the only efficient transport
option. The population density and vehicle km relationship can be weakened according to the type of land-

Dordrecht: Springer. Turkey was obviously not affected by the post-socialist transition, but has also faced the development of
suburbanization.

                                                               52
                                                                

                                                                

use policies in place, such as zoning for mixed use, raising density maximums, and eliminating minimum
parking regulations. Avoiding the development of a US high-energy model and instead developing one
based on more compact, transit served urban city, could reduce transport energy needs by up to three-
quarters. From a transportation perspective, urban sprawl has a number of negative effects, apart from
increasing VKT. It also makes it more difficult to develop financially viable mass transit systems.

121. Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans are being developed for a number of cities in Romania and are
likely to be looking at the implementation of some or all of these interventions; these plans are expected
to be finalized before end 2015. This intervention is outlined in this Report for completeness. However,
it is essentially an urban strategy intervention that would form part of an urban package of measures, and
is within the remit of the urban report under Task C. Emission impacts and costs of this intervention were
therefore not modelled within our project. Integrated land use and transport planning in urban areas
essentially involves close consideration of transport requirements when planning development of urban
areas. The physical layout and design of a city has a direct impact on daily travel patterns (including travel
distance and mode choice) and thus on annual vehicle-km travelled. Many studies have shown that vehicle
dependence and transportation energy consumption per capita are far greater for cities with low-density
suburban residential areas that are a significant distance from the areas where people work and conduct
other significant activities. Using the planning system to reduce the need for long-distance vehicular travel
is potentially an effective contributor to minimising or reducing carbon emissions. A recent World Bank
study on GHG emission mitigation in FYR Macedonia67 identified the following land use planning policies
and regulations that could be used to reduce the need to travel and dependence on the private car:

                     Developments permitted only where good quality access to public transport, walking and
                      cycling facilities is provided as part of the development.
                     New developments that in-fill sites close to city centres and/or refurbish and re-use derelict
                      buildings are encouraged, potentially through regulation or financial incentives.
                     Car parking provision in new/refurbished developments is limited to a maximum and
                      developers are encouraged/required to provide high quality alternatives to the car instead.
                     New developments are required to complement existing uses in the area or where large
                      developments are planned, they are required to be mixed-use, ensuring that amenities such as
                      shopping, schools and other public services are located near to residential areas avoiding the
                      need to travel further afield by car.
There are many examples of good practice that the Romanian Government could look at. Singapore is
often quoted as a good example of a coherent and comprehensive set of land use and development policies

Sjostad forms another good example.69  

122. The cost to the Romanian Government of implementing integrated land use and transport planning
would primarily consist of the cost of establishing well-informed, educated and trained planning
departments in local governments, together with the administrative cost of implementing any regulations
at local or national level. Integrated land use and transport planning could be implemented in a short
timeframe, working within existing government structures. Implementation could start immediately, with
the aim of all Romanian municipalities fully using the approach by 2018. The main barrier to implementing
integrated land use and transport planning would be getting political support and recognition that such an
approach is in the long term interest of Romania rather than a ‘laissez-faire’ approach to planning. Study
tours of places—for example through the European Covenant of Mayors program—with good practice
may help gain high level acceptance for the intervention.

123. Investment in Infrastructure for Zero Carbon Modes. Investment in infrastructure for zero
carbon transport modes (walking and cycling) has the potential for reducing carbon emissions by
encouraging shift towards those modes. This can result from provision of infrastructure and services that
make use of such modes more feasible for more journeys, quicker, more convenient, safer, more
comfortable or more pleasant. In the context of this project, we focussed on urban infrastructure
improvements because urban areas are where there is greatest potential for shifting significant numbers of
people to walking and cycling because of the relatively short distances travelled. Infrastructure investment
may include investing in packages to improve the quantity or quality of some or all of the following:
         Cycle paths and cycle lanes

                     Cycle parking facilities
                     Footpaths
                     Pedestrianization of streets
                     Pedestrian and cycle crossings
124. A number of European cities have excellent cycling and pedestrian infrastructure and as a result
have high levels of cycling and walking embedded in their culture. Well-known examples include
Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Groningen and Munich. Many other European cities are currently
investing in cycling and walking infrastructure in an attempt to grow their trip modal share. The investment

for 5000. 3km from the city centre on a 160 hectare brownfield industrial site, the street layout and the mix of land uses is designed
to make the streets attractive to pedestrians and cyclists, with traffic and services concentrated along the central avenue. The latest
modal split figures for Hammarby Sjostad show that 52 percent of trips are made on public transport, 27 percent on foot or by
bike, with car journeys accounting for only 21 percent. See: Thriving cities: Integrated land use and transport planning. Report

circumstances and the extent of the targeted shift.

125. The city of Bogotá (Colombia) provides an interesting illustration of potential costs and benefits.
Here, based on advice from Dutch cycling planners, Euro 178 million was invested in transforming the
city’s cycling infrastructure over a 10 year period from the mid-1990s.70 This resulted in an increase in
cycling trip mode share in the city from 0.9 percent to 4 percent over that period. Taking account of dollar
inflation, Euro 178 million in 2000 values (the midpoint of the implementation period) is equivalent to
around Euro 232 million in 2011 dollar values. At that mid-point, the population of Bogota was around
6.3 million people, so the investment per person over 10 years was equivalent to Euro 37 per person (2011
values). Based on a similar level of investment per head of population, an investment cost of Euro 75
million is adopted for the 20 largest cities in Romania. Investment in improved cycling and walking
infrastructure would require a long term program. However, such a program could in principle be started
(subject to availability of funding) in the near future. The main barrier to implementation would be political
and public acceptance that the benefits of investment in these modes outweigh any disbenefits arising from
reallocating road space or traffic priority away from motorized vehicles.

126. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. The investment in walking and cycling implemented
in Bogota saw cycling trips increase from 0.9 percent to 4 percent of daily trips within a decade. This
scale of increase is considered to be feasible within the context of Romania, as despite climatic differences,
the potential for certain trips to be replaced by cycle trips is present. The trips replaced by cycle trips tend
to be the shorter distance trips by nature. Overall, a 4 percent shift in urban car trips to walking and cycling
was modelled for all major urban areas. The annual GHG emission savings are presented in the graph
below when the policy is implemented as part of the Green package of measures. A maximum annual
saving of 0.09 MtCO2e is projected for between 2020 and 2025, however the impact tails off to 0.07
MtCO2e in 2050 as other polices act to suppress trips.

127. Investment in public transport infrastructure. Investment in public transport infrastructure has
the potential for reducing carbon emissions by encouraging shift towards that mode. The Romanian
General Transport Master Plan (GTMP) that is included in the Business as Usual scenario already includes
very significant investment in public transport infrastructure on the strategic transport network, including
the national rail system. Investment is also required to maintain and enhance the urban public transport
system. It not within the scope of this study to undertake modelling of specific transport infrastructure
schemes at the urban level, but the importance of an efficient and well-functioning public transport systems
is highlighted here as a prerequisite to ensuring that the modelled strategic policies are effective in
achieving the expected levels of carbon mitigation. Without insufficient investment in maintaining and
enhancing the urban public transport network, modal shift towards private car will accelerate and the
policies which promote modal shift will be less effective without a sufficiently attractive alternative to
private modes.

128. Public transport in Bucharest includes a metro system (operated by Metrorex), a tram network,
trolley buses, and an extensive bus network (all operated by RATB). In other Romanian cities and towns,
public transport consists of buses, minibuses, trolley buses and trams. The city of Brasov took the decision
in 2005 to abandon its tram line due to the prohibitive cost of upgrading and maintaining and is focusing
on buses and trolley buses. Cluj-Napoca has upgraded its tram system, while other cities have similar
plans but lack funding to implement them. Although data is hard to obtain, it is understood that public
transport patronage in many Romanian towns and cities is in decline, with a corresponding increase in
private traffic levels. For example, in Ploiesti, public transport patronage fell from 7 million trips per
month in 2011 to 6.7 million in 2012.71

129. Many European cities provide excellent examples of high quality urban public transport
infrastructure. The 2011 COST action TU0603 report ‘Buses with High Level of Service’ presents

examples of different aspects of good practice from 35 European cities.72 The investment in infrastructure
required to achieve modal shift from private cars towards public transport depends strongly on local
circumstances (including the state of current infrastructure and patronage levels) and the extent of the
targeted shift. Modelling of the potential impact of particular public transport schemes at the city level
requires a level of detailed city level information and modelling assumptions that was outside the scope of
this study. However, investment in improved public transport infrastructure in Romanian cities requires a
long term program which must not be neglected as ancillary to the strategic objectives of the GTMP.

130. Investment in smarter choices/behavioural change programs. Over recent years there has been
an increasing interest in and focus on ‘soft’ transport policies as a means of changing travel behaviour.
‘Smarter choices’ behavioural change programs seek to provide better information to travellers on the
travel choices they have available to them, and in highlighting the potential benefits which considering
more sustainable transport modes (eg walking and cycling) may bring to them. Schemes and policies
which typically fall under the ‘smarter choices’ banner include: (a) workplace and school travel plans; (b)
personalized travel planning, travel awareness campaigns and public transport information and marketing;
(c) car clubs and car sharing schemes; and (d) teleworking, teleconferencing and home shopping.

131. Examples of best practice can case study evidence can be found across Europe. In the UK a number
of cities have received funding to implement smarter choices programs as part of the Sustainable Travel
Demonstration Town initiative and in Scotland, soft policies were trialled in seven cities as part of the
Smarter Choices Smarter Places Program. Each of these initiatives involved investment of GBP 15 million
spread across the cities, with investment in active travel infrastructure and behaviour change activities
targeted at achieving an increase in active travel, increased public transport use and reduced emissions.
Follow up monitoring of the programs identified statistically significant increases in walking and cycling
and a reduction in car trips.

132. In Romania, a Smarter Choices program could be effectively focused on the largest urban areas,
such as the twenty cities with over 100,000 population, and designed to complement the investment
programs such as the walking and cycling infrastructure investment scheme. Travel planning programs
concentrated on the largest employment sites and schools, combined with travel awareness campaigns
would enhance the effectiveness of infrastructure investment. A proposed investment budget of Euro 23
million spread across the largest urban areas is proposed, based on similar spend levels to the UK based
schemes (not including infrastructure which is covered in other policies here).

133. Modelling approach used and GHG benefits. This policy has been modelled as a mode shift for
urban trips from car and motorcycle to bus, rail and walking modes. A mode shift of 3.2 percent from car
and 1.1 percent from motorcycle have been assumed. These values represent a shift of 5 percent of car
trips and 2.5 percent of motorcycle trips. The trips are reapportioned in equal measure to bus, rail and
walk. The annual GHG emission savings are presented in the graph below when the policy is implemented

4.1      Introduction

134. The range of potential interventions have been defined and costed and assessed in terms of carbon
abatement potential. The measures have been modelled individually to assess their relative mitigation
potential and value for money in terms of investment against estimated abatement potential. These metrics
sit alongside wider qualitative co-benefits to inform the ranking of those most appropriate for inclusion
within the Green Scenario. The interventions performing best in the multi criteria appraisal were included
in the Green Scenario, with explanation of why each should be pursued. An explanation of why the other
options were not selected for adoption. However, all interventions have been included in the Super Green
Scenario in order to assess an upper bound for slow GHG emission growth from the transport sector. No
specific pre-defined GHG saving targets were used to constrain the choice of interventions, as a bottom-
up approach was adopted. The identified measures have been drawn from a range of policy categories
including: (a) pricing instruments; (b) technology; (c) regulatory; (d) operational efficiency; and (e)
behavioral change and urban investments.

135. Figure 34 provide a summary of the cumulative abatement results for each intervention over 2015-
2050, while the table below provides a breakdown of the abatement potential per intervention in three
different time periods. The measures which have the potential to deliver the greatest absolute carbon
savings over the course of the modelled period are as follows: (a) the lowering of speed limits (speed
restrictions); (b) increasing the fuel tax (as a substitute to more sophisticated road user charging); (c) the
implementation of a more progressive first registration tax (Environmental Stamp) promoting the adoption
of low emission vehicles; and (d) eco-driving programs which encourage more efficient driving patterns,
with advertising campaigns targeted at private car users and training programs focused on the freight and
public transport sector.

4.2          Marginal Abatement Cost Analysis

136. Having identified the abatement potential for each of the interventions modelled, consideration
needs to be given to the most effective areas of investment to achieve emission reduction. Marginal
abatement cost (MAC) analysis provides a framework within which to guide investment decisions,
identifying the levels of abatement possible and at what level of investment cost. A key component of the
MAC analysis is the cost of each intervention, in terms both of capital cost and ongoing operational and
maintenance costs. The implementation and ongoing costs of delivering the identified schemes have been
estimated using case study evidence and a variety of sources of estimated costs applied to the Romanian
context. The scope of the estimated costs are limited to those borne directly by the Government of
Romania in terms of capital investment costs and ongoing operational and maintenance costs. The
potential costs or operating cost savings borne by the private sector are not estimated or included within
the MAC analysis. The basis for the cost estimation has been set out for each intervention in the preceding
chapter.73 Table 17 summarizes the mitigation potential of each intervention against scheme value for
money based on the cost per ton of carbon abated. A summary of the qualitative assessment of the wider


                                                            
73 Costs—capital and operational and maintenance costs—are discounted at a discount rate of 4 percent to provide the net present

value (NPV). The abatement cost is hence cost (NPV) divided by total undiscounted cumulative carbon reduction over 2015-
2050. The choice was made not to discount carbon savings as the resulting value is an abstract figure which cannot be directly
compared back to any graph and would not be easily cross-compared to other literature evidence of abatement costs.

4.3                 Development of the Green Scenario

137. The decision on which interventions to include in the Green Scenario were derived from a multi-
criteria analysis that took into account the following: (a) scheme investment cost to the government; (b)
cumulative emission savings; (c) carbon reduction cost effectiveness; (d) deliverability and economic
important; and (e) wider benefits). The performance of each intervention against these criteria are provided
in The tables above provide a basis for identifying the schemes which perform well in terms of investment
value, and also in terms of required investment cost and potential implementation barriers. The scheme
performance is summarized below, ranked by value for money in terms of carbon reduction cost
effectiveness. Scheme performance under each criteria has been assigned a rating, based on
straightforward three tier ranking as detailed in     Table 19.

138. In order to achieve significant levels of carbon abatement, two schemes stand out above others.
The implementation of speed restrictions is demonstrated to have significant potential to reduce vehicle
emissions levels. Fuel taxation also can make a significant contribution to reducing emissions, through a
combination of market forces acting to reduce the demand for travel and also in influencing purchasing
decisions towards more efficient vehicles. Both of these policies have significant wider implications for
the economy, with costs in terms of increased journey times in the case of speed restrictions and economic
burden of higher taxation. In order to make meaningful reductions in carbon emissions in the transport
sector, it is likely that at least one of these measures be adopted in some form. The wider costs and benefits
will play an important role in determining the most appropriate, but ultimately it is likely that the political
acceptability of one or other measure ultimately determines which may be more politically palatable.

139. In the near term, whilst politically challenging and economically burdensome in particularly on
the lower income households, applying increases in fuel taxation is more practicable. The requirements
to change speed restrictions, with the associated awareness campaigns and need for reminder signage and
enforcement would involve greater upheaval. It is therefore recommended that fuel taxation be considered
as a key tool in achieving significant carbon abatement over the period of the Action Plan and Strategy.
                                                                      63
                                                       

                                                       

Of the ‘second tier’ intervention measures which may contribute valuable abatement to carbon emissions
in absolute terms, the new vehicle registration tax is identified as a tool which can bring significant carbon
savings through the influencing of purchasing decisions. Again, this measure has the potential to create
adverse political pressure, even whilst remaining fiscally neutral, and may have negative equity
implications in the increased taxation of older and less efficient vehicles. However, as seen in countries
across Europe, influencing the make-up of the vehicle fleet at point of purchase is an effective means of
encouraging evolution towards a lower emitting vehicle stock. The benefits of this continue to be realised
over time, and represent a particularly important opportunity in the face of a high projected growth rate in
motorisation levels and car ownership.

140. Eco-driving programs also offer significant potential for the reduction in vehicle emissions, and
unlike the previous interventions, there are no significant barriers to implementation or adverse impacts.
In fact, eco-driving offers significant potential wider benefits in the form of cost savings for motorists and
enhanced environmental and safety benefits. Investment costs will vary according to the nature of the
program implemented, but studies have highlighted the measures as performing strongly in terms of both
overall impacts and value for money.

141. The following interventions perform strongly in value for money terms and should also be
considered for adoption within the action plan, and as a feature of the Green Scenario.

       Smarter choices programs combined with investment in walking and cycling infrastructure have
        been demonstrated to lead to modal shift, achieving not only a reduction in emissions levels but
        also significant wider benefits including health and wellbeing, and decongestion. In cost-benefit
        analysis, these schemes typically perform strongly, with cost-benefit ratios in excess of 20 by
        comparison with highway and public transport schemes in the low single figures. This analysis
        demonstrates that with concerted and sustained investment over the strategy period, emissions
        savings realized at a reasonable level of cost effectiveness.

       Parking pricing is a further market based measure which offers the potential for emissions
        savings with a high level of cost effectiveness. Indeed, the measure would be expected to offer a
        stream of revenue which could facilitate some of the investment measures highlighted above.
        Parking pricing, in conjunction with tightened parking regulation and enforcement, may be
        considered to be a more cost effective more readily implementable solution to in town congestion
        instead of urban congestion charging and most European cities are following this strategy in
        preference to congestion charging; and

       Air travel taxation presents a mechanism for exerting some control over the growing demand for
        air travel at the margins, and also offers a revenue stream which may be put to useful purpose.
        The implications for the economy need to be considered, but there is are potentially positive equity
        impacts in what may be expected to be a strongly progressive form of taxation.

142. Based on the analysis of the abatement potential of the identified measures and on the results of
wider assessment, the following measures are proposed for consideration within the Action Plan period
under the Green Scenario:

           Fuel Price Taxation Increase
           New Vehicle Registration Tax
           Eco-Driving Program
           Smarter Choices/Personal Travel Planning Programs
           Investment in Walking and Cycling Infrastructure
           Parking Pricing
           Air Travel Taxation


143. Of the above measures, the market based policies where the taxation mechanisms already in place
require no significant capital investment. The combined undiscounted capital investment of the above
infrastructure dependent measures totals Euro 136 million over the timeframe of the Strategy under the
Green Scenario, but rise sharply for the Super Green Scenario (Table 20). For the Green Scenario, Euro
93 million of investment is profiled to fall within the period of the Action Plan, with ongoing investment
in walking and cycling measures extending beyond 2022, based on a ten year investment profile. The
mitigation impact of the combined bundle of interventions included within the Green Scenario is presented
in Figure 36, together with the mitigation of the Super Green Scenario. Note that the impact of the bundle
of measures is not identical to the sum of the individual measures due to the inter-relationship between
certain policies.

144. The remaining interventions modelled as part of the study have not been considered suitable for
inclusion within the Green Scenario, reflecting either the lower value for money based on the MAC
analysis, or deliverability challenges. Non-inclusion within the Green Scenario does not however mean
that the schemes have no value or that these should not be considered for implementation in Romania
based on wider appraisal criteria such as economic impact or local air quality. The high costs of the Super
Scenario are driven by the high cost of urban congestion charging scheme, but in terms of initial investment
and operating and maintenance costs.

145. The promotion of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) has a place within government policy,
and indeed incentives are currently offered for the purchase of low emitting vehicles both in terms of direct
subsidy and as an additional stackable incentive under the existing scrappage scheme. Take-up of electric
or plug-in electric vehicles to date has been low, which is likely to be a reflection of the limited existing
infrastructure for such vehicles. Large scale investment in charging infrastructure would have the potential
to increase take-up. However, this infrastructure has been seen to come at high cost, based on existing
technology and the current commercial suppliers operating within this market. The technology is evolving
rapidly, and already exposing mis-allocation of investment based on the approaches adopted by the
countries early to provide supporting infrastructure. Equally, the marketplace is changing, and new
business models relating to the provision of charging infrastructure are being developed, whether by
vehicle manufacturers or by private suppliers identifying commercial potential. As such, it is considered
that the high level of investment required to hasten the implementation of supporting infrastructure does
not represent best value for money or lead to sufficient emissions reduction savings or wider benefits to
merit immediate consideration.

146. Equally, whilst target setting relating to the acquisition of ULEVs within the public sector fleet
and the public transport fleet may be considered laudable as a means of promoting and raising awareness
about the technology, the cost of the new technology remains high by comparison with the emissions
savings achieved, and the technological barriers to effective integration within the fleets are also notable
in the near term. Speed restrictions have been rejected in preference to higher fuel duties due to the
implementation difficulties, the economic impact and the lack of revenue generated by such a measure.
Low Emission Zones are demonstrated to have carbon saving potential, although the driving force behind
implementation of such policies is typically local air quality. With its very poor air quality standards,
Bucharest would potentially benefit most significantly from such a measure, and the policy should be
considered within this context. However, with high implementation and operating costs, technological
and enforcement barriers and potential political resistance, the pursuing of such a policy in the
short/medium term is not considered cost effective as a means of carbon emissions saving.



                                                                        66
                                                        

                                                        

4.4       Conclusion

147. To demonstrate the scale of mitigation achievable under a high intervention or Super Green
scenario, the Green Scenario policies as well as policies which were not selected for inclusion within the
Green Scenario, but which nevertheless provide GHG emission saving potential amongst wider benefits
have been included. The Super Green Scenario therefore represents an all policy modelled scenario. The
scale of abatement potential achievable in the Super Green Scenario by comparison with the Green
Scenario and the BAU scenario is presented in Figure 36.

148. Under the BAU scenario emissions grow by 34 percent over 2015-2050, while under the Green
Scenario emissions growth slows to 24 percent and under the Super Green Scenario growth slows to 17
percent. In all cases GHG emissions from the transport sector rise. These results are in line with many
studies which suggest that reducing GHG emissions in the transport sector—as opposed to reducing GHG
emission growth rate—is difficult in the transport sector. In order to reach a low emission scenario in 2050
Romania’s transport sector has to have close to zero emissions, which will need large changes in behavior
and technology. However, this growth in GHG emissions has to be seen in the context of a growing real
economy. Figure 37 reveals that under a Green Scenario there is a gradual decoupling of GHG emissions
from transport with growth in the economy.

                          ANNEX 1: TECHNICAL MODELLING NOTE

Overview

This technical note sets out the structure of the Romania Transport Emissions Model and the development
of the emissions baseline projections. This note identifies what the key datasets are, defines the values
used for the BAU scenario, and later benchmarks the resulting GHG emissions of this baseline scenario.
The emissions model is comprised of four modules which produce the input matrices for the emissions
engine which calculates the GHG emissions. The four modules are:

                Transport Demand
                Vehicle Stock
                Vehicle and driving efficiency
                Fuel consumption and emissions
Each module takes a number of baseline datasets as input and applies the effect of relevant policies to
them. The adjusted datasets are then input to the emissions engine which calculates the resulting GHG
emissions. The process is outlined in the figure below.

Description of Input Datasets

This emissions model has been developed in a format which ensures as far as possible that it is
straightforwardly compatible with the datasets which are used as model inputs. These datasets are
discussed in detail below, but include the National Transportation Model, COPERT and Eurostat statistics.
                                                         69
                                                          

                                                          

Model outputs are also structured to provide relevant output statistics and results which can be compared
with other studies. The format of the model outputs have been drawn from the SULTAN emissions model
which was used to conduct Europe wide transport emissions modelling work for the European
Commission. The model operates using a number of key desegregations including mode, powertrain, fuel
used and location type (urban, non-urban, highway)

As mentioned above, a number of datasets belong to each of the four modules. The module holds the
baseline values for each dataset as default and applies the effect of the policies to them. The datasets which

The data is required for each of the model time horizons which are: 2011 (the base year), 2015, 2020,
2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045 and 2050. The terminology for Mega and million or kilo and thousand are
used interchangeably depending on the usual use for each data. A range of data sources were considered
to identity the most appropriate baseline values for Romania. These sources include:
                   COPERT: a database of road transport demand, stock and emissions– provides Romania
                    specific dataset.
                   TREMOVE: a behavior based transport model for the EU - model inputs include Romania
                    specific data
                   SULTAN: a transport emissions model for the EU – provides average values for the EU
                   Eurostat – provides transport data specific to Romania
                   EU Energy, Transport and GHG Emissions, Trends to 2050, Reference Scenario 2013, – used
                    outputs specific to Romania
                   Romanian National Transport Model
No single source provides all of the data required for the emissions model because different sources
specialise in certain modes and because sources differ on their definitions of mode -for example Eurostat
groups some van journeys with passenger cars, while COPERT separates out all van journeys.

Demand Module

Vehicle Capacity 
SULTAN provides EU wide average capacity for all modes. The TREMOVE dataset, which is specific to
Romania, largely matches that of SULTAN, however does not include every mode and it used different
categories for truck. We have taken most values from SULTAN with the exception of inland shipping.
The nature of inland shipping in Romania is atypical within the EU because of the heavy use of push and
dumb vessels on the Danube.74
The average capacity was instead calculated using Eurostat data, by dividing the total tonnage of inland
vessels (including dumb) by the number of push vehicles. This provides a value of 4,566 tons which is
more than double that of the EU average used in SULTAN of 2,000 tons.75 Vehicle capacity remains
constant across the time horizons.

                                                            
74 These vessels can transport much higher loads than the normal barge, a comparison of vessel capacities can be found here:

 respectively. Average loads are all higher in TREMOVE, which is to be expected in Romania. We have
 therefore used the TREMOVE values for load where available. Table A7 presents the values for load
 used in 2011 and their source and Figure A1 shows how the chosen profiles vary through time. There are
 two deviations from the available TREMOVE or SULTAN data:
              The load for passenger rail in TREMOVE appears too high and produces values for rail energy
               demands much lower than those reported in Eurostat, therefore the load for passenger rail was
               taken from SULTAN.
              The load of inland shipping provided by SULTAN is probably not typical of Romania because
               of the unique use of the Danube, we have therefore taken a provision value of 50% which yields
               levels of energy usage expected by Eurostat.

Passenger and Freight Demand 
Estimations of total transport demand are provided by COPERT, Trends to 2050, TREMOVE and
Eurostat. Table A8 compares data from these datasets and presents the chosen values for the base year,
2011. Statistics for road transport demand provided by COPERT and Eurostat differ, however COPERT
                                                             74
                                                            

                                                            

provides more detailed within the data, for example it identifies demand by location and it separates out
more modes. We have therefore taken COPERT values in most cases for road transport. The exception is
the demand for heavy trucks, for which COPERT records double the ton-km than Eurostat. One possible
reason is that Eurostat data relates only to vehicles registered in Romania, whereas COPERT data might
relate to all heavy trucks operating inside Romania. To help benchmark the model we have used the
Eurostat value provisionally as this is the value that would have been used as part of the Trends to 2050
modelling.

The emissions model requires the total demand to be broken down by location. COPERT provides this
data for road transit. For the remaining modes we have used the EU wide averages presented in SULTAN.

Projected changes to future demand have been taken from the ‘Environmental and Economic Scenario’ of
the NTM. This model forecasts transport demand up to 2040, so the trends were extrapolated to 2050. The
NTM only models non-urban and highway trips, therefore the projected growth has only been applied to
demand at these locations. This also serves to avoid an overlap with the urban modelling team. Figure A2:
presents the change in demand that is forecast by the NTM, and Figure A3 applies these trends to the
demand for transport.

Vehicle Stock Module

Estimates of the total vehicle stock in 2011 are provided by Eurostat and COPERT. The chosen values for
2011 are presented in Table A10 below. Values presented by COPERT and Eurostat often differ. For
example Eurostat reports there to be 4,335,000 cars in 2011 compared to 5,284,494 by COPERT. However
we have chosen to use COPERT values for most modes because this data explicitly concerns vehicle data.

 To project vehicle stock to 2050 we have set the number of vehicles as proportional the change in
 demand.76 The split of each mode by powertrain for all vehicles in use in 2011 is presented in Table A11.
 COPERT provides the most detailed data on the number of vehicles by powertrain, so its values have
 been used where possible. Eurostat data has been used in conjunction with Marfa, the Romania’s rail
 freight operator, to provide the split between diesel and electric rail locomotives. SULTAN values were
 used for air and shipping.

76The vehicle lifecycle model is taken from SULTAN, and is based on survival rates which decline with vehicle age. Vehicles
drop out of the fleet according to this survival profile, and are replaced in the quantity required to meet the fleet size growth
profile.

Split of New Vehicles by Powertrain 
The powertrain split of all vehicles in 2011 provides the baseline conditions for the model. However a key
element for future projections of emissions is the type of vehicles that will be purchased in the future.
Values for the powertrain split of new vehicles have been taken from the BAU scenario of the Trends to
2050 scenario set used in SULTAN. Although these projections are not specific to Romania, these are
taken presently as the best estimates available. Table A12 presents the split of new vehicles for the decadal
time horizons.

Vehicle and Driving Efficiency Module

The emissions model calculates the total energy used by vehicles of each powertrain. This requires an
estimation of the average energy consumption for each powertrain, which is measured in Mega Joules per
km (MJ/km). The model uses values presented in the BAU scenario for SULTAN as part of the Trends to
2050 scenario set. SULTAN uses 2009 as its base year instead of 2011, therefore we derived values for
the average energy consumption by powertrain for vehicles operating in 2011 by applying historical
changes in Romania’s vehicle stock from 2009 to 2011.

Fuel Composition and Emissions Module

Hybrid vehicles have dual power sources, combining electricity with gasoline or diesel. This model uses
a ratio of energy consumption of 70 percent electricity to 30 percent gasoline or diesel. This split follows
that used in the SULTAN scenarios. Direct GHG emissions are those produced from the vehicles’ exhaust
pipe due to combustion of the fuel. As such vehicles running on electricity and hydrogen don’t create any
direct GHG emissions. The quantity of GHG gasses emitted for each Mega Joule of energy provided is
referred to as the emissions factor - this is measured in Kg of CO2e per Mega Joule (KgCO2e/MJ). The
GHG emission factors for each fuel have been provided by the SULTAN BAU dataset.77 This dataset
foresees improvements in the quantity of GHGs emitted over time as shown in Figure A8. The SULTAN

the Routes to 2050 work. The fuel assumption is incorporated into the model and an indirect emission factor which evolves over
time as electricity production becomes cleaner. Emissions factors in kgCO2e/MJ have been modelled as followed: 0.1109 (2011),
0.10258 (2015), 0.09908 (2020), 0.0892 (2025), 0.07939 (2030), 0.06466 (2035), 0.050 (2040), 0.040 (2045), and 0.030 (2050).

Indirect emissions are those produced in the course of sourcing, refining and transporting the fuel from its
source to the vehicle. Again we have referred to the SULTAN BAU dataset for these values. As supposed
to direct emissions, all fuels have indirect emissions associated with them, especially electricity and
hydrogen power. The baseline trend in indirect emissions to 2050 is presented in Figure A9 and Figure
A10.

Biofuel Substitution 
Gasoline and diesel sold within the EU contains a proportion of biofuel, at present approximately 3% of
gasoline and 5% of diesel is biofuel. Biofuels aim to be carbon natural because the GHG emissions
produced when they are burnt are offset by the abstraction of CO2 from the atmosphere when they are
grown. Table A14 presents the projected increase in biofuel as a share of fuel to 2050; this data follows
that of the SULTAN BAU scenario. Biofuels are an emerging technology therefore the carbon savings
they currently yield are modest at 64% for gasoline and 54% diesel. However as the technology improves
we expect these rates to improve into the future, as shown in Table A15. Again this data follows that of
the SULTAN BAU scenario.

Benchmarking BAU Results

The emissions model produces three key outputs which are readily benchmarked against existing studies,
these are:

                         Transport activity - measured in million passenger-kms (Mpkm) or million ton-kms (Mtkm)


                                                                          84
                                                                        

                                                                        

          Final energy demand – in kilo ton of oil equivalent (ktoe)
          GHG emissions - in Mega ton of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e)
The first point, transport activity, is a key input to the model in the base year however the projection of
how transport activity changes from 2011 to 2050 is an important output which requires to be benchmarked
against other studies. The following two publications are useful sources of information to benchmark base
year (2011) results:

          EU Energy, Transport and GHG Emissions: Trends to 2050, reference scenario 2013
          Eurostat figures, as presented in the Statistical pocketbook for Transport 2013
There is a considerable degree of cross over between these publications. The statistical pocketbook
presents Eurostat data tables in an easily understood manner, and the Trends to 2050 study used Eurostat
data for its baseline. Both sources are referred to because neither source is complete for the benchmarking
task:

          The Trends to 2050 study provides estimates for final energy demand which are not provided by
           the statistical pocketbook, and
          The statistical pocketbook provides values for 2011, the base year, whereas Trends to 2050
           provides data for 2010.

Transport Activity 
As expected levels of transport activity provided by Trends to 2050 match those of Eurostat for the year
2010, with the exception of Inland navigation. The reason for the discrepancy with inland navigation is
unknown. The activity levels for car and buses used in our emissions model are lower than Eurostat
because we have used values from COPERT were possible. This is also the reason why truck activity is
slightly higher. Activity levels for all other modes have been taken from Eurostat or Trends to 2050, so
they must match.

Energy Demand 
The unit for energy which is used in the emissions model is the Mega Joule (MJ) and Peta Joule (PJ).
However Trends to 2050 and the statistical pocketbook use kilo ton of oil equivalent (ktoe). 1 PJ is equal
to 41.868 ktoe. The base year energy demand from our emissions model matches well the values provided
by Trends to 2050 and Eurostat for road based transit. Our model doesn’t match so well the rail and aviation
values.

GHG Emissions 
Neither Trends to 2050 nor the Statistical pocketbook provide GHG emission values for our base year,
2011. We have therefore extrapolated our model results backwards from 2011 to 2010 to provide a dataset
we can compare. Table A18 shows a close correlation between the results of our emissions model and
Eurostat estimations of emissions for 2010 for most modes. Emissions from aviation do appear to be higher
in our emissions model. It should be remembered here that TRANSEPT uses Eurostat values for heavy
truck activity in place of COPERT values which were twice as high. If we used the COPERT measure of
heavy truck activity then this would add on 2.57 MtCO2e.

    We have compared our BAU results to the Trends to 2050 study. This study made projections of transport
    activity, energy demand and GHG emissions for every European country to 2050.

 
Transport Activity 
The table below compares the projections of transport activity (demand) from our emissions model with
Trends to 2050. The projections in our model have been taken from NTM to 2030 and extrapolated
thereafter. It should be remembered that we only applied growth in trips to non-urban and highway
locations. The key differences in the projections are:
               (a) The emissions model forecasts less passenger growth than Trends to 2050, however this is
                   to be expected because our urban trips do not grow (Figure A12).


                                                             87
                                                                                             

                                                                                             

                                             (b) The emissions model forecasts nearly double the growth in freight activity to 2050. This is
                                                 partly due to the extrapolation of a high rate of growth from 2040 to 2050. The difference
                                                 in freight activity is presented in Figure A13.

                   (a) The emissions model forecasts higher growth in car and motorcycle trips, despite no increase in
                       urban trips
                                             (b) The growth in Bus, rail and aviation activity is much smaller in our emissions model
                                                 compared to Trends to 2050. It could be that Trends to 2050 observes considerable increases
                                                 in buses and rail use in the urban areas.
                                             (c) All freight modes see considerably more use in our emissions model compared with Trends
                                                 to 2050.

        Energy Demand 
        Projections for energy demand largely match the growth in transport activity described above. The
        emissions model see less growth in the energy demand for bus, rail, air, but much larger increases for
        trucks. Overall our emissions model projects a greater increase in energy demand to 2050 compared to
        Trends 2050, despite holding urban area activity constant.

        GHG Emissions 
        The key output of the Trends to 2050 study is projections of GHG emissions to 2050. It should be noted
        that the estimation of GHG emissions by Trends to 2050 in 2010 has been revised upwards in the Transport
        Statistical Pocketbook 2013. This raised the value from 14.5 MtCO2e to 15.8 MtCO2e. This indicates that
        the Trends to 2050 model might underestimate emissions overall. Table A10 compares the projections of
        GHG emissions, which is also presented graphically in Figure A14. Overall our emissions model forecasts
        a greater growth in GHG emissions to 2050; this is to be expected because our growth in energy demand
        is higher. The principal driver of higher GHG growth in TRANSEPT is the higher projected vehicle
        activity levels taken from the National Transport Model. This model represents the planned investment in
        highway, rail and port infrastructure as well as the underlying drivers of travel demand such as growth in
        real GDP and car ownership.
