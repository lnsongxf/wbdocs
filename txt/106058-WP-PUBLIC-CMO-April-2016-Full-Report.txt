Executive Summary
Most commodity price indexes rebounded in February-March from their January lows on improved market sentiment
and a weakening dollar. Still, average prices for the first quarter fell compared to the last quarter of 2015, with energy
prices down 21 percent and non-energy prices lower by 2 percent. Given the recent rebound in oil prices and expected
supply tightening in the second half of the year, the crude oil price forecast for 2016 has been raised to $41 per barrel
(bbl), up from $37/bbl in the January assessment (and represents a drop of 19 percent from 2015.) Metals prices are
projected to decline 8 percent, a slightly smaller drop than anticipated in January due to supply reductions. Agricul-
tural prices have been revised marginally lower on signs of adequate harvests in major producers, and are expected to
register a decline of 4 percent from last year. Looking to 2017, a modest price recovery is projected for most commodities
as demand strengthens. Crude oil is projected to rise to $50/bbl as the market moves into balance. This issue of the
Commodity Markets Outlook examines the implications of resource development in an era of lower commodity prices
and concludes that ambitious improvements in governance and sounder macroeconomic policies are required to miti-
gate delays and risks.

                             Resource development in an era
                                 of cheap commodities1
During the commodities super cycle that began in the early 2000s, many resource-rich countries benefitted from surging
exploration, investment, and production activities, which transformed growth prospects. In 2016, with oil and metals
prices 50-70 percent below their early-2011 peaks, these patterns have been reversed, adversely affecting many com-
modity-exporting countries. Project development has already been put on hold or delayed in several Emerging Markets
and Developing Economies (EMDEs). It would take ambitious governance improvements in EMDEs—for example, to
the levels prevailing in advanced markets—to mitigate the delays in ongoing development of large mines resulting from
falling metals prices (up to four years for some of the largest mines in EMDEs). Governments seeking to develop natural
resources may consider delaying new initiatives until the price outlook turns more favorable.

 Notes: n/a implies data not available. Industrial roundwood, reported in cubic meters solid volume underbark (i.e. exclusing bark), is an aggregate comprising sawlogs and
 veneer logs; pulpwood, round and split; and other industrial roundwood except wood fuel. Sawnwood, reported in cubic meters solid volume, includes wood that has been
 produced from both domestic and imported roundwood, either by sawing lengthways or by a profile-chipping process and that exceeds 6mm in thickness.

M    ost commodity prices rebounded from their January lows
on improved market sentiment and a weakening dollar. Still,
average prices fell in the first quarter—energy down 21 percent
and non-energy down 2 percent. The crude oil price forecast has
been raised to $41/bbl for 2016 (up from $37/bbl in January)
on expected supply tightening in the second half of the year,
but represents a 19 percent drop from 2015. Metals prices are
projected to decline 8 percent on weak demand and increases
in new capacity. Agriculture prices are projected to decline 4
percent in 2016 on early signs of good harvests for next season.
Looking to 2017, a modest price recovery is expected for most
commodities. Crude oil price is projected to rise to $50/bbl
as supply tightens. The Special Focus of this edition examines
the implications of resource development in an era of cheaper
commodities, and concludes that ambitious improvements in
governance and sounder macroeconomic policies are required to
mitigate delays and risks.

The World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook is published
quarterly, in January, April, July, and October. The report
provides detailed market analysis for major commodity groups,
including energy, metals, agriculture, precious metals, and
fertilizers. Price forecasts to 2025 for 46 commodities are also
presented, together with historical price data. Commodity price
data updates are published separately at the beginning of each
month.
