Overview
This Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Learning Product addresses the
effectiveness of World Bank interventions during fiscal years (FY) 2000–15 in
supporting client countries for improving the financial performance and long-term
viability of their electricity sectors. Like other IEG learning products, this study is a
synthesis of evaluation findings, cross-cutting lessons, and good practices from
existing IEG evaluations, supplemented with a targeted literature review.

The World Bank supports client countries in improving the financial performance
and viability of their electricity sectors principally through financial or institutional
development components and financial covenants in investment loans, and through
conditionalities in development policy operations (DPOs). Technical assistance
projects, policy advice, and economic and sector work complement these in some
cases. A significant number of investment projects—especially in the 1990s and
2000s—used components and covenants covering financial recovery plans, utility
debt restructuring, payment collection improvement, tariff methodology and
adjustment, and operations performance improvement. In recent years, DPOs were
used more often to support financial performance improvements in the electricity
sector. Generally, DPOs provided untied, quick-disbursing direct budget financing to
governments for policy and institutional reforms aimed at achieving a set of sector-
specific development results. Overall, investment projects and DPOs adequately
identify sector financial performance drivers.

This study compiled a comprehensive inventory of World Bank electricity sector
investment projects approved during FY2000–15 that contain components and
covenants for improving sector financial performance and viability. Of the 41 projects
identified, ten were in the Sub-Saharan Africa Region (the region with the lowest
electricity access), which accounted for about 25 percent of total investment lending.
By income category, ten of the projects were in low-income countries. The study also
produced an updated list of DPOs approved during FY2000–15 with electricity sector
financial viability objectives. Of the 49 DPOs identified, 18 (37 percent) were in Sub-
Saharan Africa, accounting for 12 percent of total DPO lending.

IEG conducted a targeted literature survey to compile the latest analysis on electricity
sector financial viability in developing countries and compiled the leading electricity
utilities’ profitability trends between 2003 and 2013 for a sample of 40 World Bank
client countries. The study uses available data to characterize an empirical
relationship between sector financial performance and sector outcomes.


                                            viii
This study’s analysis shows that most investment loans with financial components
and covenants for the electricity sector show a moderately satisfactory or better
performance regarding their financial performance objectives. However, IEG rated
most DPOs moderately unsatisfactory or lower for their electricity sector financial
viability objectives. Several factors explain these findings. For investment loans, it is
likely that the relatively long implementation periods allow more time for the
gradual realization of politically sensitive financial reforms and measures while the
World Bank’s phased loan disbursements provide some leverage. DPOs are more
likely to be concerned with deep sector reforms, which often evolve along different
time lines than DPOs. The mismatch between the time horizon of sector reform
programs and the usually short period for effective government action in the DPO
context may contribute to reducing the efficacy of these interventions.

The proportion of sector-specific DPOs in the study sample with moderately
satisfactory or better financial outcomes is significantly higher than the
corresponding proportion for broad-spectrum DPOs that cover several themes or
sectors (75 percent versus 37 percent). IEG found no significant difference in financial
performance outcomes between regions for either DPOs or investment loans, and
found no statistically significant correlation between financial sustainability key
performance indicator ratings and overall project outcome ratings for both the DPOs
and investment loans. An analysis of the latest country assistance and country
partnership strategies for the countries with DPOs, investment loans, or both
analyzed in this report shows that issues of financial sustainability received
significantly greater attention than affordability issues, and these two sets of issues
were addressed together in less than half of all cases.

Sector outcomes from improved financial performance attributable to World Bank
support were largely sustained in relatively few cases, such as Brazil, Turkey, and
Kazakhstan. A broader examination of the profitability of major national electricity
utilities in 40 countries (of which several received World Bank electricity sector
support) from all regions for the past 15 years shows that the most are unprofitable
and likely experienced a downturn in sector outcomes. This is particularly true in
Sub-Saharan Africa, where most countries have been in a de facto permanent
financial crisis for many years or even decades. Significant reversals in profitability
recently occurred in several cases. The unacceptably low electricity access rates and
inadequate, unreliable, and poor-quality electricity service in several of these
countries is largely linked to the sector’s financial status. Continued inadequate cost
recovery is the key driver of financial underperformance, but poor bill collection and
operational inefficiencies, including excessive network losses, have a significant role.




                                            ix
Overall, this is a disappointing outcome considering the decades of sector reform
efforts, technical assistance, and considerable financial support from the World Bank
and other donors. The analysis of the experience of both investment loans and DPOs
leads to several findings and lessons.


Addressing the Political Economy of Sector Financial Viability
The experience from both investment loans and DPOs shows that government
commitment to serious financial stabilization and recovery objectives is often fragile,
because of the political sensitivity of measures such as tariff adjustments towards
cost-recovery levels, which are crucial to setting the electricity sector on the path to
long-term financial viability.

Aligning the DPO program’s timeline with that of a government reform program.
Most World Bank client countries require deep sector reforms that often operate on
different timelines than DPOs, but the government, national utility, and the World
Bank might focus excessively on short-term management of crises. The generic lesson
learned is that the DPO-supported sector reform program’s time horizon and
complementary investment projects should reasonably match the time required for
effective government action.

Matching the scale of World Bank support to the scope of reforms and political
risk. The quantum and scope of World Bank support should equal the scale of
reforms and the accompanying political risks—for example, in complex reforms
involving large tariff adjustments (among other things).

Balancing the window of opportunity with achievable targets. When the window
of political economy opportunity is small, it is better to set realistic, modest targets
that are achievable in a relatively short time.


Steering Clear of Complex Project Design
Complex design and unrealistic time frames are common pitfalls for both investment
loans and DPOs.

Avoiding the pitfalls of overambitious agendas and excessive conditionalities. An
over-ambitious angenda and too many loan conditionalities in DPOs is seen to
impact the performance of sector financial objectives.

Retain focus on the underlying structural causes of sector financial viability.
Several investment and multi-tranche DPO operations gave disproportionate


                                            x
attention to developing financial indicators and targets instead of focusing on the
underlying structural causes of the sector’s or national utility’s poor financial
performance.

Overall, programmatic DPOs showed better outcomes than multi-tranche and one-
off DPOs. A programmatic series of single-tranche policy loans can be an effective
way to support a well-specified, medium-term financial recovery program. One-off
DPOs are prone to excessive complexity, overdesign, and trying to do too much in a
short time, with few exceptions. Multi-tranche loans tend to be less flexible in their
conditionalities.


Sustaining Improvements in Sector Financial Performance
The World Bank’s experience with country electricity sector engagement shows that
complementary interventions and sustained support contribute positively to
favorable and enduring results.

Deep-rooted structural problems have no quick fix. Electricity sector reforms that
involve financially restructuring insolvent or bankrupt utilities require time and
sustained financial and technical resources that several developing countries lack.

Leveraging investment operations and DPOs with technical assistance and
analytical work will yield better and more sustainable results. Better results occur
when DPOs and investment projects are complementary and accompanied by
technical assistance and analytical work.

1. Introduction
        IEG’s Evaluation of World Bank Group's Support for Electricity Access 2000–2015
(IEG 2015d) identified financial viability of the electricity sector as one of the key
drivers of performance toward universal electricity access. This implies that countries
that transitioned from low-medium to high-universal access performed better in
securing the financial viability of electricity companies by adopting rational
electricity tariffs complemented by appropriate subsidy policies. In the results
framework for IEG (2015d), financial viability is one of the main intermediate sector
outcomes affecting access (figure 1.1).

       Financial crises often have roots in the electricity distribution subsector, which
is usually the most dysfunctional link in the electricity generation-transmission-
distribution value chain. Poor quality of service, customer dissatisfaction, and
relatively high prices compared with incomes induce electricity theft by businesses
and households through illegal connections and nonpayment of electricity bills,
sometimes with the involvement of corrupt utility staff. The financial deficits then
cascade into other segments of the value chain (transmission and generation).


Framework for Assessing the Impact of Poor Financial Performance on Electricity
Sector Outcomes
       A vicious cycle of poor financial performance has long captured many
national electricity sectors and utilities. The cycle continues from structural financial
weakness to underinvestment and poor maintenance practices; to poor service
quality; to blackouts; to weak payment discipline (nonpayment), theft, and
insufficient government transfers; to low net revenues and internal cash generation,
financial losses, low self-financing levels, and growing indebtedness to structural
financial weakness.

       Figure 1.1 shows a results framework for electricity access, which combines
the main elements that determine sector financial performance, an intermediate
outcome, and the relationships between financial performance and overall sector
outcome (defined as the delivery of adequate, reliable, and affordable service that
complies with certain quality standards). The framework highlights the main
elements that affect electricity sector financial performance and viability within this
overall context.

       Underinvestment is a major reason for poor sector financial performance, and
underpricing (which leads to low cost recovery) largely causes it. Electricity prices
held below full supply costs subject electricity utilities to ongoing financial distress
and infrastructure decapitalization, thus impairing their ability to maintain and
expand services, especially in poorer, rural, and dispersed areas where service

provision is more expensive. Improving cost recovery requires an integrated
approach involving tariff adjustments, improved payment collection, reduction of
excessive technical and commercial network losses, control of both operational and
capital expenditures, and sufficient and predictable subsidy transfers from the
government when needed.


Purpose of the Learning Product
        The purpose of this learning product is to inform World Bank strategy and
operations in supporting client countries for improving electricity sector financial
sustainability, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where the
electricity sector’s underlying financial weakness hinders access growth.

       This learning product’s findings and lessons relate to the following issues
raised in IEG sector- and project-level evaluations:

      To what extent do the World Bank’s lending operations—specific investment
       loans and development policy operations (DPOs)—adequately identify and
       address the drivers of poor sector finances, including political economy
       aspects?
      To what extent have specific investment loans (through financial covenants
       such as standard financial ratios and other relevant components) been
       effective in improving financial sustainability?
      To what extent have DPOs been effective in supporting client countries in
       improving their electricity sectors’ financial sustainability? How have the
       DPOs’ design features (programmatic, stand-alone, and the like) influenced
       the operations’ outcomes?
      To what extent were financial viability improvements resulting from World
       Bank support sustained after project completion?

       This learning product draws on IEG sector evaluations, Project Performance
Assessment Reports, Implementation Completion Report Reviews, and other project
documents of specific investment loans and DPOs (approved and completed during
FY2000–16) with objectives or components and covenants aimed at supporting
financial sustainability at the sector level. The learning product also draws on
relevant country assistance strategies and country partnership strategies, and various
sector evaluations. The study also conducted a targeted literature review that
incorporated findings from recent World Bank Group research papers, publications,
and other economic and sector work, including nonlending technical assistance
reports, relevant literature from development partners, and academic journals on



                                           3
electricity sector financial sustainability. IEG conducted a portfolio analysis to assess
the development effectiveness of World Bank—International Development
Association (IDA) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development—
specific investment loans and DPOs on financial sustainability. The learning product
study team also compiled the salient features of financial performance of national
electric utilities in 40 developing countries for the 2000–13 period to explore trends.
The team consulted with staff and management of the Energy and Extractives Global
Practice who are concerned with financial sustainability issues.

       The rest of the study is organized into four sections:

      Section 2: Recent trends in financial viability of electricity sectors and
       access outcomes in developing countries. This chapter is an overview of
       developing country electricity sector financial performance and financial
       viability drivers, and it characterizes the link between financial viability and
       sector outcomes.
      Section 3: World Bank support for the financial viability of country
       electricity sectors through investment loans. This chapter covers the role of
       investment loans in improving sector financial viability and analyzes their
       performance.
      Section 4: World Bank support for the financial viability of country
       electricity sectors through DPOs. This chapter covers the role of DPOs for
       improving sector financial viability and analyzes their performance.
      Section 5: Lessons from addressing sector financial viability through
       specific investment loans and DPOs. This chapter summarizes the main
       findings and lessons from World Bank support for sector financial viability
       and illustrates them with relevant investment loan and DPO examples.

        The financial performance of electricity sectors has deteriorated in recent years
in several developing countries, including countries that received significant World
Bank financing and advisory support. Utility-led electricity access programs are
important in the electrification strategies of most developing countries. Therefore,
utility financial performance can determine electrification’s extent and pace and the
adequacy, reliability, and quality of electricity services. However, many of the

electricity utilities, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, have long been technically
bankrupt, suffering from a structural operating deficit and dependent on annual
government subsidies and loan guarantees to cover operating losses and investment
expenditures.

       Table 2.1 shows the trend in overall profitability of leading electricity utilities
in a sample of 40 developing countries (appendix A includes data for the full list of
countries). The overall share of profitable utilities in this set increased from 10
percent to 35 percent in 2010, but fell back to 25 percent in 2013. This trend is
particularly stark in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of profitable utilities was
only four out of the sample of 17 in 2013 (after increasing from 2 to 6 during 2000–
10).1

DRIVERS OF FINANCIAL VIABILITY: COST RECOVERY
        The available literature suggests that inadequate cost recovery was a systemic
and endemic feature of the electricity sector in most developing countries.
Governments were often slow and reluctant (mostly for political reasons) to adjust
tariffs to reflect higher costs from inflation, and fuel charges, and interest charges.
Subsidizing electricity is politically attractive, but raising the price of electricity is
seen as a lump-sum tax weighing heavily on poor and elderly people and large
households (Kessides 2004; Komives et al. 2005; Besant-Jones 2006). The evidence




1The reported financial statements are not always reliable and tend to bias actual
performance upwards for a variety of reasons (Kojima and Trimble 2016).


                                                                 5
suggests limited progress toward depoliticized electricity pricing and higher cost
recovery in most developing countries in the past decade.

        A 2016 study (Kojima and Trimble 2016) that compared estimated existing
retail tariffs with benchmark operating expenditures and capital expenditure for 39
Sub-Saharan Africa countries showed that only 21 countries were able to cover
operating expenditures. In some cases (Guinea and Botswana, for example), the cost
recovery ratio was extremely low at about 50 percent. The picture is much bleaker for
total cost recovery when only one country, the Republic of Congo, could attain full
cost recovery. The Seychelles and Uganda were reasonably close with ratios of more
than 90 percent. These findings are in line with two earlier studies (Briceno-
Garmendia and Shkaratan 2011; Eberhard et al. 2008) that examined the electricity
sectors of Sub-Saharan Africa countries during the mid-2000s using different samples
sizes and slightly different methodologies.

        The overall message from these studies is that Sub-Saharan Africa made little
progress toward higher cost recovery in the past decade and, by implication, toward
a financially viable electricity sector (Dobozi 2016). Further increases in tariffs are
unlikely to be affordable because tariffs in Sub-Saharan Africa countries are already
high when compared with relatively more developed regions of the world, and
incomes are lower. Therefore, the only feasible solution would be to reduce costs due
to pricing inefficiencies.

        Cost recovery of residential tariffs at the national level in India in 2010 was
only 68 percent, which is considerably less than the ratio of 74 percent registered in
2000 (Pargal and Banerjee 2014). Only two of 29 states had average effective tariffs
slightly higher than the average cost supply (table 2.2, see appendix B for a list of all
states). At the other end of spectrum, cost recovery was about 33 percent (and as low
as 23 percent in the state of Himachal Pradesh). Consequently, an overwhelming 87
percent of all residential electricity consumption is subsidized, equivalent to more
than one-fifth of all electricity consumed in the country in 2010, or 0. 4 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) (Mayer et al. 2015). The agricultural sector is even
more heavily subsidized. Regarding cost recovery, the average billed tariff was
higher than the average cost between 2003 and 2008, but has dropped below the cost
recovery level since 2008 (Pargal and Banerjee 2014).

DRIVERS OF FINANCIAL VIABILITY: OTHER FACTORS
        A quantification (Kojima and Trimble 2016) of quasi-fiscal deficits (defined as
implicit financial losses) for 39 Sub-Saharan Africa countries for 2014 shows that the
median total hidden costs were 1. 37 percent of GDP and ranged from a low of 0. 08
percent in Uganda to as high as 5. 92 percent in Zimbabwe. When the total hidden
costs are broken down into their components, underpricing emerges as the most
important and accounts for a median 0. 45 percent of GDP, and after that are
transmission and distribution losses (0. 32 percent), overstaffing (0. 21 percent), and
bill collection (0. 17 percent). Similar to previous findings, this study found that
underpricing is the largest component (about one-third) of the total quasi-fiscal
deficit in most countries, as shown in table 2.3 (appendix C presents a table for 39
countries).

        Undercollection of bills. Electricity utilities in many developing countries
have bill-collection rates well below 100 percent, which translates to large financial
losses. Financial losses from undercollection in some countries (Nigeria, Madagascar,
The Gambia, and Mauritania, for example) are larger than from underpricing
electricity. In The Gambia and Zimbabwe, the cost of poor collection is as high as 1.8
percent and 1.4 percent of GDP, respectively (table 2.3).

       Poor operating performance. Public monopoly and lack of exposure to market
competition, excessively centralized decision making, distorted performance
incentives, soft budget constraints, inadequate accountability, and high technical and
commercial losses often characterize electricity sectors. These factors usually
contribute to poor operational, commercial, and financial sector performance.

        Lagging fiscal subsidies. Public utilities facing a government-imposed cost-
revenue gap often receive fiscal subsidies that are insufficient to ensure sound
financial performance, and the actual volume of subsidies received is often less than
promised or booked. For example, subsidies in India allocated in the state budgets
for financially strapped distribution companies are often not received according to
the process stipulated in the Electricity Act (Jog 2011; Pargal and Banerjee 2014).

PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION AND ELECTRICITY SECTOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
        A strand in the literature suggests that the self-reinforcing cycle of structural
financial weakness can be broken only by an external shock such as a sustainable
liberalizing electricity market reform, of which privatization is considered a lynchpin
(Dobozi 2016). However, the evidence does not provide a clear verdict on the positive
impact of privatization on financial performance and, by implication, on sector
outcomes, other than improving the government’s fiscal position through
privatization receipts and reduced fiscal subsidies.




                                                           8
       An empirical study covering the electricity sector in several Sub-Saharan
Africa countries for the mid-2000s found no measurable improvement from
privatization in cost recovery or transmission and distribution losses (Eberhard et al.
2008).

        A more recent large–scale study found that privatization in Latin America,
along with unbundling and competition, was a key instrument to improve the
government’s fiscal position, sector efficiency, and access to electricity service for the
poor. On average, distribution utilities with private ownership outperformed public
utilities, with clear improvements after the change of ownership. The main
differences in performance between the two types of utilities relate to labor
productivity, distribution losses, the quality of service (frequency and duration of
interruptions) and tariffs (Andres et al. 2013). Figure 2.1 shows how private firms in
Peru outperformed state utilities in reducing distribution losses. Because of the
dominant presence of private companies across the value chain, the electricity sector
shifted from being a drain on the public treasury to a profitable business by the late
1990s (ESMAP 2015c).

        Other studies showed positive relationships between the introduction of
private sector participation in electricity distribution and enhanced operational
efficiency. However, liberalization reforms (including privatization) rarely lead to the
anticipated reduction of retail prices, even in advanced countries. The link between
private sector participation and tariff increases was positive and significant, most
likely reflecting the need to raise tariffs to cost-reflective levels to attract private
participation in distribution (Vagliasindi and Besant-Jones 2013).2 Liberalization is
expected to lead to better investment incentives (including higher prices) in

2Tariffs were 20 percent higher for countries that introduced private sector participation
compared with countries that kept distribution in state ownership.


                                                                       9
developing countries, where regulated electricity prices are inefficiently low and
typically accompanied by insufficient capacity. The empirical literature partially
supports this (Nagayama 2007; Sen and Jamasb 2010). Sector liberalization and
privatization worked in some countries to reduce historic pricing distortions.
Specifically, cross-subsidies from industrial customers to households were gradually
reduced because prices for households are aligned with underlying costs (Kessides
2012). Since the mid-2000s in Brazil, the cost recovery index has closely tracked the
steep increase in private ownership in distribution.

        In most of the countries where private sector participation is minimal and
tariffs are state-controlled below cost recovery levels (India, the Arab Republic of
Egypt, and Indonesia, for example), distribution companies experienced sustained,
severe financial stress, which occasionally required government bailouts to keep the
utilities afloat (debt restructuring, increased fiscal transfers, and so on).

ROLE OF REGULATION AND MARKET STRUCTURE
         An empirical study found that the introduction of an autonomous regulator is
positively associated with better sector performance in financial efficiency, specified
as tariff level in U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour (Vagliasindi and Besant-Jones 2013).3
Tariffs are considerably higher under an autonomous regulatory regime, indicating a
stronger commitment to make tariffs more cost-reflective. Specifically, electricity
tariffs in national electricity systems with an autonomous regulator were 64 percent
higher than in countries with no autonomous regulator. The higher tariffs reflect
insulating crucial electricity pricing decisions from political interference.

       The same study tested the cost recovery index against a set of explanatory
variables and found that the cost recovery index is higher under vertically
unbundled systems, greater competition in the distribution sector, an autonomous
regulator, and a higher share of private sector participation.4, 5

THE LINK BETWEEN FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND SECTOR OUTCOMES
       This study tried to characterize two empirical relationships linking sector
financial performance to sector outcomes by using a compilation of available data.6

3 The study covered a sample of 22 countries, which are mostly developing countries. In the
study, the average tariff level is a crude proxy for regulatory quality.
4 Cost recovery index is defined as the ratio of average revenue yield divided by the average

supply cost for all electricity distributors as a group.
5 In the sample of countries with an autonomous regulator, the cost recovery index is 115.6

compared with 76.3 for countries with no autonomous regulator.
6 An extensive literature review could not locate even one systematic, cross-country,

empirical study to quantify this relationship.

Data for a sample of Sub-Saharan Africa countries shows an overall positive
relationship between the electricity tariff cost recovery ratio (a proxy for sector
financial performance) and the quality of electricity supply, approximated by
frequency of service interruptions and voltage fluctuations (figure 2.2).

Note: Quality of electricity supply is a survey-based index that is part of the World Economic Forum’s Energy Architecture
Performance composite index. The survey question used is “How would you assess the quality of the electricity in your
country (lack of interruptions and lack of voltage fluctuations)?” The scale ranges from 1 = insufficient and suffers frequent
interruptions to 7 = sufficient and reliable. Underlying data for the quality of electricity supply index are for 2012, and data for
tariff cost recovery ratios are for the mid-2000s.

       Although displaying a much weaker relationship statistically,7 the financial
gap in the electricity sector (expressed as quasi-fiscal deficit) is negatively related to
the electricity supply’s reliability (figure 2.3).8

Financial Performance and Sector Outcomes: Recent Country Experiences
        Several recent experiences in World Bank client countries illustrate the link
between financial performance and sector outcomes. In Vietnam, the financial
performance of the national utility Vietnam Electricity (EVN) was reasonably
satisfactory until the mid-2000s. A sharp deteriorating trend started in 2008, raising
serious concerns about the financial and operational sustainability of both EVN and
the electricity sector going forward. In India, despite considerable progress in some
reforms (including legislation, open access regulation, and market opening),
electricity sector finances have deteriorated sharply in the past decade, which
together with other factors brought the electricity sector to the brink of crisis. The
financial performance of the electricity sector in Bangladesh deteriorated despite a
series of World Bank development support credits, including a freestanding


                                                                12
Electricity Sector Development Credit in 2008–09 aimed at financial stabilization of
the electricity sector, though the deterioration was largely because tariffs were
significantly short of cost recovery levels. Senegal’s electricity sector has faced a
deepening financial crisis since 2006 despite sizable World Bank policy lending
(budgetary support). Recurrent blackouts that rose exponentially between 2006 and
2011 characterized the crisis.

       Considerable country-based anecdotal evidence points to the detrimental
impact of poor financial performance on sector outcomes. The Dominican Republic’s
experience illustrates the close link between electricity blackouts and financial
blackouts (that is, the generators’ inability to pay for fuel due to the distributors’
insufficient and lagging payments for electricity). South Africa’s electricity system
came under considerable strain toward the end of the 2000s after several years of
sustained economic growth supported by reliable and sufficient electricity supply.
The electricity sector, though generally operationally efficient, ran into major capacity
constraints.

      Appendix D presents a detailed discussion of each of these country
experiences.


3. World Bank Support for the Financial
Viability of Country Electricity Sectors through
Investment Loans
        The World Bank supported client countries in improving the financial viability
of their electricity sectors through investment loans and development policy
operations (DPOs). The typical approach under many World Bank–funded
investment projects in the past—particularly those implemented in the 1990s and
early 2000s—was to combine investment loans with sector reform conditionality,
including financial performance-enhancing measures (tariff adjustment, payment
collections, commercialization, privatization, and so on). DPOs have recently been
the most frequently used mode to support electricity sector financial performance.
Generally, DPOs provided untied, quick-disbursing direct budget financing to
governments for policy and institutional reforms aimed at achieving a set of sector-
specific development results.

      An analysis of the latest country assistance strategies (CASs) and country
partnership strategies (CPSs) for the countries with DPOs, investment loans, or both



                                           13
analyzed in this report shows that issues of financial sustainability received
significantly greater attention than affordability issues (mainly subsidies to the poor
for electricity connections or electricity consumption). Of the 48 CASs and CPSs
examined, 43 documents (90 percent) analyzed financial sustainability issues and
only 26 documents examined affordability for the poor. The number of documents
that proposed specific strategies and actions was relatively lower in both cases, with
only 33 documents (69 percent) for financial viability and 17 documents (35 percent)
for proposed policy actions. The number of documents that considered both financial
viability and affordability for the poor was quite low at 22 documents (46 percent),
and only 14 documents (29 percent) proposed specific strategies and actions (table
3.1). For example, the Nicaragua CPS for FY08–12 noted the lack of an adequate legal
and regulatory framework to address energy sector tariff and subsidy issues. The
CPS proposed that the government prosecute large-scale electricity theft more
proactively and facilitate the normalization of poor communities that connected
illegally, with the aim of gradually increasing cost recovery in line with their ability
to pay. Pakistan’s CPS for FY15-19 notes heavy dependence on non-pro-poor
government subsidies and poor service management, and proposes the development,
adoption, and implementation of policy guidelines on tariff management and
subsidies with pro-poor targeting.

        About two-thirds of the 41 projects had comprehensive financial performance
improvement goals—usually a financial recovery plan, including debt restructuring
for the national utility. Tariff methodology and adjustment was the next most
frequently occurring financial component (31 percent), and after that are payment
collection improvement (22 percent) and transmission and distribution loss reduction
targets (19 percent). These investment projects were mainly in lower-middle-income

PERFORMANCE OF FINANCIAL COMPONENTS AND COVENANTS IN INVESTMENT LOANS
       Table 3.4 presents a summary of the performance of key performance
indicators (KPI) relating to financial viability for the 41 projects (appendix F presents
detailed ratings). The study team could rate KPIs for only 36 projects because the
outcomes for the remaining five projects were either not available or not evaluable.
IEG rates 69 percent of the 36 projects as moderately satisfactory or higher on the
achievement of financial objectives. The highest achievement was for operational
performance improvement, with 100 percent of the projects performing marginally
satisfactory or better. Payment collection improvement was the next highest (75
percent rated moderately satisfactory or better), and after that are transmission and
distribution loss reduction (71 percent rated moderately satisfactory or better),
comprehensive financial performance improvement indicator (67 percent of projects
rated as moderately satisfactory or better), and tariff methodology/adjustment (55
percent of outcomes rated moderately satisfactory or better).10 The weakest
achievement was on the subsidy reduction—no projects rated moderately
satisfactory or better.

utility), this can be achieved through a financial recovery plan or a similar action plan aimed
at financial sustainability, including debt restructuring.

Note: MS = moderately satisfactory; T&D = transmission and distribution. Figure in parentheses is the number of projects
with KPI rated MS or better.
a. A moderately satisfactory rating is  3 on a scale of 1–4. The 1–4 scale corresponds to the following scale: 1 =
unsatisfactory or worse; 2 = moderately unsatisfactory; 3 = moderately satisfactory; and 4 = satisfactory or highly satisfactory.
b. The same project may have multiple KPIs in the same category (see appendix F for details).

       Regarding compliance with legally binding financial covenants (including
standard financial ratios), 41 percent of the 41 investment projects with financial
sustainability indicators complied fully or at least partially with the legal financial
covenants (table 3.5). Compliance increases to 71 percent when excluding projects
that did not provide outcome data. Looking at individual covenants, compliance is in
the range of 43 to 88 percent for the projects that reported compliance information.
The lowest compliance is for utility profitability-related covenants, such as operating
margin and rate of return on assets or equity (only 43 percent of projects complied
with profitability covenants). It this context, it is notable that nearly half of the 41
projects did not provide any information in the Implementation Completion and
Results Reports and Implementation Completion and Results Report Reviews on
compliance levels for financial covenants, raising concerns about the lack of
systematic monitoring, tracking, and reporting on the achievement of these legally
binding financial covenants.

4. World Bank Support for the Financial
Viability of Country Electricity Sectors through
Development Policy Operations
        Development policy operations (DPOs) have recently been the World Bank’s
most frequently used modality of supporting electricity sector financial performance
improvements. Generally, DPOs provided untied, quick-disbursing direct budget
financing to governments for policy and institutional reforms aimed at achieving a
set of sector-specific development results. Sector-specific DPOs supported a more
targeted program policy and institutional actions, often to strengthen or drastically
turn around weak sector finances. All the sector-specific DPOs covered under this
assessment included financial recovery, improvement, and sustainability as an
important project development objective. The World Bank increasingly used
programmatic DPOs in a series of single-tranche operations (typically annual) to
support a more complex and generally well-specified, medium-term sector reform
agenda. The World Bank’s operational policy guiding development policy lending
includes, among other things, the principles of country ownership, strong analytic
underpinnings for policy choices, and alignment of World Bank operations with a
country’s own development strategy and focus on the most critical policy and
institutional actions for program results (World Bank 2009a).


DPOs with Financial Performance Components and Covenants
       During FY2000–15, IEG evaluated 49 DPOs that included a substantial
component for electricity sector financial performance improvement. These
operations represent total commitments of $10.7 billion, of which $6 billion directly
related to the electricity sector (appendix G presents the list of DPOs). A high
percentage of the DPOs that IEG evaluated (65 percent) were part of a programmatic
series of operations, and 35 percent were one-off projects. Furthermore, only 31
percent of projects were sector-specific and 69 percent were broad-spectrum DPOs
covering more than one sector or theme. By World Bank region, 37 percent of DPOs
were in Sub-Saharan Africa, 22 percent were in South Asia, and 16 percent were in
East Asia and Pacific (16 percent). Regions with the least DPOs were Latin America
and the Caribbean (6 percent) and Middle East and North Africa (4 percent).
Regarding country income category, 30 DPOs (about 61 percent of the total) were in
lower-middle-income countries and only 7 DPOs (14 percent) were in low-income
countries (tables 4.1 and 4.2).

        The DPOs supported sector financial reforms, typically drawn from the
government’s reform program, that were deemed critical to achieving sustainable
results in improving financial performance. All reform measures (prior actions) were
to be implemented before the operation was presented to the Board for approval. In a
programmatic series, indicative actions (triggers) for subsequent operations in the
series were included when the initial operation was presented for approval. These
indicative actions were not binding and were meant to be flexible and to be adjusted
to the country’s circumstances.

        Almost all of the 49 DPOs that this study covers had key performance
indicators (KPIs) related to sector financial performance, but only 27 DPOs had
financial viability or sustainability as an explicit development objective for the
electricity sector (or national utility). Financial viability/sustainability was the
principal area of sector support, especially under the dedicated sector-specific DPOs.
Prior actions typically focused on the adoption of cost-recovery tariffs, payment
collection, and reduction of commercial losses (such as metering), cost

rationalization, and government subsidy transfers. Reforms related to transparency,
governance, and accountability also became more common. For example, the
Bangladesh Power Sector Development Credit supported enhanced governance and
accountability along with more typical measures, such as tariff adjustment, payment
collection, and budgetary transfers to the national utility.

PERFORMANCE OF FINANCIAL COMPONENTS AND COVENANTS IN DPOS
       Of the full cohort of 49 DPOs, only 35 projects had evaluable final outcome
data on financial indicators (appendix H presents detailed ratings). Other DPOs were
either part of an ongoing series of DPOs or did not have evaluable financial outcome
data. Regarding individual financial KPIs, about 77 percent of the rated DPOs
targeted comprehensive financial performance improvements (broader policy
programs, such as a financial recovery plan, debt restructuring, privatization, and
commercialization), 20 percent targeted tariff adjustment, 17 percent targeted subsidy
reduction, and 17 percent targeted payment collection improvement (table 4.3).

        IEG rated less than half of the evaluated DPOs (17 out of 35 DPOs, or 49

all financial sustainability related indicators. This is distinctly lower than the
corresponding figure of 69 percent for investment loans. The performance was most
favorable for tariff adjustment, with 71 percent of projects rated moderately

and payment collection improvement (67 percent each), and comprehensive financial
improvement (44 percent moderately satisfactory or better). The lowest achievement
was on the politically sensitive subsidy reduction (only 33 percent of projects had
moderately satisfactory or higher performance).

       Despite the World Bank interventions’ largely appropriate focus on financial
performance improvement under the DPOs, sustainable improvements toward the
structural soundness of sector finances was low, and deeper structural weaknesses
persisted and even worsened in some cases, as illustrated in the discussion in section

is significantly higher than the corresponding proportion for broad-spectrum DPOs

study does not analyze this differential performance, but important factors may
include lower design complexity, project objectives that have more focus and
dedicated sector expertise.

         Testing for regional bias. IEG found no significant difference in financial
performance outcomes between regions either for DPOs or for investment loans.
Since the DPO sample has a higher share of Sub-Saharan Africa countries (31 percent)
than the investment loan sample of rated projects (24 percent), the study team
conducted a simple proportions test to see if the difference in geographical scope has
a significant differential impact on the two sets of operations. Test results showed no
statistically significant impact.

        Given the link between financial performance and sector outcomes, the less-
than-satisfactory results from the World Bank’s DPOs might have limited their
effectiveness in supporting the broader access agenda encompassing adequacy,
quality, and affordability of electricity supply. Section 5 discusses the lessons learned

country electricity sectors.


5. Lessons from Addressing Sector Financial
Viability through Investment Loans and DPOs
       An analysis of the World Bank’s experience with investment loans and
development policy operations (DPOs) for improving the financial viability of
country electricity sectors provides lessons in many areas. The primary lesson is the
importance of sustained government commitment and the political economy that can
aid or detract from the long-term engagement required to address deep-rooted
structural problems in the electricity sectors of many developing countries. Design
features of both investment loans and DPOs can shape their performance, combined
with government commitment and the occurrence of crises. In particular, the choice
between programmatic, multi-tranche, and single-tranche loans, along with sector-
specific versus broad-spectrum DPOs, has implications, and they all interact with
other factors covered under other lessons. Combining DPOs and investment
operations with technical assistance and analytical work affects their efficacy. This
learning product discusses these findings in the context of specific investment loans
and DPOs.


Addressing the Political Economy of Sector Financial Viability
        Widespread evidence suggests that political commitment to serious financial
stabilization and recovery objectives is often fragile. New elections, changes in
government, macroeconomic crises, and external shocks (or an abating sense of
urgency after weathering a severe crisis, often with sizable World Bank financial
support) can erode political commitment. Because tariff adjustments toward cost
recovery levels are highly sensitive and political, sustained government commitment
is important to creating financial stability and getting the electricity sector on the
path to long-term financial viability. Therefore, political economy and not just
external financial support explains much of the outcome of the World Bank’s policy-
based sector operations aimed at a sustainable turnaround in poor finances.

       Development policy operations—particularly those well rooted in a medium-
or long-term sector strategy and with strong government ownership (such as in
Turkey and Brazil)—had multiple and recurring pressure points, translating into a
higher probability of successful and sustainable reform. Strong country ownership of
the sector development program (including financial viability goals) anchored the


                                          22
DPO approach in Turkey (box 5.1). Full country ownership was fundamental for
such a complex and ambitious program’s success. Another positive example is the
Brazil Energy Sector Reform Loan that the World Bank built on the political will and
consensus formed across party lines to prevent a repetition of the devastating 2000–
01 electricity crisis.

       Conversely, a long series of World Bank–supported investment projects in
Vietnam failed to improve sector finances by applying specific, target-oriented and
time-bound measures through tariff-level covenants, which carried excessive political
implementation risks and were prone to government noncompliance. Further
complicating the situation, during project implementation the World Bank often took
too accommodating a stance on noncompliance with the commitments for improving
financial performance. Consequently, a long series of World Bank investment
operations were essentially ineffective in preventing a serious, recent deterioration of
sector finances, much less placing the sector on the road to sustained financial
recovery. The sector’s financial situation worsened to the extent that EVN and its
subsidiaries (the state-owned national electric utility) were frequently in breach of the
financial covenants applied under the World Bank’s investment loans (IEG 2014).

        In the Senegal Electricity Sector Efficiency Project (an investment project), the
government lacked an overall strategy to address the sector’s deep-seated structural
problems (including tariffs and budget transfers) and long-term investment
decisions, particularly on generation. Both the government and SENELEC (Société
National d'Éléctricité du Sénégal), the national electricity company of Senegal, focused
excessively on short-term management of a financial and operational crisis. In these
circumstances, sector policy and strategy, along with the financial restructuring of
SENELEC, could have been the foundation of World Bank intervention in the
electricity sector before any investment commitment (IEG 2013). Separately, during
Senegal’s two-tranche Energy Sector Recovery Development Credit approved in June
2008, the government implemented an 8 percent tariff decrease in 2009 when
SENELEC was in its most dire financial straits, clearly displaying the impact of the
political economy in the country.

        Aligning the timeline for the DPO program with that of a government
reform program. Deep sector reforms often operate on different time lines than
DPOs. In several countries experiencing a persistent, deep, financial and operational
crisis in the electricity sector (such as Senegal, Lebanon, Pakistan, and the Dominican
Republic), the government, the national utility, and the World Bank can be tempted
to focus excessively on short-term management of the crisis. In such circumstances,
medium- or long-term sector policy and strategy, along with possible financial
restructuring of the national utility, could be the basis of World Bank intervention in


                                           23
the sector before any major investment commitment. A generic lesson learned
through the implementation of several DPOs (in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Lebanon,
for example) is that better results can be expected when the DPO-supported sector
reform program’s time horizon reasonably matches the time available for effective
government action.

       Matching the scale of World Bank support to the scope of reforms and
political risk. When supporting complex reforms involving large retail tariff
adjustments (among other things), it is important make the magnitude of World Bank
support (that is, the volume of direct government budget support) commensurate
with the political risks incurred by government in implementing the reforms. In
Turkey and Brazil, the large lending volumes provided a strong incentive for the
government to comply with all major policy conditionalities. However, in the
Dominican Republic, the sector DPO’s support (because of its tranching and the
resulting slow and lower-than-planned disbursement in four years) was too little to
motivate the government or defray the costs of reform. In Senegal’s two-tranche
Energy Sector Recovery Development Credit, the heavy frontloading of fund
disbursement while backloading the restructuring conditions (reserving the most
difficult ones for the second tranche) greatly reduced the government’s incentives in
meeting the tough second tranche release conditions.

       The Senegal Electricity Sector Efficiency Project, an IDA credit approved in
April 2005, had policy objectives that were too ambitious for the credit’s relatively
small size ($15.7 million equivalent). Furthermore, the project’s design barely
addressed the critical issue of sector finances except for a weak requirement to
establish new tariff system (with little details on its implications) and imposing
financial covenants based on financial projections that were too optimistic.

         Balancing the existing sector environment with achievable targets. If a
DPO’s window of political economy opportunity is small, it is better to set modest
targets that are achievable in a relatively short time. A government dealing with a
severe crisis and encountering high political risks is generally not willing or able to
focus on implementation of long-term reforms that not directly related to the ongoing
crisis. In several other instances (such as Bangladesh, Senegal, Lebanon, and
Pakistan), the World Bank overestimated the favorable environment, which was
fleeting and small in reality and would have justified lower program targets. In such
contexts, a careful World Bank assessment of the policy reversal risks is necessary,
particularly amid highly volatile political circumstances.




                                           24
Steering Clear of Complex Project and Operations Design
        The pitfalls of overambitious agendas and excessive conditionalities.
Loading too many loan conditionalities on to DPOs while seeking to accomplish an
ambitious agenda in a short period occurred in several cases. The two-tranche Energy
Sector Recovery Development Credit in Senegal (approved in June 2008) had the
overarching objective of restoring the financial and institutional viability of the
energy sector as a whole, but most urgently in the electricity subsector mired in deep
financial and operational crisis. The project design included a large number of policy
conditionalities, including recapitalization of SENELEC, upward adjustments to the
electricity tariffs, reform of the tariff-setting mechanism, and elimination of
budgetary transfers to SENELEC. The overarching project development objective was
relevant, but IEG’s project performance assessment report found the design and
implementation was deficient (IEG 2013b). The operation’s two-year timeline was too
ambitious, particularly on sector finance improvement. Furthermore, the
government’s commitment to implement the required actions, including tariff
increases required to turn around sector finances, was considerably overestimated.
This commitment weakened further during the 2008 energy crisis, when spiking oil
prices hit SENELEC particularly hard, given its liquid fuel–dominated generation
mix. SENELEC’s financial situation continued to deteriorate under these
circumstances, requiring ever-larger budgetary transfers to stay financially afloat
without sufficient tariff increases. The IEG Project Performance Assessment Report
rated the operation’s outcome as unsatisfactory, with modest relevance of project
design, poor project design, and negligible achievement of development objectives.
IEG also rated the World Bank’s performance as unsatisfactory, partly because its
stance on key project conditions was too accommodating, and its supervision ratings
were too optimistic. The dependence of the electricity sector on the budget has
worsened lately, reaching an unprecedented high level of 1. 8 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012 (World Bank 2013). The ongoing World Bank–supported
Electricity Sector Support Project, an investment operation approved in July 2012, is a
fresh attempt at trying to restore reasonable financial health in Senegal’s electricity
sector through SENELEC’s financial restructuring and long-overdue tariff
adjustments, among other things.

       Finally, Morocco is another instructive counterpoint to Turkey’s successful
DPO experience. The project in Morocco could not adhere to the original ambitious
timetable for the programmatic energy sector development DPO because of the lack
of clear reform direction resulting from a change in government, weak client
consensus, and the policy program’s complexity and eventually changed to a
sequence of stand-alone DPOs. The first DPO suffered from several shortcomings,



                                          25
and IEG rated the overall development outcome as moderately unsatisfactory in the
Implementation Completion amd Results Report Review (IEG 2010c). Parallel World
Bank investment operations (or operations by other development agencies) could
have accompanied or preceded the DPO—such operations would have addressed the
high risks from the electricity infrastructure’s poor technical condition and from too
much dependence on high-priced imported oil for electricity generation. Without
such parallel sector operations, the DPO’s development benefits would have been
unsustainable, even under smooth DPO program implementation.


 Box 5.1. Turkey Programmatic Electricity Sector DPO: Lessons from a Successful Experience
 The Turkey Programmatic Electricity Sector Development Policy Operation (DPO),
 approved in June 2009 for $2.1 billion equivalent, addressed the then-looming electricity
 supply shortage in the country by introducing cost-reflective tariffs and improving
 payment performance for transactions in the electricity wholesale market. After the DPO,
 the main state-owned utilities have achieved profitability in recent years and paid their
 arrears in full to private sector generators. The improved sector finances helped attract a
 large volume of private capital, adding 31,000 megawatts of new generation capacity since
 2008 without sovereign guarantees (figure B5.1.1), and an investment of about $12.7 billion
 for the electricity distribution privatization program. Turkey’s electricity supply security
 improved considerably, generation capacity more than doubled, and the severe supply
 imbalances projected for the early 2010s were avoided.

 Major lessons learned from this highly successful policy operation in Turkey include the
 following:
        Country ownership. A strong country ownership of the sector development program,
         including the financial viability goals, anchored the DPO approach.
        Operational and policy engagement. World Bank operational engagement in the
         electricity sector complemented the DPO through a series of investment projects, high-
         quality analytical work, and productive collaboration with the government’s own
         Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Program and key sector stakeholders.

    Flexible DPO design. Programmatic lending in a series of single-tranche DPOs can be
     a powerful and flexible World Bank tool (under appropriate conditions) to support
     complex, challenging, medium-term sector reforms aimed at a drastic turnaround of
     poor sector finances.
    Criticality. The operation’s financial components focused on the most critical aspects
     of sector financial performance, such as cost-based electricity pricing and full payment
     collection. Large-scale privatization of the sector has largely strengthened these
     improvements.
    Implementation time. The four-year implementation period—longer than usual for
     programmatic DPOs—was appropriate for the nature and breadth of issues addressed.
    Incentives matter. The large amount of direct budget support under the DPOs
     provided a strong incentive for the government to comply with the policy
     conditionalities and strong leverage for the World Bank.

       Retaining focus on underlying structural causes of sector financial viability.
Several investment and multi-tranche sector operations focused excessively on
monitoring financial indicators and targets instead of the underlying structural
causes of the sector’s or national utility’s poor financial performance. Imposing
financial loan covenants with little chance of achievement serves no useful purpose.
Working on the conditions that will fulfill these covenants is best (such as in Senegal
and Vietnam). Monitoring and reporting on the achievement of each legally binding
financial covenant in the project design is also imperative.

        Overall, programmatic DPOs showed better outcomes than multi-tranche
and one-off DPOs. A well-conceived programmatic series of single-tranche policy
loans can be a highly effective approach for supporting a well-specified, medium-
term financial recovery program. This approach captures the medium- to long-term
nature of most significant financial and related sector reforms, but it allows flexibility
to adjust to new developments and changing circumstances during implementation
and to adjust the operation’s scope over time. A programmatic approach is especially
useful when the government’s reform direction is clear, but the timing and details of
implementation need to stay flexible. Multi-tranche operations generally fared poorly
compared with programmatic single-tranche DPOs, sometimes leading to
noncompliance with agreed actions and loan cancellations. Multi-tranche operations
are considered more rigid because the tranche release conditions are predetermined
and require waivers from the World Bank’s Board if they are not fully met.
Furthermore, the commitment fee for a multi-tranche operation is a higher financial
cost to the borrower.

      One-off DPOs are prone to excessive complexity, overdesign, and trying to do
too much in a short time. The government or a national utility has difficulty focusing


                                              27
on multiple targets in a distressed environment. Even the World Bank is often
tempted to do many things as quickly as possible. Experience suggests that one-off
operations cannot be expected to make progress on multiple policy fronts in a sector,
especially if the policy issues have commonalities with other sectors. Furthermore, it
is essential that reform areas to be supported link to other World Bank operations
through either investment lending or technical assistance. Some DPOs have weak
results frameworks, which often lack clear statements of objectives and outcomes and
have low-impact prior actions, also contribute to the difficulties in monitoring and
measuring their development impact (Mkrtchyan et al. 2015). This shortcoming is
present in some newly approved DPOs that follow the modified Operations Policy
and Country Services template. Their results frameworks lack explicitly stated
outcomes, and result indicators fall short of meaningfully measuring a DPO’s impact
in many cases. Regarding financial performance improvement, sector-specific DPOs
tend to perform significantly better than the generally overloaded broad-spectrum
DPOs in which financial sustainability is only one of the multiple project objectives.

       A one-off DPO may work during a crisis. A stand-alone, single-tranche
operation can be considered for a crisis or turnaround situation under appropriate
conditions (such as in Brazil in the early 2000s). The Brazilian government was
committed and able to implement wide-ranging reform measures because of impetus
from the critical 2000–01 electricity crisis. However, a one-off policy operation may
not be the best support structure under normal circumstances because most policy
and institutional reform that affects financial performance are medium- to long-term
processes of multiple, sequential actions. For example, the one-off sector DPO in
Bangladesh with no follow-up investment or DPO was unsuitable for a sector with
long-term structural problems. The prior actions under the DPO for addressing
issues of financial stability and sustainability were clearly inadequate. The sector’s
financial situation deteriorated considerably after project closure.

        The Energy Sector Reform Loan in Brazil, a one-tranche DPO approved in
2002, successfully address critical financial aspects of the 2001 electricity supply
crisis—the worst the country every experienced because of severe, prolonged
drought. The DPO supported a series of regulatory reforms, including rebalancing
retail tariffs to accurately reflect service cost, thus eliminating subsidies for large,
industrial consumers; reviewing distributor tariffs to ensure they were cost-reflective;
revising high-voltage transmission tariffs to fully reflect geographic cost variations,
leading to more economic generation siting; and resolving financial disputes among
electricity companies caused by the energy crisis. The disputed amounts were large,
totaling $2.6 billion between generators and distributors (because generators could
not meet their electricity delivery contracts with the distributors) and $2 billion
between the distributors and the Brazilian electricity regulatory agency (because the


                                           28
government-imposed rationing led to financial losses for the distributors). Overall,
the project helped restore the financial health of the electricity companies (public and
private). The World Bank originally preferred a two-tranche DPO, but a highly
committed government, under the pressure of an acute crisis, implemented most of
the reform measures promptly. The government also reasonably argued that it would
be much more sensible to complete the operation during the outgoing administration
instead of getting caught up in the transition or facing project delays later because of
it, or possible cancellation by the new government (World Bank 2003).

       The electricity sector DPO in the Dominican Republic, two electricity sector
DPOs in Senegal , and the one-tranche DPO for Bangladesh (all rated unsatisfactory
for development outcome) are examples of some of typical design shortcomings of
development policy lending in a difficult sector environment that borders on
financial chaos.

       The Programmatic Power Sector Reform Loan in the Dominican Republic,
approved in May 2005 as a three-tranche operation, supported the government’s
strategy for electricity sector financial recovery, particularly to establish conditions
that would improve both access to electricity and quality of service, especially by
reducing widespread blackouts. Heavily underpriced electricity and widespread
nonpayment of bills (including by government consumers) were at the heart of the
sector’s deep financial and operational crisis marked by large government subsidy
transfers to distribution companies, extremely poor service quality, rationing,
frequent blackouts, and slow increases in access to electricity in unelectrified rural
communities.

        The loan to stabilize electricity supply and reduce blackouts supported a key
short-term policy measure that included keeping current on payments to generation
companies. Outcomes for the short-term stabilization of supply were satisfactory in
2006–07, but the oil price increase in 2008 pushed the sector’s deficit to more than $1.2
billion, and budget transfers were insufficient to pay generators in full. Large-scale
blackouts returned in 2008 as a result. The loan’s contribution to laying the
foundation for the medium-term stabilization of the electricity supply was weak on
balance. The cash recovery improved somewhat, but tariffs remained frozen amid
rising fuel prices, and both government transfers and payment arrears increased. The
government did not implement the automatic tariff adjustment despite its
commitment to do so under the loan. Further complicating the situation, the
government did not sustain the large and growing levels of operational subsidy
transfers required to keep current on the amounts owed to generators.




                                            29
       Under these circumstances, the original intent for as a rapid disbursement
mechanism with a tranche of $50 million in loans every six months gradually became
a halting effort to comply with the conditionality checklist for the first and second
tranches for four years. Of the $150 million loan amount, only $100 million was
disbursed, and the nonfulfillment of policy actions led to cancellation of the third
tranche at loan closing in 2009. Overall, IEG’s Implementation Completion and
Results Report rated the project outcomes as unsatisfactory because they fell far short
of project development objectives—that is, the operation did not contribute to
making the sector more financially sustainable (World Bank 2009).

       The Dominican Republic’s experience suggests that the choice of a multi-
tranche modality may not provide the flexibility needed to reassess a rapidly
changing sector situation and adapt the World Bank’s approach accordingly. Even at
project appraisal, a multi-tranche operation was considered more rigid than a
programmatic series of single-tranche loans because the tranche release conditions
for the multi-tranche operation were predetermined and would require waivers from
the World Bank’s Board if they were not fully met, which was the case on two
occasions regarding the critical tariff adjustment formula. Based on experience, a
programmatic series of single-tranche loans might have been the better approach for
supporting a well-specified, medium-term program for the crisis in the Dominican
Republic’s electricity sector to allow flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances
during implementation (World Bank 2011b).

       The Senegal Electricity Sector Efficiency Project, an IDA credit approved in
April 2005, carried significant financial performance-enhancing measures in addition
to the physical components that supported the electricity sector’s 10-year investment
program through a two-phase adaptable program loan (APL) combined with partial
risk guarantees and International Finance Corporation (IFC) loans.11 The key project
objectives included the adoption of a new electricity tariff mechanism and a series of
financial covenants to promote steady improvement in SENELEC’s finances.12
However, the project did not explore these covenants in-depth during project
preparation or establish measures to that effect during implementation. The tariff-
setting mechanism was reformed twice during project implementation, but this was
not sufficient to spare SENELEC from severe financial difficulties. Paragraph 5.31


11 None of the IDA-funded physical investments was carried out[[AQ: Are physical
investments implemented? Is there another word besides “carried out?”]], but the IFC-
supported power plant was satisfactorily completed in 2008, though with a two-year delay
and serious technical problems in the first years of operation.
12 Financial covenants included debt service coverage, return on assets, and accounts

receivable.


                                            30
discusses this in more detail in the context of leveraging investment operations with
technical assistance and analytical work.

        The single-tranche Power Sector Development Policy Credit in Bangladesh,
approved in June 2008 and considered the World Bank’s flagship operation, aimed to
improve the electricity sector’s financial sustainability through several measures,
including corporatization, enhanced governance and accountability, customer
metering, and systematic transfer of government subsidy to the main national utility,
the Bangladesh Power Development Board. IEG found this objective was highly
relevant, but the 2014 Project Performance Assessment Report rated the development
outcome as unsatisfactory, citing little progress toward sector financial solvency and
a continuing, unsustainably high level of government subsidies (World Bank 2014).
For example, the planned installation of automatic metering to monitor interutility
flows and consumption by large electricity consumers in the South Zone Power
Distribution Company was not pursued seriously, even six years after credit closure.
The company corporatization was essentially reversed in the five years after credit
closure, erasing earlier progress. Tariffs continue to be significantly short of cost
recovery, and the sector’s financial deterioration persisted. The scale of subsidy grew
sharply since credit closure. The credit operation’s only positive outcome was that
the government created a system for transferring operational subsidies to the main
utility. The project design was logical and comprehensive, but the single-tranche
arrangement was a serious design shortcoming. Clearly, the World Bank acted
opportunistically with a reform-minded (though short-lived) caretaker
administration. However, the sector’s long-standing structural, financial, and
governance shortcomings and the operation’s complexity in the context of the
existing institutional capacity, readiness, and political instability would have called
for a medium-term, multi-tranche project instead of a 10-month, one-off operation
(IEG 2014).


Sustaining Improvements in Sector Financial Performance
       Deep-rooted structural problems have no quick fix. Electricity sector reforms
that involve financially restructuring insolvent or bankrupt utilities require time and
sustained financial and technical resources that few developing countries can
provide. Experience shows that fundamental financial restructuring of the electricity
sector takes many years, and the turnaround process may take even longer than
usual in countries with a long-running history of almost permanent financial crisis
(such as India, Senegal, the Dominican Republic, and Lebanon). Considering that
deep-seated problems of structural financial underperformance have no quick fix,
some of the policy-based sector loans (particularly the single-tranche DPOs such as


                                          31
those in Bangladesh, Senegal, and Lebanon) tried to achieve too much too soon. This
circumstance may largely explain the prevalence of these operations’ relative poor
development outcome ratings.

       Given the long-standing, deep-rooted structural problems in the electricity
sectors of many developing countries, a single-tranche sector DPO can at best
contribute to short-term stabilization of a sector mired in financial crisis—for
example, through budget support to enable the government to make budgetary
transfers that compensate for electricity underpricing in a largely state-owned
system. Experience shows that it is unrealistic to expect a quick-disbursing, single-
tranche DPO to address long-standing structural weaknesses successfully, much less
place the sector on the road to financial sustainability, even when the World Bank’s
broad operational engagement in the sector accompanies the policy operation (as in
Bangladesh).

         As discussed in paragraphs 5.17–5.21, the Dominican Republic DPOs faced a
project time frame that was unrealistic and too optimistic, which was completely out
of sync with the sector’s long-standing, deeply rooted structural financial
underperformance. In particular, the policy action on electricity tariffs was too
ambitious in the country’s difficult political environment. Including measures to
bring tariffs in line with market rates for oil in a short time was unrealistic. The
government’s resulting lack of political commitment to implement the automatic
tariff adjustment undermined all efforts to move the sector toward financial
sustainability on a compressed time scale.

        Turkey’s programmatic DPOs present a positive experience in this respect.
The four-year implementation period—longer than usual for programmatic DPOs—
was appropriate for the nature of the underlying key issues addressed, including the
tariff reform, payment collections, and privatization of a large number of distribution
companies.

       Leveraging investment operations with technical assistance and analytical
work yields better and more sustainable results. Kazakhstan’s experience in
successfully turning around its national utility’s finances through a set of sustained
World Bank–supported measures illustrates this point well. The Kazakhstan
Electricity Grid Operating Company (KEGOC) was unprofitable since its
establishment, with losses in the late 1990s of 7–10 percent of total revenues because
of underpriced transmission and dispatch service, excessive use of government-
imposed transmission tariff discounts granted to selected large, industrial customers,
and losses from noncore businesses. Against this background, a major project
development objective of the World Bank–funded Kazakhstan Electricity


                                          32
Transmission Project was to help transform KEGOC (a corporate borrower) into a
financially viable company, set a cost-reflective transmission tariff, and support full
cost recovery for its services, including eliminating administratively imposed tariff
discounts, improving payment collections, reducing accounts receivable, and
divesting noncore businesses. KEGOC became profitable in 2002 because of the
consistent implementation of these measures and remained profitable through 2015
with the support of a series of follow-on World Bank projects that allowed sustained
monitoring of KEGOC’s financial performance reform of the transmission tariff
methodology, and avoided recourse to administratively ordered tariffs discounts.
KEGOC is one of Central Asia’s financially and technically strongest national
electricity utilities, with the capacity to self-finance a considerable portion (more than
half) of the company’s ambitious medium-term investment and modernization
programs (World Bank 1999 and 2009e).13

        A series of four World Bank loans to India’s national electricity transmission
company, Power Grid Corporation of India (PowerGrid), in the past two decades is
another good example of the value of long-term World Bank engagements through
sequential specific investment loans to improve corporate financial performance.
Four World Bank loans significantly and measurably contributed to improved
corporate finances. When the first loan was approved in 1993, PowerGrid was
financially weak and had low value assets and limited cash resources. However,
PowerGrid’s financial capacity continued to improve at an impressive rate during the
four operations. The company regularly complied with the financial loan covenants
(including the standard ratio covenants) and frequently exceeded them. The
company’s net profitability increased substantially over time through a series of
measures such as tariff improvements, employee productivity gains, impressive
growth in power exchange and transmission volumes, recovery of past debts, and
effective receivables management. For example, during the life of the fourth loan
(FY2008–14), PowerGrid complied with the following financial legal covenants in the
loan agreement: the debt-equity ratio was lower than 80:20; the self-financing ratio
was greater than 20 percent; and the accounts receivables stood at only 0. 34 months
of average billing as of July 31, 2014 compared with the legally allowed less-than-
three months of billing (IEG 2012c and 2015a).

       Another example long-term World Bank engagement is the Mongolia Energy
Sector Project (IEG 2015b), implemented during 2001–13, which supported the
government’s strategy of improving the reliability, quality, cost-effectiveness, and


 IEG’s sources also include the Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company Annual
13

Reports for various years.


                                            33
financial viability of the electricity sector. The project design combined physical
components with commercialization measures and institutional and capacity-
building arrangements. The operation significantly contributed to reducing electricity
system losses, improving service reliability in distribution, and enhancing revenue
collection by Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Company (UBEDN). The project
achieved UBEDN’s financial recovery by reducing the company’s cost of supply
through loss reduction, and providing much-needed liquidity through increased
revenue collection and reduction of accounts receivable. At project completion, the
number of billing collection days at UBEDN decreased from 100 to 35 days.

         The Rwanda Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project aimed to alleviate power
shortages and enhance the capacity of energy sector institutions. The project was a
fast-track operation to alleviate the power supply shortfall. Investments in
transmission and distribution contributed to a reduction of technical system outages
and a loss reduction from 25 percent to 16 percent. The application of a prepayment
system also cut commercial losses. The government significantly raised the power
tariffs in two stages, and payment collection increased from 72 percent to 84 percent.

        Senegal’s experience contrasts with these examples. The Senegal Electricity
Sector Efficiency Project, an IDA credit approved in April 2005, carried significant
financial performance-enhancing measures in addition to the physical components
that supported the electricity sector’s 10-year investment program through a two-
phase APL combined with partial risk guarantees and IFC loans.14 The key project
objectives included the adoption of a new electricity tariff mechanism and a series of
financial covenants to promote steady improvement in SENELEC’s finances.15
However, the project did not explore these covenants in-depth during project
preparation or establish measures to that effect during implementation. The tariff-
setting mechanism was reformed twice during project implementation, but this was
not sufficient to spare SENELEC from severe financial difficulties. Instead, the
company’s financial situation worsened dramatically in 2006 when it lost $70 million
(after a government operating subsidy of about the same amount), and continued to
worsen in subsequent years because of higher oil prices and delayed investments,
requiring budgetary transfers of about $220 million in 2011. SENELEC’s leverage rose
to alarming levels, with a debt-equity ratio of 86:14 by the end of 2011. None of the
financial covenants were met. IEG’s Project Performance Assessment Report (IEG

14 None of the IDA-funded physical investments was carried out, but the IFC-supported
power plant was satisfactorily completed in 2008, though with a two-year delay and serious
technical problems in the first years of operation.
15 Financial covenants included debt service coverage, return on assets, and accounts

receivable.


                                            34
2013b) rated the project outcome unsatisfactory, including World Bank performance.
The report noted that SENELEC’s serious structural operating deficit in the absence
of revenue-enhancing measures, including much-needed tariff increases.

        In retrospect on both Senegal and the Dominican Republic (paragraphs 5.17–
5.22), the World Bank could have considered sufficient operational and policy
advisory engagement (such as in Turkey and Vietnam) on various sector fronts to
work effectively with governments on sustainable implementation of financial
performance. In the Dominican Republic, parallel World Bank investment operations
(or operations by other development agencies) could have accompanied or preceded
the stand-alone sector DPO—such operations would have addressed the high risks
from the electricity infrastructure’s poor technical condition and from too much
dependence on high-priced imported oil for electricity generation. Without such
parallel sector operations, the DPO’s development benefits would have been
unsustainable, even under smooth DPO program implementation.

Notes: In unbundled sectors with mixed state and private ownership a major national utility (e. g. , KEGOC, the national
transmission company for Kazakhstan) was chosen as proxy indicator. When data were not available for 2000, 2010 and
2013 the closest available year was chosen for which data could be found. Net income is after tax.

Appendix D. Illustrating the Link Between
Financial Performance and Sector outcomes:
Four Recent Country Experiences
Most recently, sector finances have further deteriorated—in some cases rather
sharply—in a number of developing countries including those to which the World
Bank has provided considerable advisory and financing support. A combination of
factors accounts for this unforeseen trend, including continued underpricing, overly
ambitious government-imposed investment programs and onerous debt-service
burdens driven increasingly by costly short-term borrowing. Several illustrative cases
are described below in some detail.

In Vietnam, the financial performance of Vietnam Electricity (EVN), the national
utility, was reasonably satisfactory till the mid-2000s. A sharp deteriorating trend
started in 2008, raising serious concerns about EVN’s and the power sector’s financial
and operational sustainability going forward. Between 1998 and 2011, the company
posted large financial losses. 16 In 2011, the after-tax loss amounted to 13 percent of
the company’s net sales revenue. Indebtedness has grown so much in the absence of
capital injection from the government that EVN is now increasingly challenged to
raise funds from the commercial market. Due to overall poor financial performance
in recent years, EVN Holding and its subsidiary companies, unlike before, have often
been in breach of the financial ratio covenants (including for self-financing and debt
coverage) applied under ongoing World Bank and Asian Development Bank loans.
Several drivers explain the deterioration of the financial situation, including
insufficient tariffs, operational underperformance, lack of proper financial
management and un-hedged positions in foreign exchange, interest rates and fuels,
and unsustainable indebtedness driven largely by an overly ambitious investment
program (AF-Mercados EMI 2013). The financial deterioration has coincided with a
steady worsening of the reliability and quality of electricity supply in distribution. 17
The high voltage transmission system has also displayed a mixed reliability record
lately. Although the number of interruptions has fallen, the duration of interruptions
has increased considerably (IEG 2014b).



16In 2012 and 2013, EVN recorded a net profit due to favorable hydrological conditions and
the resulting large increase in low-cost hydropower in the generation mix.
17For example, in 2012, under the Northern Power Corporation, one of the three large
regional distribution companies, there were 53 interruptions per customer, totaling a
cumulative 150 hours (or 6.3 days).


                                             5
In India, despite considerable progress in some reforms (including legislation, open
access regulation, market opening), power sector finances have deteriorated sharply
in the past decade, which, in conjunction with other factors, have brought the
electricity sector to the brink of crisis. The alarming state of the sector is highlighted
by the massive grid failures in July 2012 that interrupted electricity supply in the
northern half of the country for two consecutive days. Generally, consumers receive
unreliable service with frequent supply interruptions. Sector-wide financial losses
stood at US$25 billion in 2011 (1. 3 percent of GDP), more than twice (in real terms)
than in 2003, i. e. , growing at 9 percent per year. The increase in sector losses has
been largely plugged by state subsidies and heavy (and increasingly short term and
costly) borrowing to meet operating expense by all segments of the value chain.
Subsidies received by state utilities over 2003-2011 totaled US$28 billion (2 percent of
GDP in 2011) and total debt stood at US$77 billion in 2011 (5 percent of GDP). The
financial crisis is rooted overwhelmingly in the distribution sector from which it
spills over to transmission and generation. Distribution utilities account for more 70
percent of total sector-wide accumulated losses. Three main factors have been
driving the underlying cost-revenue gap and the resulting financial loss: (i)
inadequate tariff increases to cover rising costs (including heavily subsidized
electricity supply to agriculture); (ii) high technical and commercial losses (in the
range of 30-40 percent in the major electricity consuming states); and (iii) inefficient
revenue collection [94 percent in 2011] (Pargal and Banerjee 2014).

In Bangladesh, despite a series of Development Support Credits, including a recent
(2008-2009) freestanding Power Sector Development Credit aimed at financial
stabilization of the electricity sector, the latter’s financial performance has
deteriorated significantly lately due largely to tariffs significantly short of cost
recovery levels. Net losses of the national electricity utility (Bangladesh Power
Development Board/BPDB) increased from US$146 million (18 percent of operating
revenue) in FY2008 to US$640 million (30 percent) by FY2013 – a 4. 5-fold jump in a
half decade. During this period, there has been a roughly similar increase in
government budgetary support to BPDB to enable the latter, a single buyer, to make
timely payments to IPPs and rental electricity providers. To prevent a further large
increase in electricity shortages, the government has contracted rapidly increasing
capacities of very expensive rental power plants run on liquid fuel. The share of
rental capacity in total installed generation capacity jumped from 1 percent in FY2008
to 26 percent in FY2013. These short-term plants have imposed a large additional
financial burden on the electricity sector, which the government handles by
subsidizing the gap between the bulk supply tariff that the distribution utilities pay
to BPDB and the price the PBDB pays to generate and purchase electricity (IEG
2014a).

In Senegal, in spite of sizable policy lending by the World Bank in the form of
budgetary support, the electricity sector ended up facing a deepening financial crisis


                                            6
from 2006 onwards, characterized by recurrent blackouts rising exponentially
between 2006 and 2011, with unserved energy spiking to 250 MW (equivalent to 18
percent of consumption) and mounting needs for budgetary transfers to the sector (in
2008, about US$120 million, or 1 percent of GDP). In 2006, the national electricity
company SENELEC’s financial loss deteriorated dramatically to US$70 million.
Things got only worse in the subsequent years with the effect of higher oil prices and
delayed investments, requiring significant amounts of budgetary transfers. In
parallel, SENELEC’s leverage rose to alarming levels, with a debt-equity ratio of
86:14 by end-2011. By 2010, the company’s financial loss exceeded the US$100 million
mark in spite of significant operating subsidies from the government. Essentially, the
electricity sector has been caught in a steep downward spiral caused by the
interaction of SENELEC’s increasingly poor finances and the sector’s
underinvestment. It works like this: SENELEC’s undercapitalization and structural
operating deficit (caused by insufficient tariffs and lagging budgetary transfers)
perpetuates inefficiency by preventing the company from investing in required
maintenance of aging assets and moving away from oil-based generation to improve
cost structure in the long run. 18 And SENELEC’s difficult cash situation only makes
matters worse by causing payment problems with suppliers, leading to delays in
supplies of critical inputs, including fuel, and in payments to the private IPP thereby
disrupting the functioning of the generating plants. The dire state of sector finances is
also a disincentive to potential private partners in future IPP projects whose
contribution is much needed to invest in more efficient, lower cost (e. g. , coal- or gas-
based) generating plants without which the sector will continue to generate
electricity at prohibitively high costs (IEG 2013b).

In addition, considerable country-based anecdotal evidence points to the detrimental
impact of poor financial performance on sector outcomes.

The Dominican Republic exemplifies the close linkage between “financial blackouts”
(i. e. , the generators’ inability to pay for fuel purchase due to the distributors’
insufficient and lagging payments for electricity) and power blackouts. In 2002-2004,
the electricity sector fell into a financial chaos. Distribution was the most
dysfunctional element of the electricity system. Poor quality of service, permanent
customer dissatisfaction and relatively high tariffs induced large-scale theft through
illegal connections and nonpayment of bills by businesses and households alike. The
cash recovery index was down to 48 percent in 2004 - one of the lowest in the world.

18In an attempt to limit load shedding but also due to insufficient scheduled maintenance of
generation facilities, the planned investment program was grossly underachieved by
SENELEC: for example, between 2009 and 2001, the execution rate fell from 58 percent to as
low as 25 percent, which increased breakdown frequency and reduced the operating
efficiency of the power plants. Transmission and distribution equipment suffered the same
fate and now require disproportionately large rehabilitation investments (World Bank 2012).


                                             7
The resulting generation shortfall led to blackouts of extreme proportions. From mid-
2002, power cuts curtailed supplies by over 20 hours per day in vast areas of the
country, particularly in poor neighborhoods. In 2004, unmet electricity demand rose
to 25 percent. Short-term policy measures, supported by a World Bank programmatic
loan, stabilized the electricity sector: no arrears were accumulated in the payment to
generators in 2006-2007 as transfers from the government covered the losses of
distributors, leading to better outcomes in service quality than in previous years. The
blackouts were relatively flat during this period. However, arrears resurfaced in 2008
when exceptionally high oil prices pushed the sector’s financial deficit over the US$1.
2 billion mark and budget transfers became insufficient to pay generators in full. This
resulted in the resumption of significant blackouts in mid-2008 and led to street
violence (World Bank 2005; World Bank 2009).

A similar case is presented by Senegal where recently a direct linkage could be
observed between the electricity sector’s deepening financial crisis and rapidly
growing electricity shortages in terms of undelivered energy. In tandem with the 14-
fold increase in SENELEC’s financial losses between 2004 and 2010, the undelivered
energy jumped 12. 5-fold during the same period (see Figure 1). The increasingly
severe energy shortages can be traced to delays in needed generation investments,
poor operational efficiency and fuel supply difficulties faced by generators primarily
as a result of SENELEC’s downward financial spiral (IEG 2012a; IEG 2013b).

In Bangladesh, amid worsening sector finances, the electricity deficit (peak demand
minus maximum generation) widened from 1,439 MW in FY2008 to 1,949 MW in
FY2013. In 2012, load shedding was equivalent to 12 percent of total installed
generation capacity despite the extremely rapid growth in expensive short-term
rental generation capacity (World Bank 2014).
In India, the inefficient, financially loss-making distribution sector and inadequate,
unreliable electricity supply have become major constraints to the country’s


                                              8
economic growth, inclusion, job creation and aspirations for middle-income status.
As noted above, in 2010, cost recovery of residential tariffs at the national level was
only about two-thirds. Most of the state electric utilities have been caught in the
“death spiral” of a steady cost-revenue gap. As a result, the peak electricity deficit
today is as high as 10. 5 percent and the amount of unserved energy is 7. 5 percent.
More than 300 million people remain without electricity and per capita consumption
at 780 kWh is among the lowest in the world. The unsustainable state of sector
finances, unless they are turned around in the near future, makes it highly unlikely
that government’s ambitious plan for generation capacity expansion—a fourfold
increase by 2031—can be achieved (Pargal and Banerjee 2014; Mayer et al 2015).

Finally, in South Africa, after several years of sustained economic growth, supported
by reliable and sufficient electricity supply, the electricity system came under
considerable strain towards the end of the 2000s when the electricity sector, though
generally operationally efficient, ran into major capacity constraints. In recent years
the cash-strapped national utility, Eskom, has put off maintenance of its generation
plants in an effort to keep the country’s lights on and has concentrated on keeping
existing, obsolete plants running. Nearly two-thirds of Eskom’s installed base-load
capacity is past its “mid-life. ” Of total generation capacity of about 43,000 MW, only
75 percent is available – a 10 percentage point decrease over the past five years.
Figure 2 shows a large jump in the unavailable capacity due to plant breakdowns.
The supply crisis has forced the utility to apply increasingly severe load shedding -
rolling power cuts to conserve supplies. The load shedding, affecting both the
residential sector and energy-intensive industries, shaves an estimated 0. 5 percent of
the country’s economic growth. The national economy has staggered to crawl in 2015
because of crippling electricity shortage (World Bank 2011a; Financial Times 2014;
The Economist 2016).
