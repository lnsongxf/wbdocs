Start-up               A newly establish business venture that is in its first stages of operation. This
                       report focuses on tech start-ups, which are start-ups that have a technological
                       component. These start-ups are typically designed to scale up quickly.

Start-up Ecosystem     The combination of people, start-ups at various stages and other stakeholders
                       and organizations supporting or connecting to these start-ups, interacting in
                       multiple dimensions to create and scale new start-up ventures.

Scale-up (Firm)        OECD defines a scale-up as a firm that has an average annualized return of at least
                       20 percent in the past three years with at least 10 employees at the beginning of
                       the period (OECD 2007).

Venture Capital (VC)   An institutional investor that provides financing to start-ups and small early stage
                       firms. Usually VCs look for high growth potential firms to exit the investment in
                       the short term.

Angel Investor         An investor who invest in ventures (primarily at an early stage) in their personal
                       capacity (that is, investing their personal money) and may or may not have an
                       active advisory or guidance role for the founders in the venture.

Mentor                 An experienced person who can provide advice, knowledge, or connections to
                       a start-up founder. Mentors usually have strong business acumen and practical
                       experience through former entrepreneurship experience or industry knowledge.

Business Acumen        Theoretical or practical knowledge of how to develop and manage a business,
                       including proclivity and speed in understanding and dealing with risks and
                       opportunities in the business environment.

Exit                   Refers to the point at which a founder or early stage investors sell their stakes
(start-up exit)        in the venture, generally either in a private acquisition or public offering. This
                       report refers more widely to “start-up exit” as the point at which a start-up is
                       sustainable or it has received sufficient funding to grow in the medium-term
                       (that is, over the next five years).

     The largest two networks of connectivity in Dar es Salaam’s

     Dar es Salaam (see Figure 2.12). For start-ups to raise funding
     successfully, they need to be part of the core clusters of
     connections. In Dar es Salaam, the ecosystem is less densely                          400
     connected, meaning that founders already need to have a
     connection with the clusters of accelerators, investors, or
     funded start-ups or reach out to those clusters as outsiders.                         350

     hypothesis is further supported by a comment from a survey

     The community of Dar es Salaam’s ecosystem is consistent
     with its nascent stage, with very low density and limited                             200

     the more difficult it is for a founder to find their way to

     The evidence from our analysis points to the conclusion that the start-up ecosystem in Dar es Salaam is at a nascent stage that is
     just beginning to develop (see Table 3.1).

     support programs for entrepreneurs (for example, accelerators)    to grow.

BOX A.1 WHAT IS CENTRALITY?

                                                                                                   Degree centrality
   By calculating centrality measures of stakeholders in the dataset, key players
   in the community can be identified quantitatively.

   The diagrams below, while not specific to our dataset, help illustrate the
   definition and interpretation of each type of centrality. Red indicates higher
   centrality values. Blue indicates lower centrality values.

   Degree centrality measures the number of other nodes within the
                                                                                                  Closeness centrality
   ecosystem each node is directly connected to. It does not take into account
   any second-order connections.



   Closeness centrality measures a node’s social distance to other nodes. It is
   expressed as the inverse of the average distance from each node to every
   other node in the network. A low closeness centrality indicates that the firm
   is on the edge of the network.                                                                Eigenvector centrality



   Eigenvector centrality augments degree centrality by taking into account
   the connectivity of the nodes a node is connected to. Highly connected nodes
   within highly interconnected clusters have high eigenvector centrality.


                                                                                                 Betweenness centrality
   Betweenness centrality measures how many times a node acts as a gateway
   in the network. The higher the betweenness centrality of a firm, the more
   paths run through that firm to connect two other firms. High betweenness
   centrality means that a node is a key bridge or facilitator between different
   clusters.
