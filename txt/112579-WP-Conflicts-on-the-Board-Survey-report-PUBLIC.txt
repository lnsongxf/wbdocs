          Introduction
          In the boardroom, disagreements are often unavoidable — especially when the board is composed of independent-
          minded, skilled, and outspoken directors. This is not a bad thing. There should be a debate in the boardroom, and
          decisions should result from a process in which directors consider all reasonably available information. A board that never
          argues or disagrees is most likely to be an inactive, passive, or inattentive board — in other words, an ineffective board
          that is neither fulfilling its oversight function nor carrying out its duty of care.

2   Conflicts in the Boardroom Survey
Key Findings

4   Conflicts in the Boardroom Survey
Boardrooms in Conflict
All boardrooms have disputes, which not surprisingly cover a wide range of topics. Our survey found that the most
frequent subjects of disputes were (in descending order of frequency) 1) the financial, structural, or procedural workings
of the organization; 2) the personal behavior and attitudes of directors; and 3) strategy development, including mergers
and acquisitions. (See Table 2.)

Impact of Disputes
In themselves, disputes are not necessarily a problem for a board; it is when they are mismanaged or become insurmountable
that the problem occurs. Considering the impact of these disputes on business priorities (see Table 3), it is important for
organizations to tackle them effectively, to ensure that the negative outcomes are minimized.

          Attempts to Resolve the Dispute
          Regarding the roles that those surveyed have taken when disputes have arisen on the board, we received a mixture of
          responses.

          For example, 47.8 percent of respondents stated that                 stance that is either openly on one side of the dispute or is
          when they encountered board disputes, they commonly                  noncombative (a fight-or-flight response).
          attempted to mediate the dispute; 34.3 percent admitted              The significance of the positions people adopt in
          that they were frequently or very frequently an active               relation to conflict can be seen in their choice of how
          party to the dispute; 25.3 percent said they commonly                to deal with it. The most common mechanisms for
          are not the active party, but take side in the dispute; and          resolving a dispute remained internal to the board (see
          26.5 percent of respondents reported that they frequently            Table 4). Therefore, as the table suggests, it is important

          show that, although board members may think they                     skills in mediation and negotiation — the most common
          would try to resolve a dispute, in reality a small majority          methods of resolving disputes.

When Disputes Cannot Be Resolved
A significant percentage (15.6 percent) of respondents reported that their boardroom disputes frequently are not resolved.
And 67.2 percent said they have some experience of unresolved issues.
More strikingly, 29.6 percent of our survey respondents indicated that they had experienced a boardroom dispute that
affected the survival of an organization they had been involved with. Of those who reported such disputes, 63.6 percent
cited personal issues connected with the dispute as being a major factor in the organization’s demise. (See some of their
comments below.)



     There are many [issues], but they all boil down to personality
    “
     crisis. Most of the people I have been on boards with feel
     overqualified and find it difficult to accept views of other
     members.”



                                                 In the first board meeting with a new board which was less friendly
                                                “
                                                 to him, [the CEO] quit and put several million dollars in his pocket.”



     . . .The chairman insisted on his idea of an IPO, and the
    “
     organization collapsed.”




                                                 The current conflict over succession planning for the founder/chair/
                                                “
                                                 CEO of the NGO is threatening the survival of the organization.
                                                 A pattern of conflict avoidance on the part of the chair/CEO, a
                                                 stagnant flow of information, and the board’s passivity make it hard
                                                 to discuss next steps.”




     Personal behavior and attitudes of directors. The CEO’s
    “
     abrasive style, with zero appetite for “changes,” has pushed the
     company to a stage wherein the company is under attack from
     the stakeholders, including the creditors.”



                                                 In one board, there was a significant difference of opinion between
                                                “
                                                 the chairman-CEO and the board about the way he had treated
                                                 relations with personnel. That might have paralyzed the company.
                                                 The board obliged the CEO to quit.”




     If we [the board members] are not going to act as per their
    “
     instructions, our job security will be questionable. Generally
     speaking, we are hostages.”




                                                                                                        Conflicts in the Boardroom Survey   7
          The Difficulty of Dealing with Personal Factors
          Complicating factors in the way a dispute is presented frequently become as important as the subject matter of the dispute
          itself. These factors can make handling a dispute more difficult (see Table 5).

The Training that Directors Want versus the Training Already Received
Given these trends, it is not a surprise that the training that board members now want is in how to deal with these personal
issues and handle the human being behind the dispute. Overall, the most requested training was for the “ability to deal
with different personalities” (74.8 percent described it as “very useful”), the “ability to give and receive constructive
feedback” (73.0 percent described it as “very useful”), and the “ability to have difficult conversations” (70.1 percent
described it as very useful). (See Table 6.)

The following comments from our respondents reflect this need for increased training in tackling personal issues, such as
emotional intelligence, diversity, and leadership.


      A greater awareness of the role that emotional intelligence plays in
     “
      relationships and decision making would be helpful. Our chairman/CEO
      is all too willing to bury succession planning by reducing the number of
      board meetings held annually, creating impossibly long agendas, and
      dominating discussions. The board members admire and respect his work
      but are too timid and seem unable to help him see that if the NGO is to
      survive and his legacy remain intact, it is time to find a new leader.”

      might have to deal with. With diversity, which may overcome group

      keep disagreement from becoming a dispute.”

           A Gender Difference?
           Notably, while training is comparable for men and women in the other skills, we found a gender difference in the amount
           of skills training that respondents have received in negotiation skills: for example, 39.1 percent of men have received
           internal training and 62.5 percent have received external training; but just 11.4 percent of women have received internal
           training and 45.5 percent have received external training. (See Figure 5 and Table 7 on page 11.)

           Impact of Enterprise Size on Resolving Conflict
           We found that the size of an organization made a notable difference in the percentage of board disputes that were not
           resolved. Respondents from smaller companies were more likely to say that the issue was not resolved than were those
           from larger enterprises. Of those surveyed, 24.1 percent from smaller enterprises said that their issues were frequently not
           resolved, compared to just 5.9 percent from medium enterprises and 15.6 percent from large enterprises. (See Figure 7.) (It
           should also be noted that a significant number of respondents across all enterprises stated that there were never occasions
           when their issues were not resolved.)

Conclusion
Overall, the results show the prevalence of boardroom disputes and the damaging effects that unresolved disputes can
have. Even those disputes that are resolved still have a significant impact on a business, because they waste management
time and distract from core business priorities. Further, we found that the majority of disputes are resolved by internal
methods of negotiation and mediation, rather than through court action. Therefore, it is important for board members
to be capable of resolving disputes themselves and thus they should continue to be trained in the skills needed to do so.
However, we discovered that respondents find some disputes more difficult to resolve, and the most complicated to
resolve are those that involve human factors such as competing factions and emotions. Our survey uncovered a skills
gap in training for these types of issues, and we learned that the vast majority of respondents would appreciate more
training in these soft skills. Training in how to handle different personalities and emotions (as well as increased training
in negotiation and mediation skills) would equip boards to tackle disputes that are frequently extremely difficult because
of board members’ reluctance to address these human factors.
