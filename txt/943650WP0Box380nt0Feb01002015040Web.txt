Executive Summary

The Growth Transformation Plan (GTP, 2010/11-2014/15) prepared by the Government of Ethiopia
(GoE) is the medium term strategic framework for a five-year period that shall guide the country’s
efforts towards accelerating GDP growth, employment creation and transforming Ethiopia from
a predominantly agrarian to a modern and industrialized economy. The GTP aims to increase the
per capita income of its citizens to middle-income levels by 2025. This is just one goal in a portfolio
of important socioeconomic targets for the future. Private sector development strategies to reach
these goals include enhancing the productivity and modernization of Ethiopia’s agricultural sector,
and enhancing the technological sophistication and economic contribution of the industrial sector.
Ambitious targets have been set for the industrial sector and the GTP specifically identifies micro and
small enterprises (MSEs) development as the key industrial policy direction for creating employment
opportunities in Ethiopia.1 In particular, MSEs are expected to contribute greatly towards the GTP
targets through the creation of more than 3 million jobs over the 5-year reference period.2

But are MSEs currently the main net job creators in Ethiopia? Are they able to access adequate
financial services in a context where the banking sector is registering profitability levels well above
the Sub-Saharan African average?3 These are some of the key questions that the present study
aims at addressing.

At the international level, the key role played especially by small and medium sized enterprises
in economic development and their contribution to economic diversification and employment is
widely recognized, and so is the reality that these enterprises face financing constraints around the
world, both in developed and developing markets (Ayyagari et al. 2007; Beck et al. 2005).

This study starts with a brief analysis of which firms are the main net job creators in Ethiopia and
then focuses on the financing constraints of Ethiopian MSMEs as one of the key obstacles to job
creation and growth.4 In doing so, the study uses two demand-side surveys (the Ethiopia Survey
of Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing Industries – LMMIS, an unbalanced panel composed of
about 6,000 firms with at least 10 employees which allows for a study of firm dynamics from 2000
through 2011 and the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey (ES) that was conducted between July 2011
and July 2012 and includes 794 firms which allows for the additional examination of the services
sector, microenterprises, and a more detailed understanding of firm experiences with respect
to access to finance) and an ad-hoc supply side survey administered to 16 financial institutions,
including the major public and private sector commercial banks and microfinance institutions,
covering over 90% of the total assets in the banking and microfinance sector.5 This survey allowed
collecting data on the actual involvement of financial institutions with MSMEs, their perception of
potential public policy approaches to enhance MSME access to finance and the adequateness of
their current business models.

The combination of both demand-side and supply-side analysis allows to gain a full picture of MSME
finance practices in Ethiopia by connecting information on firm experiences with the reporting of
financial institutions on their business practices. While there was already anecdotal evidence that
small firms were lacking proper access to finance in Ethiopia, the value added of this study is to
provide accurate empirical evidence of the existence of a missing middle phenomenon.

   1	 The industrial sector has been identified as the leading sector for realizing the country’s development objectives.
      Industry’s share in overall GDP is expected to increase from 12.9% in 2009/10 to 18.8% by 2014/15.
   2	 Under the leadership of FeMSEDA, support to MSEs has been extensive, and has helped to achieve targets
      set out in the GTP. From 2010 to 2013, 578,005 MSEs were supported by FeMSEDA and received at total of
      4,807,314,875 Birr in financing ($240 Million USD), creating an estimated 1,024,739 jobs. (Source: FeMSEDA MSE
      Yearly Statistical Bulletin, 2013).

   4	 While there is no universally agreed definition of MSMEs, the supply side analysis of this study makes use of the
      definition for MSEs contained in the 2011 Ethiopia National MSE Strategy (i.e. by focusing on head count only,
      microenterprises have up to 5 employees, small enterprises have from 6 to 30 employees) while the demand-side
      analysis relies on the definition used by the Ethiopian CSA’s Survey of Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing
      Industries (i.e. micro as 0-9 employees, small as 10-20 employees, medium as 21-99 employees and large as 100+
      employees).
   5	 Responses to the supply-side survey were provided by thirteen out of sixteen financial institutions: seven banks
      representing 87.1 percent of the banking sector asset portfolio and six microfinance institutions representing 70
      percent of the micro finance sector asset portfolio.



SME FINANCE IN ETHIOPIA: ADDRESSING THE MISSING MIDDLE CHALLENGE                                                          3
Findings from both demand-side and supply-side surveys clearly indicate the existence of a missing
middle phenomenon in Ethiopia whereby small enterprises are more credit constrained than either
micro or medium/large enterprises. In particular, the demand-side analysis shows that MSMEs
in Ethiopia perform much worse than large firms across a host of finance indicators. MSMEs are
much more likely to be rejected for loans, and less likely to have a loan, line of credit, or overdraft
facility. These firms are also more likely to avoid loan applications all together due to high collateral
requirements. However, the data reveals that the lack of access to finance is even more severe for
small firms than for microenterprises. Main findings from the demand-side can be summarized
into the following three categories:

       i.	     Job creation and employment growth: Job creation and employment growth is
               concentrated in large established (i.e. older) firms in both service and manufacturing
               sectors. Moreover, job creation and employment in the services and retail sectors are
               higher than in the manufacturing sector.

       ii.	    Access to finance: overall, data indicates the existence of a missing middle phenomenon
               in terms of financial services catering to small firms. Young and smaller firms are much
               more likely to be rejected for a loan or a line of credit than firms who are more established
               or larger. Moreover, despite confirming their need for improved access to finance, SMEs
               are discouraged from applying for loans due to excessively high collateral requirements.
       iii.	   Firms’ performance: Firms that are credit constrained exhibit poorer performance and
               productivity.

The supply-side analysis confirms that small and medium enterprises are being underserved
compared to micro and large firms. Micro finance institutions (MFIs) primarily cater to micro firms,
leaving small and medium firms financially excluded. Large banks are discouraged from serving
this segment primarily because of perceptions of lower returns and higher risk. However, most MFIs
and banks also view the SME segment as the most promising one for growth and having good
prospects. Key findings from the supply-side survey include the following6:

       i.	     SME finance culture: Financial institutions lack an “SME finance culture”: a harmonized
               definition of MSMEs is missing and consequently specific MSME financing strategies
               are not in place.

       ii.	    Perception of SMEs’ market segment: Financial institutions believe that market potential
               is very good for the SME segment. Expected returns and the contribution to the
               economic development of the country are seen as main drivers for lending to SMEs
               and microenterprises.

       iii.	   Risks and obstacles to SME finance: SME-specific factors and macroeconomic factors
               were indicated by all MFIs and banks as significant obstacles to the development of
               SME lending. While banks and MFIs believe there is high growth potential in lending
               for small enterprises, the current lack of involvement is due to perceived risks.

       iv.	    The missing middle phenomenon: SMEs represents a missing middle in the financial
               sector with high heterogeneity of lending patterns between MFIs and commercial banks.

       v.	     Business models: The business models of the surveyed financial institutions are mostly
               inadequate to serve SMEs: they lack a dedicated and specialized SME unit or department
               within their organizational structure; loan appraisal techniques are still mostly based
               on traditional relationship lending rather than on transactional technologies such as
               credit scoring etc.; products are highly standardized and there is very limited product
               innovation; distribution channels are still largely based on branches and long term
               financing needs of SMEs do not seem to be properly addressed.

                                              certainly be beneficial as currently collateral rates in Ethiopia are among
                                              the highest in the region. The proposed registry would document charges

                                              from a thorough analysis. Particularly it would be recommended to
                                              conduct a diagnostic of the creditor rights and enforcement systems (for

                                              and informal enterprise workout practices; formal insolvency system
                                              (liquidation and reorganization proceedings); and effectiveness of the

                                              in this area. A similar diagnostic would allow to identify bottlenecks,
                                              facilitate access to credit for SMEs and provide a stable backdrop for

                                         it is being used merely as a database management system by the
                                         National Bank of Ethiopia that collects information on creditworthiness of
                                         borrowers from supervised financial institutions, makes such information
                                         available for financial institutions, and uses it primarily for supervisory

However, an analysis we conducted on a panel of 6000 Ethiopian firms from 2000 to 2011, reveals
that large and more established (i.e. older) firms are more important as net job creators than small
and younger firms.

     Micro-establishments are also referred to as small-scale firms by the CSA.
Therefore, the present study, while keeping job creation as its starting point, has looked into

financing constraints of SMEs as one of the possible main reasons preventing SMEs in Ethiopia
from playing their catalyst role.

SME financing, in fact, is now at the centre of the international development agenda and is of
considerable interest to policy makers due to their importance for economic development as well
as their potential contribution to economic diversification and job creation. However, SME growth
potential in developing economies, especially in Africa, is limited as they are significantly more
credit constrained compared to larger enterprises8. Kuntchev, Ramalho, Rodriguez-Meza, and Yang
(2012) find that over half of SMEs are credit constrained in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region,
which is higher than in any other region9 (Figure 4).

 the time         The Ethiopia’s Survey of Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing Industries (2000-
          of the report.
2011) and the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey that was conducted in Ethiopia in 2011 are used for
the demand-side analysis. Specifically the former 17dataset provides insights on firm dynamics while
the latter helps to capture the experiences of firms in the services and retail sectors and to have a
more detailed view of firm financing experiences. Moreover, in order to capture the perspectives and
drivers of financing institutions, an ad-hoc supply-side survey was issued to 16 financial institutions
including the major public and private sector commercial banks and microfinance institutions
covering over 90% of the total assets in the banking and microfinance sector. The survey allowed
collecting data on the actual involvement of financial institutions with MSMEs, their perception
of potential public policy approaches to enhance SME access to finance and the adequateness of
their current business models.

Studies on SME financing with demand and supply-side components have also been carried
out in other Sub-Saharan Africa’s countries (including Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and
Tanzania) in the North Africa and Middle East region and in the Latin America and Caribbean
region (De la Torre et al. 2008; Beck et al. 2008; Fuchs et al, 2011; Rocha et al. 2010)10. While using a
similar instrument to analyse the supply-side, this study differs from the previous ones conducted
in Sub-Saharan Africa for a more comprehensive and detailed analysis on the demand-side which
provides useful complementary recommendations to the more traditional ones based only on
supply-side constraints.

The combination of information on firm experiences with the reporting of financial institutions on
their business practices, allowed us to gain a full picture of SME finance practices and perspectives
in Ethiopia.




     10	 The financial crisis in 2008 also motivated the study to be conducted in several countries in the Latin America
         and Caribbean region evaluating the impact of SME finance programs (Acevedo/Tan, 2010).

The results from both demand-side and supply-side analysis clearly indicate the existence of a
missing-middle phenomenon in Ethiopia. This is a common feature to many developing countries
that have a large number of microenterprises and some large firms, but far fewer small and medium
enterprises. In high-income countries, SMEs are responsible for over 50% of GDP and over 60% of
employment, but in low-income countries they are less than half of that: 30% of employment and
17% of GDP.11 This SME gap is called the ‘missing middle’. Evidence from international research clearly
shows that returns to capital are high in this segment.12 SMEs aren’t missing because they would
not be profitable: they are missing because finance is not reaching them in an effective way. This
shows that access to finance is a significant barrier, and that there is a massive profit opportunity
for those who are able to successfully finance these firms.

The SME finance studies conducted in other African countries are useful for benchmarking Ethiopia’s
position with regards to access to finance. The share of SME lending in the overall portfolio of banks
in the 5 countries where a similar study on the supply-side was conducted varies between 5 and 20
percent. Banks in Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania are more involved in SME lending in terms of the
share of their portfolio than banks in South Africa and Nigeria. SME lending in Ethiopia is on the
lower side, with SME lending comprising only 7 percent of bank portfolios. The studies found that
major contributing factors for SME lending are the structure and size of the economy, the extent of
government borrowing, the state of financial sector infrastructure and the enabling environment
including government support programs.
In the case of Ethiopia, main findings from the demand-side can be summarized into the following
three categories:

      i.	    Job creation and employment growth: Job creation and employment growth is concentrated
             in large established (i.e. older) firms in both service and manufacturing sectors. Moreover,
             job creation and employment in the services and retail sectors are higher than in the
             manufacturing sector.

             a.	 Jobs analysis in the manufacturing sector shows that the majority of paid employment
                 is found in large enterprises. Interestingly, in the services sector the job dynamics
                 are similar to the ones in the manufacturing sector as large established firms tend
                 to be the most important net jobs creators during the period 2009-2011.

             b.	 Typically, young firms are a great source of job creation, but this trend is not seen in
                 Ethiopia. Conditional on survival, young Ethiopian firms enjoy higher employment
                 growth rates than established firms, but they also generate a smaller number of new
                 jobs than older firms. In the rest of the world, young firms are principal job creators
                 despite high exit rates (Haltinwanger et al 2011; Rijkers et al, 2013). The fact that older
                 firms dominate net job creation in Ethiopia is worrisome since it suggests there is a
                 lack of competitiveness and innovation in the private sector.

             c.	 The manufacturing sector plays a limited role in the overall Ethiopian economy,
                 comprising only 4.2 percent of GDP in 2012/13. Therefore, it’s important to also
                 understand employment trends in the services sector. The service sector created
                 nine times more jobs than the manufacturing sector during the period 2009-2011.

      ii.	   Access to finance: overall, data indicates the existence of a missing middle phenomenon
             in terms of financial services catering to small firms. Young and smaller firms are much
             more likely to be rejected for a loan or a line of credit than firms who are more established
             or larger. Moreover, despite confirming their need for improved access to finance, SMEs
             are discouraged from applying for loans due to excessively high collateral requirements.

             a.	 Only 1.9 percent of small firms have a loan or line of credit. This rate is lower than
                 among micro, medium, and large firms (6.0, 20.5, and 35.5 percent respectively).
                 Fifty-seven percent of small firms are fully credit constrained, a rate higher than in
                 any other size group. These statistics corroborate with assertions that small firms

SME FINANCE IN ETHIOPIA: ADDRESSING THE MISSING MIDDLE CHALLENGE                                           11
                struggle the most in obtaining access to finance since MFIs cater to micro-sized
                firms, and commercial bank clientele are predominantly medium and large firms.

             b.	 Among firms who applied for a loan or line of credit in fiscal year 2011, 57.3 and
                 87.9 percent of applications submitted by micro and small firms respectively were
                 rejected; this is in sharp contrast to the much lower 6.2 and 10.4 percent rejection
                 rate experienced by medium and large firms. Fifty-six percent of young firms had
                 their loan applications rejected compared to 33 percent of established firms.

             c.	 Results show that SMEs are less likely to say that they don’t need a loan, thus
                 confirming the need for finance. However, SMEs are discouraged (or voluntarily
                 exclude themselves) from applying for loans or lines of credit. About a third of small
                 and medium firms reported that they did not apply for a loan or line of credit because
                 collateral requirements were too high. Collateral rates in Ethiopia are much higher
                 than in more developed African economies. For example, collateral rates are only
                 120.8 percent of the loan value in Kenya (2007) compared to 234 percent in Ethiopia.
                 Small firms are also the most likely to use personal assets as a type of collateral (36.8
                 percent of small firms use this type).

     iii.	   Firms’ performance: Firms that are credit constrained exhibit poorer performance and
             productivity.

             a.	 In Ethiopia, a credit constrained firm has sales growth 15 percentage points lower,
                 employment growth 5 percentage points lower, and labor productivity growth 11
                 percentage points lower than firms who are not credit constrained.

             b.	 Investment decisions of manufacturing firms in Ethiopia are heavily dependent on
                 cash flows. To identify the existence of credit constraints we evaluate the extent to
                 which firms’ investments are reliant on cash flow. We find some evidence that liquidity
                 constraints are stronger for young small firms when compared to established small
                 firms. On the other hand, there is limited evidence that young medium and large
                 firms are more credit constrained than other medium and large firms.

On the other hand, key findings from the supply-side survey include the following:

     i.	     SME finance culture: Financial institutions lack an “SME finance culture”: a harmonized
             definition of MSMEs is missing and consequently specific MSME financing strategies are
             not in place.

             a.	 Financial institutions in Ethiopia lack a commonly agreed definition of MSMEs.
                 While the majority of MFIs uniformly use the MSE definition that is laid out in the
                 Government’s National MSE Development Strategy, commercial banks do not seem
                 to uniformly distinguish among small, medium, and large enterprises.

             b.	 The lack of a harmonized definition leads to a lack of market segmentation and
                 ultimately a lack of in depth customer knowledge and proper business strategy to
                 address this untapped market segment.

     ii.	    Perception of SMEs’ market segment: Financial institutions believe that market
             potential is very good for the SME segment. Expected returns and the contribution to
             the economic development of the country are seen as main drivers for lending to SMEs
             and microenterprises.

             a.	 The co-existence of these two motors, on the one hand the economic dimension
                 of business profitability, and on the other hand the more political dimension of
                 contribution to the country’s economic development, represents an interesting
                 feature of the Ethiopian market. Namely, publicly owned financial institutions
                 dominate both the banking and the microfinance sector.




12
              b.	 Although MFI and bank involvement in SME lending is limited, these same financial
                  institutions believe that the potential for this segment of the market is very good. The
                  majority of surveyed financial institutions believe that prospects for the SME market
                  are good and that the SME market size is large. The small enterprise segment is also
                  identified as the most promising segment for growth, by both MFIs and banks.

      iii.	   Risks and obstacles to SME finance: SME-specific factors and macroeconomic factors were
              indicated by all MFIs and banks as significant obstacles to the development of SME lending.
              While banks and MFIs believe there is high growth potential in lending for small enterprises,
              the current lack of involvement is due to perceived risks.

              a.	 Regarding the SME specific factors, most of the financial institutions highlighted the
                  poor quality of financial statements, inability to manage risk, lack of knowledge of
                  business management, lack of awareness on how to be bankable, lack of adequate
                  collateral and informality of SMEs as the major challenges. Regarding macroeconomic
                  aspects, inflation, tax regulation and high vulnerability of the agriculture sector were
                  mentioned as hindrances by financial institutions.

              b.	 Most financial institutions in this study perceive costs and risks to be higher in the
                  SME segment compared to the large enterprise segment. Banks seem to have a more
                  negative perception of risks and costs than MFIs. Further, when asked to compare the
                  profitability of SME loans versus large enterprise loans, SME profitability is perceived
                  to be considerably lower.

      iv.	    The missing middle phenomenon: SMEs represents a missing middle in the financial sector
              with high heterogeneity of lending patterns between MFIs and commercial banks

              a.	 Ethiopia lags behind other Sub-Saharan Africa’s countries and developing countries
                  in terms of lending to SMEs. The share of SME lending in overall lending portfolio in
                  Ethiopia is in fact only 7 percent, among the smallest shares in Sub-Saharan African
                  countries as well as far below that of developing economies.

              b.	 SMEs represent a missing middle in the financial sector: Lending to SMEs is limited
                  as MFI deposit and loan portfolios are comprised mainly by microenterprises (over
                  90 percent). The same is true for commercial bank portfolios, which are primarily
                  comprised of large enterprises. Deposits and outstanding loans to SMEs typically
                  comprise less than 10 percent of the total portfolios of MFIs or banks. This leaves a
                  considerable missing-middle of SMEs not served by either banks or MFIs and who
                  need access to finance

              c.	 High heterogeneity of lending patters: MFIs issue the most number of loans to SMEs,
                  but banks issue the most value. Seventy-four percent of the value of SME loans
                  outstanding from the sample of financial institutions are by banks, only a quarter
                  of SME loan values originate from MFIs. In terms of the number of loans, ACSI has
                  8,670 loans outstanding to SMEs compared to only 88 by the CBE (Dec. 2012). Banks
                  provide large loans with longer maturities compared to much smaller size lending
                  with short maturity provided by MFIs. Interest rates for SME customers vary between
                  10 percent for low risk MFI customers and 15.5 percent for high risk bank customers.
                  SMEs face higher collateral requirements and interest rates because banks perceive
                  them as more uncertain and harder to evaluate.

      v.	     Business models. The business models of the surveyed financial institutions are mostly
              inadequate to serve SMEs: they lack a dedicated and specialized SME unit or department
              within their organizational structure; loan appraisal techniques are still mostly based on
              traditional relationship lending rather than on transactional technologies such as credit
              scoring etc.; products are highly standardized and there is very limited product innovation;
              distribution channels are still largely based on branches and long term financing needs of
              SMEs do not seem to be properly addressed




SME FINANCE IN ETHIOPIA: ADDRESSING THE MISSING MIDDLE CHALLENGE                                        13
             a.	 The organizational model used by the majority of the interviewed financial institutions
                 does not consider the need to set up a specialized SME unit or department to better
                 serve the SME clientele. 9 out of the 12 financial institutions did not possess a separate
                 SME department or unit at the time of the study.

             b.	 When it comes to appraisal and monitoring of SME loans, these are largely done
                 through the establishment of a close relationship with clients for both banks and
                 MFIs. A minority of banks stated using transactional technologies such as credit
                 scoring, risk rating tools, factoring or leasing. None of the MFIs use these techniques.

             c.	 The product mix offered by financial institutions does not seem to be sufficiently
                 large. Other lending products such as leasing and factoring are not offered by any
                 of the financial institutions in this study. Furthermore, products provided to the SME
                 and micro enterprise market are largely standardized and efforts to continuously
                 adapt them to client’s needs are limited. The great majority of financial institutions in
                 the study reported no change in their financial product offering between the years
                 2010 and 2012.

             d.	 Geographic location does not appear to be an important marketing criterion for
                 financial institutions. This is particularly the case for MFIs as the five dominant ones,
                 with more than 90 percent of total asset portfolio of the micro financing sector, are
                 affiliated with the regional governments in Ethiopia. Regarding their geographic
                 outreach most of the banks and MFIs use only their own branches as distribution
                 channels.

             e.	 Long term financing needs of SMEs do not seem to be properly addressed. The average
                 loan maturity for SME loans reported by MFIs was 2.38 years while for the banks it
                 was 6 years. According to the questionnaire responses, the average maturity loan
                 for large enterprises was 10.4 years. This indicates that long term financing needs
                 of SME’s are not met and that there is a potential market gap here.

     vi.	    The importance of Government financed programs: Government financed programs
             (credit guarantee programs and line of credit with technical assistance) are important drivers.

             a.	 When asked about the impact of government financed programs on the decision to
                 engage in SME finance the picture that emerges clearly indicates that both categories
                 (i.e. banks and MFIs) have a positive perception of partial credit guarantee schemes
                 and the provision of dedicated credit lines associated with technical assistance.

             b.	 Directed credit programs are also perceived as having a positive impact, confirming,
                 once again, the dominant role that public institutions play in the banking and
                 microfinance sector.

     vii.	   A supportive financial sector infrastructure. The potentialities of the credit bureau are
             not effectively exploited.

             a.	 The survey indicated that most banks use the credit bureau information for SMEs
                 loan analysis and most of them consider it to be an effective tool. However only the
                 negative information provided is used and the credit bureau information has limited
                 input and an insignificant contribution to loan decisions.

             b.	 The credit bureau’s coverage and the quality of the financial information on SMEs
                 reported by banks should be further improved through a better enforcement of
                 financial institutions reporting requirements.
             c.	 The fact that MFIs are still not connected to the credit bureau (despite the technological
                 platform currently in place is capable also to accommodate MFIs) suggests the need
                 to carefully look into the obstacles preventing MFIs to contribute to and benefit from
                 the credit bureau service.




14
      viii.	 Regulatory and judicial issues. The contractual environment and lack of collateral registry
             inhibit secured lending and constrain access to finance for SMEs. Changes in the market
             due to imposed lending restrictions are seen as a hindrance causing liquidity constraints.

             a.	 Lack of contract enforcement and judiciary inefficiency were indicated as main
                 obstacles concerning the contractual environment. There is no legally authorized body
                 to register machinery and/or equipment for it to be held as collateral. The absence
                 of a collateral registry in combination with ineffective enforcement of contracts in
                 case of default could contribute to significant losses for banks and thereby have
                 significant impact on access to finance for SMEs.

             b.	 The regulatory framework affecting the liquidity position of banks is seen as another
                 significant obstacle to involvement with SMEs. The majority of surveyed financial
                 institutions reported that there have been significant changes in the market for
                 lending to SMEs which affected banks in terms of liquidity and overall competition
                 in the banking sector13.

             c.	 MFIs are more likely than banks to perceive competition in SME lending as an
                 obstacle. Banks are more likely to perceive bank-specific factors and characteristics
                 of SME lending as obstacles. Bank specific factors include amongst others the lack of
                 interest at the bank level, limited geographic outreach, lack of appropriate products
                 and knowledge on how to evaluate MSMEs or high collateral requirements.

The remainder of the report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 provides a short overview of the
government’s economic development goals and a summary of the Ethiopian legal and regulatory
framework as well as the status of the country’s overall financial sector. Results from demand
and supply-side surveys are presented and discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 5 examines
international best practices in SME finance and current government programs in support of MSMEs.
Policy recommendations are presented in Chapter 6.

SME FINANCE IN ETHIOPIA: ADDRESSING THE MISSING MIDDLE CHALLENGE                                                    15
2. 	MSMEs IN ETHIOPIA: THE MACRO
    ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND INSTITUTIONAL
    FRAMEWORK


2.1	 Strategic and macroeconomic context for MSME GROWTH
Ethiopia is currently implementing a five-year (2010/11-2014/15) Growth and Transformation Plan
(GTP) in line with its long-term vision of achieving rapid, sustainable and equitable socioeconomic
growth and development, reducing poverty, and meeting the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) within the framework of macroeconomic stability.

In order to promote the MSME sector the Government intends to facilitate the development of
industrial clusters, for interconnected firms in a particular field with links to related institutions such
as financial service providers, technical and vocational educational institutions, and various levels of
government institutions. These initiatives aim to enable firms to overcome constraints in the areas
of capital, skills, technology, logistics as well as to grow and compete by fostering production value
chains and achieving efficiency gains. According to the Micro and Small Enterprises Development
Strategy of the GTP, MSMEs are given strategic focus by the Government due to the fact that they
play an essential role in the country’s industrial development plan and in the creation of employment
opportunities in urban centers with the ambitious objective of 3.4 million jobs expected to be added
to this segment over the five-year GTP period and training provided to over 3 million operators.

Over the past decade, Ethiopia has achieved high economic growth, averaging 10.7 percent per year
(World Bank, 2013) establishing the country among the fastest growing economies both in Africa
and the developing world. This growth momentum has continued through the first two years of
the GTP period and inflation has declined to single digits (from its peak of 40 percent in July 2011
to around 7 percent in June 2013), significantly reducing the distortionary effects that a negative
real interest rate environment was having on financial intermediation. The combination of robust
economic growth and increased expenditure on social assistance have resulted in a several fold rise
in real per capita GDP and a dramatic drop in the national poverty rate (from 60.5 percent in 2005
to 30.7 percent in 2011)14. Economic growth has also helped to reduce unemployment particularly
in urban areas. While overall unemployment rate stands at about 25 percent, urban unemployment
rate declined from 22.9 percent in 2004 to 17.5 percent in 2012. In urban areas, both female and
male unemployment declined and the large gap between the two groups has narrowed for the two
years of available and comparable data (2009 and 2010). Unemployment rates remains particularly
high among young females, with almost one third of them unable to find a job in the urban areas.

For the country to continue its historically impressive growth performance (and reach the middle
income status by 2025 as indicated in the GTP), the conditions for an increased scope of the private
sector should be created. In fact, despite the impressive results achieved through the public
sector-led growth strategy centered on high public investments promoted by the Government,
the challenge of strengthening the competitiveness of the economy requires the support of the
private sector as an additional engine of growth.

The economic growth is driven by services and agriculture on the supply side. The share of
industry in GDP has remained modest increasing to 11 percent in 2011/12 from 10.5 percent last
year and, according to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED), its growth
rate averaged 14.3 percent during the last two years (2010/11-2011/12). The modest share and
growth of the industry sector and the significant share of the agriculture (44 percent) and services
(45 percent) sectors clearly indicates the challenge and need for further structural transformation
of the Ethiopian economy for the country to be able to join the club of middle income countries
within the planned period.

2.2	 Legal and Regulatory Framework
The regulatory and legal environment plays an important role for the development and promotion
of MSMEs and their financing needs. Financial institutions in Ethiopia operate under a rather
conducive regulatory framework whereby prudential regulations and directives are in place to ensure
financial system stability and financial sector soundness. The legal and regulatory environment is
conducive for providing finance from banks and MFIs to business activities. Particularly, micro finance
business proclamation number 626 gives flexibility for MFIs to transform into banks or any other
financial institutions that they would be able to provide financial services to small and medium
size enterprises. The regulatory framework has been relaxed on maximum loan size from time to
time. National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) directive number MFI/18/06 provides extension to any single


18
borrower up to 1 percent of the total capital of the MFI which is good enough for MFIs to lend to
SMEs. However, the directive sets regulatory requirements that constrain MFIs to predominately
make credit available on the basis of group guarantees amongst members who have joined a
membership arrangement. The directive also has a provision for lending to individuals on a limited
scale on the basis of collateral. However, the absence of a well-functioning and efficient legal
system to enforce contracts affects the implementation of prudential regulations in the banking
and microfinance sector. In Ethiopia’s court system, commercial benches are handling the court
cases related to businesses. There are no dedicated commercial units in the first instant courts to
relieve the commercial cases and to strengthen contract enforcement.

The framework for banking supervision and regulation was strengthened during a financial sector
reform in the areas of financial reporting, external audits and related frameworks and deposit
insurance. NBE, thanks to the World Bank’s Financial Sector Capacity Building Project, has now
adopted risk based supervision and conducts quarterly credit and liquidity risk stress testing of the
banking system. Commercial banks continue to be subject to the April 2011 NBE directive requiring
them to hold 27 percent of new loan disbursements in low-yield NBE bills. The proceeds of these
bonds are transferred to the state-owned Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) which, according to
the stated policy is supposed to on-lend them to government targeted private sector activities. The
application and the effects of this directive have been controversial. The Ethiopian Bankers’ Association
(EBA) has appealed to NBE to revise this directive15 arguing that it forced banks to unnecessary
portfolio adjustments. In fact, to avoid the effects of this 27 percent bond requirement, private
banks have been moving up market and towards longer term financing. Aiming at counteracting
this tendency and to push for T-bill purchases, NBE has issued a new directive in February 2013
setting the minimum requirement for short term loans at 40 percent of bank’s total loan provision.
This directive applies to all banks (except DBE and CBE) and forces them to provide short term
loans with maturities of less than a year. The directive also cuts commercial banks’ total deposit
reserve requirements down to 5 percent, from the previous 10 percent. The aim of this directive
is to counter the tendency of private banks to move up market. These aspects will be addressed
further in the section on obstacles to SME finance. The directive is effective since beginning of
July 2013. NBE has also given banks until January 2015 to restructure their loan portfolios to the
required ratio16. On the other side, the National Bank of Ethiopia directive number FIS/01/2012 on
regulation of mobile and agent banking services is a very positive step to stimulating the use of
technology and innovative financial service delivery channels such as mobile devices and agents
that will have significant contribution in deepening financial service accessibility to the a wider
section of population at an affordable price.



2.3	 Outlook of The Ethiopian Financial Sector
Ethiopia’s financial sector is dominated by the banking sector (commercial banks) which currently
represents more than 92.6 percent of total assets of the financial sector, excluding the assets of the
Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) and National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). MFIs constitute 5.2 percent
and insurance companies 2.2 percent of the total financial sector assets. There is a considerable
increase in assets of MFIs from 4.4 percent of the total financial sector assets in 2005/06 to 5.2 percent
in 2011/12 demonstrating the increasing role of microfinance institutions in poverty alleviation,
asset building and employment creation particularly in rural communities.

Financial intermediation is a driving force for economic development: an expansion in credit to the
private sector in fact enables firms to invest in productive capacity thereby laying the foundation
for a sustainable growth path. However, Ethiopia is falling behind its peers in this area (Figure 5). In
2011, credit to the private sector in Ethiopia was equivalent to about 14 percent of GDP compared
to the regional average of 23 percent of GDP. Moreover, while the worldwide trend has been an

        There is a considerable increase in assets of MFIs from 4.4 percent of the total financial sector
        assets in 2005/06 to 5.2 percent in 2011/12 demonstrating the increasing role of microfinance
        institutions in poverty alleviation, asset building and employment creation particularly in rural

3.	 DEMAND-SIDE ANALYSIS

      Main research questions addressed:

                1.	 Which firms create more jobs in Ethiopia?
                2.	 Which firms are the most credit constraint?
                3.	 Is there a link between access to finance and firms’ performance?


This section utilizes two data sets to describe the characteristics of Ethiopian MSMEs vis-à-vis other
companies with a special focus on identifying their constraints in accessing external finance. The
focus of this chapter is on three inter-related aspects: job creation, access to finance, and firm
performance. The two main sources of data used for the analysis are:

1.	      The Ethiopia Survey of Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing Industries (LMMIS): an unbalanced
         panel composed of about 6,000 firms with at least 10 employees which allows for a study of
         firm dynamics from 2000 through 2011.

2.	      The World Bank’s Enterprise Survey (ES): conducted between July 2011 and July 2012 and
         including 794 firms which allows for the additional examination of the services sector,
         microenterprises, and a more detailed understanding of firm experiences with respect to
         access to finance.

These two datasets offer complementary information and reveal supporting trends17. The main
findings from the demand-side analysis are summarized below and then discussed in-depth in
the following sub-sections.

         i.	      Job creation and employment growth

                  a.	 In both service and manufacturing sectors, job creation is concentrated in large
                      established (i.e. older) firms. Jobs analysis in the manufacturing sector shows that
                      the majority of paid employment is found in large enterprises. Interestingly, in the
                      services sector the job dynamics are similar to the ones in the manufacturing sector
                      as large established firms tend to be the most important net jobs creators during
                      the period 2009-2011.

                  b.	 Typically, young firms are a great source of job creation, but this trend is not seen in
                      Ethiopia. Conditional on survival, young Ethiopian firms enjoy higher employment
                      growth rates than established firms, but they also generate a smaller number of new
                      jobs than older firms. In the rest of the world, young firms are principal job creators
                      despite high exit rates (Haltinwanger et al 2011; Rijkers et al, 2013). The fact that older
                      firms dominate net job creation in Ethiopia is worrisome since it suggests there is a
                      lack of competitiveness and innovation in the private sector.

                  c.	 Job creation and employment in the services and retail sectors are higher than in the
                      manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector plays a limited role in the overall
                      Ethiopian economy, comprising only 4.2 percent of GDP in 2012/13. Therefore, it’s
                      important to also understand employment trends in the services sector. The service
                      sector created nine times more jobs than the manufacturing sector during the period
                      2009-2011.

         ii.	     Access to finance

                  a.	 Overall, data indicates the existence of a missing middle phenomenon in terms of
                      financial services catering to small firms. Only 1.9 percent of small firms have a loan
                      or line of credit. This rate is much lower than that of micro, medium, and large firms
                      (6.0, 20.5, and 35.5 percent respectively). 57 percent of small firms are fully credit
                      constrained, a rate higher than in any other size group. These statistics corroborate
                      with assertions that small firms struggle the most in obtaining access to finance since

                   MFIs cater to micro-sized firms, and commercial bank clientele are predominantly
                   medium and large firms.

                b.	 Young and smaller firms are much more likely to be rejected for a loan or a line of credit
                    than firms who are more established or larger. Among firms who applied for a loan
                    or line of credit in fiscal year 2011, 57.3 and 87.9 percent of applications submitted
                    by micro and small firms respectively were rejected; this is in sharp contrast to the
                    much lower 6.2 and 10.4 percent rejection rate experienced by medium and large
                    firms. 56 percent of young firms had their loan applications rejected compared to
                    33 percent of established firms.

                c.	 Despite confirming the need of increased access to finance, SMEs are discouraged
                    from applying for loans due to high collateral requirements. Results show that SMEs
                    are less likely to say that they don’t need a loan, thus confirming the need for finance.
                    However, SMEs are discouraged (or voluntarily exclude themselves) from applying
                    for loans or lines of credit. About a third of SMEs reported that they did not apply
                    for a loan or line of credit because collateral requirements were too high. Collateral
                    rates in Ethiopia are much higher than in more developed African economies. For
                    example, collateral rates are only 120.8 percent of the loan value in Kenya (2007)
                    compared to 234 percent in Ethiopia. Small firms are also the most likely to use
                    personal assets as a type of collateral (36.8 percent of small firms use this type).

        iii.	   Firms’ performance

                a.	 Firms that are credit constrained exhibit poorer performance and productivity. In
                    Ethiopia, a firm that is credit constrained has sales growth that is 15 percentage points
                    lower, employment growth that is 5 percentage points lower, and labor productivity
                    growth that is 11 percentage points lower than firms who are not credit constrained.

                b.	 Investment decisions of manufacturing firms in Ethiopia are heavily dependent on
                    cash flows. To identify the existence of credit constraints we evaluate the extent to
                    which firms’ investments are reliant on cash flow. We find some evidence that liquidity
                    constraints are stronger for young small firms when compared to other small firms.
                    On the other hand, there is limited evidence that young medium and large firms are
                    more credit constrained than other medium and large firms.



3.1. The place of small and medium enterprises in the economy
What is the role and place of SMEs in terms of job creation? We first examine employment trends in
the manufacturing sector between 2000 and 2011 using the Ethiopia Survey of Large and Medium
Scale Manufacturing Industries (LMMIS). The data set is an unbalanced panel comprised of 495 –
1,039 firms per year18.

Our results, shown in Figure 8, suggest that medium and large firms are creating most of the new jobs
during this period19. The top panel illustrates the total number of employees in the manufacturing
sector, and the lower panel illustrates the number of net new employees disaggregated by firm
size based on Ethiopia’s Central Statistical Agecny definitions (micro (<10); small (10-19), medium
(20-99), large (100+)), as well as firm age (young (0-5 years); established (6+ years)).



     18	 An important note about this data set is that this survey is designed to exclude small-scale industries
         (microenterprises) with fewer than 10 employees however some firms in the LMMIS data set reported fewer than
         10 workers. Employment levels calculated using this survey will be negatively biased for microenterprises. The
         micro segment of the manufacturing sector is extremely large and important. In fiscal year 2007/08, the Central
         Statistical Agency reported there were 43,338 microenterprises in Ethiopia comprising of 138,951 engaged
         persons. In the LMMIS, we have only 35 microenterprises in fiscal year 2007.
     19	 These statistics do not capture changes in part-time employment or shifts in hiring from full-time to part-time
         employees. By construction these statistics only consider firms who were in operation in 2009, therefore new jobs
         created by firms who began operations after 2009 is not captured.



24
It is also important to distinguish among different types of employees. The results show that paid
employees are primarily employed in large establishments, while the composition of workers in
smaller scale enterprises tend to be characterized by a higher prevalence of temporary and unpaid
workers, relative to large establishments. Therefore, when taking into account all workers (“engaged
persons”) including paid employees, unpaid working proprietors, active partners, unpaid family
workers and paid and unpaid apprentices, the weight of MSMEs increases. For example, in 2011
half all engaged persons were affiliated with MSMEs.

Large manufacturing companies that have been established for more than 5 years have been the
largest employers of permanent paid workers in the economy during the last decade. In 2011, they
accounted for 74 percent of total paid employment. Another important result is relative to the effect
of exogenous shocks on job creation, revealing the sensitivity of the Ethiopian manufacturing sector
to external shocks. Specifically, in the aftermath of the financial crisis the most affected firms were
large and established ones. In 2008, these firms experienced a net loss of 4,043 jobs. However, this
was just a temporary shock as, in the next year, jobs began to recover slowly. In 2009, the large
enterprise saw an addition of 381 jobs and 5,480 jobs in 2010.

Another way to examine employment trends is to look at the proportion of firms in a size group
in year t who transition to another size group in year t+1 (Table 3). In the table below, we examine
firm size transitions only in recent years after the financial crisis (t=2008, 2009, and 2010). Large
firms are the most stable, the majority of large firms stay large, and virtually none reduce in size
to less than 20 employees. Micro firms are the most dynamic, over half of micro firms expand to
become small, medium, or large firms in the next year. Small firms are much less dynamic, as only
11.1 percent of small firms grow to become medium firms in the next year. Growth for medium
firms is also challenging after the financial crisis; medium firms are more likely to become smaller
(11.6 percent) than to become larger (4.5 percent).

However, it is important to widen our analysis to the entire economy, since the large and medium
scale manufacturing sector contributed to only 2.9 percent of GDP in 2012/13, while services
accounted for 45.2 percent of GDP. An understanding of employment dynamics in the services
sector is important.
                                                                                                                  37
To compare employment trends between manufacturing and services, we turn to the World Bank’s
Enterprise Surveys (ES). The Enterprise Surveys interviewed 794 Ethiopian firms in 2011 that were
formally registered, had private ownership, and operated in the manufacturing and service/retail
sectors. The Enterprise Survey is representative of the entire population of Ethiopian firms at the
level of sector, size, and sub-national region. Another important feature of the Enterprise Surveys
is the inclusion of microenterprises since these firms are not targeted in Ethiopia’s Survey of Large
and Medium Scale Manufacturing Industries; 154 microenterprises were surveyed in the Addis
Ababa region only. However, while it is now possible to compare the manufacturing section with



26
services, and also analyze microenterprises, we lose the ability to follow trends before and after
the financial crisis.

Analyzing the ES we find that, conditional on survival, the majority of Ethiopian firms were job
creators. Less than 8 percent of firms reported employing fewer full-time permanent workers in
fiscal year 2011 than in 2009 (Figure 9)20. However, a significantly larger number of jobs were created
in the services and retail sector compared to the manufacturing sector. Less than 10 percent of all
new jobs were created in the manufacturing sector.

During the period 2009-2011, medium and large firms created most of the new jobs.21 Established
firms (i.e. firms that have been in operations for six years or more) added 15,615 full-time permanent
jobs, equivalent to 38 percent of all new jobs. Large firms who are young created the smallest number
net jobs. Small established firms that remain small after many years in operations are likely to be
poor performers, and accordingly created fewer jobs than young small firms. Large established firms
create the most number of jobs; however, younger firms have the highest growth rates (Figure 10).

In Ethiopia, young firms do not contribute to job creation as significantly as in the rest of the world.
In the U.S. younger firms grow faster than more established firms, and also yield higher net job
creation (Haltiwanger et al 2011). Rijkers et al (2013) also finds that young firms in Tunisia create
the most new jobs despite high exit rates. This shows that Ethiopian firms are not competitive and
it is difficult for new start-ups to survive.

3.2	 Is access to finance an obstacle to business?

                          3.2.1	 Firms’ perceptions of access to finance in Ethiopia

Young and small firms appear to be facing more serious financial constraints relative to those that
are larger and more established (Figure 11). Across a range of finance indicators created using
the Ethiopia Enterprise Surveys (2011), young and small firms are the most likely to report that
access to finance is a major constraint to their business operations, and at rates higher than other
well-developed African countries. In South Africa (2010), only 10.4 percent of SMEs22 rated access
to finance as a major constraint, compared to the much higher rates in Ethiopia. Nearly half of
microenterprises, 40 percent of small firms, and 18.5 percent of medium firms reported access to
finance in Ethiopia to be a major constraint to daily operations.

Consistent with this “perception based indicator”, objective data show smaller firms are more likely
to be excluded from financing and utilize fewer financial instruments. In fact, as shown in the lower
panel of Figure 11, multiple objective indicators suggest that micro and small firms, as well as those
that are young are excluded from the financial market.

While the majority of micro and small enterprises do have checking and savings accounts, access
to finance is extremely low for this segment. Only 6 percent of micro enterprises, 1.9 percent of
small enterprises, and 20.5 percent of medium have a loan or a line of credit. Small firms also have
the highest incidence of loan application rejection. Among firms who applied for a loan or line of
credit in the last fiscal year, 57.3 and 87.9 percent of applications submitted by micro and small
firms respectively were rejected. This is in sharp contrast to the much lower 6.2 and 10.4 rejection
rate experienced respectively by medium and large firms. In addition, less than 1 percent of micro
firms have external financing at all, whether to finance working capital or investments. Similarly,
only 4.5 percent of micro firms have an overdraft facility, compared to 57.1 percent of large firms.



     22	 The South Africa (2007) Enterprise Survey did not survey micro firms so we only have SME and not MSME
         comparisons.

These low lending and financing rates to small firms can be attributed to (among other factors)
the extremely high value of collateral needed for a loan.

It is clear why collateral requirements can be binding for smaller firms since the most common type
of collateral used are land and buildings and personal assets (Table 5). Like elsewhere in developing
economies, Ethiopian banks prefer immovable collateral such as land rather than movable assets
such as machinery. Large firms are the only ones who commonly can use equipment as collateral.
The use of accounts as collateral is also rare, even for large firms, less than a quarter of large firms
use this as a form of collateral.

The average value of collateral needed for loans in Ethiopia is also very high compared to other
regions of the world as well as to other developed economies in Africa. On average, Ethiopian firms
require 234 percent of the loan amount for collateral, compared to 134.3 percent in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia. In well-developed African countries, collateral requirements are also much lower
than in Ethiopia: 120.8 percent in Kenya (2007), and 103.6 percent in South Africa (2007).

These indicators illustrate a clear picture that in Ethiopia, young and small firms are less likely to
utilize lending services and also face barriers when they attempt to acquire financing.

         3.2.2	 More than elsewhere firms are considerably credit constrained

Figure 1 illustrates the percentage of firms that are credit constrained using a measure that
distinguishes between four degrees of “credit constrained”24 which is constructed using the Ethiopia
Enterprise Surveys (2011). The main result is that, while the proportion of firms in Ethiopia who are
not credit constrained (NCC) is comparable to the Sub-Saharan Africa regional average, the share

of firms completely without access is much higher. In other words, firms in Ethiopia are much more
likely to be fully credit constrained (FCC) than firms elsewhere in the world (Figure 12). Fully credit
constrained firms are those that have no external financing and were either rejected for a loan or
did not apply because of its terms and conditions.

The U-shaped relationship between firm size and the proportion of firms who are fully credit
constrained supports the concept of the missing middle phenomenon in credit provision for
enterprises. In Ethiopia, small-sized firms (10-20 employees) are the most credit constrained of
all firm segments (57 percent), more than micro, medium, or large firms (41, 49, and 24 percent
respectively).25 These results, along with the ones presented earlier on loan rates by firm size
(Figure 11) support the notion that small firms struggle the most in obtaining access to finance.
As the supply-side survey confirmed (Chapter 4), microfinance institutions in Ethiopia cater to
microenterprises, while banks primarily have deposits by and loans to medium and large firms.
In contrast, among both MFIs and banks, the shares of deposits and loans associated with small
establishments are extremely small.

3.3	 Liquidity Constraints
After having analyzed differences in terms of credit constrained using the Enterprise Survey data,
this section expands the previous analysis and conducts further tests regarding firm characteristics
associated with being financially constrained. This analysis relies on the Survey of Large and Medium
Scale Manufacturing Industries conducted during the period 2000-2011. Following the recent
literature assessing firms’ financial constraints, we evaluate the extent to which firms investments
are correlated to their cash flow.

To determine whether or not firms are liquidity or financially constrained, we examine if changes
in investment27 and cash-flows28 are significantly correlated over time29. The basic intuition of
this approach is that if a firm was unconstrained in its access to external financing, its investment
patterns should not be correlated to its cash-flows. On the opposite, the existence of credit constraints
would lead to a situation where the firm is only able to invest in the presence of positive cash-flows.
Using this approach developed originally by the influential work of Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen
(1988) we are able to identify which types of firms are more likely to be more credit constrained.

     27	 Investment is calculated as the investment in fixed assets plus the depreciation
     28	 Cash flow = profit after taxation, extraordinary profit, and depreciation
     29	 For a complete discussion on the methodology, please refer to Appendix 5.



32
The literature pioneered by Fazzari et al (1988) argues that a positive investment-cash flow
relationship can be interpreted as evidence of financial constraints. In a related work Fazzari et al
(2000) clearly argues how constrained firms with large cost of external financing tend to have larger
investments-cash flow sensitivity than relatively unconstrained firms that have very small cost of
external funds. Building on this approach, a previous study by Carpenter and Petersen (2002) showed
how the growth of small firms is constrained by external access to finance. Similarly, another study
by Guariglia et al (2008) shows how in China while the investments of state-owned enterprises are
not affected by cash flow; the opposite is true for privately-owned firms.

In our analysis, we find that investment decisions of manufacturing firms in Ethiopia are heavily
dependent on their cash flows (Appendix 5, Table 19). This confirms that firms are constrained in their
access to external financing sources when making investments in fixed assets such as machinery
or the purchase of land. In addition, we find some limited evidence that these credit constraints
are stronger for young firms. However when looking at small firms only, we found that age matters
with young small firms being more liquidity constrained than other small firms (Table 22).

4. SUPPLY-SIDE ANALYSIS

   Main research questions addressed:

   1.	          How do banks and MFIs define MSMEs?
   2.	          What is the actual extent of banks and MFIs’ involvement with MSME?
   3.	          What are the main drivers and obstacles to MSME finance?
   4.	          Are banks and MFIs’ business models adequate to support MSMEs?


This section presents the results of an ad hoc survey on the supply side of MSME financing in
Ethiopia addressed to commercial banks as well as microfinance institutions. The questionnaire
was designed to address the following areas: (i) the extent of banks and MFIs’ involvement with
MSMEs; (ii) the characteristics of the credit market for MSMEs (iii) the main drivers and obstacles
to MSME finance; (iv) the adequateness of financial institutions’ business models for supporting
MSMEs (including marketing strategies, specialized products and services as well as models of
credit risk management).

The methodology used for the supply-side study is comparable to the one used in recent studies
undertaken by the World Bank to analyse SME finance in other African countries (including South
Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Benin).
The survey was originally addressed to 16 financial institutions covering over 90% of the total assets
in the banking and microfinance sectors. 13 financial institutions responded to the survey - 7 banks
representing 87.1 percent of the banking sector asset portfolio and 6 microfinance institutions
representing 70 percent of the micro finance sector asset portfolio30. Due to a varying response
rates to questions the questionnaires were supplemented by structured face-to-face interviews
conducted with 6 banks and 5 microfinance institutions. The results presented in this section are
based on the written responses to the questionnaire as well as views expressed during interviews
and discussions.

Main findings from the supply-side analysis are summarized below and then discussed in-depth
in the following sub-sections.

         i.	    Defining MSMEs

                a.	 Financial institutions in Ethiopia lack a commonly agreed definition of MSMEs.
                    While the majority of MFIs uniformly uses the MSE definition that is laid out in the
                    Government’s National MSE Development Strategy, commercial banks do not seem
                    to uniformly distinguish among small, medium and large enterprises.

         ii.	   Financial institutions’ involvement with MSMEs

                a.	 Ethiopia is lagging behind other Sub-Saharan Africa’s countries and developing
                    countries in terms of lending to SMEs. The share of SME lending in overall lending
                    portfolio in Ethiopia is in fact only 7 percent, among the smallest shares in Sub-
                    Saharan African countries as well as far below that of developing economies.

                b. 	Although MFI and bank involvement in SME lending is limited, financial institutions
                    believe that the potential for this segment of the market is very good. The majority of
                    surveyed financial institutions believe that prospects for the SME market are good
                    and that the SME market size is large. The small enterprise segment is also identified
                    as the most promising segment for growth, by both MFIs and banks.

                c. 	 SMEs represent a missing middle in the financial sector: Lending to SMEs is limited

   30	 Originally 16 financial institutions were approached; nine banks holding 93.5 percent of the total assets of the
      banking sector, and seven microfinance institutions with 93 percent of total assets of micro finance sector. From this
      original sample, The 13 financial institutions who provided data are Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), Wegagen
      Bank, Dashen Bank, NIB Bank, Awash International Bank, Construction and Business Bank (CBB), Development
      Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), Amhara Credit and Saving Institution (ACSI), Oromia Credit and Saving Share Company
      (OCSSCO), Addis Credit and Saving Institution (AdSCI), Omo Micro Finance Institution, Wasasa and Wisdom MFI.



SME FINANCE IN ETHIOPIA: ADDRESSING THE MISSING MIDDLE CHALLENGE                                                          35
                as MFI deposit and loan portfolios are comprised mainly by microenterprises (over
                90 percent). The same is true for commercial bank portfolios and large enterprises.
                Deposits and outstanding loans to SMEs typically comprise less than 10 percent of
                the total portfolios of MFIs or banks. This leaves a considerable missing-middle of
                SMEs not served by either banks or MFIs and who need access to finance

             d. 	High heterogeneity of lending patters: MFIs issues the most number of loans to SMEs,
                 but banks issue the most value. Seventy-four percent of SME loans outstanding values
                 from the sample of financial institutions are by banks, only a quarter of SME loan
                 values originate from MFIs. In terms of the number of loans, ACSI has 8,670 loans
                 outstanding to SMEs compared to only 88 by the CBE (Dec. 2012). Banks provide
                 large loans with longer maturity compared to much smaller sized firms lending with
                 short maturity provided by MFIs. Interest rates for SME customers vary between 10
                 percent for low risk MFI customers and 15.5 percent for high risk bank customers.
                 MSMEs face higher collateral requirements and interest rates because banks perceive
                 them as more uncertain and harder to evaluate. As to the quality of loan portfolios,
                 there is only a slight difference between banks and MFIs, with the latter having a
                 non-performing loan rate of 2.3 percent and banks of 1.9 percent.

     iii.	   Main drivers to MSME finance
             a.	 All banks and MFIs indicated that expected returns and the contribution to the
                 economic development of the country as the main drivers for lending to SMEs and
                 microenterprises. The co-existence of the economic dimension of profitability of
                 the business with the more political dimension of contributing to the country’s
                 economic development represents an interesting feature of the Ethiopian market,
                 where publicly owned financial institutions dominate both the banking and the
                 microfinance sector.

             b.	 While banks and MFIs believe there is high growth potential in lending for small
                 enterprises, the current lack of involvement is due to perceived risks. Most financial
                 institutions in this study perceive costs and risks to be higher in the SME segment
                 compared to the large enterprise segment. Banks seem to have a more negative
                 perception of risks and costs than MFIs. Further, when asked to compare profitability
                 of SME loans versus large enterprise loans, this is considered considerably lower in
                 the SME segment.

             c.	 Government financed programs (credit guarantee programs and line of credit
                 with technical assistance) are important drivers. When asked about the impact
                 of government financed programs on the decision to engage in SME finance the
                 picture that emerges clearly indicates that both categories (i.e. banks and MFIs) see
                 favourably partial credit guarantee schemes and the provision of dedicated credit
                 lines associated with technical assistance. Directed credit programs are also perceived
                 as having a positive impact, confirming, once again, the dominant role that public
                 institutions play in the banking and microfinance sector.

             d.	 The potentialities of the credit bureau are not effectively exploited. As shown in
                 Figure most banks use credit bureau information for MSMEs loan analysis. 3 out
                 of 5 banks consider the credit bureau to be effective. However only the negative
                 information provided is used and the credit bureau information has limited input
                 and an insignificant contribution to loan decisions.

     iv.	    Main obstacles to MSME financing
             a.	 SME-specific factors and macroeconomic factors were selected by all MFIs and banks
                 to be significant or very significant obstacles to the development of SME lending.
                 Regarding the SME specific factors, most of the financial institutions highlighted the
                 poor quality of financial statements, inability to manage risk, lack of knowledge of
                 business management, lack of awareness on how to be bankable, lack of adequate
                 collateral and informality of SMEs as the major challenges. Regarding macroeconomic


36
                aspects, inflation, exchange rate, tax regulation and high vulnerability of the agriculture
                sector were mentioned by financial institutions.

             b.	 The contractual environment and lack of collateral registry inhibit secured lending
                 and constraints access to finance for SMEs. Lack of contract enforcement and judiciary
                 inefficiency were indicated as main obstacles concerning the contractual environment.
                 There is no legally authorized body to register machinery and/or equipment for it
                 to be held as collateral. The absence of a collateral registry in combination with
                 ineffective enforcement of contracts in case of default could contribute to significant
                 losses for banks and this could have significant impact on the access to finance for
                 SMEs.

             c.	 Changes in the market due to imposed lending restrictions are seen as a hindrance
                 causing liquidity constraints. The regulatory framework affecting the liquidity position
                 of banks is seen as another significant obstacle to involvement with SMEs. The
                 majority of surveyed financial institutions reported that there have been significant
                 changes in the market for lending to SMEs which affected banks in terms of liquidity
                 and overall competition in the banking sector.

             d.	 MFIs are more likely than banks to perceive competition in SME lending as an
                 obstacle. Banks are more likely to perceive bank-specific factors and characteristics
                 of SME lending as obstacles. Bank specific factors include amongst others the lack
                 of interest at the bank, limited geographic outreach, lack of appropriate products
                 and knowledge on how to evaluate MSMEs or high collateral requirements.

      v.	    Adequateness of business models

             a.	 Most of surveyed financial institutions lack a dedicated and specialized MSME unit
                 or department within their organizational structure. The organizational model used
                 by the majority of the interviewed institutions does not take into account the need
                 to set up a specialized MSME unit or department to better serve the MSME clientele.
                 9 out of the 12 financial institutions did not possess a separate SME department or
                 unit at the time of the study.

             b.	 Loan appraisal techniques are still mostly based on traditional relationship lending
                 rather than on transactional technologies such as credit scoring etc. When it comes
                 to appraisal and monitoring of MSME loans, these are largely done through the
                 establishment of a close relationship with clients for both banks and MFIs. A minority
                 of banks stated using transactional technologies such as credit scoring risk rating
                 tools, factoring or leasing. None of the MFIs use these techniques.

             c.	 Products are highly standardized and there is very limited product innovation. The
                 product mix offered by financial institutions does not seem to be sufficiently large.
                 Other lending products such as leasing and factoring are not offered by any of the
                 financial institutions in this study. Furthermore, products provided to the SME and
                 micro enterprise market are largely standardized and the efforts to continuously
                 adapt them to client’s needs are limited. The great majority of financial institutions
                 in the study reported no change in their financial product offering between the
                 years 2010 and 2012.

             d.	 On the institutional level and regarding specific business models, MFIs and banks
                 diverge in terms of sector targeting. Both target enterprises in the manufacturing
                 sector as required by the government. Banks however have further outreach to the
                 export trade sector, while MFIs focus more on agriculture. The only sector banks are
                 not aiming to reach that MFIs are, is petty trade.
             e.	 Geographic location is not considered as an important marketing criterion and
                 distribution channels are still mostly based on branches. Geographic location does
                 not appear to be an important marketing criterion for financial institutions. This is
                 particularly the case for MFIs as the 5 dominant ones, with more than 90 percent

                    of total asset portfolio of the micro financing sector, are affiliated with the regional
                    governments in Ethiopia. Regarding their geographic outreach most of the banks
                    and MFIs use only their own branches as distribution channels.

              f.	 Long term financing needs of SMEs do not seem to be properly addressed. The average
                  loan maturity for SME loans reported by MFIs was 2.38 years while for the banks it
                  was 6 years. According to the questionnaire responses, the average maturity loan
                  for large enterprises was 10.4 years. This indicates that long term financing needs
                  of SME’s are not well addressed and that there is a potential market gap here.



4.1.	 Defining MSME Financing in Ethiopia
In order to provide an insight into how financial institutions view the MSME segment, they were
asked to provide data on how they define small enterprises (SE’s) and micro enterprises (MI’s).
Typically banks define SME’s according to the annual turnover of the business, loan size, number
of employees and/or revenues generated by the financial institution.

The definitions used by MFIs in Ethiopia are based on the Government’s micro and small enterprises
definition as laid out in the national MSE development strategy (2011) (Table 7). All MFIs, besides
one, uniformly use the number of employees’ criteria. Most MFIs also categorized micro and small
enterprises in terms of turnover and loan size. Some of the MFIs indicated that in addition they
categorized businesses according to the capital requirement as defined in the national policy
document.

As shown in Table 8, definitions can vary to a certain degree when using the definition by turnover
and this needs to be taken into account when comparing data between microfinance institutions.
The MFIs uniformly used the policy definition in the MSE Development Strategy in terms of the
number of employees (1-5 employee for micro enterprise and 6-30 for small enterprises). Hence, the
firms above this employment definition are categorized by default as medium and large enterprises.
Medium enterprises are not clearly defined by the financial institutions. Only two MFIs defined
the medium enterprises in terms of loan size which highly varies (the maximum loan size is 10
million Birr for one MFI while it is 200 thousand Birr for the other). Similarly, firms are not defined
as medium enterprises and large enterprises neither by the government in terms of size of capital
requirement nor by MFIs in terms of turnover and loan size.

Structural changes in the market were mostly seen as a driver by MFIs due to recent government’s

 decision to engage in SME finance. The majority of MFIs and banks rated the burden
 posed by regulatory documentation requirements as appropriate and beneficial (Figure

 imposed by the central bank are excessive and too stringent for SMEs.

The role of the credit information bureau. As shown in Figure 24 most banks use credit bureau
information for MSMEs loan analysis. 3 out of 5 banks consider the credit bureau to be effective.
However only the negative information provided is used and the credit bureau information has
limited input and an insignificant contribution to loan decisions. Value added services such as
credit scoring are not available at the credit bureau. Currently, banks are submitting their new
credit information to the credit bureau on a monthly basis. The credit bureau validates this credit
information and sends it back to the banks. Each individual bank can only access its own borrowers’
credit information and the central, institution wide data is only available at the credit bureau level.
Although the technology infrastructure of the credit information system is capable of accommodating
the credit information of MFIs and MFIs have been involved in the setting-up of the credit bureau,
they are not using the credit information system. This is due to a lack of technology platforms in
their institutions not allowing them to connect to the credit bureau.

           Banks and MFIs equally use both quantitative and qualitative assessments for their credit analysis.
           All criteria of qualitative assessments including rating the quality of the SMEs management, doing
           a SWOT analysis, evaluating the viability of the business idea, assessing the target market size and
           potential as well as the entrepreneurship skills of the owner are used. The majority of banks and
           MFIs use qualitative techniques for credit assessment (Figure 29). The viability of the business idea
           and the entrepreneurial character of the owner are the two most important variables used by banks
           as well as MFIs. MFIs however, rely less on SWOT analysis and more on the evaluation of the market
           size and potential of a business than banks.

Products. Regarding the product offering for the target SME market, the banks interviewed
reported more than 80 percent of their loan products being term loans and other top
loans include overdraft, pre-shipment credit and advances on import bills. MFIs provide
group lending as their main loan product. They also provide non-financial products such

           main savings products offered to SMEs are saving and time deposit accounts for both banks and
           MFIs. Checking accounts are only offered by banks.

           Financial institutions in this survey do not seem to offer a sufficiently large product mix. Three banks
           reported offering either one or two of the following products: payroll/pension retirement payments,
           other payment services and/or foreign exchange. One bank offers all these three products while only
           one MFI reported offering payroll/pension retirement payments and other payment services. Other
           lending products such as leasing and factoring are not offered by any of the financial institutions
           in this study. Furthermore, products provided to the SME and micro enterprise market are largely
           standardized and efforts to continuously adapt them to client’s needs are limited. 88 percent of
           financial institutions in the study reported no change in their financial product offering between
           the years 2010 and 2012. This standardization, limited availability and range of products indicate
           that there is only limited lending product innovation taking place in the financial sector.

Banks and MFIs adapt their marketing efforts based mainly on profitability expectations, credit quality
and specific industry sectors. There is a slight difference in sector targeting between banks and
MFIs. In line with the government’s priorities, both banks and MFIs heavily target the manufacturing
sector (80 percent of MFIs and 83 percent of banks). Banks’ overall involvement is highest in the
manufacturing and export trade sectors, while lower in agriculture and construction. 80 percent
of MFIs are marketing to target the agricultural sector compared to 67 percent of banks. As to the
construction sector, 50 percent of banks focus on it and 40 percent of MFIs. The only sector banks
are not targeting but 40 percent of MFIs are, is petty trade. MFIs on the other hand are not involved
in export trade financing at all while 83% of banks are.

5. 	INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICES IN
    SUPPORTING SME FINANCE

The previous two chapters provided an in-depth analysis of constraints to access to SME finance
as one of the key drivers for promoting job creation.

Building on those findings, this chapter has three main objectives:

      To look at the main findings emerging from the demand-side and supply-side analysis
            and put them in relation to international best practices in SME finance;

      To provide an overview of the initiatives that the Government of Ethiopia has currently
           put in place to support MSMEs, highlighting whether alternative sources of finance are
           sufficiently exploited;

      To present how other countries (namely Turkey and China) have been successful in
           tackling the missing middle issue by implementing effective interventions in support
           of SME finance.



5.1.	 Key Findings on SME Finance Practices in Ethiopia vis-à-vis
      International Best Practices
The demand-side and supply-side analysis conducted in the previous chapter provided a
comprehensive list of findings and constraints that, if properly addressed, could unlock the potential
of MSME finance for Ethiopia. In this section we will focus on what we consider to be the five main
findings emerged from the analysis done so far:

      1.	    The lack of a common definition of MSMEs across financial institutions and private
             sector operators

      2.	    The effective existence of a missing middle phenomenon that constraints growth
             opportunities for small and medium enterprises
      3.	    The excessive collateral requirements

      4.	    The role of Government programs

      5.	    The inadequateness of business models.

      5.1.1. The importance of a commonly agreed definition of MSMEs

Having a common MSME definition at the national level would ease the design of loans, investments,
grants and statistical research. Worldwide, efforts to support MSMEs are at the center of the
development agenda. Since the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh in 2009 the MSMEs opened a debate
on whether a universal definition of MSMEs could be found. Hypothetically, the choice of an
MSME definition could depend on many factors, such as business culture, the size of the country’s
population; industry; and the level of international economic integration. A research recently
conducted by IFC demonstrated the wide range of approaches government can take to define
what an MSME is in their economy (Table 14).

All this shows how difficult it would be to find a universal MSME definition and suggests that it
probably makes more sense to measure MSMEs with a single rule e.g. annual sales or turnover and/
or number of employees and tailor the size breakdown to particular conditions in the country of
operation.36 The number of employees seems to be the most frequent characteristic used in the
definitions of national governments and statistical agencies. The number of employees is also a
fair characteristic to assess MSMEs’ contribution to GDP.

The fact that Ethiopia has already an official definition for micro and small enterprises contained
in the National MSE strategy makes it easier to work towards a nationally agreed definition. Our
supply-side survey however revealed that this definition is not adopted by commercial banks
with reference to their business, leading to important limitation to the actual implementation of
effective MSME-finance interventions.

         5.1.2.The existence of a missing middle phenomenon
Both the demand-side and the supply-side analysis clearly indicated that small (and medium)
enterprises are not properly served by financial institutions as MFIs mostly focus on the microenterprise
segment while commercial banks devote most of their resources to large enterprises. Our analysis
also showed how (contrary to the rest of the world) small enterprises are not the main job creators
in Ethiopia and one of the possible reasons for this might well be considered to be their lack of
access to finance. The concept of the missing middle is quite well known around the world and
interventions to tackle it have been put in place by other countries with some notable achievements
as the last section in this chapter will show. The bulk of interventions put in place to address the
missing middle phenomenon can be grouped into two main blocks, well represented in the figure

     36	 In their paper Defining SMEs: A Less Imperfect Way of Defining Small and Medium Enterprises in Developing
         Countries, Tom Gibson and H. J. van der Vaartindeed suggest a less imperfect formula: An SME is a formal
         enterprise with annual turnover, in U.S. dollar terms, of between 10 and 1000 times the mean per capita gross
         national income, at purchasing power parity, of the country in which it operates. However the problem of one-
         size-fits-all remains even in the Gibson and Vaart definition.

       5.1.5. The inadequateness of business models.

In order to effectively serve the segment of small enterprises, financial institutions need to have
the right business model in place.

The supply side analysis of this study reveals that this does not seem to be the case for financial
institutions in Ethiopia: most of surveyed financial institutions lack a dedicated and specialized
MSME unit or department within their organizational model. Loan appraisal techniques are still
mostly based on traditional relationship lending rather than on transactional technologies such as
credit scoring etc. Products are highly standardized and there is very limited product innovation.
Geographic location is not considered as an important marketing criterion and distribution channels
are still mostly based on branches.

These features suggest that business models of financial institutions in Ethiopia are not adequate
to properly serve the missing middle of SMEs. What is then an adequate business model? Figure 37
below helps us to identify the main features of an adequate model by looking at the key stages of a
possible MSME banking value chain. Among the key steps in fact, financial institutions are required
to properly understand the market by clearly defining the SME sub-segment; to tailor products and
services to the specific needs of SMEs, by using innovative technologies and bundling lending and
non-lending products; to grow a diversified portfolio by properly screening SME clients; to serve
SME clients through a dedicated unit able to monitor loans and provide cross-selling opportunities;
 opportunities; to properly manage risk by separating the sales and risk management
to properly manage risk by separating the sales and risk management functions and by developing
 functions and by developing risk modeling tools.

SME FINANCE IN ETHIOPIA: ADDRESSING THE MISSING MIDDLE CHALLENGE                                                           57
 5.2.1. TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES
        5.2.1.	 Training Opportunities

One area of intervention focused by the government in terms of MSE development is providing
training in entrepreneurship, skills development, and business management. There are more than 300
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) centers in the country that provide vocational,
technical and business skills trainings. The Ministry of Urban Development and Construction is also
setting up independent centers to train more than 200,000 people on entrepreneurial skills.37 In
fact the GTP target is to provide training for 3 million actors on entrepreneurship and handicrafts
during the plan period.

        5.2.2.	 Technology Transfer

The government of Ethiopia also provides support in the assessment, selection, acquisition, adoption,
and adaptation of foreign technology that are appropriate to the MSEs. The government has set
up independent institutions in selected areas such as textile; leather, metal and engineering, and
agro processing that are also responsible for the technology acquisitions and transfer in their
respective industries.

        5.2.3.	 Leasing Services

The Ethiopian government also provides a program on machine leasing. This program is intended
to help MSEs who may have collateral problems in securing loans to finance their project. The
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) and MFIs jointly run the lease-financing program, which is open
for all MSEs. Metal Engineering Corporation, the biggest producer of machineries and metallic
products in the country and other private organizations also take part in this program as key suppliers.

The government also runs a savings program for leasing machine/investment materials. This is a
program intended to solve capital/asset issues micro and small enterprise face. Under this program,
clients can get 60% loan/credit from banks when they save 40% in the bank.

        5.2.4.	Facilities

The MSE strategy underlines the importance of developing business and industrial premises (shops,
offices, factories, market stands, etc.) and providing them to enterprises on a cost recovery basis. The
plan envisages providing about 146 miles meter square land for 21,000 sheds and 8,000 buildings to
1.7 million actors who are registered as enterprise during the GTP period. According to the Ministry
of Urban Development and Construction, so far 10,500 hectares of land has been made available
and about 11,626 sheds and 983 buildings were constructed for production and sales purposes.

        5.2.5.	 Capacity Building

The MSE strategy also outlines the need to build capacity of implementing agencies at all levels.
The strategy (attached) outlines specific capacity building needs for all major actors that execute
MSE development strategy such as MSE development agencies at Federal and regional levels, TVETs,
MFIs and government officials found at various levels. Any possible private sector development
program in the future may focus in these identified areas.

        5.2.6.	 Partial Credit Guarantee Schemes

Since lending in Ethiopia is mainly collateral based, the partial credit guarantee scheme is a very
important public support program. The supply-side survey results indicate that the provision of
partial credit guarantee (PCG) schemes is a strong incentive for financial intuitions to serve SMEs.
Most financial institutions mentioned guarantees as a potential area through which the government
could encourage bank lending to SMEs. Some donors such as USAID and KfW (capital link) are
providing guarantee facilities for banks. MFIs borrow from banks to implement such schemes.
However, this arrangement has challenges as MFIs require negotiated interest rates to cover high
transaction costs of lending to SMEs.

     37	 UNDP is providing funding for these trainings.

  In addition, the Government of Ethiopia provides an export credit guarantee scheme for non-coffee
  exports to facilitate exporters’ access to bank credit with minimum property or other collateral
  equivalent to at least 40% for producer exporters and 50% for other exporters of the amount of the
  loan requested. The export credit guarantee scheme service was transferred from National Bank
  of Ethiopia to Development Bank of Ethiopia in 2007.

  Regional states provide guarantee for farmers’ unions for rural finance specifically for purchasing
  fertilizer. There are no other guarantee programs established by government to support SMEs
  financing in Ethiopia.

        5.2.7. 	MFI Up-Scaling Intervention: The Women Entrepreneurship Development
                Project (WEDP)

  WEDP is a national program whose objective is to increase the earnings and employment of micro
  and small enterprises (MSEs), owned or partly owned by female entrepreneurs in targeted cities.
  This is meant to be achieved by: i) tailoring financial instruments to the needs of the participants
  and ensuring availability of finance; and ii) developing the entrepreneurial and technical skills of
  the target group and supporting cluster, technology and product development for their businesses.

  It’s a market “up-scaling” operation where the Development Bank of Ethiopia acts as a wholesaler and
  MFIs act as retailers. The project uses an incentive approach aimed at (i) helping DBE developing a
  new business line involving wholesaling of MSE subsidiary loans and provision of related technical
  support to participating MFIs; and (ii) helping the MFIs build up a high quality MSE loan portfolio
  based on credit techniques that have been developed and validated under successful micro and
  small loan programs in other countries, introduced through downscaling or upscaling approaches
  to microfinance.

5.3.1. LEASING
5.3.	 Alternative Sources of Financing

      5.3.1.	Leasing

The Leasing Proclamation has been amended recently by providing licensing and supervisory
authority to National Bank of Ethiopia for finance leasing and hire-purchase leasing. Leasing can
be an effective mechanism for boosting the Ethiopian economy by providing long-term finance
to SMEs. Leasing companies play an important role in the financing of small and medium-sized
businesses, which need funds to expand but often do not have the credit history or collateral sufficient
for credit from conventional financing sources. Leasing gives these enterprises the opportunity to
create and modernize their operations hence increasing productivity, lowering transaction costs,
increasing employment opportunities, increasing business profitability, promoting innovation and
creativeness, and increasing product choices.

No financial institutions in the survey reported the provision of leasing as a loan product.

      5.3.2.	Factoring

Factoring is not practiced in Ethiopia. SMEs could have alternative source of finance to solve their
cash flow problems by discounting their bills/ accounts receivables as a key source of working
capital if factoring is provided by financial institutions as an SME financing product.

      5.3.3.	 Capital Markets

Capital markets have a long history in Ethiopia. Commercial Code of 1960 provides primary offering
to public investors. However, Ethiopia’s current legal and regulatory framework is not adequate
as both the primary offering market and secondary trading market are essentially unregulated.

The primary market is unregulated and the law does not provide adequate protections for investors in
the primary offering for the following main reasons: (i) there is no institutional framework (securities
commission) as an independent government agency for review and approval of a registration
statement and prospectus prior to issuers’ offering and selling shares to investors; (ii) there is no
requirement that the registration statement and prospectus contains audited financial statements,
the issuers’ financial statements be prepared in accordance with defined internationally accepted
accounting principles and the audit of issuers’ financial statements be conducted in accordance with
defined internationally accepted auditing standards; and (iii) there is no provision for stopping or
halting in the event of fraudulent conduct; no adequate anti-corruption provision and on penalties
for non-compliance.

An adequate legal, regulatory and supervisory framework that can serve as a foundation for secondary
trading market is also missing. Hence, the country’s equity and corporate bond markets are non-
existent. As a result, SMEs in Ethiopia rely mainly on conventional sources of external financing
which is almost exclusively provided by the banking sector and equity investments that come
from retained earnings and capital provided by friends and family groups of related companies.

There are no investment banks with a wide range of specialized services for companies and large
investors including underwriting and advising on securities issues and other forms of capital raising,
mergers and acquisitions, trading on capital markets, research and private equity investments etc.
so that commercial banks could lean towards SMEs financing.

In absence of financing sources from capital markets, SMEs also do not have venture capital funding
for adequate financing for technical assistance, start-ups, seed investing or any stages of investing
in their businesses.

             5.4.	 Other International Support Programs
             In May 2012, a high-level delegation of the Government of Ethiopia was invited by the World Bank to
             join a study tour to Turkey and China to observe how these two countries successfully implemented
             SME finance interventions as part of World Bank-financed projects.

             The objective of the study tour was to learn from the good practice models in China and Turkey in
             the area of financing and enterprise development, with a special focus on MSMEs. Line of Credit
             (LoC) schemes provide successful examples of financial interventions that helped enhance MSME
             business lending and improved outcomes in terms of increase in exports, sales and employment
             of participating firms.

             This section aims at recalling those two successful examples in light of the results of the demand-
             side and supply-side analysis of MSME finance practices in Ethiopia.

             In China, between 2007 and 2011, the World Bank contributed to funding a project aimed at
             providing financing to MSEs who did not have prior access to financing. Over half a million MSEs were
             served in this collaborative project with the China Development Bank (CDB). Technical assistance
             was critical for project success; the CDB as well as all participating financial institutions (PFIs) were
             required to engage and participate in mandatory technical advisory provided by an international
             consulting firm (Internationale Projekt Consult). In addition, the CDB and PFIs created specialized
             units to service and monitor MSE lending.
             In Turkey, between 1999 and 2011, the World Bank provided $1.7 billion in lending to Turkey, where
             the objective was to assist exporter firms who needed longer term financing.

             Overall, these two projects were very successful. Intensive technical assistance enhanced lending
             processes in China. At the end of the project in 2011, the number of MSEs that were being served
             tripled compared to the number before the project in 2007 (63,540 in 2011 vs 20,000 in 2007). In
             Turkey, participating exporter firms had higher growth rates, export activity, and innovation than
             non-participating firms.

6. 	POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND POTENTIAL
    POLICY DIRECTIONS

The SME segment is strategically important for the development of the Ethiopian economy and the
creation of employment opportunities as they create an important value chain in different economic
sectors. The significance of SMEs and their challenges have been clearly identified in the Growth
and Transformation Plan and MSE Strategy Development document. Significant measures are
being taken by the Government of Ethiopia to strengthen SMEs in terms of developing business
skills; providing access to finance; and creating market linkages. Hence, the SME market should
evolve towards increased competitiveness. Financial institutions need to invest in product and
service development for SMEs as they seek to pursue their growth strategy to secure sustainable
profitability and contribution to economic development of Ethiopia.

Access to finance is one of the most significant concerns for SMEs in Ethiopia. As shown in Chapter
4, the share of SME loans to overall lending portfolio in Ethiopia is only 7 percent which is very low
compared to other developing countries (16 percent). Banks and MFIs mainly rely on credit history
of SMEs with their own financial institutions, financial assessment of the SME business and behavior
of SME owner for loan decision making while SME specific factors such as poor quality of financial
statements, lack of skills in business and risk management, and informality are the main constraints
for lending to SMEs. Access to finance for SMEs is further hampered by the financial institutions’
strong reliance on real estate and cash as prime collateral. Banks and MFIs require collateral for
SMEs with a minimum value from 100 percent to 120 percent for immovable assets. For movable
assets, that are accepted only by a few financial institutions, the collateral is 140 percent. This is an
acute problem for SMEs which have not built up a capital and asset base.
Alternative sources of finance such as leasing, factoring and capital market are not readily available
in Ethiopia as an additional source of liquidity for SME businesses. Hence, SMEs rely on equity
investment and limited access to credit from banks and MFIs as an external source of finance for
their businesses.

The legal and regulatory framework in Ethiopia is conducive and ensures financial system stability
and soundness for providing financial services to businesses. However, the legal, regulatory and
supervisory frameworks are focused mainly on traditional banking whereas the frameworks for
alternative sources of finance are inadequate and the institutional frameworks are either weak or
unavailable.

The Government of Ethiopia has put in place helpful public support programs but the offer is still
inadequate to properly address the missing middle challenge. Existing lines of credit (e.g. WEDP
and RUFIP) are tackling the MFIs’ space but are not helping commercial banks to engage in SME
lending. The export credit guarantee, which is being provided by Development Bank of Ethiopia,
is also not sufficient to adequately address the financial needs of SMEs in divers sectors.

Conditions exist for Ethiopia to take a step further towards the promotion of SME finance and help,
through a series of well calibrated interventions, the commercial banking sector to start addressing
the mostly untapped SMEs market segment. As shown in Figure 39, an effective intervention in this
space should aim at moving the SME finance productivity frontier from the “unprofitable” corner
of old credit and service allocation techniques to the sustainable profitability’s path which starts
from the acquisition of new financial information and communication technologies, leads to better
credit risk decisions and access to SMEs and better cross and up-selling decisions.

           commercial banks’ downscaling interventions

             a.	 The positive role that public support interventions can play in promoting SME finance
                 practices came out clearly from the analysis.

             b.	 While the Government of Ethiopia is currently engaged in a series of positive efforts
                 to promote the engagement of MFIs in the small business segment through market
                 up-scaling efforts (e.g. WEDP), the banking sector requires further attention in order
                 to exploit its potential in serving the missing middle segment.

             c.	 Incentives should be provided to commercial banks for engaging in market
                 downscaling initiatives. Successful examples of international best practices showed
                 that the combination of dedicated liquidity (through lines of credit) with tailored
                 technical assistance packages prove to be effective in successfully reaching the
                 missing middle segment.

             d.	 In Ethiopia, institutions like the Development Bank of Ethiopia are currently well
                 placed to play the wholesaler role in providing dedicated liquidity for SME finance
                 to financial intermediaries.




64
      Promote innovation in financial products and lending technologies by providing incentives
          to commercial banks through tailored technical assistance.

             a.	 Around the globe, certain commercial banks have applied lending practices developed
                 in the microfinance sector to overcome the issues of high transaction costs and
                 high-risk profiles of potential borrowers. These best practices can be of use in the
                 Ethiopian context as well.

             b.	 The surveys revealed that most Ethiopian financial institutions do not have the right
                 instruments to put in place an innovative product mix and to engage in new lending
                 technologies.

             c.	 Tailored technical assistance, coupled with the provision of dedicated liquidity as
                 under point #2 above, would help to stimulate the use of new techniques in line with
                 international best practices. It would help commercial banks to establish dedicated
                 SME units within their organization, define SME-specific strategies, offer a range of
                 products beyond lending, utilize low cost delivery channels, develop and use risk
                 modeling tools and build adequate hardware and software architecture.

      Address SME specific factors through the provision of adequate business development skills
           (BDS) in conjunction with interventions on the supply-side.

             a.	 BDS can help to address some of the intrinsic weaknesses in SMEs that cannot be
                 addressed through financing tools alone.

             b.	 The survey indicates that SME specific weaknesses are among the major factors
                 inhibiting commercial banks to engage in this market segment.

             c.	 The government has a role in this market as a provider of BDS as it is already currently
                 doing through FeMSEDA and the TVETs. However, it would be crucial to coordinate
                 and tailor BDS interventions with parallel incentives provided to the supply side (i.e.
                 commercial banks) to engage in SME lending.

      Promote policies aimed at addressing the limitations of the current collateral regime.

             a.	 Given the prevalence of collateral lending in Ethiopia, establishing collateral registry
                 of both movable and immovable asset would be important for creating an effective
                 credit market by expanding the scope of secured lending transactions and improving
                 access to financial services. It registers charges and collaterals created by borrowers
                 to secure credit facilities provided by lenders.

             b.	 Establishing Collateral Registry encourages lenders to accept a diverse range of
                 movable properties as collaterals. It is also a useful mechanism for enforcing credit
                 agreements as the lender is able to realize the collateral upon the simple delivery
                 of a notice to the borrower and collateral registry in case of default.

             c.	 The legislation related to the contractual environment would also benefit from a
                 thorough analysis. Particularly it would be recommended to conduct a diagnostic of
                 the creditor rights and enforcement systems (for secured and unsecured credit); credit
                 risk management, debt recovery and informal enterprise workout practices; formal

                   of the relevant institutional and regulatory frameworks in implementing laws in this
                   area. A similar diagnostic would allow identifying bottlenecks, facilitating access to
                   credit for SMEs and providing a stable backdrop for private transactions.38

        Support development of market credit information for SMEs

                a.	 While comments generally were positive about information from the credit bureau,
                    it was noted that coverage is limited and does not necessarily include all financing
                    received by SMEs.

                b.	 Currently, Ethiopia has a credit information system with high technological capabilities
                    and business functionalities to run credit reporting. However, it is being used merely
                    as a database management system by the National Bank of Ethiopia that collects
                    information on creditworthiness of borrowers from supervised financial institutions,
                    makes such information available for financial institutions, and uses it primarily for
                    supervisory purposes.

                c.	 Enhancing its functions to provide reliable and value added credit information,
                    both positive and negative information (full file), is critically important for financial
                    institutions for quality decision making on credit, risk mitigation and minimizing
                    fraud by providing value added services such as credit scoring, marketing service,
                    application processing and portfolio monitoring.

                d.	 Specific policies could support the use of market credit information through the
                    refinements to the legal and regulatory framework to improve incentives to share
                    information among lenders, and an educational campaign promoting the value of
                    credit bureaus among SMEs and financial institutions.

        Develop the institutional framework for alternative sources of funding.

                a.	 Among the alternative sources of funding, the Leasing Proclamation has been
                    amended recently by providing licensing and supervisory authority to the National
                    Bank of Ethiopia to finance leasing and hire-purchase leasing. Leasing can be an
                    effective mechanism for boosting the Ethiopian economy by providing long-term
                    finance to SMEs and its use should be more extensively promoted.

                b.	 Similarly, the institutional framework for other sources of funding such as factoring
                    and joint venture capital need to be developed as a part of a comprehensive package
                    of financial sector infrastructure and products development.




     38	 The World Bank Insolvency and Creditor/Debtor Regimes Initiative (ICR) has developed a diagnostic tool to
         assist countries in identifying vulnerabilities and establishing priorities for strengthening creditor rights and
         insolvency legal and institutional frameworks. The diagnostic is based on a detailed comparative review of the
         practical functioning of the country’s insolvency and creditor/debtor system against international best practice
         benchmarks. The results of this review are contained in the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
         (ICR ROSC). The ICR ROSC diagnostic and recommendations help countries identify areas for improvement and
         set priorities for legal and institutional reform. The diagnostic is delivered to the country authorities for their

Conclusions

This study looked at the policy goal of job creation from an access to finance perspective. Precisely,
the study aimed at understanding which firms are the actual net job creators in Ethiopia and what
role (the lack of ) access to financial sources may play for those firms.

Evidence from two demand-side surveys, (i.e. the Ethiopia Survey of Large and Medium Scale
Manufacturing Industries – LMMIS and the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey - ES) revealed that job
creation and employment growth are concentrated in large established (i.e. older) firms rather
than in young and smaller firms.

By looking deeper into the area of access to financial services as one of the possible explanations
for this unexploited potential role of young and small firms in job creation, we find indeed the
existence of a missing middle phenomenon in terms of financial services catering to small firms.
Young and smaller firms are much more likely to be rejected for a loan or a line of credit than firms
who are more established or larger. Moreover, despite confirming the need for access to finance,
SMEs are discouraged from applying for loans due to excessively high collateral requirements. In turn,
data also show that firms that are credit constrained exhibit poorer performance and productivity:
in Ethiopia, a firm that is credit constrained has sales growth that is 15 percentage points lower,
employment growth that is 5 percentage points lower, and labor productivity growth that is 11
percentage points lower than firms who are not credit constrained.

These findings from the demand-side analysis highlighted the need to look at SME financing
constraints also from a supply-side perspective, in order to gain a full picture of access to financial
services for SMEs in Ethiopia. This was done on the basis of an ad-hoc questionnaire administered
to a sample of financial institutions including the major public and private sector commercial banks
and microfinance institutions that allowed collecting data on the actual involvement of financial
institutions with MSMEs, their perception of potential public policy approaches to support SMEs
access to finance and the adequateness of their current business models.

The supply-side analysis indicated first of all that financial institutions in Ethiopia lack an “SME
finance culture”: the use of a harmonized definition of MSME is missing especially for commercial
banks and consequently specific SME financing strategies are not in place.

Still, the financial institutions perception of the SME segments’ business potential is very good as they
see expected returns as major drivers along with the contribution to the economic development
of the country. However SME-specific factors (i.e. poor quality of financial statements, inability to
manage risk, lack of knowledge of business management, lack of awareness on how to be bankable,
lack of adequate collateral and informality) and macroeconomic factors (i.e. inflation, tax regulation
etc.) still represent significant obstacles to the development of SME lending.

In line with the findings from the demand-side analysis, also the supply-side findings indicate that
SMEs represent a missing middle in the financial sector. The financial sector is characterized by a
high heterogeneity of lending patterns between MFIs and commercial banks, with MFIs issuing
the most number of loans to SME and banks issuing the most value.

Moreover, the supply-side analysis also showed that the business models of the surveyed financial
institutions are mostly inadequate to serve SMEs: they lack a dedicated and specialized MSME unit
or department within their organizational mode; loan appraisal techniques are still mostly based on
traditional relationship lending rather than on transactional technologies such as credit scoring etc.;
products are highly standardized and there is very limited product innovation; distribution channels
are still mostly based on branches and long term financing needs of SMEs are not adequately met.

Finally the underexploited capacities of the credit reference bureau coupled with the absence of a
collateral registry and the ineffective enforcement of contracts in case of default have all significant
impacts on the access to finance for SMEs and the actual incentives of financial institutions to
engage in this market segment.




SME FINANCE IN ETHIOPIA: ADDRESSING THE MISSING MIDDLE CHALLENGE                                      67
Against this background, the Government has a key role to play in helping the financial sector
to effectively address the missing middle challenge. Government financed programs (e.g. credit
guarantee programs and line of credit with technical assistance) in fact are seen favourably by
financial institutions and were indicated as important drivers.

While the Government of Ethiopia is already engaging in the promotion of financing micro and
small enterprises mostly through MFIs (i.e. through the Women Entrepreneurship Development
Project – WEDP and through the Rural Financial Intermediation Project – RUFIP), significant space
is left open for helping commercial banks to downscale their business and focus on SMEs. This type
of intervention, successfully implemented in other countries (e.g. China and Turkey), is based on the
joint provision of a credit facility (providing dedicated liquidity through a line of credit) and tailored
technical assistance that helps participating banks in developing innovative financial products and
lending technologies. At the same time, addressing SME specific factors through the coordinated
provision of business development skills training opportunities to SMEs is a crucial success factor.

Finally, an integrated approach to SME finance development, as the one proposed by this study,
would require also to: (i) invest in improving the financial sector infrastructure (e.g. by enhancing
the use, coverage and functionalities of the currently existing credit information bureau); (ii) address
limitations of the current collateral regime and the contractual environment; and (iii) develop the
institutional framework for alternative sources of funding.
The recommendations contained in this study are all meant to contribute to the creation of an “SME
finance culture” that would translate into an increased access to finance for SMEs and ultimately to
job creation and economic growth. It is certainly a complex and multidimensional task requiring
strong commitment and coordination but we believe that the Government of Ethiopia is well
positioned to pursue this objective and, by doing so, contribute greatly to the achievement of the
GTP’s targets.

Appendix 1: 	 About the Enterprise Surveys

Data for the Ethiopia 2011 Enterprise Survey was collected between July 2011 and July 2012 as
part of the Africa Enterprise Survey 2011. In total, 794 firms were surveyed.

As part of its strategic goal of building a climate for investment, job creation, and sustainable growth,
the World Bank has promoted improving business environments as a key strategy for development,
which has led to a systematic effort in collecting enterprise data across countries. The Enterprise
Surveys (ES) are an ongoing World Bank project in collecting both objective data based on firms’
experiences and enterprises’ perception of the environment in which they operate.

Industry stratification was designed in the way that follows: the universe was stratified into one
manufacturing industry and one service as defined in the sampling manual. For the Ethiopia
Enterprise Survey (ES), the manufacturing industry had a target of 340 interviews and service
industry had a target of 240 interviews. The sample design for the Ethiopia micro survey targeted
240 establishments, 120 in manufacturing and 120 in services. Given to difficulties during the
fieldwork implementation, the sample design for the Ethiopia micro survey was revised in March
2012. The revised sample had a target of 120 establishments, 60 in manufacturing and 60 in services.
Size stratification was defined following the standardized definition for the rollout: small (5 to 19
employees), medium (20 to 99 employees), and large (100+ employees). The micro sample consists
of firms with 1 to 4 employees. For stratification purposes, the number of employees was defined
on the basis of reported permanent full-time workers. This seems to be an appropriate definition
of the labor force since seasonal/casual/part-time employment is not a common practice, except
in the sectors of construction and agriculture. Note that the size stratification for the Enterprise
Surveys is different than throughout the report. The size groups used in the report match groups
defined by Ethiopia’s Survey of Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing Industries (CAS).

Regional stratification for the Ethiopia ES as well as the Ethiopia micro surveys was defined in five
regions (City and the surrounding business area): Addis Ababa, Oromya, Snnp, Amhara, and Tigray.
The revised sample design for the Ethiopia micro survey included establishments only in Addis Ababa.

Analysis using the Enterprise Surveys data is supplementary to the work done using the Ethiopia
Survey of Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing Industries (LMMIS). The main differences between
ES and LMMIS are the following: (a) first, the LMMIS only covers the manufacturing sector and
includes fully government-owned enterprises, while the ES covers selected manufacturing, retail and
other services sector and does not include fully government owned enterprises; (b) second, there
are differences in the variables between surveys, (c) third, the ES is a cross-section and the LMMIS
is longitudinal. These differences in the ES increases the scope of the study from what is feasible
using the LMMIS alone, specifically in examination of the services sector and credit constraint status.

Appendix 2: 	 About the Survey of Large and Medium Scale
              Manufacturing Industries (LMMIS)

The Survey Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing Industries is collected by the Central Statistical
Agency. Our panel contains 14,435 observations, and 5,984 unique firms. While the Survey aims
to include only establishments with 10 or more employees, we find a small number of firms who
reported fewer than 10 employees.

Appendix 4: 	 Liquidity constraints

The goal of the liquidity constraint analysis is to examine whether age and size matter in access to
finance. To do this, we use the Survey of Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing Industries from
2000-2011.

Our baseline specification is shown in Equation (1). The specification to test whether or not a firm is
financially constrained uses cash flow CF as a proxy for liquidity, defined as the sum of profit after
taxation, extraordinary profit, and depreciation.
                                           it
                                                  If firms are constrained by their internal funds, we
expect the coefficient on cash flow (α ) to be positive and statistically significant. We introduce
an interaction of cash flow with an age  1
                                             dummy and a size dummy to examine whether young
firms and SMEs are subject to different liquidity constraints than other firms. However one may
be concerned that size and age may not be the only explanatory variables that define the ability
of a firm to get external financing for fixed assets. For instance, exporters or public firms may be
seen as lower risk borrowers for commercial banks. Public firms may have an easier access to credit
because of political connections.

                                                                                                                           (1)

                 Iit/Kit-1 = α0 + α1 CFit/Kit + α2∆Si + α3 CFit/Kit*SMEit + α4 CFit/Kit*Youngit + α5
         CFit/Kit*Youngt*SMEt + α6 SMEsit + α7 Young it + α8 Exporterit + α9 Publicit + αi + αjt + εit



Where ∆Sit is the change in sales, SMEit is the dummy variable to indicate whether the firm i at time
t employees between 10 and 99 workers (permanent and temporary), the Youngit variable indicates
whether the firm has been operating less than 10 years (included)40, the Publicit dummy is equal to
one if public funds were injected in the firm’s capital, and the Exporterit dummy indicates whether
the firm exports (at least) a part of its production. We normalize investment and cash flow by dividing
those variables by the capital stock at the beginning of the period Kit. For all continuous variables,
we use natural logarithms. To control for the unobserved heterogeneity across firms we estimate a
model using firm fixed effects (αi). We also include year x industry fixed effects (αjt) which capture
aggregate conditions affecting the cost of capital in a particular year and in a particular sector, so
it is not necessary to control for interest rates, tax rates or sectorial inflation.

The goal of our analysis is to examine whether age and size matter in access to finance. We introduce
an interaction of cash flow with an age dummy and a size dummy (CFit/Kit*Youngt*SMEt) to examine
whether young firms and SMEs are subject to different liquidity constraints than other firms.
However, one may be concerned that size and age may not be the only explanatory variables that
define the ability of a firm to get external financing. For instance, exporters or public firms may be
seen as lower risk borrowers for commercial banks.

Because the data from the Enterprise Surveys show that we must consider a more granular
breakdown in terms of size, we consider three size categories: small if the number of employees
is between 10 and 19, medium if the number of employees is between 20 and 99, and large is the
number of employees is above 100. The size definition is slightly different from what can be found
in the usual definition because the Manufacturing Census is supposed to cover only firms above
10 employees. However we can find in the Census some observations for firms with less than 10
employees. We chose not to include those in the analytics since those micro firms are usually firms
that are not performing well.

In Table 18, specification (1) shows results from testing for the direct effect of cash flow on the
investment decision. The coefficient on the cash flow is positive and statistically significant at

     40	 We first tested a Young variable with three categories: Start-up (0 to 5 years), Young (6 to 10 years) and Well
         established (above 10 years). We also tested two variables with two categories: young firms are below or
         equal to 10 years old and young firms are below or equal to 5 years old. The results give statistically significant
         relationships between investment and age only for the variable for which young firms are below or equal to 10
         years old.

the one percent level, thereby suggesting that firms are constrained by their internal funds. In
specification (2), we are testing the same hypothesis but with a lagged cash flow. The conclusion
is the same, although the coefficient is smaller.

Specifications (3), (4) and (5) examine the link between investment and cash flow with regard
to different explanatory variables. Those models suggest that young firms are not particularly
constrained by their internal funds. However, those seem to be determinant in the decision to
invest for SMEs (statistically significant coefficient on the interaction term with cash flow). Moreover,
the positive coefficient of the interaction term suggests that SMEs that have been operating for
more than 5 years are more constrained than large firms and young SMEs. The coefficients on the
interaction terms between Public and Exporter dummies and the cash flows are not statistically
significant but are both negative, suggesting that exporter and public firms do not face liquidity
constraints.

The Young variable is crucial in the analytics. This variable is defined based on the age of the firm
which is calculated based on the year of establishment. For a firm, we may found different years of
establishment. We chose to use the median year of establishment as the reference point. In some
strand of the literature, age is broken down in three categories: the start-ups (defined as firms
between 0 to 5 years old), the young firms (defined as firms between 6 and 10 years) and the well-
established firms (defined as firms above 10 years). We tested which kind of characterization fits best
the Census, by choosing the definition where the coefficients are the most statistically significant. We
finally chose a Young variable with two categories in which young firms are 10 years old or below.

In Table 19, we tested the baseline specifications and the different variables that may affect the
liquidity of firms. The value that is excluded from the regression is the value that corresponds to
large firms. The results show that size seems to be an important variable when looking at liquidity
constraints. However the results seem not coherent with the rest of the literature which usually
shows that large firms are less credit constrained than small and medium firms. The results also
indicate that public firms seem to be less credit constrained than private firms. However being an
exporter or having a foreign participation does not seem to matter a lot.

We then tested the baseline by firm size. Looking at Table 21, it seems that small firms are less
constrained than medium firms that are less credit constrained than large ones.

Given that different parameters may play a role depending on the size category of the firm, we
are testing the baseline on each of the size category. In Table 22, which corresponds to small firms
only, the results show that the age is crucial: especially young firms are more credit constrained
than older firms. The fact that a firm is public or has a foreign participation does not seem to ease
its access to finance. The specifications (3) and (4) test the robustness of the results when we add
sales in the regression.

We apply the same methodology for medium firms. Age does not seem to matter in the ability of
a firm to access finance. However public medium firms appear to be less credit-constrained than
private ones. When adding sales, we find that according to specification (5), exporting firms are far
less credit constrained than firms that distribute their products locally.

None of the dependent variable seems to affect the capacity of a large firm to access to finance.
Even if the coefficients are not statistically significant, we find that a negative coefficient on cash
flow for public firms, as well as exporters.
