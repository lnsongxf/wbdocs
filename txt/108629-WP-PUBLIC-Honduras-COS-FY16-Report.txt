I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Honduras perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Honduras
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Honduras
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From November 2015 to January 2016, 360 stakeholders of the WBG in Honduras were invited
to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 180 stakeholders participated in
the survey (50% response rate).

Some respondents completed the survey with the presence of a representative of the independent
fielding agency; others received and completed the questionnaire online. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Honduras; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Honduras; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 43%, N=130). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown
and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix D (page 86).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations; and
       respondents from NGOs/community based organizations and private foundations were
       combined in the “CSO” category. Few respondents from the office of a parliamentarian,
       local governments, and independent government institutions were included in the “Other”
       category. Note that there were no respondents from trade unions, faith-based groups,
       youth groups, and the judiciary branch.

      analyses comparing geographic locations would not be statistically reliable and,
      therefore, were not conducted.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey indicated significantly
        higher levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from the FY’13
        Country Survey (weighted mean in FY’16 = 6.9; weighted mean in FY’13 = 5.7)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Honduras, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Honduras, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

        Survey.
       Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the Office of the
        President/Prime Minister/Minister and employees of ministries were significantly more
        likely to indicate that Honduras is headed in the right direction, while respondents from
        CSOs and the media were significantly less positive about the prospect of Honduras.

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister/
       Minister had the highest mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS
       indicator questions, whereas respondents from CSOs had significantly lower mean
       ratings. Responses for individual indicator questions by stakeholder groups can be found
       in Appendix B (page 59).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 7.1) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 6.5). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix E (page 91).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Honduras, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Honduras. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at climate change; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at food security.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Honduras, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year18
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 110  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 165

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them

SECTION A: GENERAL ISSUES
 A4. The World Bank Group’s “Shared Prosperity” goal captures two key elements, economic growth
 and equity. It will seek to foster income growth among the bottom 40 percent of a country’s
 population. Improvement in the Shared Prosperity Indicator requires growth and well-being of the
 less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the
 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Honduras? (Choose no more
 than TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable social safety net
  3    Greater access to micro-finance for the poor
  4    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
  5    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  7    A growing middle class
  8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
