Annex C: Financial and Non-financial Constraints Faced by Women-Owned SMEs
The material in this section is based on “Stregthening Access to Finance for Women-owned SMEs in
Deveoping Countries”

Table C1: Non-financial Constraints

 Non-financial Constraints:
 Conditions in broader business environment including: legal, cultural, regulatory environment, human capital, infrastructure
 and governance issues that are an impediment for women to have access to finance, and own/manage strong and
 profitable businesses
 Condition                     Examples
 Legal Environment:            Smart regulations
                               Right to access and control property
                               Modernization collateral laws
 Cultural Environment:         Gender division of labor/household obligations reduces available time for entrepreneurial activities
                               Gender discrimination: legal capacity, property rights, cultural traditions, exclusion from
                               identification documentation
                               Lower inter-household bargaining position
                               Lack of entrance to labor force
                               Restrictions on mobility
                               Restrictions on business activities to engage in
                               Fear of take over of business prevents reinvestment of earnings
                               Access to products and services that meet life cycle needs: education, health, insurance, pension
                               Constraints within financial institutions (i.e. cultural barriers preventing interest in women clients)
                               Access to a safe place to save
 Human Capital:                Personal characteristics of women entrepreneurs
                               (i.e. different levels of education and business and financial management training)
                               Limited access to human capital and collateral
                               (human capital - talent, networks, management techniques, education)
                               Education levels/literacy
                               Financial literacy
                               Work experience
                               Leadership
                               Business skills
 Regulatory environment:       Informal sector/lack of incentives for businesses to formalize
 Infrastructure:               Unreliable or poor can be constraint for financial institutions that serves SMEs and productivity
                               of SMEs.
                               Weak investment climate/financial markets limits local banks ability to serve growing businesses
                               Weak infrastructure affecting the ability to grow a business (i.e. Electricity, transportation,
                               governance, red tape, crime
 Weak Governance:              Corruption
                               Harassment reported by both men & women, but women are seen as more vulnerable and
                               softer targets

Table C2: Financial Constratints

 Financial Constraints:
 Condition                           Examples
 Infrastructure:                     Current financial infrastructure that limits incentives to reach more clients (i.e. lack of credit
                                     bureaus or collateral registries, limited sharing of information between financial institutions).
                                     Too complex & cumbersome procedures for financing
 Risk aversion:                      Characteristics of entrepreneurs & enterprises they run (i.e. women run smaller firms, service
                                     sector firms, and in the informal sector) Small firms are too risky b/c can’t survive weak
                                     investment/infrastructure
 Gender-disaggregated data:          Lack of tracer studies to allow for cross-country & large-scale conclusions on evaluation of
                                     enterprises specific to gender
                                     Banks’ marketing strategies not built around women entrepreneur profile
                                     (i.e. hours open, locations due to cultural constraints)
                                     Lack of services offered beyond micro-credit to help women graduate
                                     Lack of knowledge about the market opportunities that women entrepreneurs present
 Gender Stereotyping/Institutional   Financial institutions stereotype women to be less entrepreneurial than men
 discrimination:
                                     Small size of women owned businesses are seen as a deliberate & socially induced choice
                                     and influences FIs perception of amount of financial resources allocated
                                     Women are offered more expensive financing terms(i.e. higher rates and lower amounts of
                                     loan) because they do not meet transaction criteria or are seen as less qualified
                                     Women are offered terms based on statistical averages of SMEs at large
                                     Women do not have access to financial programs that only support sectors that men have
                                     historically operated in
                                     Women are seen as high risk due to lack of collateral and credit history
                                     Involuntarily built into the credit evaluation criteria
 Undiversified portfolios of         Banks rely on limited personal profiles & track records in reviewing loan applications which
 financial institutions:             do not properly represent women due to lack of personal records & documentations
 High cost of servicing women:       Costs associated with administering small loans
