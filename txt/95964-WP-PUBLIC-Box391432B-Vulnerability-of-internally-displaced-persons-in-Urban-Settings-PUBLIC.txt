VULNERABILITY OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED
     PERSONS IN URBAN SETTINGS

  Internal displacement, rapid growth of urban areas and proliferation of informal
  settlements are in the spotlight of public policy debate in Afghanistan at present. This
  pamphlet discusses characteristics, livelihood strategies and vulnerabilities of
  households living in informal settlements in three urban centers in Afghanistan. These
  findings summarize the analysis from a joint World Bank-UNHCR “Research study on IDPs
  in urban settings”, which illustrates the complexities of displacement and of urban
  informal settlement growth.

          Motivated by an existing knowledge gap on these issues, the analysis provides a
  starting point for discussion among actors directly or indirectly involved with
  management of problems related to displacement and urban informal settlements,
  including departments in the Government of Afghanistan, international institutions and
  stakeholders from civil society.

         The study documents the significance of displacement as a factor underlying
  vulnerabilities observed in informal settlements, and identifies IDPs as an extremely
  deprived segment of the population, even in comparison to the profile of urban
  poverty in the recent National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA 2007/08).

      The study calls for:
       going beyond a purely humanitarian approach and looking for sustainable
         solutions for IDPs in informal settlements;
       a comprehensive and integrated developmental approach to displacement in
         urban areas; and
       strengthening existing monitoring and coordination efforts to target the
         immediate needs of urban IDPs, especially in the initial phases of displacement.

2 In particular, based on the recent economics literature on migration, economic migrants would be expected to be relatively better off compared to forced

migrants in that the former tend to be “self-selected” groups of the rural population (for example in terms of skills, education, age…) who invest in migration
expecting a positive economic return from such a choice. On the other hand, forced migrants are precluded such rational choices as conflict or insecurity
compels them to leave to preserve their own safety, irrespective of positive economic returns from migration itself.
3 The NRVA 07/08 household survey is the primary data source used for the current official definition of the poverty line in Afghanistan and for the Poverty

Assessment analysis.
4 This selection ensures a balanced geographical coverage between the Center, West and Southern regions, as well as representation of different ethnicities,

displacement histories, population profiles, urban settlement and integration patterns.
5 A total of 20 key informant interviews was conducted throughout the project to guide the methodology (pre-field work), assist the teams locally during field

work, and provide input on data analysis (post fieldwork). The list of key informant interviews includes meetings with representatives from UNHCR, OCHA,
UNHABITAT, Solidarités, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), Assistance Médicale Internationale (AMI), Action Contre la Faim (ACF), UMCOR, MoRR, and USAID, at
the national and sub-national levels.

7 If a household is defined as poor, all individuals in that same household are deemed to be poor.

8 The average value of the poverty line for urban areas is 1,776 Afghani per person. The poverty line represents the typical cost of attaining 2,100 calories per

person per day and of meeting some basic nonfood needs, in terms of Fall 2007 prices from urban areas of central Afghanistan. The poverty line reflects
regional differences in the cost of living, and also accounts for inflation over the time of the survey. For a detailed description of the methodology adopted to
define the poverty line see CSO – World Bank (2011), Setting the official Poverty Line for Afghanistan, Mimeo.
9 92 percent of IDPs covered in the study come from a rural community of origin.

10 One in four households in the study has been displaced since before December 2002.

11 On average, IDP households have only 1.61 active members.
12 As an example, the share of households reporting access to housing as one of the three most important problems increases from 61 percent among families

settled for 1 year or less to 67 percent among those residing for more than 5 years. Similar trends are also reported for access to electricity (from 16 to 35
percent), access to land (from 8 to 17.2 percent) and sanitation (from 3 to 8 percent). The only exception to this trend relates to access to water which is
reported as one of the three major problems by 45 percent of families settled for 1 year or less and by 23 percent of those residing for more than 5 years.
