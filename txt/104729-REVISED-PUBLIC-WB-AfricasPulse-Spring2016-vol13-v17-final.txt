                         An analysis of issues shaping Africa’s economic future




                                  u	 Growth will remain lackluster in
                                      Sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, weighed
                                      down by low and volatile commodity
                                      prices.

                                  u	 Addressing growing economic
                                      vulnerabilities and developing new
                                      sources of sustainable, inclusive
                                      growth are key priorities for the
                                      region.

                                  u	 Africa’s rapid urbanization offers a
                                      potential springboard for economic
                                      diversification. But building cities
                                      that work will require reforming land
                                      markets and urban regulations, and
                                      coordinating early infrastructure
                                      investments.

               Summary
               u	Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa decelerated to an estimated 3.0 percent in 2015, from 4.5 percent
                   in 2014, driven by low commodity prices, weak global growth, rising borrowing costs, and
                   adverse domestic developments in many countries. The slowdown was especially sharp in the
                   region’s largest commodity exporters. But there were some bright spots, such as Côte d’Ivoire,
                   which continued to experience robust, broad-based growth, supported by rising investment, and
                   Kenya and Rwanda, where growth remained buoyant, helped by infrastructure spending, strong
                   consumer demand, and a growing services sector.
               u	Recent commodity price movements represent a deterioration in the region’s terms of trade in
                   2016 by an estimated 16 percent (first-order approximation), with commodity exporters, especially
                   oil exporters, seeing large terms-of-trade losses. For the region as a whole, it is estimated that
                   the impact of the terms-of-trade shock will lower the level of economic activity in 2016 by 0.5
                   percent from the baseline, and weaken the current account and fiscal balance by about 4 and 2
                   percentage points below the baseline, respectively.
               u	With commodity prices expected to remain low for longer amid a gradual pickup in global activity
                   and volatile financial market conditions, average growth in the region is projected to remain
                   subdued at 3.3 percent in 2016. For 2017–18, growth is projected to average 4.5 percent. The
                   projected pickup in activity in 2017–18 reflects a gradual improvement in the region’s largest
                   economies—Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa—as commodity prices stabilize and policies
                   become more supportive of growth.
               u	Nonetheless, risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, including a sharper than expected
                   slowdown in China, further decline in commodity prices, delays in implementing the necessary
                   adjustment to the export price shock in affected countries, worsening drought conditions, and
                   political and security uncertainties.
               u	As African countries move to rebuild momentum on growth, key policy challenges include
                   adjusting to a new, lower level of commodity prices; addressing economic vulnerabilities; and
                   developing new sources of sustainable, inclusive growth.
               u	The rapid decline in oil and commodity prices has signaled an urgent need for economic
                   diversification in Africa. Urbanization and well managed cities provide a major opportunity to offer
                   a springboard for diversification. But for urbanization to bring the benefits that it should, cities
                   must become less costly for firms and hence more appealing to investors; in addition, cities must
                   become kinder to their residents by offering services, amenities, and housing for the poor and the
                   middle class.
               u	To build cities that work—cities that are livable, connected, and affordable, and therefore
                   economically dense—policy makers will need to direct attention toward the deeper structural
                   problems that misallocate land, fragment development, and limit productivity. Local and national
                   governments are called to reform land markets and urban regulations—to enable investment and
                   development, reward compliance, and ensure enforcement—and coordinate early infrastructure
                   investments—increasing them is not enough.

GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS
The global economic environment facing Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) weakened significantly in 2015, with
commodity prices falling sharply. Global growth slowed further, from 2.6 percent in 2014 to 2.4 percent
in 2015. The slowing of growth in emerging market economies was an important contributing factor,
with output contracting in Brazil and the Russian Federation, and rebalancing leading to a deceleration
of growth in China. The deceleration of activity in emerging markets and developing economies
overshadowed a modest recovery in advanced economies (figure 1.1).

                      efforts to lift inflation. In Japan, the economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2015 and remained weak in
                      the first quarter of 2016, with activity continuing to slow in the manufacturing and services sectors. In China,
                      PMI data indicated some improvement in factory activity in March.

                      The weakness of commodity prices seen in 2015, especially energy, has persisted into early 2016.
                      Abundant supplies, weaker growth prospects in emerging economies, and a strong U.S. dollar resulted
                      in a sharp drop in commodity prices in 2015, with energy prices falling by 45 percent and non-
                      energy prices declining by 15 percent from the previous year. Oil prices rose from less than $30/bbl in
                      January 2016 to US$37/bbl during the first half of March on improved sentiment. Despite discussion
                      among producers to freeze output at the January levels, the price rally stalled as the market remained
                      oversupplied with large stocks, particularly in the United States. Metal prices have also risen from lows
                      in January, on expectations of firming demand and production cuts. However, the markets remain
                      oversupplied with large stocks and capacity continues to rise, especially for iron ore and copper.
                      Agricultural prices continued their downward trend in early 2016 due to ample supplies.

                      In addition to the fall in commodity prices, global merchandise trade was subdued in 2015, as import
                      demand fell in commodity-exporting countries, and weakened in China because of slowing activity
                      and economic rebalancing. International trade has been growing at a slower pace than in the 20 years
                      preceding the international financial crisis (figure 1.2). Globally, the annual growth in goods and services
                      import volumes has averaged 3 percent since 2012, compared with an average pace of 7 percent
                      between 1986 and 2007. The sluggish performance of trade in recent years can be explained by several
                      factors: among others, the slowing economic growth in low- and middle-income countries, uneven
                      recovery of high-income economies, exchange rate volatility with the strong appreciation of the U.S.
                      dollar, and the slump in commodity prices. The terms of trade of commodity exporters have deteriorated,
                      affecting their purchasing power to demand goods and services from the rest of the world. Another factor
                      contributing to the deceleration in international trade is the slower expansion in recent years of global
                      value chains, which played a significant role in accelerating global trade in the past decades. Although
                      services trade has shown more resilience than goods trade in recent years, supported by strengthening
                                                                                                                          consumer spending and rising

prices, rating downgrades, and concerns about rising borrowing costs hit emerging market assets.
Emerging market funds started 2016 with continued outflows, as risk aversion and growth concerns
intensified. Foreign direct investment (FDI) generally showed greater resilience in 2015.

In response to weak global growth prospects, softening inflation expectations, and financial market turmoil,
major central banks have maintained low rates or shifted toward further accommodation at their March rate-
setting meetings. The U.S. Federal Reserve left the target range of the federal funds rate unchanged at 0.25 to
0.5 percent, as expected, noting that parts of the U.S. economy softened toward the end of 2015 and at the
beginning of 2016. The European Central Bank cut Euro Area deposit rates by 10 basis points to -0.4 percent,
and announced new measures that include expanding the quantitative easing program. The Bank of Japan
left the policy interest rate at -0.1 percent, and the annual rate of quantitative easing unchanged. In this
environment, emerging market assets rallied, reversing the losses registered at the start of 2016.

Against this backdrop, global growth is projected to reach 2.5 percent in 2016, marginally higher than in
2015 as emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) commodity exporters continue to adjust to
low commodity prices. Global growth is projected to pick up to 2.9 percent in 2017 and 3.1 percent in
2018, largely reflecting a rebound in EMDEs. Growth in EMDEs is projected to rise to 4.6 percent in 2017–
18, driven by improvements in the large commodity exporters as commodity prices stabilize. Growth in
advanced economies is projected to remain low, averaging 2.0 percent annually in 2017–18.

Risks to the global outlook remain tilted to the downside. Although it is still a low-probability scenario,
a faster than expected slowdown in China combined with a more protracted deceleration in other
major emerging markets would weaken growth prospects across the developing world, including in
SSA, as China is a large export market for commodity-exporting countries in the region. A synchronous
slowdown in the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) could have more pronounced global
spillover effects if it is combined with financial stress. In a scenario where BRICS growth continues to be
downgraded as in previous years and emerging market bond spreads suddenly rise (by 100 basis points),
growth in other emerging and frontier markets could be curtailed by 1.3 to 1.5 percentage points in 2016.
Many emerging and developing countries have seen their fiscal and reserve buffers depleted in the post-
crisis period, reducing their ability to use countercyclical measures to support growth in a downturn.

Recent Developments
Economic activity in SSA slowed in 2015, with GDP growth averaging 3.0 percent, down from 4.5 percent
in 2014. The deceleration in growth was driven by low commodity prices, weak growth in major trading

of growth was last experienced by the region in 2009, following the global financial crisis, and contrasts
sharply with the robust 6.8 percent average annual growth in GDP that the region enjoyed in 2003-
08. The slowdown in growth implies that GDP per capita increased by less than 0.5 percent in 2015,
complicating the challenge of accelerating poverty reduction in the region.

The fall in commodity prices represented a significant shock for the region because of the large share of
commodities in exports: fuels, ore, and metals account for more than 60 percent of the region’s exports
compared with 16 percent for manufactured goods and 10 percent for agricultural products. Oil prices

                        have declined markedly, falling by about 67 percent, from US$108/barrel in June 2014 to US$38/barrel
                        by December 2015. Oil prices continued to fall at the start of 2016, and, despite a recent rebound, have
                        remained low because of strong supply conditions (figure 1.3). Prices of agricultural commodities and
                        metals declined as well, but at a slower pace than the price of oil. Among non-energy commodities, metal
                        prices sustained a steeper drop, driven by large declines in the prices of iron ore, platinum, and copper, due
                        in large part to weak global demand, especially from China and other large emerging market economies.

                        Going beyond the regional aggregate, there was considerable variation in growth performance across
                        countries. The impact of the decline in commodity prices has been most severe for oil exporters, in part
                        because oil prices fell the most. Average growth in oil-exporting countries is estimated to have slowed
                        from 5.4 percent in 2014 to 2.9 percent in 2015 (figure 1.4). In Nigeria, the region’s largest oil exporter,

output contracted by a fifth, as low
commodity prices led to the closure of iron ore mining operations.

In comparison, the slowdown has been less pronounced in most oil-importing countries. In Mozambique,
delayed investment in the liquefied natural gas sector as a result of weak commodity prices weighed on GDP
growth. In Uganda, a large depreciation of the currency spurred a tightening of monetary conditions that
dampened economic confidence and domestic demand. Nevertheless, compared with the SSA average,
growth has remained robust in these countries, helped in part by lower oil prices. Among net oil importers,
Ethiopia and Rwanda continued to post solid growth, supported by public infrastructure investment,
private consumption, and a growing services sector. Elsewhere, growth remained buoyant in Kenya, amid
improving economic stability; Tanzania registered strong growth, underpinned by expansion in construction
and services sectors. Despite terrorist attacks in some member countries (Burkina Faso, Mali), the West
African Economic and Monetary Union continued to experience strong growth in 2015, helped in part
by favorable agricultural developments. Côte d’Ivoire saw broad-based growth, supported by a favorable
policy environment, rising investment, and increased consumer spending. In Burundi, a severe political crisis
contributed to a contraction of output.

                       Amid the low commodity prices, capital flows to the region eased from their record level in 2014, led by
                       a decline in cross-border bank lending, as European banks have increasingly deleveraged and oriented
                       their lending activities toward developing Asia (figure 1.7). Eurobond issuance also softened. Sovereign
                       bond issuance in 2015 totaled US$9.2 billion, compared with US$12.9 billion in 2014. Several countries
                       tapped the international bond market in 2015, including maiden issuances from Angola and Cameroon.
                       However, reflecting in part expectations about the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike that materialized
                       toward the end of 2015, SSA Eurobond issuance became increasingly expensive. Yields were substantially
                       higher than in previous issuances, reaching 10.75 percent for Ghana (October 2015), above the 9.5 percent
                       obtained by Angola (November 2015). At the start of 2016, concerns about growth in China and emerging
                       markets more broadly, and monetary policy tightening in the United States led to a further tightening
                       of external financial conditions for emerging and developing economies, prompting many countries in

percent of GDP in 2014. On aggregate, external debt levels increased moderately in oil-exporting countries,
contained in part by Nigeria’s low level of public external debt. At the country level, Angola, Gabon, and the
Republic of Congo experienced a large increase in the external debt ratio. Other countries where external
debt levels rose significantly in 2015 include Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. Several of
these countries (Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia) have tapped the international bond market. The rising external
debt levels leave several countries (Malawi, Mozambique, and the Republic of Congo) vulnerable to the risk
that future currency depreciation could pressure debt servicing costs.

In many cases, the deterioration in the current account deficit led to falling reserves and substantial
currency depreciations (figure 1.9). Reserve levels fell across the region, most markedly among oil
exporters and in countries defending fixed exchange rates (Angola, Burundi, Nigeria, and Rwanda).
Most of the region’s currencies sustained large depreciations against the U.S. dollar. The Ghanaian
cedi, Mozambican metical, and Zambia kwacha, in particular, weakened considerably. Most currencies
stabilized during March 2016 as commodity prices rebounded. The pass-through of nominal exchange
rate depreciation, compounded by the impact of drought on the food supply and the removal of fuel
subsidies, contributed to a rise in inflation in several countries. Headline inflation increased sharply in
Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa, exceeding the central banks’ targets, and was in double digits in Ghana
and Zambia (figure 1.10). Core inflation also edged upward. However, in some oil-importing countries
(Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) inflation eased, reflecting strong external disinflationary pressures from
lower food and oil prices. In Kenya, inflation fell within the central bank’s target as the shilling stabilized.
Inflation has also remained low in the CFA franc zone countries where the currency has remained
relatively stable thanks to its peg to the euro.

Monetary authorities in countries with a flexible exchange rate regime responded to the pressures on
exchange rates by letting currencies depreciate more (Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda), and by
tightening monetary policy through an increase in reserve requirements and policy rates (South Africa
and Uganda) to contain inflationary pressures. South Africa’s central bank has hiked interest rates by a
cumulative 75 basis points since the start of the year, and a cumulative 1.25 percentage points since

                        weakened across the region. Oil exporters (Angola, Chad, Gabon, Nigeria, and the Republic of Congo)
                        faced a substantial decrease in revenues that put pressure on the overall fiscal balance. The fiscal policy
                        response to the revenue shortfalls has varied, highlighting the need for a medium-term strategy to deal
                        with the commodity price shock. Several countries cut expenditures in the face of declining revenues,
                        with the expenditure cuts matching the reduction in revenues in only a few countries. In other countries,
                        the government continued with its ambitious infrastructure investment program. For example, the
                        Republic of Congo tapped into its reserves at the BEAC (Banque des États de l’Afrique Centrale) and its
                        stabilization fund. Among oil exporters, fiscal deficits are estimated to have increased by an average of 1.5
                        percentage points of GDP in 2015 from their 2014 levels. Some large mineral exporters (such as Zambia)
                        also saw a sharp decline in revenues that was not met with a commensurate reduction in expenditure.
                        Expenditures rose in Zambia, resulting in a large fiscal deficit. In other non-resource-rich countries
                        (Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, and Tanzania), an expenditure overrun and shortfall in revenue (in
                        some cases grants) caused the fiscal deficit to widen.

Elevated or rising fiscal and current account deficits signal weaker policy frameworks in a number of
countries, constraining these countries’ policy response to a more difficult economic environment
(figure 1.12). The extent to which fiscal deficits are fueling current account deficits is examined in
box 1.1. The evidence suggests that countries in SSA face the challenge of balancing fiscal prudence as
their economies become more globally integrated (through trade openness).

As a result of the limited fiscal adjustment, public debt burdens have risen. Public debt rose marginally in
Nigeria in relation to GDP. However, some oil exporters (such as Angola, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo)
saw a large increase in their public debt/GDP ratio, exceeding 15 points in the case of Angola. The increase
in debt burdens was more moderate in non-energy mineral exporting countries, with the exceptions of
Niger, Sierra Leone, and
Zimbabwe, where the public             FIGURE 1.12: Policy Frameworks in SSA                                                                                                        Higher fiscal

Angola, which, coupled with currency depreciation, will weigh on consumers’ purchasing power. By
contrast, lower inflation in oil importers, owing in part to lower fuel prices, should continue to boost
consumer spending. However, food price inflation caused by ongoing droughts in several countries, high
unemployment as in South Africa, and the price level impact of currency depreciation, combined with
interest rate increases, could moderate these effects.

Gross fixed capital formation is expected to slow across the region, driven by weak investment growth
among oil exporters and large mineral exporters. China’s rebalancing, lower commodity prices, and
deteriorating growth prospects in many commodity exporters are expected to result in further declines
in FDI flows. Domestic policies also weigh on private investment. In Nigeria, the central bank’s foreign
exchange control measures are tightening credit conditions and curtailing private investment. In South
Africa, policy uncertainty and low business confidence could weigh on investment flows. By contrast,
in several low-income, non-oil commodity exporters, governments are expected to continue with their
public infrastructure investment program, drawing in part on public-private partnerships, donor aid, and,
in some cases, financing from Chinese entities. Some countries are also turning increasingly to domestic
borrowing through the issuance of treasury bills. Nevertheless, the pace of investment growth in low-
income countries is expected to slow somewhat. Already, countries, such as Mozambique, Tanzania, and
Uganda are experiencing delays in inward investment in their resource sectors, caused by the decline
in commodity prices. Moreover, the tightening of global financing conditions has prompted many
countries to delay tapping the international bond market.

The fiscal policy stance in commodity exporters is expected to remain tight in 2016 as commodity prices
remain low. But in some countries, further fiscal adjustment may be necessary unless commodity prices
pick up swiftly or external resources are available to smooth the adjustment. With fiscal deficits widening
across the region, other countries, including the low-income non-oil commodity exporters, are also
increasingly facing the need for fiscal consolidation to build buffers and resilience.

Net exports are expected to make a negative contribution to real GDP growth in the near term, despite
currency depreciations. Low commodity prices will depress export receipts, especially among oil
exporters, even as export volumes rise in some countries. The pull from advanced economies is expected
to remain modest, given their moderate prospects for medium-term growth. Among oil importers,
current account balances are expected to deteriorate in many countries on account of continued strong
import growth, driven by capital goods imports for infrastructure projects.

Against this backdrop, the region faces the following expectations:

 Activity is expected to remain weak in the region’s three largest economies in 2016. In Nigeria, foreign
u	
  exchange restrictions (if maintained) will continue to weigh on economic activity, exacerbating the effects
  of low commodity prices. In South Africa, the deterioration of the business environment will depress
  investment growth, while high unemployment and interest rate hikes will limit private consumption. In
  Angola, low oil prices, a weak investment climate, and rising inflation will weigh on real GDP growth.

 Among the region’s frontier markets, growth is expected to rise moderately in Ghana, driven by
u	
  improving investor sentiment, launching of new oilfields, and overcoming of the electricity crisis.

                    Real GDP growth is expected to remain subdued in Zambia, because of low copper prices and power
                    shortages, and as higher interest rates and food costs stemming from the weakening currency weigh
                    on private consumption. However, growth is expected to remain robust in Kenya, supported by
                    private consumption and public investment. In Côte d’Ivoire, improved investment climate and strong
                    domestic demand will help to keep growth high.

                 The outlook for the region’s low-income countries is expected to include a modest pickup in

                    Mozambique, delayed investment in the liquefied natural gas sector and rising inflation will weigh
                    on real GDP growth in 2016. Growth is also expected to slow in the Democratic Republic of Congo
                    as the copper sector continues to struggle and political uncertainty weighs on investor sentiment.
                    Post-Ebola recovery, aid-driven infrastructure investment and some limited growth in iron ore
                    exports should help boost activity in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. However, political and security
                    uncertainties are expected to remain a drag on economic growth in Burundi, Burkina Faso, Mali, and
                    Niger, and drought could adversely impact activity in Ethiopia. For most other countries, growth is
                    projected to remain robust, supported by domestic investment and lower oil prices.


                RISKS
                The balance of risks to the outlook remains tilted to the downside.

                 On the external front, a sharper than expected slowdown in China through the rebalancing of
                u	
                    growth toward consumption and services would lead to a further decline in commodity prices and
                    investments that could lead to a cancelation of planned investment projects in resource sectors, and
                    further weaken activity in commodity exporters. Weaker than expected growth in the Euro Area could
                    further weaken the external demand for exports, and reduce investment flows as well as official aid.
                    Tighter global financing conditions would result in higher borrowing costs that could affect the region
                    through higher risk premia and reduced sovereign bond access for emerging and frontier countries.

                 On the domestic front, delays in adjustment to external shocks in affected countries would create
                u	
                    policy uncertainties that could weigh on investor sentiment and weaken the recovery. A worsening
                    of drought conditions would dampen growth in agriculture, reduce hydroelectricity production,
                    and accentuate inflationary pressures. Boko Haram insurgencies and terrorist attacks remain a
                    concern in West Africa and Kenya, while the risks of political upheavals are substantial in Burundi
                    and South Sudan.


                POLICY CHALLENGES
                Commodity exporters across the region face a new, lower level of commodity prices to which they need
                to adjust. Furthermore, with commodity markets, and external conditions more generally, likely to be
                less supportive than in the past, the region will also need to focus on developing new sources of growth.
                Meanwhile, widening fiscal and current account deficits have increased economic vulnerabilities, which
                are reflected in depreciating currencies and rising inflation. This has prompted central banks in many
                cases to raise interest rates, even as the economy was slowing, further undermining growth. Responses
                to these challenges will vary, depending on country-specific conditions.

 For most countries in the region, the adjustment to the low commodity prices will need to include stronger
u	
  efforts to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, to reduce overdependence on revenue from the
  resource sector. In particular, resource-rich countries would benefit from improving their non-resource
  tax systems. Although tax revenues as a share of GDP have increased in SSA since the 1980s, much of the
  improvement was driven by growth in commodity revenues. Excluding resource-based revenues, there has
  been limited improvement in the domestic mobilization of tax revenues in the region. Stronger efforts to
  broaden the tax base and strengthen tax administration would help increase domestic revenue.

 Exchange rate flexibility could help the adjustment to the low commodity price environment. In
u	
  countries where exchange rates are flexible, policy makers may need to tighten their macroeconomic
  policy stances, and strengthen their monetary policy frameworks, to prevent inflation induced by
  currency depreciation from becoming a constant threat.

 The increased vulnerabilities across the region point to the need for greater efforts to build policy buffers
u	
  and resilience to external shocks. This will require measures to rationalize current expenditure, particularly
  the wage bill, and improve public financial management and the quality of spending. In oil-exporting
  countries, in particular, measures would be needed to increase public investment efficiency. Countries
  where a deeper and faster fiscal adjustment is required as a result of the commodity price shocks may face
  a difficult trade-off between boosting development spending and building buffers. In these countries,
  to the extent possible, fiscal adjustment should be designed to minimize the impact on growth and on
  vulnerable populations. In this context, provision of countercyclical financial support could help to build
  policy space for essential expenditures and ease adjustment.

 Accelerating the pace of structural reforms aimed at boosting competitiveness and diversification
u	
  will be critical for raising growth prospects and reducing extreme poverty (box 1.2). In most countries
  this will require greater efficiency of infrastructure investment, energy sector reforms, a more inclusive
  financial sector, and improvements in the business climate.


   The post-financial crisis period has seen an increase in the number of countries in the region with large        BOX 1.1:

   current account and fiscal deficits. For instance, 32 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) had current          in Sub-Saharan
   account deficits that exceeded 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014-15 (up from 25                  Africa

   in 2007-08). The number of countries in the region with large fiscal deficits (exceeding 5 percent of
   GDP) increased from two in 2007–08 to 15 in 2014–15. The evidence suggests that fiscal deficits are
   associated with a deterioration of the current account balance for SSA countries; consequently, SSA
   countries face the challenge to balance their fiscal prudence while opening up the domestic market
   to the world.

   Figure B1.1.1 plots the fiscal and current account balances in 2007–08 vis-à-vis those in 2014–15. It shows
   a deterioration of the current account and fiscal balances among SSA countries in the last two years
   compared with the pre-global financial crisis period. The current account balance deteriorated in 29 of 45
   countries in SSA in 2014–15 relative to 2007–08. Over the same time period, the fiscal balance deteriorated
   in 35 countries, with expenditure increases outpacing revenue improvements (figure B1.1.2). Overall,
   24 countries in the region experienced a deterioration in both the current account and the fiscal balance.

                no significant association
                between fiscal and current
                account deficits. Specifically, tax cuts financed by the issuance of new public debt lead forward-
                looking households to expect government’s future tax increases to repay the new debt (Barro 1974).
                Anticipating future tax increases, households will save all the resources freed by the tax cut. Hence,
                consumption, national saving, and the current account will remain unchanged.

                The Keynesian view states that government deficit shocks tend to crowd out private investment in
                the short run.a The endogenous response of the private sector to the fiscal shock does not completely
                compensate the effect of public dissaving. Consequently, fiscal deficits end up fueling current

account deficits. For example, a fiscal expansion financed by public debt issuances will increase                                                               BOX 1.1

private disposable income and private consumption, and lower national saving. This fiscal expansion
will crowd out private investment by lifting domestic interest rates; therefore, a decline in national
saving is matched by an increase in the current account deficit, thus leading to twin fiscal and current
account deficits.

The twin deficits hypothesis is examined for a sample of 47 SSA countries with annual information
from 1980 to 2015. Table B1.1.1 reports the results of regressing the current account balance (as
percentage of GDP) on the fiscal balance and other explanatory variables selected from the literature
(Bartolini and Lahiri 2006), namely, government consumption, public debt, trade openness, GDP
growth, and population growth. Table B1.1.1 (column [1]) reports a simple bivariate regression of
the current account balance on the fiscal balance that yields a positive and significant coefficient.
The regression confirms the hypothesis that fiscal deficits are associated with a deterioration of the
current account balance for SSA countries. The estimated coefficient suggests that if the fiscal balance
declines by 1 percent of GDP, the current account balance deteriorates by 0.16 percent of GDP. When
more control variables are included in the regression (column [2] in table B1.1.1), the estimated
coefficient of fiscal balance not only remains positive and significant, but also becomes larger than
that of the bivariate regression. It shows that a 1 percent of GDP deterioration in the fiscal balance is
associated with a 0.22 percent of GDP widening of the current account deficit.

BOX 1.1         show that fiscal deficits are more likely to be associated with current account deficits in countries with
Continued
                greater trade integration and lower public debt. The (partial degree of ) responsiveness of the current
                account deficit to fiscal deficits is about 1.43 for countries with low public debt (around 20 percent of
                GDP), and about 0.89 for countries with higher public debt (50 percent of GDP).

                Figure B1.1.3 shows the responsiveness of the current account deficit to movements in the fiscal deficit
                conditional on the degree of trade openness (panel a) and the level of government indebtedness
                (panel b), while keeping constant the other dimension (at its median level). The solid line represents
                the strength (or lack thereof ) of the twin deficits hypothesis, while the dotted lines capture the 90
                percent confidence interval. This response was evaluated at selected percentiles of the distribution
                of these two variables for SSA (5th, 10th, …, 90th, 95th). The figure shows that the nature of the
                relationship between the current account and the fiscal balance among countries in the region is
                consistent with that of the twin deficits hypothesis: (a) the relationship is stronger the greater is the
                degree of international trade integration, and (b) the relationship is stronger the lower is the level of
                general government gross debt (as a ratio to GDP).

                Figure B1.1.3, panel a, shows that for countries with very low levels of trade openness (below the 5th
                percentile—that is, exports and imports of about 25 percent of GDP), the relationship between the
                current account deficit and the fiscal deficit is negative and nonsignificant. For countries with trade
                openness of about 55 percent of GDP (that is, the 40th to 45th percentile), the relationship is positive
                and statistically significant, and the coefficient fluctuates between 0.4 and 0.45. For SSA countries with
                a high level of openness (say, the top quartile or real exports and imports that represent 90 percent of
                GDP), the coefficient is 0.8. This implies that a 1 percent of GDP increase in the fiscal deficit is associated
                with a 0.8 percent of GDP increase in the current account deficit for countries with high trade openness.

                Figure B1.1.3, panel b, indicates that for countries with very high levels of government indebtedness
                (above the 75th percentile—that is, public debt of about 98–100 percent of GDP), the relationship

      countries with low and middle levels of public indebtedness—such as general government gross
      debt of about 30 and 56 percent (the 25th and 50th percentiles, respectively)—there is a significant
      and positive relationship between the current account deficit and the fiscal deficit, with coefficients
      of 1.1 and 0.5, respectively. For instance, a 1 percent of GDP increase in the fiscal deficit is associated
      with a 0.5 percent of GDP increase in the current account deficit for countries with the median level
      of government indebtedness.

a.	 An output decline may generate a deeper fall in investment compared with the decline in national savings. This will improve the current account and lead to a phenomenon called
    “twin divergence” (Kim and Roubini 2008; Nickel and Vansteenkiste 2008).
b.	 Corsetti and Muller (2006) show that a fiscal deficit that results from a temporary increase in government spending may not be accompanied by a foreign trade deterioration if
    the economy is sufficiently closed. Accordingly, twin deficits are more likely to be observed if the economy is highly integrated in world goods markets. Nickel and Tudyka (2014)
    show that an increase in the budget deficit (or a decline in public savings) may be accompanied by lower private consumption (and higher savings) if private agents perceive an
    unsustainable fiscal stance. Consequently, households may observe higher taxes in the future as more likely to take place if the government’s indebtedness is high. If the public debt-
    to-GDP ratio is low, households may not put too much weight on future fiscal adjustments, and fiscal shocks will lead to a deterioration of the current account.

The global economy is more challenging, but opportunities to drive diversified growth through
exports are important for Africa. Falling demand in key markets, such as China, and the resulting
decline in commodity prices are undermining Africa’s immediate growth prospects. The dominant
commodity exports are sold on global exchanges and cannot be simply diverted to other markets.

Continued
                low production costs in manufacturing, and services to drive more inclusive export-led growth.a
                Integration into regional and global value chains offers a route for African firms and individual services
                providers to provide their goods and services to the global market. These opportunities are enhanced
                by the duty preferences that African producers can receive in key markets, such as the United States
                under African Growth and Opportunity Act, the European Union through Economic Partnership
                Agreements or Everything but Arms, China, and other African countries through regional agreements.

                High trade logistics costs and limited domestic competition undermine the ability of African
                entrepreneurs to exploit new export opportunities. Africa’s infrastructure constraint is beginning to
                be addressed, but trade logistics costs remain high relative to other regions. In some cases, such as
                apparel, trade preferences can offset these high costs and are allowing new exports to emerge.

                Maintaining a competitive exchange rate is essential, but reducing trade costs is necessary to scale
                up and sustain these new activities for long-term job creation and poverty reduction. Importing
                (materials, machinery, technology, knowledge, and skills) to export is indispensable to be able to
                enter modern value chains and diversify exports more broadly. Hence, attention must be given
                to reducing the costs to import as well as export by reducing those tariffs that remain relatively
                high, rationalizing procedures, including electronic submission of documents, disciplining the
                use of permits and licenses and other regulatory measures that create barriers to trade, improving
                access to trade-related information, and increasing coordination between agencies involved in the
                trade process. Competitive and efficient input and output markets are essential to support trade
                development, but African markets lack competition. The level of competition is lower in African
                countries than in competitors and in many cases a single firm accounts for more than 50 percent of
                the market in key sectors, such as trucking services and fertilizer distribution.

Section 2: Terms-of-Trade Shock and Impact
on Economic Performance in Sub-Saharan Africa

    The current oil price decline of about 70 percent since June 2014 is the largest 20-month price drop
   u	
        over the past half-century. In contrast to other episodes, the price decline has come along with falling
        prices of metals and minerals and agricultural commodities—although at a different pace.

    Recent commodity price changes represent a deterioration in the terms of trade of countries in
   u	
        Sub-Saharan Africa by an estimated 16 percent (first-order approximation). Terms-of-trade losses of
        commodity exporters tend to be larger than the gains by commodity importers. Oil-rich countries are
        hit the hardest.

    For the region as a whole, the level of economic activity is 0.5 percent lower than the baseline under a
   u	
        scenario of energy and non-energy commodity price changes. At the same time, the current account
        and fiscal balance are about 4 and 2 percentage points below the baseline, respectively.

    Falling oil prices are reducing cash flows from oil production, limiting oil companies’ investment in
   u	
        exploration and production. The falling prices are also reducing the value of the underlying assets
        that these companies use to back their rising liabilities. Most oil and gas development in Sub-
        Saharan Africa is extremely vulnerable to deferral at the current prices and given the tighter financial
        conditions facing oil companies.



DECLINE IN OIL PRICES: LOWER AND LONGER
Commodity prices have experienced sharp swings since the global financial crisis.1 More recently,
the world economy has experienced sharp declines in oil prices. The average international price for a
barrel of crude oil dropped significantly, from US$108 in June 2014 to about US$31 in February 2016.
Moreover, several commodity prices other than oil have also weakened over the past year; however,
the extent of their decline has been far from uniform (figure 1.3). For instance, the cumulative decline
in the prices of iron ore and nickel has been about 50 percent since June 2014, while that of wheat has
exceeded 40 percent.

The sharp drop in crude oil prices since June 2014 is not unprecedented. Four other episodes where the
cumulative price decline exceeded 40 percent can be identified from the data on 20-month variations
in the international price of crude oil, from November 1984 to February 2016 (table 2.1).2 Oil plunge
episodes that are mostly driven by demand shocks (1990–92, 1996–98, and 2008–10) have a cumulative
loss in the price of oil below 50 percent—as opposed to oil supply–driven events (1984–86 and 2014–
16) with a price decline that exceeds 65 percent over a 20-month window.


1	 After the sharp drop in the last quarter of 2008 and first half of 2009, ample policy stimulus in high-income countries and among large and dynamic emerging markets produced a post-
   crisis recovery in commodity prices.
2	 Baffes et al. (2015) undertook a similar approach. They identified episodes of sharp decline in oil prices by selecting seven-month periods where the cumulative drop in oil prices exceeded
   30 percent.

                MACROECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE OIL PRICE DECLINE
                Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), as a net exporter of commodities, is prone to drastic swings in their
                international prices, especially oil, iron ore, copper, gold, coffee, and cocoa, among others. The end
                of the commodity super cycle has led to a sharp reduction in export proceeds and volumes, and it is
                putting pressure on the currencies of commodity exporting countries in the region. Commodity-related
                revenues have also dropped considerably for the governments of countries that export energy and
                extractive commodities.

                The plunge in commodity prices will be a drag on growth in the region. Macroeconomic simulations
                suggest that the plunge in commodity prices would explain a reduction in the level of economic
                activity of the region for 2016 of about 0.2 to 0.5 percent below the baseline. However, the end of the
                commodity super cycle will hit resource abundant countries in the region harder—notably, oil abundant
                countries. Hedging against commodity price risks is at the forefront of the policy agenda, as oil prices
                have plunged since June 2014.


                Terms-of-Trade Effects 3
                Table 2.2 presents a first-order approximation of the terms-of-trade effects of recent fluctuations in
                commodity prices.4 The price shock used to simulate the terms-of-trade effects among the countries in
                SSA is the percentage change in the 2016 average price of each of the commodities under analysis, as
                predicted by World Bank in 2015 Q3 and 2016 Q1.5 Box 2.1 reports the assumptions about the changes
                in commodity prices. For instance, the average price of crude oil in 2016 was forecasted at US$61.3 per
                barrel in 2015 Q3 and US$37 per dollar in 2016 Q1. This implies a downward revision of the international
                price of oil of about 40 percent. The approach followed here to compute the terms-of-trade effects may
                underestimate the net trade benefits resulting from price changes, as export supply and import demand
                may adjust to the new relative prices and exchange rates in a welfare-improving fashion. Hence, the

                3	 This section updates the findings in Africa’s Pulse Volume 11 (World Bank 2015).
                4	 The calculations in table 2.2 involve a sample of 48 SSA countries and a basket of 37 commodities, including energy commodities (crude oil, natural gas, and coal), metals and minerals
                   (including precious metals), and agricultural commodities (food, beverages, and raw materials). The choice of commodities reflects their presence in the commodity basket among
                   countries in the region as well as the existence of liquid markets that allow for the identification of a clear international price.
                5	 The commodity basket for a few African countries might be underrepresented because of price data limitations. Among the commodities with missing (or lack of international) prices
                   are diamonds (with a great participation in the export basket of Botswana, Central African Republic, Namibia, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo), uranium (Niger and
                   Namibia), cloves (Comoros and Tanzania), fish (Cabo Verde and Seychelles), and bauxite (Guinea).

(15.98 percent).

Terms-of-trade changes are different across countries in the region and their direction depends
on the pattern of trade. Countries exporting energy commodities (crude oil, natural gas, and coal)
display the largest terms-of-trade deterioration (about 33 percent), while agricultural commodity
exporting countries register a terms-of-trade improvement of about 1 percent. For the latter group, the
weakening of their agricultural prices was more than offset by their gains from the lower prices of their
fuel imports. Metals and minerals exporters show a modest terms of trade loss of 6 percent. Again, the
weakening of their corresponding metals and minerals prices (about 7 percent) is softened by lower
energy prices. The data seem to corroborate the fact that many agricultural exporters, as well as metals
and minerals exporters, are net oil importers in SSA. Looking at groups of countries that have risks other
than (or including) commodity price risks, the terms of trade of fragile and conflict-affected states is
expected to deteriorate by 8 percent, whereas that of heavily indebted poor countries is expected to
deteriorate by about 4 percent. In both groups, the main driver of the deterioration of the terms of
trade is the adverse impact of the price of energy commodities—notably, oil and natural gas—whose
contribution exceeds 90 percent of the total terms-of-trade effect.

Table 2.2 shows that the terms of trade of the region as a whole deteriorates with the downward revision
of commodity prices for 2016; however, there is a great degree of cross-country heterogeneity. Figure 2.1

6	 There are other caveats to this initial approximation of the terms-of-trade effects of commodity prices. First, the trade structure considered in the assessment of the terms-of-trade effects was
   computed over the period 2011–13. However, extraction from recent discoveries of nonrenewable resources may change these structures over time. For instance, in 2013 tungsten became
   the major commodity export of Rwanda. Second, the calculation of the terms-of-trade effect involves average prices in international markets. As they are considered for a broad group of
   countries, these prices may not necessarily match those received by the country. For instance, there are some discrepancies in the variation of Kolkata and Mombasa tea prices. Third, the
   price change used is the expected percentage variation in the international price of each commodity for 2015, that is, the price predicted for 2015 compared with the actual price for 2014.
   This forecast might differ from actual year-on-year or year-to-date changes in commodity prices up to March 2015. Fourth, sharp declines in commodity prices may not be distinguished from
   more secular downward trends if the time horizon over which the price change is longer. Calculating the average annual variation in commodity prices over three- or four-year periods will
   conceal the sharp decline in oil prices over the past nine months. Finally, the basket of commodities excludes those goods where some form of processing has been undertaken and, hence,
   that are classified as manufacturing goods. For instance, the calculation excludes exports of aluminum bars in Mozambique, refined copper in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia,
   as well as exports or imports of refined petroleum in some African countries.

                         terms of trade as a result of commodity price shocks.                                                                                            basket). According to

                         losses in the terms of trade across countries in the region is asymmetric. For instance, terms-of-trade losers
                         (31 out of 48 SSA countries) are predicted to have an average loss of about 17 percent. These countries
                         represent 63 percent of the region Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and about 74 percent of its population.
                         The terms-of-trade gainers, by contrast, only registered a meager increase of about 1 percent.

                         The group of vulnerable countries consists of 12 countries with terms-of-trade losses that are expected
                         to exceed 10 percent. The countries house nearly 36 percent of the region’s population and represent
                         about half of its economic activity. For most of the countries in this group, lower energy prices are
                         the culprit of their adverse terms-of-trade effect. Seven countries in this group are oil-rich countries,
                         namely, Angola, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo, and South Sudan.
                         The Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea have also been affected by lower oil prices, although
                         natural gas also played a significant role in the former. For the rest of the countries in this group (Liberia,
                         Mauritania, and Sierra Leone), weaker iron ore prices help explain the terms-of-trade deterioration—a
                         pronounced decline in rubber prices also played a role in the case of Liberia.

The group of less vulnerable countries is formed by 19 countries that registered terms-of-trade losses that
did not exceed 10 percent. The group represents more than 15 percent of the region’s GDP and about
40 percent of its population. Weaker prices of metals and minerals and agricultural commodities play
a more important role in this group. For instance, not only oil but also gold prices contributed to the
deterioration of the terms of trade in Ghana (9 percent). Weaker gold prices primarily drove the adverse
terms-of-trade effect in Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Somalia, and Tanzania. Lower coffee prices help explain
the deterioration in Burundi, Ethiopia, and Rwanda.

The group of terms of trade gainers comprises 17 countries with terms-of-trade gains. More than 25
percent of SSA’s population lives in this group of countries, which produces about 36 percent of the
region’s GDP. The magnitude of the terms-of-trade gains is considerably smaller than the losses in the
vulnerable countries: they fluctuate between 0.1 percent (Lesotho) and 7.8 percent (Eritrea). The majority
of countries in this group benefited from cheaper energy prices; however, these gains were partly
offset by decreased prices for in non-energy commodities in some countries. For instance, gains from
lower oil prices in Botswana and South Africa were partly offset by weaker prices of iron ore and nickel,
respectively.

Finally, the value of commodity production for the vulnerable countries is expected to decline in 2016,
and this will have direct growth effects. The impact on growth will be magnified by second-run effects
associated with lower investment in resource-based activities and reduced expenditure by income
earners in these industries. The currency depreciation that ensues from the lower commodity prices
might boost growth in non-resource-based activities; however, the negative effect may dominate.


Macroeconomic Impacts
Swings in commodity prices will have an impact on economic activity in SSA countries. The extent of
this impact will depend on whether the country is a commodity importer or a commodity exporter.
For instance, lower export proceeds and government revenues as a result of a decline in oil prices will
explain the deterioration of the current account balance and the fiscal balance of oil exporting nations
as well as their level of economic activity.

To assess the macroeconomic impact of changes in commodity prices, two different scenarios are
considered: scenario 1 where only the price of oil changes, and scenario 2 where all commodity prices
change simultaneously. The simulations are undertaken using a global macroeconomic model, an
integrated version of the iSim country models.7 This model endogenizes the global link variables, which
are designed to capture the second round or repercussion effects, namely, the effects of the export
market, effective exchange rates, and global commodity prices.

Under scenario 1 (only the price of oil changes), the 2016 level of GDP for the SSA region is projected
to be 0.7 percent below the baseline. It can be inferred that the cost for oil exporting countries in the
region far exceeds the benefits for the oil importing countries.8 A downward revision in the terms of
trade and an expected depreciation of the exchange rate for 2016 results in nominal GDP that is about

                       3.8 percent below the baseline.9 The plunge in oil prices also predicts current account and fiscal balances
                       for 2016 that are about 1.9 and 1.7 percentage points lower than the baseline, respectively.

                       Under scenario 2 all commodity prices change. In the case of SSA, the changes in commodity prices
                       (energy, agriculture, and metals) lead to a lower level of real GDP by about 0.8 percent. Including
                       changes in relative prices, the level of nominal GDP is about 4.1 percentage points lower. However, the
                       losses of commodity dependent nations in the region (in export basket and government revenues)
                       tend to offset the potential gains of commodity importers. The current account and fiscal balance in the
                       region deteriorate by about 2 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively, relative to the baseline.

                       These findings show that the impact of changes in commodity prices can be different across countries—
                       say, oil exporters vis-à-vis oil importers. Hence, it is expected that these effects may be different across
                       countries in SSA. Figures 2.2 through 2.4 plot the impact on real GDP, the current account balance,
                       and the fiscal balance for SSA countries of commodity price changes under scenario 1 (only oil price
                       changes) and scenario 2 (all commodities). Figure 2.2 plots the real GDP response to changes in
                       commodity prices: oil abundant countries exhibit the largest declines in real economic activity (Angola,
                       Gabon, and Nigeria), while the decline in Mozambique is attributed not only to the plunge in crude oil,
                       but also in the price of aluminum. The level of GDP of most of the African countries in 2016 under both
                       scenarios is about 0.2–0.5 percent below the baseline. In the case of South Africa, the gains from the
                       plunge in oil prices are partly offset by lower prices of metals and minerals (such as iron ore and gold).
                       Still, South Africa’s GDP for 2016 is 0.2 percent above the baseline under scenario 2. Finally, the countries
                       with the largest gains from commodity price changes are Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal (about 0.3 and 0.5
                       percent above the baseline, respectively). Finally, the distribution of gains and losses in real economic
                       activity is uneven: losses are considerably larger than benefits.

                       Figures 2.3 and 2.4 depict the responses of the current account balance and the fiscal balance,
                       respectively. Again, the oil abundant countries (Angola, Gabon, and Nigeria) are among the countries

Are Impacting the
Investment Decisions
of Oil Companies
Falling oil prices are putting a strain on the balance sheets of highly-leveraged oil companies.10 The
declining international price of oil is not only reducing firms’ profits, it is also having a negative impact
on the value of their assets. Since June 2014, investors have lost more than US$150 billion in the value of
the 1,278 actively traded (oil and gas company) bonds in global markets. Furthermore, the stock market
value of the 300 largest oil and gas companies has declined by about US$2.3 trillion since June 2014—
about 40 percent in terms of lost value.11

These developments have led to rising financial strain and downsizing among oil and gas companies.
Financing costs are increasing as spreads on high-yield energy bonds have sharply increased from 330

10	 An environment that combined high oil prices with a zero interest rate policy and unconventional liquidity measures by the monetary authorities of high-income economies created the
    incentives for investors to search for yields, thus shifting their portfolios to riskier assets. In this context, the rapid expansion of exploration and production activities among oil and energy
    companies was fueled by a sharp increase in their leverage.

                flow from production (as a result of falling oil prices) is raising the risk of illiquidity, and may render some
                energy companies unable to meet their financial obligations. To meet their debt payments, oil and gas
                companies are increasing their production levels, even as the international price of oil continues sliding.

                Falling oil prices and high leverage among firms in the industry may restrict the ability to finance
                ongoing and prospective investments. It is more likely that capital expenditure may fall at a faster place
                for companies with large financial obligations and reduced cash flow from current and future sales.
                Several companies have announced or are already cutting capital expenditure at rates between 30 and
                50 percent.

                oil for 2016 has experienced a downward revision, from US$61.3 per barrel for 2015 Q3 to US$37 per

Can African Cities Deliver on the Promise of Growth?1

    As Africa undergoes rapid urban growth, there is a narrow window of opportunity to harness the
   u	
       potential of cities as engines of economic growth. The rapid decline in oil and commodity prices has
       adversely affected resource-rich countries and signaled an urgent need for economic diversification
       in Africa. Urbanization and well managed cities provide a major opportunity to offer a springboard
       for diversification. Although it is not possible to predict the specific sector opportunities for
       diversification, the investments chosen need to be generic, supporting many specific activities. Cities
       are just such generic capital: virtually whatever niches prove to be viable, they will take place in cities,
       and their success will require that cities work efficiently.

    The growth of cities, when well managed, can spur economic growth and productivity in two ways.
   u	
       One, by boosting incentives for investment through higher economic density and proximity—to
       support clusters of firms, and to connect workers with firms more efficiently. Two, by making cities
       more livable for poor and middle-class residents, through access to services, amenities, and housing.
       Through both channels, a successfully developed city offers firms the incentives of agglomeration and
       high returns on investment (largely by keeping a rein on workers’ living costs).

    In contrast to these known features of well-developed cities, Africa’s cities today are predominantly
   u	
       local: they lack a regional or global reach. That is because they have been on a different development
       trajectory—one that poses excessive costs to residents and firms. Recent research by the World Bank
       on the spatial development of African cities2 shows that cities in Africa today cannot be characterized
       as economically dense, connected, and livable. Instead, they are crowded, disconnected, and costly for
       households and firms.

    African cities can easily support only small and local businesses, usually offering nontradable products
   u	
       and services. The underlying challenge facing these cities is found in constraints on the functioning
       of key factor markets. Essential structures for urban economic density and expansion into global
       markets are lacking or inadequate. Specifically, the typical African city lacks the structures of human,
       institutional, and productive capacity that well-developed cities take for granted. In particular,
       economic density cannot rise until authorities take decisive action to strengthen institutions
       governing the transfer, valuation, and use of land. In addition, Africa’s cities lacked policy coordination
       needed for well-conceived infrastructure based on early, integrated planning and investment. Such
       coordination is all the more urgently needed because levels of capital investment have lagged behind
       the pace of urban growth, as Africa urbanizes at lower incomes than those of other developing
       economies.

                    To build cities that work—cities that are livable, connected, and affordable, and therefore
                   u	
                        economically dense—policy makers will need to direct attention toward the deeper structural
                        problems that misallocate land, fragment development, and limit productivity. Local and national
                        governments are called to reform land markets and urban regulations, and coordinate early
                        infrastructure investments. At the heart of these efforts is a key principle: common knowledge. Only with
                        common knowledge can all parties anticipate the results of their actions and the likely returns on their
                        investment.

                    Successful urbanization will also support Africa’s agricultural and rural transformation by effectively
                   u	
                        absorbing the labor being released by these sectors, providing a market for agricultural produce, and
                        financing further transformation and commercialization. If managed well, urbanization will not be a
                        sub-plot, but rather the main policy narrative for Africa’s development.




                Introduction
                Urbanization is a source of dynamism that can enhance productivity and increase economic
                integration—a principle evident from the experience of today’s high-income countries and rapidly
                emerging economies. Indeed, during the Industrial Age, no country has achieved sustained increases in
                national income without urbanization.

                If well managed, cities can help countries accelerate growth and “open the doors” to global markets
                in two ways:

                 By creating productive environments that attract international investment and increase economic
                u	
                     efficiency

                 By creating livable environments that prevent urban costs from rising excessively with increased
                u	
                     densification.

                By generating agglomeration economies, cities can enhance productivity and spur innovation and
                national economic diversification. The underlying reason for this is economic density.

                The simplest case of agglomeration economies through economic density is the reduction of transport
                costs for goods. If a supplier locates near customers, shipping costs decline.3 Many agglomeration
                benefits increase with scale. Towns and small cities cannot generate the same productive advantages as
                larger cities. International evidence reveals that the elasticity of income with respect to city population is
                between 3 and 8 percent (Rosenthal and Strange 2004). Each doubling of city size increases productivity
                by 5 percent.

                Productivity gains are closely linked to urbanization through their ties to structural transformation and
                industrialization. As countries urbanize, workers move from rural to urban areas in search of better paid

                3	 In the early 1900s, London and New York were manufacturing powerhouses because factories located there to be close to customers and transport infrastructure. In the late nineteenth
                   century, four-fifths of Chicago’s jobs were compactly located within four miles of State and Madison Streets, close to where people lived and infrastructure was located (Grover and Lall 2015).

and more productive jobs. Similarly, entrepreneurs locate their firms in cities where agglomeration
economies will increase their productivity. Close spatial proximity has many benefits. Certain public
goods—like infrastructure and basic services—are cheaper to provide when populations are large and
densely packed together. Firms located near each other can share suppliers, lowering input costs. Thick
labor markets reduce search costs, as firms have a larger pool of workers to choose from whenever they
need to hire additional labor. And spatial proximity makes it easier for workers to share information and
learn from each other. International evidence shows that knowledge spillovers play a key role in boosting
the productivity of successful cities.

Given these potential economic benefits of cities, it is not surprising that urbanization and economic
development go hand in hand. The evidence from China, the Republic of Korea, and Vietnam in East
Asia clearly highlights the close association between episodes of rapid urbanization and economic
development. Unfortunately, these links appear to be weak in Africa (figure 3.1). African cities are
not delivering agglomeration economies or reaping urban productivity benefits. Instead they suffer
from high food, housing, and transport costs. These high costs arise from coordination failures,
poorly designed policies, weak property rights, and other factors that lower economic density. As a
consequence, African cities lack the scale economies associated with tradable activity. Potential investors
and entrepreneurs are faced with low expectations for the scale of urban production and for the size
of any return on investment. Although low expected scale and returns are not the only ways in which
low expectations harm Africa’s cities (box 3.1), such pessimism points to high urban costs as a central
development challenge. These costs lock firms into producing nontradable goods and services—
keeping the cities out of global markets, and restricting them instead to the provision of products for
local hinterland consumption.

                  wage would the urban cost curve be flatter then City N would be able to break into global markets and
                  compete with international firms.



                  Strengthening the link between urbanization and economic development in Africa is particularly urgent
                  to manage two regional “megatrends”:

                   Rapid urban growth. Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are quickly gaining in population. Urban areas
                  u	
                      in Africa contain 472 million people. That number will double over the next 25 years. The largest cities
                      grow as fast as 4 percent annually. Productive jobs, affordable housing, and efficient infrastructure will
                      be urgently needed for residents and newcomers alike.

                   Rapid decline in oil and commodity prices, highlighting the urgency for economic diversification.
                  u	
                      Although it is not possible to predict the specific sector opportunities for diversification, the
                      investments chosen need to be generic, supporting many specific activities. Cities are just such
                      generic capital: virtually whatever niches prove to be viable will take place in cities, and their success
                      will require that cities work efficiently. For example, in Nigeria, the triple impact—of a long-term drop
                      in oil prices, low levels of non-oil-based internally generated revenues,4 and a growing infrastructure
                      deficit—poses an increasingly urgent investment challenge.

There are two key sets of challenges that need to be successfully resolved to strengthen the links
between urbanization and economic transformation in Africa:

 Enable the functioning of key factor and product markets alongside effectively regulating market distortions.
u	

   —	 Institutions governing the transfer, valuation, and use of land are central for building economic
      density and enabling Africa’s cities to support dense clusters of firms and be nimble in responding
      to changing economic circumstances.
   —	 Institutions managing the movement of people and products between rural and urban areas and
      between cities can support an integrated network of settlements.
 Coordinate and scale up investments in urban infrastructure (transport, communications, and basic
u	
  services), which are grossly inadequate and insufficiently aligned with plans for housing and
  investment in commercial and industrial structures.

Delays in addressing these challenges will lock African cities into development paths where the
agglomeration benefits from economic density, thick labor markets, and livable urban environments will
not be realized. In contrast, African cities will follow their current path of being crowded, disconnected,
and costly:

 Crowded, not economically dense—lacking structures for residents who live in unplanned downtown
u	
  settlements amid a lack of formal, affordable housing.

 Disconnected, developing as a collection of small, fragmented, and disconnected neighborhoods,
u	
  towns, and cities.

 Costly for households and firms, leading to their avoidance by regional and global investors and
u	
  potential trading partners.

The physically unstructured appearance of African cities, seen from the ground, reflects underlying
distortions in the functioning of key factor and product markets, and lack of crucial infrastructure,
housing, and commercial structures. The effects include scattered firms, failure of labor market pooling,
limited specialization across settlements, and a practical restriction to nontradable as opposed to
tradable activity. Further, the cities’ evident disarray keeps them in a second low-expectations trap: that
of underinvestment in their urban form (box 3.2).

The growth of cities will be central to development in Africa as elsewhere. But for urbanization to
bring the benefits that it should, cities will need to offer incentives to investors through agglomeration
and higher productivity. Cities also must become more livable for their residents by offering services,
amenities, and housing for the poor and the middle class. Mayors and ministries will need to resolve
structural problems that misallocate land and labor, fragment development, and limit productivity.
Starting with reforms to land markets and regulations, while increasing and coordinating early
infrastructure investments, African governments can build cities that work. Successful urbanization
will also support Africa’s agricultural and rural transformation by effectively absorbing the labor
being released by these sectors, providing a market for agricultural produce, and financing further
transformation and commercialization.

BOX 3.2: Low       A major constraint on Africa’s urban development has been the high cost of doing business in African cities.
Expectations
                   This costliness lowers expected returns for investors and entrepreneurs. But not all of the low expectations
for Urban Form
and Function:      that limit urban development arise directly from the cost of doing business. Others can arise from a city’s

Circle of Costly   people—from each other, from their jobs, and from regional and global markets.
and Unlivable
Cities             The role of these wider expectations in urban development underlies a theoretical model, developed by
                   Anthony Venables (Oxford University) and J. Vernon Henderson (London School of Economics), which looks
                   at the links between a city’s form and function. Specifically, the model relates a city’s built fabric, which
                   shapes rental and commuting costs, to its mix of productive activities, which determines urban wages,
                   productivity, and labor demand.

                   In the Venables-Henderson model, changes in a city’s physical environment largely follow the size and
                   frequency of investments in its durable structures. But these investments depend, in turn, on investors’
                   expectations about future urban growth. Thus, a circular problem arises. The future efficiency of a
                   city’s economy—which will influence future income and rent levels—is determined partly by property
                   developers’ investment decisions; and these decisions are unlikely to be optimal until large numbers of
                   developers expect future efficiency to be achieved.

                   In Africa, this circle of investments and expectations has become a vicious one. Because developers have
                   low expectations, African cities are built at low density and without coordination among governments and
                   firms—coordination that is necessary for early and effective infrastructure investment. As a result, costs are
                   higher. And the steeper is the urban cost curve, the higher is the nominal wage that must be paid to cover
                   the high cost of living for workers (see box 3.1). So cities fail to achieve agglomeration economies, and
                   businesses do not scale up. But this very fact keeps investors’ expectations depressed, trapping the cities in
                   a low-expectations equilibrium.

                   Crowded, Disconnected, Costly:
                   The Urbanization of People without Capital
                   Typical African cities share three features that constrain urban development and create daily challenges
                   for residents: they are crowded, disconnected, and costly. These features of Africa’s cities appear in
                   economic data and in evidence of urban land use from satellite imagery—while an ordinary visitor
                   can also observe them from the ground. Together they illustrate a central challenge: in Africa, the
                   urbanization of capital lags far behind that of people.


                   CROWDED CITIES
                   In principle, urbanization should benefit people and businesses through increased economic density. A
                   worker in an economically dense area can commute more easily and consume more diverse products.
                   Firms clustered in cities should be able to access a wider market of inputs and buyers—and scale
                   economies should reduce firms’ production costs, in turn benefiting consumers. Further, population
                   density is generally and strongly correlated with indicators of livability: a pattern that holds in Africa as
                   elsewhere (Gollin, Kirchberger, and Lagakos 2015).

Yet Africa’s cities are not economically dense or efficient. Instead, they are crowded and unlivable. A
majority of urban residents live in packed, informal settlements with inadequate infrastructure or access
to basic services. Two in three people in Lagos, Nigeria, dwell in slums (World Bank 2015a). Although
households in densely populated areas in Africa are better off than rural households in accessing
services, the mere fact of population density does not guarantee a livable environment.

Why should a majority of people in Africa’s cities live in slums? The immediate explanation is that
the urbanization of people is not accompanied by the urbanization of capital (box 3.3). Housing,
infrastructure, and other capital investments are lacking. Across SSA, housing investment lags
urbanization by nine years (Dasgupta, Lall, and Lozano-Gracia 2014).



   Capital investment in Africa has remained relatively low for the past 40 years, at around 20 percent of gross                                        BOX 3.3:

   China’s capital investment (infrastructure, housing, and office buildings) rose from 35 to 48 percent of GDP,                                        African Cities

   while the urban share of its population rose from 18 to 52 percent between 1978 and 2012. In East Asia as a                                          of Rapid Urban
   whole, capital investment remained above 40 percent of GDP at the end of this period.                                                                Growth

   Housing investment in Africa has also lagged behind that in other low- and middle-income economies.
   Between 2001 and 2011, African low-income countries invested 4.9 percent of GDP in housing,
   compared with 5.5 percent elsewhere; and African middle-income countries invested 6.5 percent of
   GDP in housing, compared with 9 percent elsewhere (Dasgupta, Lall, and Lozano-Gracia 2014).

   These figures underline the fact that Africa is urbanizing while poor—indeed, strikingly poorer than
   other developing regions with
   similar urbanization levels. In                  FIGURE B3.3.1: Africa’s Urbanization at Lower Income Levels

                          Because cities lack adequate formal housing within reach of jobs and transport systems to connect
                          people who live farther away, people forgo services and amenities to live in cramped quarters near
                          downtown districts. Areas such as Kibera, in Nairobi, and Tandale, in Dar es Salaam, are constantly
                          growing because—although informal—they are relatively central. They also make for crowded cities.
                          Throughout Dar es Salaam, 28 percent of residents are living at least three to a room; in Abidjan, it is a full
                          50 percent (World Bank 2015).

                          Related to the predominance of informal housing near African city centers is their relative lack of
                          built-up area. For example, in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Maputo, Mozambique, more than 30 percent of
                          land within five kilometers of the central business district remains unbuilt. The land near the core in
                          African cities is not left unbuilt by design, unlike in well-developed downtowns, such as Paris, where
                          14 percent of downtown land is not built up by design (to reserve green space to make densely
                          populated districts more livable). Instead, outdated, poorly enforced city plans and dysfunctional
                          property markets create inefficient land use patterns that no one intended: the downtown lacks
                          structures, yet it is crowded.

                          Analysis of imagery from satellites and geographic information systems confirms that in African
                          cities, capital investment not only appears low near the urban core, but also rapidly declines outside
                          it. A strong contrast emerges between patterns of downtown population density—in which Africa
                          resembles other regions (figure 3.2; Johannesburg and Lagos are exceptions)—and economic density,
                          reflected in indicators of capital investment visible from above (figure 3.3). In figure 3.3, cities with
                          higher economic density and slower economic density drop-offs—reflecting systematically high urban
                          capital investment—should cluster in the lower right quadrant. But African cities cluster in the upper
                          left quadrant: their economic densities are low, with rapid drop-offs outside the city center. Africa’s cities
                          have low peak economic densities and a small economic reach.

                              Africa’s generally low levels of urban capital investment also appear in the assessed worth of building
                          stock. For example, the total economic value of buildings in Dar es Salaam is estimated at around US$12

billion (Ishizawa and Gunasekara 2016). That is just less than three times the city’s share of gross domestic
product (GDP).5 Even lower are the estimated values for Nairobi, Kenya (US$9 billion) and Kigali, Rwanda
(US$2 billion). Compared with cities in Central America, African cities have low replacement values for
their built-up area, built floor area, and population. For instance, Nairobi has the highest replacement
value per square kilometer among the four African cities studied, yet it is just 60 percent of the value of
Tegucigalpa, which has the lowest among six Central American cities. The capital investment shortfall
appears in all building types, but it is most severe in housing: in Nairobi, commercial and industrial
structures explain 55 percent of the total value of building stock, although these structures occupy just 4
percent of the city’s area. Residential development is urgently lacking.

Well-developed cities are productive, and their inhabitants are economically better off. The reason is not
their high population density. Rather, it is their high economic density: labor and capital are geographically
concentrated. The low economic density of Africa’s cities makes them crowded—and less productive than
they should be, as their lack of capital makes them inefficient and keeps their economies local.


DISCONNECTED CITIES
Even as Africa’s cities are crowded—dense with inhabitants, but not capital—they are also physically
dispersed. They develop as collections of small, scattered neighborhoods. Without adequate roads or
transport systems, commuting is slow and costly, so workers lack access to jobs in the larger urban area.
Generally, people and firms are disconnected from each other and from economic opportunity.

The lack of connections among neighborhoods means that African cities, compared with developed
and developing cities in other regions, exhibit lower exposure and higher fragmentation in the intensity of
daytime land use near the city center.

 Low exposure means that people are disconnected from each other. At a set distance (usually 10
u	
     kilometers), they cannot interact with as many people as in a city with higher exposure.

 High fragmentation means that within a specified area, population varies widely, with scattered
u	
     peaks rather than the clustered ones that could enhance scale economies. Fragmentation increases
     infrastructure costs, and it lengthens travel times between homes, job sites, and businesses.

According to a new study of 265 cities in 70 countries that controls for total population and per capita
GDP, exposure near the center during daytime hours is about 40 percent lower in African cities than in
Asian and Latin American ones (Henderson and Nigmatulina forthcoming). In addition, African cities are
20 percent more fragmented: an example is the contrast between Nairobi, Kenya, and Pune, India
(figure 3.4).6

One pattern that explains the low exposure and high fragmentation of African cities is their relative lack
of new development near the center. New construction is not located in areas that would make capital

   of variation of density among the 8% pixels closer to the city center.

                        more concentrated and increase economic density. Instead, it tends to push the boundaries of the city
                        outward. Urban development can occur in three ways: expansion, leapfrog, and infill:

                         Expansion development occurs at the edge of the consolidated urban area, enlarging a city’s footprint.

                            development.

                         Infill development is new development on unbuilt parcels within a city’s denser, more central area.
                        u	

                        Among these three types of new development, infill does the most to increase exposure, or connections
                        among people: it defragments the city. According to our analysis of satellite images for 21 African cities
                        over 2000–10, between 46 and 77 percent of new development was expansion, with typically much less
                        infill. An even greater concern is the large number of leapfrog patches now appearing outside various
                        cities. In Bamako and Maputo, patches of leapfrog development account for more than half of the total
                        new patches over 2000–10; in many other cities, this share approaches or exceeds 40 percent (figure
                        3.5). The patches often being small scale, their isolation from existing development will undermine
                        city governments’ efforts to provide the networked services that require scale economies—and that
                        undergird urban productivity.

                        The prevalence of expansion and particularly leapfrog development is just one pattern that makes urban
                        commuting challenging in African cities; another is deficient transport infrastructure. Traffic congestion
                        cripples the economy in cities such as Nairobi, where the average journey-to-work time is one of the
                        world’s longest among 15 cities (IBM 2011). Part of the reason for long commuting times is that a large
                        share of commuting is done on foot: in Nairobi, about 41 percent (UNEP and FIA Foundation 2013). But
                        even if more city dwellers could afford transport by car or minibus, commutes would remain impractical

for lack of roads. In eight representative African cities, roads occupy far lower shares of urban land than
in other cities around the world. In addition to being low, urban road infrastructure is disproportionately
clustered near the center of African cities, according to the study of satellite images. The images show
that in well-developed cities outside Africa, land allocated to roads declines only gradually as one looks
out from the center toward the periphery: an example is Paris (figure 3.6). By contrast, paved roads in
Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam, Kigali, and Nairobi drop off abruptly, nearly disappearing beyond the most
central area (Dakar being a notable exception to the African pattern).

Economically, the ideal city can be viewed as an efficient labor market, matching employers and job
seekers through connections (Bertaud 2004). The typical African city fails in this matchmaker role. Its
land use is fragmented, its transport infrastructure insufficient—so its residents lack access to jobs. The
separation of formal housing areas from commercial and industrial areas, which makes commuting slow
and costly, is made worse by an emphasis on expansion as opposed to infill development. The lack of
connections within the city stymies agglomeration economies, keeping costs high and closing the doors
of African cities to regional and global trade and investment.

Between cities, transport connections enable firms to access local, regional, and global markets—for
buying inputs and selling outputs. The connections also give consumers options and, in many cases,
better prices. However, domestic product markets are fragmented in many African countries, limiting the
ability of secondary cities to expand production and specialize. In Nigeria, despite their having access to

a large consumer base throughout the country, most enterprises sell their products only in local markets.
High transport costs pose a disproportionate challenge to the tradables sector, helping account for lack
of development. Highway accessibility shows large regional variations caused by a mix of poor road
conditions, urban congestion, and missing highway and bridge connections. An estimated 40 percent
of federal roads, 65 percent of state roads, and 85 percent of local government roads are in poor or bad
condition and require rehabilitation or reconstruction (World Bank 2015a). In Côte d’Ivoire, transporters
who serve secondary cities face the highest costs. The transport costs are as high as US$0.47 per ton-
kilometer (twice the median cost nationally) and are detrimental to the growth of secondary cities and
reduce connectivity for economically lagging areas with higher poverty incidence (World Bank 2015).

Across Africa, high transport costs and the relatively modest spatial mobility of people likely have
contributed to the limited development of clusters of urban settlements. Evidence from a sample of 21
African countries where census data are available for two time periods shows that urban population is
highly concentrated in the largest city within countries, and that there has hardly been any dispersion of
urban population toward secondary cities.


COSTLY CITIES
Cities in Africa are costly for households, workers, and businesses. The high costs make cities less livable.
They also constrain the region’s economy. Because food and building costs are high, families can hardly
remain healthy or afford decent housing. Because commuting by vehicle is not only slow but expensive,
workers have difficulty finding jobs that match their skills. And workers’ need for higher wages to
compensate for the high cost of living makes firms less productive and competitive.

African households face higher costs relative to their per capita GDP than households in other regions.
This conclusion emerges from a new study of price level indices at the urban level based on data
collected by the International Comparison Program. Comparing price levels in 39 SSA countries with
those for countries at similar income levels, the study finds that households in urban Africa pay 20 to
31 percent more overall (figure 3.7). A similar comparison of urban prices—based on data from 125
cities, including nine in SSA (the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Worldwide Cost of Living Survey)7—finds
African cities to be about 31 percent more costly for households than cities in low- and middle-income
countries elsewhere (Nakamura et al. 2016).

The price premium for food is also large (about 35 percent), especially given the high share of African
incomes that goes to food. Household surveys conducted over 2003–10 found that the average African
urban household spent between 39 and 59 percent of its budget on food; the poorest urban households
(households in the first income quintile) spent even higher shares, between 44 and 68 percent.

Housing and transport are particularly costly in urban Africa. Housing prices are about 55 percent higher
in urban areas of African countries relative to their income levels. Urban transport, which includes prices
of vehicles and transport services, is about 42 percent more expensive in African cities than cities in
other countries. Urban workers in SSA also incur high commuting costs, or they simply cannot afford

                       to commute by vehicle, leaving them no option but to commute on foot. The informal, often colorful
                       minibus systems that dominate collective motorized transport in most African cities are far from cost-
                       efficient: the buses’ small size and low load factor (passenger capacity) prevent them from realizing scale
                       economies. For the poorest urban residents especially, the cost of vehicle transport in some cities is
                       plainly prohibitive, as measured in a study from 2008 (figure 3.8). The need to walk to work limits these
                       residents’ access to jobs.

                       Like households and workers, firms also face high urban costs. Research for this study shows that firms in
                       urban areas of Tanzania and Uganda pay higher nominal wages than those in rural areas (controlling for
                       human capital). The difference is about 30 percent in Tanzanian cities and 50 percent in Ugandan ones
                       (Bernard, D’Aoust, and Jones 2016). However, these estimated nominal wage premiums are similar to
                       those for developed cities in England, Europe, and the United States. So are urban wages in Africa higher
                       than would be expected? After all, cities around the world are associated with higher nominal wages—
                       as they should be, in theory, if urban workers and firms are more productive thanks to agglomeration
                       economies.

                       Two considerations dispel the notion that African urban workers simply earn more by producing more.
                       First, higher wages need not reflect higher productivity. Although the two are closely related in theory,
                       this relationship breaks down if, say, labor and product markets are not perfectly competitive. Second,

urban wage premiums should be estimated in real terms—nominal wages are likely to be higher in cities
because of higher living costs. For the Tanzanian and Ugandan cities studied, the urban wage premium
fades into statistical insignificance after wages are deflated to adjust for spatial differences in the cost of
living, and with controls for occupation and industry added to the regression.

In short, the higher nominal wages paid to urban workers in Tanzania and Uganda are likely driven by
higher urban living costs—not higher productivity. Urban workers in these countries gain no purchasing
power, on average, from living in a city. Instead, firms pay them the wages needed to cover the high
urban costs of food, housing, transport, and so on.

Cross-country analysis confirms that manufacturing firms in African cities pay higher wages in nominal
terms than urban firms in other countries at comparable development levels (figure 3.9).

Urban productivity does not necessarily go hand in hand with high nominal wages, any more than
it follows rapid growth in the local population. Instead, what drives urban productivity is economic
density: the city’s ability to benefit from co-located households and firms, efficiently connected.
Unfortunately, Africa’s cities today lack economic density and efficient connections, so they impose high
costs on workers and—as a result—on businesses. Higher wages mean lower expected returns. The next
section examines other cues for low economic expectations in African cities.

                    Out of Service and Closed for Business: Africa’s Urban
                    Low-Development Trap
                    Because the cities in SSA are crowded, disconnected, and costly, they are burdened with low
                    expectations for the future. An urban area that looks unlivable and unkind, without decent housing and
                    amenities for its residents, might as well post a sign stating: “out of service.” And one that is difficult for
                    commuters and firms because of a fragmented plan, lack of affordable transport, and unexpectedly high
                    labor costs could set up another sign: “closed for business.”

                    When a city appears “out of service” and “closed for business,” it has entered a low-development trap.
                    Potential investors and trading partners quickly see the signs of the physical and economic dysfunction
                    that constrains public service provision, inhibits labor market pooling and matching, and prevents firms
                    from reaping scale and agglomeration benefits. So these potential partners stay away, fearing low to no
                    returns on their investment. This dynamic will keep Africa’s urban economies undercapitalized—making
                    their development all the more challenging (see box 3.1).

How to escape the trap? Before seeking a way out, city and national governments should recognize the
problem for what it is: not simply one of underinvestment leading to low infrastructure, but one of low
expectations arising from inadequately planned growth and an ill-considered development path. This
section looks more closely at the form and function of African cities to spotlight key inefficiencies and
their immediate effects—the signs that warn business away, limiting Africa’s appeal to the business world.


CITIES ARE “OUT OF SERVICE”
From an urban planner’s perspective, three features of African cities directly explain their unlivability and
lack of appeal for property developers and investors:

 Inappropriate or unrealistic regulations and opaque guidelines—especially concerning land
u	
  ownership—impede access to land and discourage the formal development of housing and
  workplaces, especially in city centers.

 Poor connective infrastructure and the lack of affordable public transit constrain residents’ housing
u	
  choices, leading to informal squatting near city centers and long commutes from peripheral
  neighborhoods.

 Ineffective delivery of basic services leaves many residents—in downtown slums and away from the
u	
  center—lacking the amenities found in more economically successful cities.

Why have urban plans been ineffective? Partly because they are divorced from reality. For example,
they do not consider finances, market dynamics and interests, social diversity, or differences among
income groups. Moreover, such regulations that are enacted lack built-in implementation mechanisms—
while human capacity constraints and financial resource constraints have further weakened their
implementation and enforcement. Finally, the plans’ intentions and outcomes are distorted by
institutional failure and fragmentation (across sectors and levels), political interference, and insufficient
consideration of a city’s political economy.

Systems of land ownership in Africa are often the first and most cumbersome regulatory burden that
weighs on urban development. For example, a majority of the land in Kampala, Uganda, operates under
a complex land tenure regime that recognizes independent rights over land and structures, giving
rise to legal disputes and blocking investment (Muinde 2013). The problem takes a different form in
Nigeria, where urban land transactions incur high costs, and inefficient regulations further stymie formal
development. In Lagos and Port Harcourt, titling expenses alone can reach 30 percent of construction
costs, while total transaction costs range from 12 to 36 percent of a property’s value (World Bank 2015a).
As a result, land is developed informally. In Ibadan in 2000, researchers found that 83 percent of homes
violated city zoning rules (Arimah and Adeagbo 2000).

Another challenge is the lack of connective infrastructure. Given faster and more affordable transport,
more African city dwellers might forgo a downtown location for a large house with better amenities, a
few kilometers from the center. However, long commutes are an insuperable obstacle for most residents.
Some live on the outskirts of the city, while many others settle for more centrally located informal



                                                                                                 A F R I C A’ S P U L S E   >   49
                housing, the only affordable kind. In Dar es Salaam, for example, people live in Tandale—the informal
                district—not for its services and amenities, but despite its lack of them. Its central location puts people
                close to where most jobs and economic opportunities are found. In 2010, Dar es Salaam’s informal
                housing areas were on average much closer than formal ones to commercial and industrial areas (Antos,
                Lozano-Gracia, and Lall 2015). In all, more than 60 percent of Africa’s urban population lives in areas with
                some combination of overcrowding, low-quality housing, and inadequate access to clean water and
                sanitation (United Nations 2015a). The result is a picture of urban dysfunction that, across the region,
                keeps expectations low and deters investment.


                CITIES ARE “CLOSED FOR BUSINESS”
                From an economist’s perspective, the spatial form of African cities has developed in three ways that hurt
                their productive function—keeping markets inefficient and firms uncompetitive:

                 Fragmented land development prevents firms from reaping scale and agglomeration benefits.
                u	

                 Low investment in infrastructure, housing, and commercial structures further limits cities’ economic
                u	
                    size, confining business downtown.

                 High urban costs generate economic inefficiencies and necessitate urban workers to be compensated
                u	
                    with high wages, making firms less productive.

                Fragmented Land Development

                The spatially fragmented growth of African cities distances firms and workers from one another. In doing
                so, it prevents firms from reaping scale and agglomeration benefits. Spatial separation reduces workers’
                access to jobs and thus limits firm size; it prevents job market pooling and matching; and it hinders the
                transfer of skills and knowledge. Although the underlying causes of spatial fragmentation are regulatory
                and institutional, its effects are material, limiting urban economies.

                Scale matters for business—especially in tradable activities, where larger firms can lower unit production
                costs by investing in efficient technologies. Africa’s anemic tradables sector is related to the small median
                firm size for cities in the region, compared with cities in other low- and medium-income countries (figure
                3.10). Overall, Africa’s urban firms employ 20 percent fewer workers than comparable firms elsewhere
                (Lacovone, Ramachandran, and Schmidt 2014). Why?

                One reason is that in African cities, most workers cannot access employment far from where they live.
                Walking, cycling, and informal shared transport are the main commuting modes in African cities. But

                A resident of Nairobi, on average, can reach no more than 8 percent of all jobs within 45 minutes. By
                contrast, in greater London in 2013, this figure was 21.6 percent (nearly one million jobs).

                Fragmented development and unfeasible commutes imply that the most accessible urban jobs are those
                pursued at home—and by oneself. For example, in Kigali, Rwanda, the home is the usual headquarters

densely populated areas.


Low Investment in Structures

Considered as a whole, the average urban area in Africa is not strikingly less built-up than its
counterparts in other regions (except in Asia, where cities are more densely built; Angel et al. 2011). What
is lacking is the concentration of capital and infrastructure investment that enables households to live
decently and affordably near jobs.

A downtown dense with structures should in principle create dense demand, enabling specialization—
especially in locally traded goods and services—and driving productivity gains. But Africa’s large city
centers are dominated by a retail industry that does not benefit from economies of specialization. In
Kigali and Kampala, many urban workers purvey food and beverages. Low investment in structures limits
a city’s economic density, exacerbating spatial fragmentation and precluding agglomeration economies.


High Urban Costs

Spatially fragmented development and the high cost of living in Africa’s cities necessitate high urban
labor costs that make firms less competitive. Firms pay higher nominal wages in African cities than
elsewhere—wages that reflect high urban costs, not higher productivity. The need for high wages may
result partly from spatially fragmented development and inadequate transport, which together generate
economic inefficiencies. In addition, urban workers may need to be compensated for poorer living
conditions in slums with scarce amenities. When the urban wage exceeds the international wage, a city
can end up specializing entirely in the production of nontradable goods.

Investing in Institutional and Physical Structures to Support Scale
Economies in Africa’s Cities
To create an internationally competitive tradables sector, African cities must cease to be crowded,
disconnected, and costly, and instead become livable, connected, and productive. How?

The answer lies in swift action by mayors and ministers to enhance the functioning of land markets
(the factor market most urgently in need of reform), and to strengthen urban planning, regulation, and
enforcement—followed by actions to coordinate and scale up investment in cities’ physical structures
and infrastructure. In short, city leaders must make decisive and concerted efforts to:


                                                                                                                                                       A F R I C A’ S P U L S E   >   53
                1.	 Reform urban land markets and regulations. Leaders can act immediately to improve the institutional
                      and capacitive structures that govern land markets and land use—structures that depend on
                      human capital, and that will ultimately determine a city’s ability to mobilize investment capital.
                      Leaders should do this by:

                      u	Simplifying and clarifying transfers of property rights among land market participants (freeing these
                         procedures from today’s unclear, overlapping property rights regimes).
                      u	Supporting the effective management of urban development through foresighted planning, realistic
                         regulation, and predictable enforcement.
                2.	 Coordinate and increase early infrastructure investments. After taking firm and decisive steps to
                      improve institutional structures, authorities can build on those efforts to adapt physical structures
                      and infrastructure—including housing, transport infrastructure (including roads), and basic
                      services—to a future of urban productivity. Leaders should do this by:

                      u	Making infrastructure investments early, and coordinating them with land market intention reforms and
                         the plans and regulations that guide physical structures (ensuring that infrastructure investments will
                         be integrated with the growth of neighborhoods and structures in predictable ways).
                      u	Intensifying these early, coordinated infrastructure investments to take full advantage of scale economies
                         in housing, transport, and services (avoiding inefficient and fragmented investments that diverge
                         from market demand).
                Both efforts should aim at structural improvements in the allocation of a city’s land, capital, and
                structures. Their aim should be to achieve urban development at scale and for scale, while fostering
                economic specialization.


                RECOMMENDATION 1—Reform urban land markets (simplify
                property rights, strengthen city plans).
                Over the next 20 years, the growth of Africa’s urban populations will propel new demand for
                infrastructure, housing, and other physical structures, and for amenities. To meet this new demand, city
                leaders and planners must use adaptable strategies. Plans and regulations should allow the best use
                of land—but they should also permit uses, and users, to change over time, as demand evolves further.
                Three key considerations will be how to handle land and property rights, how to value land and manage
                land prices, and land use and urban planning.

                Africa’s cities do not develop in a well-planned fashion, but grow informally—and develop informally—
                because public planning is ineffective, while private development is hobbled or repelled by opaque
                or inappropriate regulations. Informal dwellings house not only the poor, but also middle-income
                households, because of constraints on formal land markets. The same constraints have much to do with
                the typical African city’s spatial fragmentation and the relatively low capital investment near its core.

                The crowded streets of African cities also attest to a lack of formative, integrated urban plans. Traffic
                congestion stems not just from limited road infrastructure, but also from limited parking and lack of


54   >   A F R I C A’ S P U L S E
formal addresses. And the informality and small scale of public and collective transport in African cities
indicate that these networks are mostly reactive—they emerge in response to the city’s growth. They do
not structure it, as did the introduction of rail infrastructure or street cars in well-developed cities, such
as Paris and London (Brooks and Lutz 2013).

Households in African cities find it difficult to locate outside the central business district because the lack
of paved roads makes commuting from the periphery impractical (Felkner, Lall, and Lee forthcoming).
Increased investments in roads could increase productivity, while affecting commuting costs and times
differently across the city—but only if such investments are well thought through in advance. Similarly,
African cities have an urgent need for well-planned and forward-thinking transport systems. All transport
development plans are not equal.9

The lack of physical and technological structures in Africa’s cities—housing, services, and transport—
points back to the need for planning capacity. Without proper local planning guidance, it is impossible
to coordinate and implement infrastructure and public amenities and other investments. No planning, or
poor planning, is one of the fundamental reasons why African cities are too crowded, too disconnected,
and too costly to attract regional and global investors and trading partners.

Reforming land markets is the sine qua non for policy efforts to get Africa’s urbanization right. Not only
will there be a major payoff in economic efficiency, these reforms will help African cities tap the potential
of rising land values to finance infrastructure and other public goods.10


Clarification of Land and Property Rights
Clear rights to urban land are a precondition for the emergence of a formal land market. Informal,
non-legal markets can function in almost any conditions, but informality in land markets is distinctively
limiting because—unlike the business of most informal markets—land is an asset. Asset transactions are
viable only if the purchaser can rely on some enduring, extra-legal means whereby new ownership is
recognized, such as sanction by the local community. In contrast, a formal market does not merely offer
purchasers the protection of the state; rather, because transactions are readily observable and recorded,
it generates the public good of accurate valuation.

African cities struggle with overlapping and sometimes contradictory property rights systems—formal,
customary, and informal. Under the customary rules for land tenure that control much peri-urban and
urban land in Africa, property rights depend on the consent of local chiefs or family elders. Examples
include cities in Ghana, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia.

When barriers to urban land access arise from an overly complex property rights regime, they impede
the consolidation of plots and the transfer of land among users—and among uses. Firms cannot readily


9	 Two contrasting paths for the development of urban mobility appear in the experiences of China and Japan (World Bank 2015c).
10	 International experience suggests that strong institutions appear as a precondition for successful implementation of all instruments for tapping land value increases to finance
    infrastructure. These include institutions that assign and protect property rights, institutions that enable independent valuation and public dissemination of land values across uses, and a
    strong legal framework supported by a healthy judicial system to handle disputes and oversee the process. Finally, as land-based instruments are considered for financing infrastructure, it
    is important to recognize the risks associated with them. Real estate markets are highly cyclical and if land financing is used to finance infrastructure broadly (as opposed to focusing only
    on new development), cyclicality can bring instability to local authorities. Further, large revenues associated with land transactions and urban infrastructure investment create incentives for
    corruption. Finally, there is the risk that high potential profits from land transactions will transform local authorities into real estate developers, with profit rather than welfare maximization
    as their main objective.




                                                                                                                                                                              A F R I C A’ S P U L S E     >   55
                buy downtown land to convert it from low-density residential use into higher-density apartments, or to
                build clusters of new commercial structures. Land transactions are long, costly, and complicated. Such
                market constraints reduce the collateral value of structures, giving developers little incentive to invest in
                residential height—while tempting all parties to enter informal arrangements (World Bank 2015b).

                Unclear land rights are severely constraining urban land redevelopment throughout Africa, imposing
                high costs. Even where formal titles or clear land rights exist, basic mapping, geographic, or ownership
                information is often inaccurate or land records are maintained poorly, causing disputes. Applying for
                formal recognition can also be a tedious process. In Mozambique, one can apply for concession to a
                land plot from the relevant municipal directorate or municipal cadaster services. But the application can
                involve as many as 103 administrative steps and may be protracted over several years (UN-Habitat 2008).
                The lack of a proper registration system prevents urban land markets from functioning well, and creates
                obstacles to raising capital for development and investment—and to the local authority raising revenue.

                Across Africa, land databases and other systems to record information are inadequate and opaque.
                An African city is likely to struggle with overlapping systems of land tenure—formal, customary, and
                informal—in a single urban space, where they often conflict with each other and constrain land
                markets by creating confusion and disputes over land rights. These dysfunctions distort the price
                and availability of land for efficient urban development. Finally, land administration systems (such
                as registries and cadaster records) are incomplete and underused for enforcing legal claims and
                landholders’ fiscal obligations, so lenders cannot always use land as collateral. In SSA, only 10 percent of
                total land is registered (UN-Habitat forthcoming). In West Africa, only 2 to 3 percent of land is held with a
                government registered title (Toulmin 2005).

                Low land registration may result partly from cumbersome, expensive registration and transfer systems
                loaded with survey expenses and fees, which make registration challenging and unaffordable for many
                (Toulmin 2005). The main challenges to effective land governance in Africa include land grabs, insecurity
                in land tenure, inefficient land administration and management, political interference and corruption,
                and insufficient capacity and resources (Byamugisha 2013).

                The good news is that African countries are taking steps to clarify land rights. Botswana took the
                bold step of regularizing customary land in 2008, partly because the Land Boards faced challenges to
                administering tribal land (Malope and Phirinyane 2016). Zambia passed a new planning bill in 2015,
                extending planning controls across state and customary land and designating all local authorities as
                planning authorities (Wesseling 2016). Namibia recognizes traditional leaders as part of the formal land
                system; they are designated by the president and details about them are published in the government’s
                gazette (United Nations 2015b).

                Some countries and cities are developing hybrid regimes to make formal and customary administration
                more compatible. For example, in Nigerian states with largely Muslim populations, the emir’s
                representatives subdivide and allocate land with the help of volunteer professionals from the
                government. An example is the city of Rigasa, in the extreme west of Kaduna (Igabi Local Government
                Area). Future urban redevelopers in Africa may learn from the past successes of two approaches—land
                sharing and land readjustment—in several Asian cities.

Land Valuation and Prices
The pricing of land on the market partly depends on policies, which must be designed with great care.
Taxes, charges, and subsidies can be used to complement regulatory controls on land use, creating
financial incentives and disincentives. Revenues—such as those from land-based financing—can also
be used to finance administrative costs and infrastructure. And implementation tools, such as capital
investment, budget, and phasing plans, can help with upstream planning.

Most cities in SSA lack the capacity to raise revenues from land: laws prohibit, or severely limit, land
fees and taxes (World Bank 2015b). Even with different laws in place, cities would have little power to
leverage land for revenue, as fiscal cadaster records and capacities are weak. And cities’ reliance on
central government transfers means that they have few incentives to make such efforts. Given the
inadequacy of revenues from intergovernmental transfers, Africa’s cities should consider land and
property taxes to finance urban infrastructure and public services (box 3.4).



   To be economically dense and well connected, Africa’s cities will need huge investment in infrastructure.           BOX 3.4:
                                                                                                                       Leveraging
   Although revenues from the intergovernmental transfer system have been the mainstay of urban public
                                                                                                                       Land Values to

                                                                                                                       Infrastructure in
   the greatest payoff where there is rapid urban growth. Rapid growth causes land prices to rise rapidly,             Africa’s Cities
   creating an opportunity to generate significant revenue. Yet rapid growth also magnifies infrastructure
   investment needs, requiring significant sources of development finance. France, Japan, and the United
   States used land-based financing techniques most heavily during periods of rapid urban growth when
   there were large leaps in the scale of urban investment. Taxes on land can also potentially improve the
   efficiency of land use, as property owners have an incentive to develop the land to its most profitable
   use commensurate with the market value of the property. Valuable downtown locations with higher land
   prices will experience densification and investment in residential and commercial structures. Not only can
   such a taxes incentivize dense urban development, they are also nondistortionary, as appreciation in land
   values is merely an economic rent for a scarce resource, rather than a return on the economic activity of
   the owner. So, unlike in production, there is no behavior by the owner to be distorted.

   Higher revenues from land and real estate can come from (a) improved valuation of land and properties
   closer to their market value, thus deepening the tax base; (b) improved compliance, so that more
   property owners pay land and property taxes, thus broadening the tax base; and (c) monetization of
   underused public land. However, setting in place land and real estate tax systems that support economic
   density is not straightforward. Strong institutions are essential to define property rights clearly; ensure
   standardized and objective methods of land valuation; and support and oversee the process of land
   management, land sales, and tax collection. For purely real estate taxes, it is important to realize that

                Urban Planning and Land Use Regulation
                Land and property rights affect the transfer of land between users; land prices determine the intensity
                of investments in structures. However, land transfers and land prices are affected by urban planning
                and land use regulations—the policies that determine how and where land is used. Among land use
                regulations are zoning ordinances, building codes, and other associated bylaws, most of them legally
                binding (Birch 2008, 142).

                Across Africa, today’s urban plans appear ineffective: They are not successfully coordinating investment
                in structures or managing the spatial form of cities. One source of difficulty is the inappropriate adoption
                of regulatory codes and planning models inherited from colonial regimes or imported from high-
                income countries (Balbo 1993; Gandy 2006; Kanyeihamba 1980; Myers 2003). Another problem is that
                plans do not give credible accounts of finance, market dynamics, or distributional impacts. Furthermore,
                guidelines are not articulated enough, granular enough, or transparent enough to set consistent
                and enforceable parameters for development. Finally, capacity and resource constraints weaken
                implementation and enforcement.

                City and national authorities will have to make tough political decisions informed by technical evidence
                and assessments. For this, they will need to increase urban planning capacity and resources. Lack of
                staff capacity proves a serious constraint on effective urban management. It is even more crippling
                to enforcement, which is often the greatest challenge, even where all the necessary structures and
                regulations are in place.

                Because African cities lack the institutional structures needed for functional land markets, farsighted
                planning, and effective regulation, their physical structures and infrastructure lag far behind the growth
                of the urban population. Not only housing, but other basic infrastructure and services are in a constant
                struggle to catch up.


                RECOMMENDATION 2—Coordinate early infrastructure
                investments (while bringing them to scale).
                Two sets of structures—institutional, and physical and infrastructural—must be improved, making them
                more livable and affordable for people and more attractive to business. However, physical structures and
                infrastructure pose special challenges.

                One challenge is path dependence: the costs of developing housing, infrastructure, and industrial
                premises will depend on sequencing. Making infrastructure investments first, followed by investments
                in housing and industrial premises, can reduce the cost of all three. That is because sewerage, drainage,
                electricity, clean water, and connectivity are cheaper to provide at scale than if they are added to houses
                and factories individually and as an afterthought (Collier 2015). Further, urban structures share a “putty-
                clay” quality: once constructed, they are difficult to modify and can stay in place for more than 150 years
                (Hallegatte 2009).

                A city’s ability to make infrastructure investments that are early, coordinated, and intensive will directly
                determine its later appeal to firms considering their own investments in the urban economy. Only

efficient infrastructure and service provision will enable economic density combined with livability, for
job market matching and productivity. In contrast, inefficient structures can set back urban development
for decades, even centuries. The challenge is that although density in structures is a public good—the
benefit of high economic density and interaction is an externality—the concomitant investment in
housing and commercial structures must be borne privately by households and firms.

A second challenge is interdependence among various investments in physical structures and
infrastructure. For households, the utility of housing depends on firms’ investments in premises that
provide accessible jobs. And for firms, the productivity of premises depends on the proximity of
infrastructure, workers, and customers. Any social return on public infrastructure depends on the
proximity of housing and premises. For example, a rapid transit system is more viable at higher densities.
Policies need to leverage complementarities and avoid coordination failures resulting in single-sector
interventions that prevent economic density.

Unregulated markets are unlikely to solve the problems of path dependence and interdependence. Public
policy and urban planning are needed to get urban structures “right.” This imperative is especially challenging
in Africa, where the fragmented nature of urban development is locking cities into high cost paths.

Despite the challenges, coordination will be crucial to Africa’s success in managing path dependence and
interdependence. Much of a structure’s value is determined by complementarities with other structures
in the neighborhood or city. The first structures built will dictate the options for further investments in
the vicinity: path dependence implies that investors need to anticipate what other structures will be built
nearby. Further, these expectations are self-fulfilling—investments affect expectations, which in turn
affect investments (see box 3.2). The problems of path dependence and interdependence are all the more
pressing because of this circular problem of expectations, as it affects investments in durable capital.


The Need for Common Knowledge
Effective coordination requires common knowledge (Thomas et al. 2014). Common knowledge is distinct
from and more demanding than shared knowledge, which is simply something that everyone knows.
Shared knowledge becomes common knowledge only when everyone knows that everyone knows the
same thing. Ideally, investment intentions need to be sufficiently publicly observable for each investor to
be confident that other investors observe the same information.


Strong Institutions Should Provide the Bedrock
for Enhancing Africa’s Urban Structures
Today, a race is on between new infrastructure investment projects and the institutional structures—the
capacities of African city governments for urban planning, regulation, and enforcement—that should
shape and coordinate them. The infrastructure projects are winning the race. The institutional structures
are falling behind.

That is a problem. The choices that leaders make now will commit a city to a specific trajectory for
decades to come (Lecocq and Shalizi 2014). If new transport systems and industrial zones, for example,


                                                                                                 A F R I C A’ S P U L S E   >   59
                are not coordinated with one another—and with urban land markets and land use regulations—such
                projects can set a city on a counterproductive development path.

                Large infrastructure projects such as roads, bus rapid transit, and railways come with high sunk costs.
                Like large structures, these projects depreciate very slowly over decades or even centuries (Philibert
                2007). Cities display high inertia: although they are in a permanent process of reconstruction, their
                transformation is largely uncoordinated and targets only individual buildings or infrastructure segments at
                any one time. So urban forms are extremely difficult to change, even when large social gains are possible
                (Fay et al. 2015).

                Decisions about a city’s growth pattern, based on underlying transport investment choices, will also
                strongly influence future greenhouse gas emissions and environmental sustainability. Scholars have
                proven the impact of urban form on driving behaviors, modal choices, transport-related energy
                consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions (Newman and Kenworthy 1989). African cities now enjoy a
                unique opportunity to avoid carbon-intensive urban transportation trajectories. Getting these choices
                right the first time around—while urbanization is still in its early stages—is critical. Given the inertia of
                urban settlements, polluting now and cleaning up later is not an option.

                If infrastructure continues to outrun the institutional structures that should be planning and regulating
                development, Africa’s cities will lose. Because urban plans and development regulations are highly
                political, planning must be accompanied by effective and inclusive political systems and institutions—
                elements often lacking in Africa.

                In sum, if cities in SSA remain crowded, disconnected, and costly, they can be neither kind to their
                residents nor productive. Yet these cities are still being built. What they can do today—before it is too
                late—is to ensure that they are not locked into inefficient and unsustainable patterns of urbanization.
                Given the high sunk costs and enduring nature of infrastructure, any approach to urban development that
                lacks early planning and coordination will only require future generations to clean up the mess: a terribly
                inefficient strategy.

                To inspire better economic and social outcomes, cities in Africa need better institutions. It is up to
                local and national authorities to undertake the institutional reforms needed for effective planning and
                coordination—raising urban economic density and productivity, and spurring Africa’s belated structural
                transformation. Institutional structures must lead, not lag, urban infrastructure. As a result, the region’s
                cities will become not only better connected and more efficient, but also kinder to their working
                inhabitants, whose increasing skills will be critical to economic growth and development. The doors of
                African cities will then, and only then, stand open to the world.
