  These recommendations should be considered as a contribution in the efforts towards standardizing data reporting
under EITI Requirements, and need to be tested to identify issues with data collection under the headings as
categorized in this report.
  The research team recommends a step by step approach to this, starting with a specific set of Requirements,
across a number of countries. This would allow the EITI International Secretariat to develop a set of comparable
statistics for various reporting entities, as well as start constructing guidelines for EITI implementers. In December
(2015) the EITI Board decided to form a Technical Working Group to develop data standards for consideration by
the EITI Board.
  The table below summarizes the type of data output for each EITI Requirement, which are then presented in more
detail in the main text.

in the report. A notation should be made to indicate if the
firm is a state owned enterprise.
   The data formats and categories discussed here are
those which relate to revenue flows where the government
is both the receiver and the payee of revenues, i.e. flows
(whether in cash or in-kind) flow from the extractive entity
owned by the state, to other state departments. These
recommendations are applicable for categories where the
information has been made available to the EITI
administrators. Table 10 outlines these recommendations.
   Providing the context for state participation is
recommended as good practice29. Inclusion of percentage
equity share of the government in extractive enterprises,
as well as clarification on how government participation is
undertaken (through equity, contracts etc.) is
recommended.
   In addition, information, on the level of state control is
also recommended in the narrative as good practice.
Control over a company can be exerted through different
means, ownership being the most common avenue used.
However, with state participation, two major situations
may exist. The first is when the state has majority
ownership but leaves management decision to
professionals. The second is when the state may have a
minority ownership but can intervene in management and
finance decisions.
   Ownership is easier to define/measure than control as it
refers to share holdings of the company. Control is more
difficult to measure as it refers to the government’s ability
to act decisively on management issues. It can be defined
as30:
     To be in control is to have the possibility to act decisively on
     strategically important issues. Such issues include the broad

   Narrative data is defined as text, predominately in
the form of annual reports, contracts and factsheets.
Quantitative data is data points, either numeric
(production volumes) or text (categorical survey data),
often in the form of downloadable datasets or interactive
visualizations.
   Indexed data is where an initiative has analysed
multiple data points to create a measurement relevant to
the chosen indicator. These indexes are often presented
in the form of an interactive visualization and may also
include a downloadable dataset. If an initiative has
published multiple data types relevant to a particular
indicator, all are listed and the predominant type is
listed in bold font.
