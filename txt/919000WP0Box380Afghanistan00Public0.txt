THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at t he bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

                    Afghanistan simplified business start-up by taking company
                    registration out of the commercial courts; establishing a new
DB2010              company registry that acts as a one-stop shop combining
                    company registration, tax registration and publication in the
                    official gazette; and introducing flat registration fees.
                    Afghanistan made starting a business easier by reducing the
DB2014              time and cost to obtain a business license and by eliminating
                    the inspection of the premises of newly registered companies.
                    Afghanistan made starting a business more difficult by
DB2015              increasing the publication fees and prolonging the time
                    required for registration.

        Obtain copy of the land deed

        After decades of conflict, most people have lost their deeds, relying on
        informal ownership claims to land. In post-conflict Kabul, a copy of the
        title deed is part of the documentation needed to apply for a building
        permit. BuildCo must file a written claim to the appeal court of Kabul
        stating they lost their deed. The claim must contain the property
        specification, deed number, district number, and number of the court
        that issued the deed. It takes about a week to obtain a valid copy of the
        title deed.

        When the deed is lost, the owner must advertise the case through news
        paper or radio and then request from the court to issue a duplicate
        deed. Within 7 -- 10 days the court will issue a scanned copy of the
        deed without charges.

        approval. The master plan is 15 -- 20 years old and has not been

      BuildCo submits a copy of the title deed, the zoning approval, the
      building design(s), and proof of the employees' qualifications. If the
      property is inside the Kabul Master Plan, the designs are sent to the
      Engineering Department and a committee will approve them. BuildCo
      then pays the building permit fee. The municipality sends approval
