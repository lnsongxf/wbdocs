Executive Summary

1.	   The World Bank encourages the use of community-driven development (CDD) and
community-based approaches to build rural infrastructure in some of the world’s poorest
countries and communities. Over the past 10 years, CDD projects and components have
constituted between 5 and 10 percent of World Bank lending. CDD emphasizes community
control over decision making and investment resources for local infrastructure and service
delivery. The approach has significantly increased access to community infrastructure and
services such as roads, irrigation, water and sanitation, electricity, basic education, and health
(Wong 2012). CDD is widely used in the least-developed countries of the world and in fragile
and post conflict contexts, and is often used by middle-income countries to reach the poorest or
most marginalized populations.1 Given the levels of investment and the importance CDD plays in
extending basic services, particularly to the poor, continued operation and maintenance (O&M)
of the basic investments supported under CDD (and other community-based operations) is a
logical concern that has been raised by both practitioners and critics (OED 2005).

2.	   This paper highlights examples of successful O&M arrangements under community-
driven and -based development projects to better understand the factors contributing to their
success. The intended beneficiaries of this assessment are client governments implementing
CDD and community-based projects for similar types of rural infrastructure, task teams, and
other potential users. In addition to highlighting factors of success, this paper shares relevant
materials, procedures, and guidelines to help support O&M systems.

3.	   This paper is based on a desk review of World Bank operational documents as well as
external literature on O&M related to rural infrastructure across several sectors. The seven project
cases analyzed for this review were selected based on evidence of successful O&M arrangements
from a longer list of more than 50 projects compiled by members of the CDD Community of
Practice (COP) and World Bank staff from the water, social protection, and transport sectors. The
desk review of relevant project documents was supplemented by discussions with task team
members and government project staff. The seven case study projects include:
      •	   Afghanistan National Solidarity Program (NSP 1, 2 and 3)
      •	   Azerbaijan Rural Investment Projects (1 and 2)
      •	   India Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
      •	   Indonesia National Program for Community Empowerment in Rural Areas (PNPM
           Rural),
      •	   Nepal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects (1 and 2)
      •	   Peru Rural Roads Program (1–3)

4.	   The review found four critical factors for O&M success, and these areas serve as the
analytical framework for this paper.

     i.	    Organizational and institutional arrangements: Comprising the organizational
            structure and roles and responsibilities for operating and maintaining the
            infrastructure at the community and local administration levels.
     ii.	   Capacity building: High-quality, timely training.
     iii.	 Financing: Revenue collection and cost-sharing mechanisms, and willingness and
           ability to pay.

     iv.	 Technical considerations: Design and technology choices, and complexity.
5.	   This note has classified rural infrastructure built under CDD and community-based
projects into the broad categories of public goods and toll goods (commonly used to classify
goods and services). Public goods include infrastructure such as roads, bridges, schools and
health clinics, while toll goods include water supply, irrigation schemes, and electricity services.
However, lines dividing these categories can be blurred, and the classification of a given good
is not inherent to its nature, but rather depends on circumstances and agreed upon policies
in-country.
6.	   Among the long list of over 50 projects reviewed (annex 1), 70 percent of projects’
documentation referred to the status of subproject O&M, and the challenges or risks to these
arrangements. While many projects reported that adequate O&M arrangements had been put
in place (particularly in the water sector), several projects highlighted concerns regarding the
sustainability of these arrangements. Moreover, all of the Implementation and Completion
Results Reports (ICRs) for those completed projects reviewed showed the projects to have met
or exceeded their target measure for O&M. However, ICR comments focused mainly around the
long-term institutional and financial sustainability of O&M, highlighting the need for technical
and financial support from central and local governments to help maintain infrastructure.

7.	    The review encountered some challenges in systematically identifying projects with
potentially useful lessons. There are few detailed technical evaluations of O&M arrangements
for CDD and/or rural infrastructure projects, therefore there is limited clear evidence regarding
key factors that may have contributed to their success. The review was also constrained by the
inability to conduct a field review of the projects and O&M systems, which would have allowed
further data collection and, possibly, a deeper understanding of the factors that help or hinder
good O&M.

Key Findings
8.	  O&M arrangements appear to be most successful in single-sector projects (for
example, rural roads or water supply), where a relevant sectoral agency has specific
responsibility for supporting O&M and where the projects tend to work to strengthen the O&M
capacity of the sector. Additionally, O&M efforts have been more successful for toll good
investments, such as water supply and irrigation, where communities and households will
more readily pay for such services, and systems are well established to collect such payments.
Generally, O&M arrangements are more challenging for public goods, such as roads or

               bridges, where access and benefits are more difficult to control and collecting user fees is
               more challenging. The review also found that rural communities more commonly carry out
               routine maintenance, which they contribute to either in-kind (through labor or materials)
               or in cash, versus periodic maintenance, where costs tend to be higher and technical
               requirements greater.2 Periodic maintenance generally requires technical and financial support
               from local government and traditional line ministries.

               9.	 The review found that the following elements or arrangements contribute to a sustainable
               O&M system for various community-based investments:
                      •	   Institutional arrangements: Establishment of O&M committees at the beginning of
                           the project, with O&M plans in place which clearly define the roles and responsibilities
                           of the different stakeholders, include a schedule of routine maintenance activities,
                           initial user tariffs, and collection mechanisms for at least the first few years after
                           construction, as well as estimated O&M costs for the lifespan of the infrastructure.
                           Establishment of formal links with local government authorities and line agencies
                           should also be made, with their roles and contributions to O&M included in the plans,
                           with the relevant government or agency representatives signing an agreement on
                           completion of construction.
                      •	   Capacity building: O&M training, often provided exclusively to community groups,
                           should be extended to other stakeholders, including local government authorities,
                           and, where appropriate, small-scale contractors or private companies involved in
                           the O&M. Distribution of simple pictorial manuals or guides to help communities
                           in carrying out O&M activities has also been very useful. Finally, the frequency and
                           timing of the capacity-building activities are important, and post-construction
                           training and technical support to O&M groups should also be allocated for within the
                           project budget. Capacity-building activities should include communication materials
                           to inform communities on O&M issues and behaviors.
                      •	   Financing: Most projects are able to cover short-term financing needs for routine
                           O&M; however, long-term financing for larger repairs appears to be a major challenge.
                           O&M financing of water sector projects appears to be more successful because user
                           fees are more easily collected to cover day-to-day O&M, compared to other public
                           goods such as rural roads or bridges with nonexclusive benefits. Successful systems
                           for longer-term O&M financing generally involve formal cost-sharing arrangements
                           with local government units or line ministries.
                      •	   Technical issues: Evidence indicates that when designs are appropriate, including
                           application of local technologies and use of local materials, materials are of
                           required quality, and supervision is provided to ensure construction is according to
                           specifications, community infrastructure tends to be in a better operational state.

               10.	 Based on the desk review, this study presents six recommendations to support and
               improve CDD and community-based infrastructure O&M:


               2	   Routine maintenance covers activities conducted on a regular basis one or more times per year to keep the infrastructure in
                    good working condition. Periodic maintenance covers activities needed once every few years that are more significant and
                    technically complex and require specialized equipment and skills.
                                                                                    Executive Summary • 7




i.	    CDD (and other rural infrastructure) investment projects should always include at
       least one O&M results indicator.

ii.	   Explore the possibility of making second and subsequent block grant financing
       conditional on the set-up and operationalization of relevant O&M arrangements.

iii.	 Analyze and include information on O&M costs and responsibilities in the
      community process of subproject prioritization.

iv.	 Pilot and evaluate different ways for financing public infrastructure O&M (particularly
     for roads).

v.	    Research the role that public-private partnerships (PPPs) can play in commercializing
       O&M efforts as an alternative to existing community-based mechanisms.

vi.	 Given the lack of robust evidence of the end results of O&M arrangements, projects
     should conduct longitudinal technical and qualitative studies focusing on O&M
     arrangements and sustainability issues.
Section I: Introduction and
 	         Overview

1.	Introduction
1.1 Background and Rationale
1.	    Community-driven development (CDD) is an approach that emphasizes community con-
trol over decision making and investment resources for local infrastructure and service delivery.
CDD has been mainstreamed and scaled up across a range of sectors and contexts over the
years and is often used to target the poorest regions and villages, mostly in rural areas. It has
been particularly effective in increasing access to and use of infrastructure and services such as
roads, water and sanitation, bridges, electricity, local schools and health clinics, among others
(Wong 2012). Over the past 10 years, World Bank lending towards CDD projects averaged 5–10
percent of overall lending, and, as of March 2015, the active CDD portfolio consisted of more
than 180 projects totaling US$16 billion in over 75 countries, covering all regions.

2.	    Infrastructure O&M is critical to ensuring its continued effectiveness and productivity, and
improper or inadequate maintenance arrangements can undermine the long-term utility of the
investments and lead to more costly rehabilitation efforts. A report prepared under the World
Economic Forum (WEF) Strategic Infrastructure Initiative indicates that current management of
infrastructure assets is a cause for concern, and that publicly owned infrastructure assets have
been managed sub optimally in both developed and developing countries, with O&M often the
victim of pressured public budgets and political priorities (WEF 2014). The report cites the root
causes of O&M underperformance as insufficient funding, inadequate capacity, and inappro-
priate governance structures. The 2005 Operations Evaluation Department (OED) review of the
Bank’s CDD and Social Fund portfolio found that, although community members were aware of
the importance of maintenance, and a significant number of them had been trained, the lack of
available resources on a continuous basis to fund O&M was a significant constraint (World Bank




                                                8
                                                                                               Section I: Introduction and Overview • 9




2005). Similarly, inadequate infrastructure maintenance has been raised as an issue in both the
rural roads and water sectors.3

3.	    Given these findings, and the breadth and scale of CDD operations worldwide, O&M has
emerged as an area of interest to the CDD Community of Practice (COP) and among other teams
working on rural or community infrastructure projects. Specifically, teams have expressed inter-
est in better understanding the factors that contribute to effective O&M systems and in identi-
fying good practices.

1.2 Objectives, Scope, and Audience
4.	    The objective is to review the O&M experiences of CDD and other community-based
infrastructure projects to document cases of good practice and, ultimately, to improve O&M
arrangements on similar Bank-supported projects. In addition, relevant supporting materials,
where available, are included to enable projects to learn from each other.

5.	    This study covers CDD projects supporting small-scale rural infrastructure and other sec-
tor-specific community-based operations, such as rural roads, water and sanitation projects,
and others. The study team reviewed documentation from over 50 World Bank projects (annex
1), of which a significant majority included references to O&M. Over 80 percent of the project
appraisal documents (PADs) discussed arrangements for O&M within the subprojects to be fi-
nanced, and almost half included an O&M indicator in the results framework.

6.	   This review aims to inform Bank staff and task teams supporting the design and imple-
mentation of CDD or community-based projects, government agencies implementing these
projects, and broader CDD COP members, who may have questions on how best to design O&M
systems within their projects.

1.3 Methodology and Analytical Framework
7.	    The main cases used for this review were identified by the CDD COP and staff from the
water and sanitation, social protection, and transport sectors. The study team analyzed the op-
erational documents related to these projects (PADs, aide memoires, technical audits, and oth-
ers) to identify projects with clear evidence on or indications of successful O&M arrangements.4
The selected cases were then analyzed through review of operational manuals and guidelines
and interviews with Bank task team members and government counterparts. Table 1 highlights
the main case studies analyzed. This paper also draws on lessons from some of the other proj-
ects reviewed, as well as from World Bank technical papers and external O&M literature related
to rural infrastructure in various sectors (transport, water supply and sanitation, buildings, and
others).

     growing issue in a number of developing countries, but the extent of the problem is not fully appreciated and the solutions
     are still not commonly understood. Also, Brikké and Bredero (2003) discuss the importance of O&M for water supply and sani-
     tation technologies, noting that in many developing countries, O&M of small community water supply and sanitation systems
     has been neglected.

     technical studies, or other evaluations covering O&M and infrastructure sustainability.

               8.	   Analytical framework. This review found four key areas critical for O&M success. These four
               areas serve as the analytical framework for this paper.
                        •	    Organizational and institutional arrangements: The organizational structure and
                              roles and responsibilities for operating and maintaining the infrastructure at the
                              community and local administration levels.
                        •	    Capacity building: Quality and continuity of training.
                        •	    Financing: Revenue collection and cost-sharing mechanisms, and willingness and
                              ability to pay.
                        •	    Technical considerations: Design and technology choices, and their complexity.
               9.	   Classification of infrastructure. In analyzing O&M, the study found a general distinction in
               arrangements based on the type of infrastructure investment, broadly classified as follows:5
                        •	    Public goods are nonrivalrous (that is, when the good is consumed, it does not
                              reduce the amount available for others) and nonexcludable (that is, people cannot be
                              excluded from the benefits even if they do not pay, which can sometimes lead to a
                              free-rider problem).
                        •	    Private goods are rivalrous (that is, when the good is consumed, it reduces the
                              availability to another person) and excludable (nonpayers cannot access the good).
                        •	    Toll goods (or club or marketable public goods) are nonrivalrous, but excludable.
                        •	    Common goods are rivalrous, but nonexcludable, meaning that the supply can be
                              depleted, but people are not restricted in their use (for example, natural resources,
                              fish in the open sea).

10.	 Rural infrastructure built under CDD and community-based projects generally fall under
the category of public or toll goods. However, distinctions between these categories of goods
can be blurred, and the classification of a given good is not inherent to its nature, but rather de-
pends on circumstances and agreed upon policies in-country. For instance, roads and schools,
generally considered public goods, can have tolls and fees that restrict access.6 Potable water
infrastructure can be delivered through different systems (for example, wells, public taps or wa-
tering points, individual connections, and so forth) that could be classified as a public, toll, or
common good, depending on the nature of the source and how easy it is to restrict access.

11.	 With the above discussion in mind, this paper proposes to classify and make reference to
the various types of rural infrastructure as: (i) public goods—rural roads and bridges, schools,
and health centers; and (ii) toll goods—water supply, irrigation, and electricity.

12.	 Review limitations. The review found that very few projects have conducted technical in-
frastructure audits or evaluations, especially years after infrastructure completion. Since most
projects close after about six years of implementation, it can be difficult to assess the impact
and performance of O&M measures: infrastructure that has been newly completed is unlike-
ly to show deficiencies of poor or inadequate maintenance. Therefore, evidence on the state
of maintenance of CDD-financed and community-based local infrastructure has been limited.
While the Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) for several projects indicate
O&M systems are satisfactorily in place, there was limited supporting documentation or evi-
dence on the long-term success of these arrangements because there have been few post-ICR
reviews. Therefore, this review broadened its initial basis for analysis from projects with docu-
mented evidence of O&M success to include examples of O&M arrangements that appear to be
successful based on a more ad hoc or less robust qualitative assessment. Additionally, since the
list of projects compiled for review was based mainly on the responses received from the CDD
COP and sector staff, it is possible that there are other relevant projects with good O&M systems
that were not identified. Finally, the scope of the study precluded field research that could have
helped validate findings and provide further insights.

1.4 Organization of Paper
13.	 This paper is organized into three main sections. Section I presents the background, ob-
jectives, scope, and limitations of the study. It also provides a general definition of O&M and
presents prototypical O&M arrangements for rural CDD and community-based subprojects.
Section II presents the detailed case studies for the seven selected projects. Section III summa-
rizes the conclusions from the review and recommends steps for moving ahead. Five annexes
provide extra background information, including the complete list of projects from which the
seven main case studies were selected, as well as: examples of maintenance requirements for
rural infrastructure; considerations for task teams planning for O&M design and implementa-
tion; sample O&M measures and timelines; and links to O&M materials.




6	   Therefore, such fees are generally not recommended, particularly in poor rural areas, where CDD operations are most com-
     mon.

               2.	 Defining Operations & Maintenance
               14.	 The definition of O&M varies depending on the system or type of infrastructure. Some in-
               frastructure types are more operations intensive, while others are more concentrated on main-
               tenance. However, a general definition customized for community infrastructure and applied
               for this analysis is outlined here.7
                      •	   Operations deal with the actual daily running of a system or service and include
                           the work and the operating costs (for example, rents, staffing, required materials or
                           inputs, utilities, and others). In the case of water supply subprojects, this could include
                           fees for technical service or for collecting user fees, fuel or electricity costs for pumps,
                           water treatment chemicals, and so forth. Infrastructure investments such as schools
                           or health clinics generally have significantly higher operating costs due to specialized
                           staff (teachers, midwives), supplies (books, medicines, and so forth), and other usual
                           costs (electricity, water, and so forth). However, these costs are generally assumed to
                           be covered by relevant sectoral ministries or local government authorities, and most
                           CDD projects require specific commitments from the responsible government agency
                           as a precondition of financing. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis, these
                           types of specialized inputs and resources required for day-to-day operations
                           and to ensure the delivery of the relevant health or education services are not
                           considered part of the O&M arrangements of these investments.
                      •	   Maintenance deals with the activities necessary to keep the system or infrastructure
                           in optimum working condition and to prevent delays, repairs, and/or downtime. There
                           are three types of maintenance:
                           •	   Preventive or routine maintenance8 is usually required on a regular basis, one
                                or more times a year, to maintain and keep the infrastructure in good working
                                condition. If performed correctly and regularly, routine maintenance can reduce
                                the need for periodic maintenance and rehabilitation, and sustain the life of the
                                infrastructure.
                           •	   Periodic maintenance covers more significant activities that are carried out once
                                every few years to ensure the smooth operation of the infrastructure, although
                                the timing intervals can vary depending on the type of infrastructure. Periodic
                                maintenance is generally more complex technically, can require specialized
                                equipment and skills, is more costly, and communities generally need support from
                                private contractors, the local government unit, or relevant government agency.
                           •	   Emergency maintenance involves urgently needed, and generally significant,
                                repairs in response to disastrous events such as floods, earthquakes, typhoons, or
                                conflict. This type of maintenance is not considered in this note.

3.	 Standard Elements of an O&M System for
    Rural CDD and Community-Based Projects
16.	 As part of a typical CDD project, and subproject design and implementation, communi-
ties are generally required to prepare an O&M plan as part of their proposal submission that
specifies the maintenance actions required; identifies the individuals, groups, or institutions re-
sponsible; and outlines the costs and financing arrangements. O&M plans are generally updat-
ed and finalized on completion of the subproject and formally agreed upon so that all parties
bear responsibility for their maintenance obligations.

17.	 O&M committees are typically established at the community level and trained by the
project. These committees are usually volunteers selected from the community and are estab-
lished prior to or during the construction phase, and are responsible for O&M-related arrange-
ments after infrastructure completion. Depending on the type of infrastructure, these commit-
tees take the form of community groups, user associations, parent-teacher associations, and so
forth. O&M committees can be informal or legally registered, depending on local laws. The O&M
committee is normally responsible for collecting community contributions, or user fees, based
on the agreement in the maintenance plan, and organizing and overseeing routine mainte-
nance of the infrastructure. Periodic maintenance can be handled by the community through
local contractors, procured by the committee, or with assistance from the local government,
municipality, or relevant agency if more substantial repairs are needed.

18.	 Communities will generally establish an O&M fund that is financed through fees collect-
ed from households based on fee structures established in the project’s maintenance plan, or
through periodic assessment. These fees usually go toward routine maintenance (generally
smaller, simpler, and less expensive) overseen at the community level, but sometimes toward
periodic maintenance (larger, more complex, and costly) as well.

19.	 Financing for operating costs varies by type of infrastructure. Operating costs for health
clinics and schools, which require a steady stream of specialized inputs to operate (for exam-
ple, nurses, doctors, teachers, supplies, and equipment) are normally covered by the relevant
local government unit or line ministry, although community members may pay small fees for
accessing these services. Other public goods infrastructure (such as roads) may have little or no
operating costs, while the operating costs for toll goods are generally recovered through user
fees. The type of infrastructure selected, therefore, has implications for how O&M is organized
and financed.

Project Description Summary
The National Solidarity Program (NSP) uses a typical CDD approach, within a challenging and volatile
environment, to improve the access of rural communities to social and productive infrastructure and
services and to strengthen locally elected community development councils (CDCs) to be effective
institutions for local governance and socioeconomic development. Begun in 2003 and currently in
its third phase (US$990 million), the program has financed a typical set of CDD subprojects in over
30,600 communities in transport, water supply and sanitation, irrigation and power, along with com-
munity centers, schools, health, and livelihoods. The project is currently developing a transition and
sustainability plan as NSP-3 comes to a close in September 2015.

Institutional, Implementation, and O&M Arrangements
The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development implemented this project through national
and provincial management units. At the provincial level, project implementation is supported by
Facilitating Partners9 who mobilize communities at the village level to form CDCs,10 which are the
units primarily responsible for the planning and execution of the subprojects, including O&M after
subproject completion. Subproject funds are transferred to CDC accounts maintained in provincial
bank branches. The Facilitating Partners support the community in preparing an O&M and cost-re-
covery plan and help with the selection and training of an O&M committee (prior to proposal com-
pletion), which is expected to ensure that subprojects are properly maintained after completion of
the infrastructure.
There are three designated methods for collecting O&M funds (any one or more of which can be
used by a village):11
       •	   User fees. Community members pay for a service (such as the provision of electricity or
            water). Fees are not set in advance and are only collected from community members who
            can afford to pay (as determined by the CDCs).
       •	   Regular collection. Community members contribute money regularly to a collection box
            for routine or periodic maintenance (or in the event of an unforeseen subproject breakdown
            caused by the failure of a key component or a natural disaster such as flooding).
       •	   Spontaneous. Community members contribute additional funds when a project breaks
            down or loses functionality (where no money is set aside in the collections box or if additional
            money must be raised following project breakdown or a natural disaster).




9	     The facilitating partners (international and national NGOs and private firms) have established staff capacities at the regional
       and district levels that include a trained network of social organizers, engineers, trainers, monitors, and provincial coordina-
       tors.

10	    The CDC is a community-based decision making body that includes a chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary, and treasurer.
       A project management committee and a procurement committee are also often established to support the CDC. CDCs were
       initially elected through a show of hands, but are now designed to be elected through a universal suffrage secret ballot elec-
       tion and to include women as part of the community representatives.

11	    However, less than one-third of the villages sampled in the sustainability evaluation collect fees, with most donating materials
       and labor toward O&M.

               Evidence and Elements of Successful O&M
               Evidence of Success
                   •	 A subproject sustainability study (2013) was conducted to assess the condition of assets built
                       under NSP 1 and 2, as well as the maintenance activities performed, and to understand the
                       variables that influenced the condition of the subprojects. The study looked at a sample of
                       100 subprojects (out of more than 55,000 completed through 2013) implemented over the
                       previous six years in mostly secure areas. The study found that 79 percent of the infrastructure
                       was functional—22 percent in good condition and 57 percent in poor condition12 due
                       to both lack of O&M and poor quality of construction and materials. Communities were
                       performing adequate or some maintenance on 58 percent of all infrastructure requiring
                       maintenance. Less technically complex subprojects (such as canals and irrigation systems)
                       tended to be better maintained than more complex subprojects, such as roads and water
                       supply systems, which were in poorer condition.13
                     •	   Subprojects implemented under NSP-2 were better maintained than those under NSP-1,
                          probably due to increased focus on planning, organizing, and mobilizing maintenance at
                          the community level.

               Elements of Success
                   •	 The project’s results framework has an indicator monitoring the number of completed
                      subprojects that have O&M plans in place, and the number of subprojects that are functional
                      and used by communities a year after completion.
                     •	   A realistic and technically viable O&M plan (including cost recovery, where required),
                          prepared by CDCs with support from Facilitating Partners, is needed for subproject approval.
                          The O&M committee also needs to be selected and trained before the subproject proposal
                          is finalized.
                     •	   The project creates awareness of the need for O&M through several channels including
                          videos on O&M issues that are shown by mobile cinemas in the villages and also aired on
                          local TV stations; radio features; and regular national conferences that enable CDCs to share
                          their experiences and learn from each other.
                     •	   Increased focus on technical training for Facilitating Partners and engineering staff and
                          simplification of O&M manuals.
                     •	   Second-block grants (which began in NSP-3) are made only to communities that are
                          successfully maintaining completed infrastructure from their earlier grants.

  Azerbaijan First and Second Rural Investment Projects
  (AzRIP1 and 2)

Project IDs: P076234, P122944 	                                                         Project Period: 2004–Ongoing

Project Description Summary
AzRIP is employing a CDD approach to improve the living standards of rural communities and
increase their access to infrastructure services. With AzRIP-2 (US$80 million including US$50 million
in additional financing), the project is expected to reach over 1,800 communities in 58 rayons across
the country. In addition to financing a typical range of CDD subprojects, including roads, potable
water, electricity, irrigation, health clinics, schools, and drainage, AzRIP-2 is scaling up livelihood
activities and launching a pilot connector roads initiative, engaging with clusters of communities
and improving rural road connectivity.

Institutional, Implementation, and O&M Arrangements
The project is implemented by the State Agency for Agricultural Credits in the Ministry of Agricul-
ture, which works through national and regional-level structures (Project Assistance Teams [PATs])14
for program management and implementation. The program is supported by regional and local
government—municipal, regional, and local executive committees (which represent the various
ministries and line agencies of government). PATs act as service providers, working closely with com-
munities throughout the subproject cycle.
Community groups (including the community engineer), facilitated by PATs and in partnership
with technical design companies,15 prepare maintenance plans and a cost-sharing formula for
maintenance of assets in conjunction with municipalities and service providers.16 Plans for cap-
ital reinvestment and medium- and longer-term maintenance are included in subproject de-
sign and updated on completion of the subproject. The O&M committee or user association
(selected at the start of the project and overseen by the community group) is responsible for
handling O&M and collecting fees after completion of construction. Fee collection varies by
type of subproject and by village, and the amount is based on the fee structure outlined in
the maintenance plan. For example, some villages collect user fees for water projects monthly,
while others do so annually. Fees for other types of subprojects (such as roads) are usually col-
lected on an as-needed basis.




14	   PATs consist of regional-level teams of consultant trainers, mobilizers and an engineer, and support several communities
      within the region.

15	   Technical design companies are hired by the project management unit. The project paid a fixed rate of US$3,600 to the design
      communities, plus an 18 percent value-added tax. The average subproject grant was US$55,000.

16	   Some communities set up a maintenance contribution fee structure based on usage (for example, households contribute
      to the potable water supply system depending on the number of family members). Similarly, in the case of roads, owners of
      heavy vehicles (for example, trucks and tractors) are expected to contribute more than owners of light vehicles and those who
      do not own a vehicle. This arrangement ensures that community members’ maintenance contributions reflect the extent to
      which they contribute to causing damage to the roads.

               Evidence and Elements of Successful O&M
               Evidence of Success
                   •	 According to the ICR for AzRIP-1, over 90 percent of its subprojects are still operational, and
                       some communities have engaged private contractors to oversee repairs and maintenance
                       (ICR 2012).
                     •	   A technical assessment of AzRIP-1 (2010) found 65 percent of the infrastructure to be in
                          good or excellent physical condition, and 35 percent in satisfactory condition (although
                          the latter were considered borderline and could become unsatisfactory in time if neglected
                          (Western World Consultants 2010).

                Elements of Success
                   •	 Before implementation can begin, the approval of a cooperation agreement by the
                      community, municipality, and project management unit (PMU) is required to confirm that
                      the O&M plan is feasible and that the communities and relevant agencies will fulfill their
                      maintenance obligations.
                   •	 The project hires technical design firms to help communities more effectively select projects.
                      These firms identify alternative technical solutions (for example, gravel rather than paved
                      roads) for each of the top three priorities and inform communities of associated lifecycle
                      costs, including investment costs, future maintenance costs, and number of beneficiaries.
                      The firms also help the communities prepare implementation, monitoring, and maintenance
                      plans.17
                   •	 Local governments and regional representatives of relevant ministries or agencies are
                      involved throughout the subproject cycle. Relevant agencies have to sign off when the
                      subproject is approved and confirm their responsibilities and their share of the maintenance
                      costs (as do the communities) when the subproject is completed and handed over to the
                      community.
                   •	 In addition to training the community groups and project engineers, the project also
                      provides technical workshops to strengthen the technical capacity of the design firms.
                   •	 There is a strong focus on learning. The project includes a community networking
                      strategy—a peer-to-peer learning initiative—that supports the sharing and dissemination
                      of best practices and lessons learned (including on O&M) and facilitates integration, business
                      relations formation, and cross-fertilization throughout AzRIP communities.
                   •	 The PMU visits a sample of the projects after subproject completion (20 percent after one
                      year and 10 percent after two years) to evaluate whether maintenance operations are
                      ongoing. Results are tracked through an indicator in the results framework.

  India Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project


Project ID: P090592	                                                                      Project Period: 2006–Ongoing

Project Description Summary
The Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (PRWSS, US$104 million) Project began implementa-
tion in December 2006 to assist government efforts to scale up a nationwide RWSS reform approach
by developing statewide projects. The PRWSS Project uses a demand-driven approach under which
rural water supply and sanitation schemes are constructed, operated and maintained by communi-
ties, and private connections and the use of water meters are encouraged. Project sustainability will
be based on its ability to generate adequate cash flows for future maintenance and repairs from the
villagers who are involved in the water supply and sanitation functions.

Institutional, Implementation, and O&M Arrangements
The project is implemented by the Punjab Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS),
which works closely with and provides technical support to the village-level gram panchayats (GPs)18
who are responsible for seeking project assistance from the DWSS. The GPs set up village water
and sanitation committees (GPWSCs)19 composed of elected and nonelected members who repre-
sent the user communities and are responsible for project implementation and O&M management
(including working out the water tariffs needed to fully cover the system’s O&M costs). The capital
expenditure funds for the schemes directly flow to the GPs. During the post-implementation phase,
the GPs are responsible for monitoring the sustainability of operations and ensuring that the GP-
WSCs conduct their O&M management functions (including levying and collecting sufficient user
charges).20 The GPWSCs are responsible for management of investment and O&M funds for all types
of village schemes.

Evidence and Elements of Successful O&M
Evidence of Success
    •	 O&M is satisfactory in most villages managed by communities (ISR, April 2014). Sixty-four
        percent of participating water and sanitation committees are meeting full O&M costs through
        user charges, and 73 percent have a medium or high rating for operational sustainability of
        their schemes.21
    •	 About 90 percent of consumers are paying their water bills regularly, and some villages now
        have a sizable savings in their O&M accounts, which are being reinvested in existing water
        systems.


18	   The gram panchayat (GP) is a local self-government institution at the village or small town level in India and consists of elected
      members.

19	   The GPWSC is a subcommittee under the GP and consists of both elected and nonelected members. The elected head of
      the GP is the Chairperson of the GPWSC, which has 11–21 members, with maximum of four elected representatives. The
      nonelected members are from the general village (gram sabha). The details of GPWSC’s composition, functions, and powers
      are elaborated in the project implementation plan.

20	   Water tariffs are devised to cover the system’s O&M costs in full (including salaries of the operator and cashier, electricity
      charges for pumping water, minor repairs, and routine maintenance). Meters are read monthly by the pump operator (and the
      cashier) in the presence of the consumer and a household’s monthly water bill averages between Rs. 70–120 (approximately
      US$1–US$2).

               Elements of Success
                   •	 On completion of construction, all subprojects are required to have a finalized O&M plan that
                      addresses technical, institutional and financial issues; an O&M budget that identifies specific
                      tariffs and tariff collection procedures; O&M back-up support for the user communities; and
                      various capacity-building activities.22
                     •	   The project’s results framework includes two indicators: the first tracks the percentage of
                          participating GPWSCs rated high or medium for scheme operational sustainability, and the
                          second tracks the percentage of participating GPWSCs meeting full O&M costs through user
                          charges.
                     •	   The promotion of private service connections contributes to the project’s financial
                          sustainability. As part of the pipe-laying process during construction of the subproject,
                          the district and water committees lay the groundwork for providing individual household
                          connections to avoid re-excavation of village roads when private connections are
                          requested. When a completed water scheme is taken over and operated and maintained
                          by the concerned water committee, it generally takes about six months to achieve financial
                          sustainability based on regular collection of user fees.
                     •	   Metering and billing are used to encourage people to save water and to more equitably
                          allocate costs with consumption.23 As of April 2014, over 300 villages (8 percent) had
                          individual connections for all households, while in 554 villagers (61 percent) at least 70
                          percent of households had individual connections.
                     •	   The project has a complaints redress system for village water supply schemes monitored
                          by a private agency, which includes a 24-hour toll-free number that users can call, and
                          an online complaints submission and tracking mechanism. The system helps check on
                          the performance of staff working in remote villages, improves the quality and speed of
                          the service delivered, and makes management of the water supply more transparent and
                          accountable.
                     •	   The project emphasizes the importance of training and information campaigns. Behavior
                          change communication materials have been developed to initiate dialogue on the need
                          for and advantages of safe drinking water in the village, as well as to explain the long-
                          term community commitment required to sustainably run the water systems. Post-
                          implementation O&M training is also conducted for GPWSCs, along with workshops on
                          improving sustainability for villages with underperforming schemes (focused on how to
                          deal with technical, financial, and O&M issues).

Project IDs: P105002, P108757, P115052, P122810, P128832                                   Program Period: 2007 – Ongoing

Project Description Summary
The PNPM national program builds on 10 years of successful CDD experience in the Kecamatan De-
velopment Program, which began implementation in 1998. The PNPM Rural Program was established
in 2007 and is a core component of PNPM Mandiri, the government of Indonesia’s main program for
community-based poverty alleviation efforts. PNPM Mandiri covers all rural villages (through PNPM
Rural, which is in its fifth phase, totaling US$2.5 billion to date) and urban wards (through PNPM
Urban) in Indonesia, and is one of the largest CDD programs in the world. The project finances typ-
ical CDD social and economic subproject investments including roads, water supply, irrigation and
drainage systems, schools, health clinics, and others.

Institutional, Implementation, and O&M Arrangements
PNPM Rural is implemented across five levels: national, provincial, district, subdistrict, and village.
The Directorate General for Community and Village Empowerment (PMD) is responsible for program
execution under the Ministry of Home Affairs. PMD is supported through the deployment of a com-
bination of national and regional management consultants and field-based facilitators who work
with the village teams. Project funds are transferred directly to a collective village account at the sub-
district level and then released for implementation of the approved subprojects. Village assemblies
choose several village teams (including a maintenance team) that are trained to support subproject
proposal preparation, implementation, and O&M. Several villagers are also selected and trained to
form an empowerment or technical cadre. Maintenance teams are responsible for collecting mainte-
nance fees, inspecting the infrastructure periodically (with assistance of technical staff ), and assign-
ing community members to conduct the required maintenance.24

Evidence and Elements of Successful O&M
Evidence of Success
      •	   A PNPM Mandiri Rural Infrastructure Technical Report Evaluation (2012) looked at a sample
           of subprojects completed between 2007 and 2011 (40 percent consisting of roads) and
           found that 96 percent of the infrastructure was of acceptable (14 percent) or high quality
           (82 percent). Additionally, 90 percent of the subprojects inspected were still functioning as
           intended and were being used by beneficiaries two to five years after completion. However,
           the study did find that a significant number of the subprojects (particularly roads, but also
           public buildings and water supply facilities) were adversely affected by poor drainage, which
           arose from poorly planned or implemented drainage infrastructure and not necessarily from
           poor maintenance.




24	   The time frame for collecting maintenance fees is agreed upon by each village. Maintenance fees are usually collected month-
      ly for toll goods infrastructure such as water supply, markets, and electricity. Fees for irrigation services are collected at harvest
      time, two or three times a year, and as needed for public goods such as roads, bridges, and drainage canals. However, the cost
      of maintaining infrastructure is estimated at approximately 2.8 percent of a household’s total consumption, and a November
      2010 World Bank study, Village Capacity in Maintaining Infrastructure Study: Evidence from Rural Indonesia, found limited
      financial capacity at the village level for road maintenance.

                          three volumes of simple picture books on infrastructure O&M. These volumes cover the

                          works; emphasize the importance of O&M activities; and outline what is needed for
                          maintenance, including the roles and responsibilities of key groups. Pictures showing
                          examples of “good”  and “bad” infrastructure identify the problems in the latter case and

                     •	   Based on past experience, the project has made concerted efforts over the years to improve
                          design quality and construction by using technical facilitators at the district and subdistrict
                          levels (in addition to social facilitators) to support villages during the design, preparation,
                          implementation, and maintenance stages.25 Given the nationwide scale of the program,
                          quality engineering support is still an issue in some areas; however, innovative methods
                          are being tested in some of the poorer provinces—such as the Barefoot Engineers program
                          in Papua, which trains local high school graduates to become technical engineers, thus
                          creating a local source of technical expertise that may be more likely to remain in place in a
                          competitive job market.
                     •	   Additionally, recognizing the important role that facilitators play in ensuring program
                          procedures are applied throughout subproject planning and implementation, a facilitator
                          certification program was developed in 2013. All facilitators (including technical facilitators)
                          are required to undergo three weeks of preservice training and twice a year attend week-
                          long refresher training.

  Nepal First and Second Rural Water Supply & Sanitation Projects
  (RWSSP I & II)

Project ID: P010516 and P071285 	                                                               Project Period: 1996–2012

Project Description Summary
The two phases of the Nepal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects (totaling US$42.6 million)
used a demand-driven approach to provide rural water supply and sanitation services to commu-
nities, who were involved in all stages of planning, implementation, operation, maintenance, and
monitoring and evaluation of the schemes, which included different types of WSS schemes, water
points, and sanitation units.

Institutional, Implementation, and O&M Arrangements
The projects were implemented at the national level by the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Fund Development Board (the Fund Board),26 which was responsible for overall oversight, in-
cluding policy implementation and project monitoring and implementation. At the local level,
district and village development committees (DDCs and VDCs) were involved in the formation
and registration of the user groups, the opening of user group bank accounts, and the resolu-
tion of community disputes. At the village level, the main implementing actors were water and
sanitation user groups and their respective user committees (WSUCs),27 which were assist-
ed by support organizations, generally national or international NGOs or private local firms. 28
The support organizations provided assistance on all aspects of the project, including technical
design appraisal, O&M, and periodic post-implementation support. WSUCs collected O&M funds
up front for the first year, followed by collection of monthly water tariffs from all users thereafter.29

Evidence and Elements of Successful O&M
Evidence of Success
      •	   The project undertook several short- and long-term sustainability studies after three
           and five years of completion of the different WSS schemes, which were implemented in
           batches (or groups) of villages. Results from long-term sustainability studies of schemes
           from batches I and II (6–10 years after completion) showed that 92 percent of the schemes
           were in good condition, with 78 percent assessed as fully sustainable.30 Infrastructure rated


26	   The Fund Board was established by the government of Nepal based on the experience of “JAKPAS,” a successful pilot project
      implemented in Nepal during 1993–96.

27	   The WSS user group is a legally registered body consisting of representatives of every household in the scheme area. The user
      group elects a WSS user committee (representing the community) to implement, operate, and maintain the RWSS facilities,
      including collection of up-front contributions and O&M funds.

28	   Support organizations are legally registered national or international NGOs or private sector firms selected to assist the user
      group and provide assistance on technical, financial, and social aspects of the project, including appraisal of technical design,
      O&M, and periodic support during the post-implementation phase.

29	   Household tariffs range from NPR 5 to 50 per month. Since most of the schemes are gravity schemes, the O&M costs are
      affordable for most households (ICR 2004).

30	   Using four major indicators related to sustainability (that is, institutional, social/environmental, financial and technical). Each
      indicator is broken down into a number of subindicators (for example, existence of user committees, level of participation, size
      of O&M funds, status of infrastructure, and others).

                          unsustainable included those damaged from floods, landslides, or water depletion. Design
                          and construction quality overall were rated very high (over 95 percent).
                     •	   Technical quality results (based on infrastructure condition and functionality) from the batch
                          II long-term sustainability study showed 22 percent of the schemes in excellent condition,
                          with 72 percent in fair to good condition. Results from batch V showed that 50 percent of the
                          schemes are functioning well, with 48 percent needing minor repairs.
               Elements of Success
                     •	   The project’s results framework tracked several indicators showing that O&M was being
                          adequately performed (for example, number of schemes functioning satisfactorily with
                          community O&M and the percentage of user committees reporting on post-implementation
                          status including repairs, fund collection, and frequency of meetings).
                     •	   District and village committees are fully involved in the planning and implementation of the
                          water schemes and, along with the user group and service provider, were required to sign
                          an agreement prior to scheme implementation indicating their commitment to fulfilling
                          their roles and responsibilities. The water schemes are also included in district plans, with
                          relevant authorities responsible for major rehabilitation or repair works that are beyond the
                          capacity of the community.
                     •	   Prior to the start of subproject implementation, the water user groups collected O&M funds
                          upfront from community members (3–4 percent of total scheme cost). These funds were
                          used to perform minor repairs as needed for the first year, after which monthly user fees
                          were collected.
                     •	   All water schemes hired a local village maintenance worker, who was trained and paid by
                          the user group. This aspect of the project was seen as one of the key factors contributing to
                          a high percentage of schemes’ functionality and sustainability.
                     •	   The user groups were also supported by Mother and Child Tap Stand Groups. These groups
                          were responsible for daily cleaning and maintenance of the tap stands and for helping to
                          collect user fees, another element that helped improve overall sustainability.
                     •	   To enhance long-term sustainability, RWSSP II provided post-implementation support,
                          under which the supporting organizations continued to provide refresher training and
                          technical support to the user committees for scheme-level problems that the community
                          was unable to resolve.
                     •	   Finally, the project piloted an insurance program in 36 schemes. The insurance program
                          was designed to help communities mitigate risks from natural disasters (for example,
                          earthquake, floods and landslides).31 While no claims have yet been made, this approach is
                          promising and there are plans to scale it up.

  Peru First and Second Rural Roads Projects and Decentralized Rural
  Transport Project (Rural Roads Program)

Project ID: P037047, P044601, P095570                         	                   Program/Project Period: 1995–2013

Project Description Summary
The Peru Rural Roads Program (through three phases, totaling US$185 million) was a countrywide
program focused on upgrading the condition of the rural road network (including nonmotorized
tracks) through the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and establishment of decentralized
mechanisms to sustainably maintain the infrastructure. Subproject selection was conducted through
a participatory planning process involving poor rural communities and other local stakeholders to
identify and prioritize rural infrastructure needs.

Institutional, Implementation, and O&M Arrangements
Institutional arrangements evolved over the three phases of the project as a result of the decentral-
ization process adopted by the government. During the first two phases, responsibility for project
implementation was with a central agency unit (Provias Descentralizado) within the Ministry of Trans-
port and Communication (MTC). Toward the end of the second phase, responsibility was transferred
to the municipalities at the provincial level through the creation of decentralized Provincial Road
Institutes (PRIs).32 During the third phase of the project, the central agency unit was responsible
for overseeing project implementation, channeling resources to local governments, and providing
management and technical assistance to the PRIs. Rehabilitation of rural roads was contracted out
by the PRI to private contractors, while subsequent routine maintenance was contracted out to
microenterprises formed under the program, supplemented as needed by periodic maintenance
contracted out to private companies. Finally, the improvement of nonmotorized transport tracks in
the most isolated and poorest communities was handled by locally formed road committees, with
technical and organizational support from local NGOs and district authorities.

Evidence and Elements of Successful O&M
Evidence of Success
      •	   The third phase of the project was rated as highly satisfactory in achieving its development
           objective of “reduced transport costs and better rural transport infrastructure” (ICR 2014).
           The ICR noted that the 3,277 km of rural roads that were rehabilitated received regular
           routine maintenance.

Elements of Success
      •	   Maintenance was an important focus of the program, and the project’s results framework
           included relevant O&M indicators (for example, number of qualified microenterprises
           created and delivering quality maintenance, and number of kilometers of rural roads
           periodically maintained at project standards).

32	   The Provincial Road Institute (PRI) is a decentralized unit in the provincial municipalities responsible for rural roads. PRIs are
      governed by a Provincial Road Board, which includes the provincial and district mayors, and their operating costs are covered
      by contributions from central government transfers and municipalities.

                          microenterprises was a successful approach used through all phases of the program.33
                          During the first 10 years of program implementation, microenterprises were contracted
                          directly to handle routine maintenance of roads at a fixed price. After this period, the bids
                          became competitive, with microenterprises competing with local construction firms for
                          maintenance contracts, and, in most cases, winning the bids. The performance incentive was
                          embedded in the results-based contracts, which imposed penalties if the roads were poorly
                          maintained. Since the microenterprise owners lived close to the roads being maintained,
                          they had a direct interest in maintaining them: they benefitted from the improved access
                          and the source of income.
                     •	   Institutions have been strengthened at several levels in the context of the national
                          decentralization reforms in Peru that started in 1993: (i) at the national level, through the
                          progressive evolution of Provias Descentralizado from an executing agency to a regulatory
                          agency; (ii) at the municipal level, the establishment of PRIs, which were piloted in selected
                          provinces during the second phase and designed to increasingly take over responsibilities
                          from the central agency and sustainably manage the maintenance and upgrading of the
                          rural roads under their jurisdiction;34 and (iii) at the community level, through the design
                          and implementation of inclusive participatory mechanisms (for example, prioritization
                          workshops) and institutions (microenterprises and rural roads committees for nonmotorized
                          tracks).
                     •	   Long-term project sustainability is linked to the establishment of a cofinancing mechanism.
                          By the end of the third phase of the project, the central government had funded two-thirds
                          of maintenance costs, with one-third financed by municipalities. Throughout the second
                          phase, the central agency worked actively with the Ministry of Economy and Finance to
                          make the budget transfer permanent. This was achieved in 2006 with a Supreme Decree
                          from the MTC, which makes the microenterprise model for routine maintenance sustainable.

                     members). The project financed all activities related to the promotion and forming of the microenterprises, as well as training
                     and back-up support. Project support included the recruitment of “road monitors”—young graduates (engineers, econo-

Project Description Summary
The KALAHI-CIDSS/NCDDP applies a typical CDD approach to empower communities and improve
access to services in the poorest municipalities in the Philippines. In 2014, the government negoti-
ated a US$479 million IBRD loan to help extend the project to cover all of the estimated 847 poorest
municipalities in the country.36 The project finances a typical set of social and economic subproj-
ect investments including: water systems, health stations, school buildings, farm-to-market roads,
bridges, drainage and flood control structures, irrigation canals, community enterprise facilities, and
others.

Institutional, Implementation, and O&M Arrangements
The project is implemented by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), which
works through national, regional, and municipal-level structures for project management and im-
plementation. At the municipal level, area coordination teams (consisting of a coordinator, an en-
gineer, a finance officer, and community facilitators) oversee and support subproject planning and
implementation at the village level (referred to as barangays). Area coordination teams are housed
in the local (municipal) government unit and work closely with municipal administrative and sec-
toral staff. Subproject funds are transferred to village accounts and managed by community volun-
teers. Arrangements for O&M can vary across subprojects. O&M groups can be formed from existing
community-based organizations, selected by the village committees from volunteers, or elected by
consumers (for example, for water supply subprojects). In the case of roads, bridges, and drainage
facilities, barangay LGU infrastructure committees are responsible for maintenance and annually al-
locate sufficient funds. User fees or tariffs are calculated during the design stage and updated prior
to construction completion.

        generally in place for pump-driven water systems, day care centers, school buildings and
        health centers, while less so for roads and gravity-fed water systems. A 2014 aide-memoire

               38	   The sustainability plan or maintenance program typically outlines the general monthly, quarterly, and yearly activities that they
                     think are required to keep the infrastructure in good and operational condition. The plan also contains estimated costs and
                     the possible sources of funding to undertake the maintenance program.
    Section III: Overview of
    Good Practices and Lessons
    Learned

20.	 This section presents the findings and lessons learned primarily based on the selected
case study projects, as well as other World Bank and non–Bank projects. Specific examples of
successful or innovative O&M arrangements or systems are shown under each area of analysis,
with links to relevant materials where available.

21.	 The discussion is broken down into the four areas of analysis introduced earlier: organi-
zational and institutional arrangeme.nts; capacity building; financing; and technical consider-
ations. However, it is important to emphasize that all themes are closely interrelated, and evi-
dence indicates that all need to be in place to have a successful O&M system. Sustainability is a
process that runs through all stages of the lifecycle of a given infrastructure, starting with plan-
ning and continuing through the design and construction and different O&M arrangements
post-construction. If there are problems with the design or construction quality, no amount of
good maintenance will compensate.

1. Organizational and Institutional Arrangements
22.	 Long-term institutional and organizational structures for O&M arrangements that
clearly define and delineate the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, are key to sus-
taining rural infrastructure. This can be a challenge for some public goods projects (roads and
bridges), where a common problem is lack of clarity over who owns or has the responsibility
for managing the infrastructure. All projects with successful O&M indicated that organizational
arrangements for O&M were in place and functioning at subproject completion. Yet another
obstacle reported by many projects was difficulty in obtaining adequate support from local
government authorities, line ministries, and/or private organizations.

               O&M Committees

               23.	 In all of the case studies, user groups or committees were set up at the start of the sub-
               project and trained to supervise subproject implementation, monitor subproject condition, and
               organize and carry out maintenance activities. Furthermore, all projects had prepared plans for
               O&M interventions.39 Various methods are used for setting up O&M committees: elected com-
               munity or village groups can select from among community volunteers with relevant O&M
               technical skills (for example, the Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project [AzRIP] and Indonesia’s
               National Program for Community Empowerment [PNPM]); committee members can be elected
               by the community (common for water supply subprojects as in Nepal’s Rural Water Supply and
               Sanitation [RWSS] Project, Nicaragua’s RWSS Project, and the Philippines KALAHI-CIDSS Project;
               or through a mix of elected and nonelected members (for example, India’s Punjab RWSS Proj-
               ect).

               24.	 Experiences suggest that the existence of a well-functioning O&M committee is an im-
               portant factor for continued infrastructure maintenance. Specifically, findings from the Afghan-
               istan National Solidarity Program (NSP 1–3) showed that the formation of an O&M committee
               has had a strong and positive impact on the physical condition and functionality of subprojects,
               as well as on maintenance activities. According to the project’s sustainability report, subprojects
               were more than twice as likely to be properly maintained in communities with O&M committees
               compared to those without.40 Similarly, findings from Indonesia’s PNPM in Rural Areas (PNPM
               Rural) show that villagers’ willingness to contribute labor or cash to a project are positively and
               significantly correlated with the responsiveness of the O&M committee in immediately address-
               ing reported infrastructure problems. However, there was also evidence from PNPM that O&M
               was carried out in communities without functioning O&M committees at the same level as in
               communities with committees, so the context and culture within the local community also con-
               tribute to how maintenance arrangements can be organized.

               Water Supply Infrastructure

               25.	 The two water supply project case studies in India and Nepal established user groups
               that were legally registered and responsible for collecting user fees from community members
               and managing routine or periodic maintenance activities. In these cases, the user groups hired
               private workers or contractors (from the fee income collected) to undertake O&M activities.
               Box 1 illustrates the institutional arrangements in the Nepal RWSS Project.

               26.	 The establishment of O&M committees is reasonably common, and evidence indicates
               that they are sustained in the short-term during the construction and early implementation
               phases (usually over a 12–18 month period). O&M responsibilities, however, are longer term,
               and the organizational requirements for O&M groups are different post-construction. It may
               prove harder to keep these groups functioning, especially if they primarily consist of volunteers.
               In general, findings suggest that there is more success in sustaining O&M institutions for


               39	   See annex 4 for sample TORs and O&M plans.

               40	   The formation of an O&M committee also had a significant impact on subproject condition and functionality. Fifty-nine per-
                     cent of the subprojects reviewed that were considered functional and in good condition had an O&M committee, compared
                     to 35 percent of subprojects that were functional and in poor condition (Altai Consulting 2013).
                                                                 Section III: Overview of Good Practices and Lessons Learned • 31




      Box 1. Institutional Arrangements in the Nepal Rural Water Supply and
              Sanitation Project

      The Nepal RWSS Project created water supply user groups (WSUGs) to represent the community, coordinate with local
      government authorities, manage the construction of civil works, and collect O&M fees. WSUGs are registered as co-
      operatives and have 9–13 members (at least one-third must be female, and with representatives from indigenous groups
      and lower castes) who are elected by the community during the subproject planning stage. These user groups are the main
      implementing institutions at the community level and are responsible for planning, implementation, and O&M of the water
      supply schemes. The groups coordinate closely with local government authorities (village and district development com-
      mittees), who play an active role in helping to form and register the user groups, open bank accounts, provide training,
      and mitigate disputes. WSUGs manage the construction of civil works (assisted by NGOs) and collect O&M fees up front to
      cover estimated costs for the first year, after which monthly water tariffs are collected from community members based on
      revised estimates of annual O&M costs. WSUGs are supported by Mother and Child Tap Stand Groups, which were formed
      and trained after construction of the water schemes. These groups are responsible for daily cleaning and maintenance of
      tap stands and for helping to collect monthly user fees. Each water scheme also hired a village maintenance worker, paid
      monthly by the WSUGs, to take care of routine maintenance and minor repairs. The final sustainability study for the project
      found that more than 90 percent of the WSUGs are sustainable (as measured by holding meetings at least annually)a and are
      maintaining records of key decisions.

      a. The same study found that 40 percent of user groups met at least quarterly.


toll good infrastructure when access or use can be easily limited or controlled. Findings
from a 2006 survey conducted for the Philippines KALAHI-CIDSS Project showed that 70 percent
of surveyed road subprojects had an O&M association, compared to 93 percent of water supply
subprojects (Araral and Holmemo 2007).41

Other O&M Institutional Arrangements

27.	 In some cases, O&M responsibilities are spun off to small-scale enterprises or contractors,
at times trained by the project, and hired by the community or relevant sector agency to ensure
timely maintenance activities are performed. The Peru Rural Roads Project (box 2) is a successful
example of the creation of community-level microenterprises for routine road maintenance, ef-
fectively addressing the challenge of keeping isolated rural roads well maintained while
also generating local employment. More detailed information on these microenterprises can
be found in the Peru case study in Section II.

Links between Community and Local/Subnational Governments

28.	 In many projects, O&M arrangements involve close links to local government units (LGUs)
and/or subnational line ministries. In the Nepal RWSS Project, the district and village develop-
ment committees along with the water user committees and service providers, sign an agree-
ment prior to project implementation that specifies the roles and responsibilities of each entity
throughout the project, including for O&M. In AzRIP, local governments and regional repre-

     Box 2. Use of Microenterprises in Routine Maintenance of Rural Roads in Peru

     One of the innovative design features of the Peru Rural Roads Program was to create, train, and support microenterprises
     at the community level to carry out routine maintenance activities on rehabilitated roads, such as filling potholes, clearing
     vegetation, cleaning drainage, removing small obstacles and doing general emergency work, particularly during the rainy
     season. These microenterprises are legally registered entities consisting of 10–25 people from neighboring rural communities
     who are responsible for the maintenance of a 10–25 km road segment. The microenterprises consist of a core group of perma-
     nent members (selected by local authorities after a lengthy consultation process with the communities) along with seasonal
     workers from the community who live near the road sections to be maintained and are contracted on a three-month basis (to
     allow jobs and wage benefits to be shared). On-the-job training in technical and business administration skills is provided to
     the microenterprises by “road monitors” (young university graduate engineers, economists, or social scientists) contracted for
     one year. During the first 10 years of program implementation, these microenterprises were directly contracted (single source)
     by the local governments to handle routine maintenance of roads at a fixed price. After this period, contracting was made
     competitive with local construction firms. In most cases, the project-formed microenterprises have been successful in winning
     the maintenance contracts.a An additional benefit of this approach is that members of the microenterprises live close to the
     target roads and directly benefit from the roads being well maintained. These enterprises have also become contact points for
     extension services and have helped to mobilize untapped local resources for local community ventures.

     Source: Case Study

     a. By the end of the third phase (Peru Decentralized Rural Transport Project), there were 857 microenterprises maintaining
     16,867 km of roads (an average of 20 km per microenterprise) in 143 provinces



                sentatives of relevant ministries are required to sign off when the subproject is approved and
                confirm their responsibilities and their share of the maintenance costs when the subproject is
                completed and handed over.42

                29.	 Such links with LGUs and sector agencies are considered key to long-term investment sus-
                tainability, and often lead to the mobilization of additional funds for the project. For instance,
                evidence in both the Nepal and Azerbaijan projects shows that additional financing was allocat-
                ed by municipalities and the central government toward maintenance costs. The Nepal RWSS
                Project closely monitors these additional resources and found that 16 percent of community
                subprojects had successfully raised additional funds, while a further 20 percent have initiated
                such links. In AzRIP, municipalities and the central government provided additional O&M funds
                as well as additional operational support (health equipment) totaling approximately 7.5 percent
                of overall subproject financing.

                2. Capacity-Building and Training Support
                30.	 The effectiveness of O&M committees and user groups to organize and manage
                O&M activities is determined to a considerable extent by their managerial and organiza-
                tional capacity. Not surprisingly, if O&M committee members and other stakeholders do not
                have the right set of organizational and technical skills to oversee the required O&M activities, or
                do not understand the importance of maintaining their infrastructure subprojects, the physical
                condition of the infrastructure will suffer. Training for maintenance teams should cover techni-

                                                                   Section III: Overview of Good Practices and Lessons Learned • 33




cal issues (how, when, and where to implement maintenance activities), as well as managerial
aspects (how to organize the teams and fund collection and management). Findings from the
Afghanistan NSP show that community development councils, when receiving some form of
O&M training and shown how and when to maintain a project, were 21 percent more likely to
maintain subprojects in satisfactory condition. All projects reviewed included capacity building
and training for O&M committees and technical staff. However, to be fully effective, this study
found that capacity building should be more frequent and scheduled both before infrastructure
is completed (which is more common) and after (when O&M activities become a reality).

31.	 AzRIP explicitly engages technical staff and firms outside of the project communities to
work with the communities to improve the design and sustainability of the subprojects. Az-
RIP extends training (including O&M) beyond community groups to the project engineers and
consultant design firms who provide the communities with design options and assist them in
preparing monitoring, implementation, and maintenance plans.43 The design options include
an assessment of short- and long-term O&M costs for different subproject types that enables
the communities to select the best option that balances short-term needs with longer-term fi-
nancial realities. By strengthening the technical capacity of these firms and generating connec-
tions between the private sector and communities, the project was able to improve subproject
O&M. AzRIP has also successfully used peer-learning events (more than 200 during the current
project) both within and across regions to improve overall project management, specifically
including topics dealing with O&M, such as “The Role of the Monitoring Group,” “Sustainability
and Maintenance of Community Projects,” and “Collaboration with Government Structures.”

32.	 The Nicaragua RWSS Project provides additional evidence on the importance of capacity
building for O&M success. The project put in place a sophisticated structure for supporting ca-
pacity building from the national level down to the community level (referred to as a “sustain-
ability chain”). This structure, and the capacity-building activities it supports, is credited with
more than doubling the numbers of local WSS groups in the project municipalities that are
working in a sustainable way, enhancing the functionality of the systems and preventing a pre-
mature need for reconstruction/rehabilitation.44 Under the second phase of the project (which
became effective end-July 2014), US$4.7 million (27 percent of the Bank’s loan) is dedicated to
institutional strengthening of the WSS sector, with capacity-building activities focused particu-
larly at the municipality and community levels.

33.	 As part of these capacity-building efforts, some projects have developed innovative us-
er-friendly manuals to aid communities in performing O&M activities (box 3).

34.	 In certain cases, awareness raising and behavior change of the public at large can also
help sustain infrastructure investments. For instance, the water and sanitation projects in Nepal
and India promote the maintenance of infrastructure by teaching community members about
the importance of clean and sustainable water sources. The India Rural Water Supply and San-
itation Project (Punjab State) raised awareness by distributing flyers and booklets and putting


43	   AzRIP Training Program.

44	   The second phase of the project, Nicaragua Sustainable Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (2014), plans an
      impact evaluation that will assess the impact of municipal strengthening on the functionality and sustainability of the water
      systems.
34 • Operations and Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure in Community-Driven Development and Community-Based Projects




     Box 3. “Good” and “Bad” Infrastructure Manuals

     The PNPM Project in Indonesia has produced O&M manuals (The Good and The Bad Infrastructure, Volumes 1, 2, and 3 with
     examples of different types of small-scale infrastructure (for example, roads, bridges, buildings, irrigation, and so forth) and
     related O&M activities. The manuals contain photographs showing examples of well- and poorly implemented infrastructure,
     along with easy instructions for making repairs. The manuals are intended for both communities and municipality staff re-
     sponsible for O&M, and can be used for training or for implementation guidelines.

     The Bangladesh Local Governance Support Project has produced the Bangladesh Handbook on Improving Rural Infrastructure
     Services, which is a collection of good practices (with pictures and simple text) on the design, construction, and maintenance
     of roads, culverts, drains, and embankments for use by project staff and communities.

     The O&M Section of Nepal RWSS Operations Manual, along with the post-construction guidelines, clearly lays out the impor-
     tance of O&M and the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders.

     Source: Case Studies



                up posters linked to each stage of the project’s lifecycle, including O&M management, and
                provided water-testing kits, which initiated dialogue on the need for safe drinking water. The
                communication materials and ongoing dialogue have helped promote the advantages of safe
                drinking water and gain the long-term commitment needed from communities to sustainably
                operate and maintain the water systems. These materials have also sensitized villagers to the
                importance of water conservation and made them more willing to pay for services and do their
                part to ensure good O&M management of the water supply schemes.

                35.	 The review found that the impacts of capacity-building activities appear to be lim-
                ited by their short-term duration and timing—generally during subproject implementation,
                rather than during post-construction when O&M becomes necessary. The Nepal Rural Water
                and Sanitation Project recognized and addressed this problem by providing post-implementa-
                tion funding for two years for organizations (local NGOs that provide organizational and tech-
                nical support to communities and user groups) to provide communities with support for O&M
                problems that they are unable to resolve on their own. This allows the support organizations
                to conduct periodic follow-up, sustainability monitoring visits, and provide technical support
                during the post-implementation phase. In AzRIP, the regional design firms were also available
                to provide post-implementation O&M technical support on demand to communities, while
                the Laos Poverty Reduction Fund Project visits a sample of subprojects at 6 and 12 months
                post-construction to observe the O&M and provide technical guidance.

                3. Financing
                36.	 For O&M to be effective, sustainable financing mechanisms must be established. For this
                to happen, the review found three key questions that need to be answered: which O&M costs
                are to be financed (for example, operations and minor repairs versus major repairs or capital
                costs), how O&M costs will be financed after subproject completion (for example, revenue col-
                lection mechanisms such as user fees), and whose responsibility it will be to pay for O&M (for ex-
                ample, communities and/or local government authorities). Equally important is how, and how
                well, O&M funds are managed. A guiding principle for maintaining CDD infrastructure at the
                                                                    Section III: Overview of Good Practices and Lessons Learned • 35




community level is to make realistic estimates of communities’ needs and financing capacity (in
cash and in-kind) for O&M.

37.	 Community financing of operations and routine maintenance activities over the
short term is less of an issue than long-term financing, which must cover higher costs for pe-
riodic maintenance and other major repairs that are usually performed by outside contractors.
However, O&M financing can be more challenging for public goods than for toll goods, where
access to the goods is easier to control and collection of user fees more widely accepted. In this
context, evidence of successful financial O&M arrangements across the materials reviewed is
particularly strong in the water and sanitation sector. Water and sanitation–related infrastruc-
ture often collect user fees, compared to, for example, rural roads projects. The case studies
and literature for water supply and sanitation provide many examples of relatively successful
cost-sharing mechanisms and innovative ways of collecting and sharing some of the O&M costs.

Estimating O&M Costs

38.	 Estimating costs is challenging for many programs. The review found that communities
usually require support in accurately estimating O&M costs, which will vary by type of invest-
ment, technology/design options, and local conditions.45 Sharing such information at the sub-
project planning/prioritization stage, as under AzRIP, enables communities to make informed
decisions about infrastructure based on both need and long-term costs. Estimates from the
Philippines KALAHI-CIDSS indicate that that O&M annual costs range from 2.4 percent of the
capital cost for a gravity-fed water supply scheme to 2.8 percent for a health clinic (excluding
costs for personnel and supplies; Araral and Holmemo 2007).46 Table 2 presents estimates for
other types of projects based on data from this review.

      plan and cost estimate should be prepared.

46	    KALAHI-CIDSS/NCDDP included the costs for staff and supplies when calculating O&M costs for schools (44 percent) and
      health clinics (27 percent), but these costs have been excluded in the estimates reflected in table 2, in keeping with standard
      methods of calculating O&M for buildings.

     Box 4. Planning for O&M Sustainability in Azerbaijan

     The Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project (AzRIP) uses simple economic analysis to assist communities in making informed de-
     cisions about their infrastructure priorities. To help the communities decide which investments to prioritize, technical design
     firms (hired by the project) prepare alternative technical solutions for each of the top three or four priorities and inform the
     communities of the full costs (including O&M costs) and benefits of the investment options.a After deciding which infrastruc-
     ture project to prioritize, communities develop detailed annual maintenance plans based on estimated maintenance costs
     over the life of the investments. This allows communities to better prepare for future maintenance costs through different
     financing and cost-sharing mechanisms. The fact that over 90 percent of road rehabilitation subprojects (covering more than
     2,000 km) were found to still be operational at the end of AzRIP 1 suggests that using O&M costs to guide subproject selection
     is having a positive impact on sustaining O&M.

                39.	 In the case of AzRIP, O&M was an integral part of the subproject prioritization and techni-
                cal design processes, and communities were assisted by technical design firms to more effec-
                tively select subprojects by balancing their short-term needs with longer-term financial realities
                and in a way that maximized sustainability and the number of beneficiaries (box 4).

                O&M Fund Collection Mechanisms

                40.	 Unsurprisingly, establishing and capitalizing a formal O&M “fund,” and doing so in
                advance of any significant O&M costs, appears to make longer-term O&M arrangements
                more likely to be sustained.47 Findings from the Afghanistan NSP show that user groups or
                committees with a system to collect user fees are more likely to perform adequate maintenance
                activities than communities where no user fee is collected.48 In all of the seven case studies,
                O&M funds for the first year were established and capitalized up-front through either commu-
                nitywide contributions or by levying user fees. In setting up such a fund, however, projects are
                faced with two important issues: (i) how to calculate the user fee or contribution that should be
                made by individuals or households, and (ii) how to ensure that people pay as agreed.

                41.	 Obviously, some subproject investments and related services that can be metered or ob-
                jectively measured (water, electricity, and irrigation) make calculating use and associated fees
                simple. In other cases, or in the absence of appropriate infrastructure or technology, other cus-
                tomized measures are commonly used, such as fees for many services on a per household basis;
                per number of children (school); by type of vehicle (roads); or number of hectares (irrigation).
                Furthermore, some fees are levied or assessed on an ad hoc or as needed basis, often based on
                the estimated cost of a certain repair or upgrade. Allocating these costs within a community


                47	   Up-front collection of O&M funds by the water user committees is considered to be one of the contributing factors to the
                      success of the Nepal RWSS Project. Minor repairs were/are undertaken by the committees using this fund, ranging from 3–4
                      percent of total scheme cost, depending on technology choice.

                48	   A 2013 sustainability study of the project showed that 42 percent of effectively maintained subprojects were managed by
                      communities that had instituted a system to collect user fees, and that 80 percent of the poorly maintained subprojects were
                      managed by communities that did not collect user fees.

  Box 5. Various Approaches to Water System O&M Fee Collection
  Private service connections in the Punjab. The India Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Punjab State) has been
  successful in operating and maintaining its water supply schemes and meeting the full O&M costs through user charges.a
  About 90 percent of consumers pay their water bills regularly, and some local water committees have sizable savings in their
  O&M accounts. Two key factors to the project’s success are (i) the promotion of private service connections, and (ii) individual
  metering and billing, which encourage people to save water, prevent waste, and only pay for what they use. Village water and
  sanitation committees set the water tariffs to cover O&M costs in full, maintain the accounts, oversee billing and collection,
  supervise and manage the pump operator, and hold nonpayers accountable. Meters are read monthly by the pump operator
  (and the cashier) in the presence of the consumer; monthly household water bills average Rs. 70–120 (approximately US$1–
  US$2).b

  Collecting water user fees in Nepal in the absence of meters. The Nepal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project did
  not use private connections and metering. Instead, the local water user committees collected O&M funds for the first year
  upfront (1 percent of the total scheme cost) to cover minor repairs, followed by collection of monthly user fees (generally
  NRs 30, or approximately US$0.30 per household) to cover the costs of regular repair and maintenance, pay the maintenance
  workers, and also cover future rehabilitation and extension costs. User fees were estimated at 3 percent of investment costs
  for gravity schemes, and 4 percent for groundwater schemes. Regular collection of these fees has contributed to the schemes’
  success—96 percent of which were found to be sustainable 3–5 years after completion. The study credits the Mother and
  Child Tap Stand Groups—which exert effective peer pressure on their fellow women community members to both pay fees,
  act appropriately to conserve the taps, and protect water quality—and the contracted community workers with the overall
  sustainability of the schemes.c

  Using social capital to ensure fee collection and positive O&M behaviors. The Maharashtra State Jalswarajya Project in
  India uses a different model for collecting user fees in water projects. The model (called Khambegaon) is based on entrusting
  women and local self-help groups (SHGs) with the responsibility of water tax collection and day-to-day O&M of the water
  supply scheme. The SHGs collect an advance of Rs. 100 (approximately US$1.50), followed by monthly collections of a flat rate
  of Rs. 30 (approximately US$0.50) per household. It was implemented successfully (90 percent collection rate) and replicat-
  ed in 235 other villages across Maharashtra. The high collection rate is the result of good communication with households
  explaining the importance of the user fees, as well as the incentive for the SHGs—who were allowed to control 80 percent of
  the funds collected for regular operation of the water supply schemes, and surpluses could be used for income-generating
  activities. The 20 percent balance went to a maintenance fund managed by the gram panchayat (local government unit).d

could draw on any one of the customized measures, or draw on other data such as the well-be-
ing of households.

42.	 Once the amount of fees have been determined, another challenge communities often
face is how to ensure that all individuals or households pay their respective fees or contribu-
tions. Several projects reviewed (Nepal RWSS, Pakistan NWFP Community Infrastructure, and
the Romania Rural Development Projects) require that an O&M fund be established and cap-
italized (generally for a year of O&M expenses) as a precondition for approval of a subproject,
which places considerable pressure on a community and individual beneficiaries to contribute
as agreed. Systems that can restrict access to services (most commonly in the cases of water,
electricity, or irrigation) in the event of nonpayment are generally effective in ensuring a reason-
ably high level of compliance, as long as the service remains reliable (box 5). In the event that
restricting access to a given structure or service is technically or socially impractical, successful
38 • Operations and Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure in Community-Driven Development and Community-Based Projects




               O&M systems have also used social networks and peer pressure to ensure adequate fundraising
               (box 5).

               43.	 User fees and contributions depend on the communities’ ability and willingness to
               pay. As suggested previously, willingness to pay is linked to the type of infrastructure, its rela-
               tive demand among the community members or users, and the extent to which access can be
               measured and restricted. However, even when toll goods are not metered, community mem-
               bers are willing to pay regular fees for services, such as water supply, when they perceive a direct
               benefit. Nonetheless, it is easier to charge and collect user fees for toll goods than for public
               goods infrastructure, where access to benefits is difficult to restrict and therefore incentives to
               pay are weakened.

               44.	 While metering and collecting user fees for toll goods are easier, it is not impossible
               to employ these approaches to other types of infrastructure, although successful exam-
               ples are rare (and generally nontypical, both from economic and social perspectives). The best
               example is AzRIP, where some communities collect user fees for maintenance of local roads
               based on usage and type of household vehicle (which serves as a proxy for road usage). There
               are some ad hoc reports of other projects where user fees are applied to the types of public
               infrastructure often exempted from such fees. Afghanistan NSP reports that some communities
               are collecting fees for the repair of roads, and, in the Philippines’ KALAHI-CIDSS Project, tolls
               are often applied for bridge subprojects based on the types of users (car, motorcycle, bicycle,
               person, and so forth).

               45.	 Community contributions to routine maintenance can also come in the form of paid or
               unpaid labor. Evidence from Afghanistan NSP indicates that where routine maintenance “costs”
               primarily involve labor (for example, canals, culverts, retaining walls, and unpaved roads), the
               infrastructure is more likely to be better maintained. In addition, and not surprisingly, NSP data
               suggest that community members’ ability and willingness to pay also depend on the overall
               cost of O&M, which is linked to the technical complexity of the subprojects. Where subprojects
               were more technically complex and maintenance costs higher, subprojects were less likely to
               be functional and in good condition. However, data from Afghanistan NSP and Indonesia PNPM
               show that when maintenance can be conducted using donated, unskilled, labor, it is more likely
               to happen. However, project arrangements that encourage labor donated by residents, partic-
               ularly for recurring maintenance activities, can prove contrary to other project objectives such
               as poverty reduction, short-term employment generation, and wage transfer. There is also a risk
               that the labor burden will fall on the more disadvantaged, less powerful households for which
               labor is their primary asset.

               Cost-Sharing Mechanisms

               46.	 Even if funds are collected regularly and managed properly by communities, they may
               not prove sufficient for long-term infrastructure maintenance requirements. Findings from Af-
               ghanistan NSP, Indonesia PMPM, and the India Maharashtra Water Supply Projects confirm that,
               even if communities can cover short-term financing related to minor operational and routine
               maintenance costs, some degree of external financial support or cost sharing is needed for pe-
               riodic maintenance. Regular and operational costs for services such as health care or education,
               and for other more costly periodic or emergency maintenance (where communities would not

      Local government budget allocations for O&M activities in Sri Lanka. To further strengthen the O&M strategy of the Sri
      Lanka Community Development and Livelihood Improvement (GemiDiriya) Project (2004–14), all local government institu-
      tions agreed to allocate a minimum of 10 percent of their annual budget for O&M activities. While this agreement has only
      been in operation since early 2014, nine local governments have approved 2014 budgets with an average allocation of 15
      percent for O&M. In addition, for the first time, O&M units are being systematically established in each local government

      bridges). Municipal allocations for O&M are usually charged against the municipality development fund and contributions
      vary across municipalities.b This can also be supplemented as needed by specific revenue collection and cost-sharing mecha-

agencies or local governments. For this purpose, CDD programs generally require that the for-
mal commitment of the relevant government unit is secured at the time subprojects are ap-
proved. Though such commitment49 is not a guarantee that the relevant authorities can or will
fulfill all relevant O&M responsibilities, explicit links to and support from local governments or
line agencies are widely seen by CDD practitioners as necessary to ensure the sustainability
of community infrastructure. There are several examples among the projects reviewed where
these links have led to commitment, which in turn led to successful and sustained O&M systems.

47.	 Furthermore, findings from the case studies indicate that O&M appears to be more suc-
cessful and sustainable in projects that have established a link between O&M committees and
local government authorities and/or line ministries to assist with costs (box 6). This approach is
promising, although in some cases (for example, Sri Lanka and Mongolia), it is still too early to
know whether the cost-sharing arrangements will work in practice and if the budget transfers
are sufficient to cover long-term maintenance costs.

term O&M support for rural infrastructure through the allocation of government funds (box 7).

     The Sustainable Livelihood Project (SLP) in Mongolia has improved basic services at the local level through the construction,
     rehabilitation, and renovation of basic infrastructure (schools, hospitals, cultural centers, kindergarten, street lighting, and
     so forth). A significant outcome of the second phase of the project was the passage, in December 2011, of a budgetary law
     that created the Local Development Fund (LDF), modeled in part on the SLP, which allocated funds to all districts (soums) for
     local-level community development starting in 2013. The Third SLP has recently been approved (June 2014) and is designed
     to support the transparent implementation and institutionalization of the LDF, using participatory budgeting to respond to
     community priorities, and to help maintain rural public facilities and infrastructure financed under SLP-2. While it is still too
     early to measure the results, it is expected that O&M of infrastructure built under the earlier phases of the project will be sus-
     tainable as a result of the LDF.

     Box 8. Private Sector Involvement in O&M in India’s Punjab RWSS

     As more and more villages in Punjab take over responsibility for the O&M of their water supply systems, performance has
     been mixed; while many gram panchayat water supply and sanitation committees (GPWSCs) are performing well (particularly
     under the World Bank–funded RWSS project), others are facing challenges. A study was commissioned by the World Bank in
     2012 to assess different PPP arrangements in the rural water and sanitation sector in Punjab and compare them with non-
     PPP initiatives, including those managed by the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS), gram panchayats, and
     GPWSCs. The different private sector arrangements reviewed included:
        •	   annual contracting of a private operator by DWSS to manage the O&M of water supply schemes for a cluster of
             villages, with tariffs set and collected by DWSS;
        •	   long-term PPP contracts for construction and O&M of water treatment plants covering groups of villages;
        •	   three-year contracting by GPWSC of a private operator to manage O&M, including billing and collecting user fees; and
        •	   PPP contracts for development and O&M of sewage schemes.
     The study found that: (i) private agencies have the lowest per capita cost in undertaking O&M of water supply schemes; (ii)
     the local water and sanitation committees (GPWSCs) are more efficient in collecting revenue and ensuring coverage and
     continuity of water supply within villages; and (iii) local governments (gram panchayats) and DWSSs have the worst collection
     efficiency and higher per capita O&M costs (The study confirms that O&M of village water supply schemes can be successfully
     managed by community groups (GPWSCs) with full cost recovery, but recommends that, for individual villages or multivillage
     schemes where O&M is less successful, it can be improved by contracting private operators using performance-based man-
     agement contracts. a

  Box 9. Introduction of Insurance Scheme for Emergency Maintenance in Nepal
  Nepal ranks as the fourth most climate-vulnerable country in the world and is highly exposed to a range of hazards such
  as floods, droughts, and earthquakes. The effects of natural disasters can be mitigated to some extent through good O&M,
  because well-maintained infrastructure is more resilient. However, overall O&M cannot prevent destruction or damage to
  infrastructure. Therefore, the Nepal RWSS Project piloted an insurance scheme for its water supply infrastructure in response
  to demands from some communities facing threats from natural disasters. The pilot involved the RWSS Fund Development
  Board (the national implementing agency), an insurance company, and initially seven communities that paid for the insur-
  ance. The project’s Fund Board worked with the insurance company to develop communications and training materials for
  inclusion in the standard training sessions for communities, and the insurance scheme was extended to cover a total of 36
  other WSS schemes by project close in 2012. While no claims have yet been made by the insured communities, the insurance
  scheme was deemed successful and is expected to continue to be implemented and mainstreamed by the Fund Develop-
  ment Board. While not directly related to what is considered O&M, such schemes could be a useful option in areas prone to
  natural disasters.

4. Technical Considerations
50.	 A number of technical issues relating to subproject design and implementation also have
a direct and significant impact on the O&M system and its sustainability. These include technol-
ogy complexity, quality of project design and materials, and supervision of construction.

Technical Design, Quality, and Supervision Issues

51.	 Infrastructure deficiencies are not always the result of inadequate maintenance. If a
newly completed infrastructure subproject has a major breakdown or needs replacement of a
key component (for example, water pumps, leaky roof, road washout) within the first year or so,
reasons other than improper maintenance may be the cause. Potential reasons include poor de-
sign, low-quality building materials, or lack of proper supervision resulting in poor construction
that does not meet agreed upon technical specifications.

52.	 Poor infrastructure design will always lead to more maintenance requirements. In some
cases necessary fixtures might not be included, or structures might not be designed to with-
stand given loads. In addition, good design can be compromised by the quality of the materials
used or by lack of proper supervision during construction. Finally, good design, proper materi-
als, and appropriate supervision can be undermined by the improper use of infrastructure. For
example, a few heavy trucks using a community-built village road can quickly do more damage
than regular local transport vehicles carrying moderate loads of goods and passengers, espe-
cially right after a long period of rainfall.

53.	 Nonetheless, there was little evidence from the project documentation and evalua-
tions reviewed of any major technical design issues, or of problems with quality of mate-
rials or supervision. On the contrary, technical reviews and anecdotal evidence indicate
that designs, materials, and supervision met or exceeded specifications, presumably due
to the increased community participation called for under the reviewed projects. For example,
under the Second Sri Lanka Community Development and Livelihood Improvement Project,
a review showed that rural roads and multipurpose buildings were of higher quality than the
42 • Operations and Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure in Community-Driven Development and Community-Based Projects




               construction completed under some of the other rural programs.50 The technical assessment of
               Indonesia PNPM found that 91–94 percent of the subprojects inspected had appropriate de-
               signs, although the quality of technical supervision was not always up to standards, and there
               were examples of cheap and low-quality materials used in construction. To address technical
               supervision issues, most projects include engineering staff to help supervise and oversee the
               quality of construction. AzRIP used the regional design firms to strengthen supervision quality
               during construction. Findings from Afghanistan NSP also indicate that high-quality subprojects
               are 28 percent more likely to be properly maintained than low-quality subprojects, confirming
               the importance of top-notch design, materials, and technical supervision.	     	

               Technical Complexity

               54.	 Complexity of project design not only affects the communities’ ability to carry out mainte-
               nance, but also the costs. Projects should select appropriate technology that will help optimize
               the tradeoffs between the lifecycle costs (investment costs and O&M requirements) and the
               scale of benefits to the community. The importance of appropriate technical designs to O&M is
               highlighted by the AzRIP experiences described earlier, where regional technical design firms
               prepare and cost alternative technical solutions for each of the top three priorities identified by
               the communities. After the introduction of alternative design options, about 10 percent of the
               communities discarded their initial first choice when it became clear to them that other invest-
               ments (based on an alternative design) would be better from a sustainability perspective.

               55.	 Technical complexity of project design can also have a negative impact on maintenance
               and the condition of the infrastructure. For example, in the Pakistan NWT Second Community
               Infrastructure Project, some of the communities opted to improve local streets through the use
               of cobblestones and bricks. The skills and equipment needed for this project were relatively
               simple and easy for the local maintenance committee to manage. Similarly, in the Nicaragua Ru-
               ral Roads Infrastructure Improvement Project, some communities use local labor to pave their
               roads with adoquines (a form of paving blocks). This technology is less expensive than tradition-
               al paved roads, and more durable and easier to maintain than gravel surfaces. Other types of
               infrastructure such as water supply and electricity systems can vary widely, with more complex
               designs requiring specialized equipment, and more technical know-how and skills for mainte-
               nance and repair. Findings from Afghanistan NSP confirm that subprojects that were classified
               as technically more complex (for example, microhydro plants, water supply networks, and solar
               panels) were generally in poorer condition than less complex infrastructure.


               5. Other Success Factors in Promoting O&M
               56.	 Grievance redress mechanisms. Effective complaints handling, or grievance redress mech-
               anisms (GRMs), have also been credited with improving O&M. For instance, in the Punjab Rural
               Water Supply and Sanitation Project, the grievance redress system managed by a third party
               agency has helped increase the responsiveness of technicians to local communities’ service re-
               quests (box 10). In addition to supporting the improved maintenance and repair of the water
               systems, GRMs have also had a positive impact on the trust of communities in the overall water
               schemes and O&M arrangements, which in turn increases user fee payments.


               50	   The quality of infrastructure was also good—local officials estimated that completed works would have a 25–30 percent longer
                     lifespan compared to equivalent government built infrastructure.

  Box 10. Complaint Redress System for Village Water Supply Schemes in India

  In 2009, Punjab State introduced a complaint redress system for village water supply schemes, Shikayat Nivaran Kendra. The
  system’s objective is to improve service delivery quality by monitoring O&M of rural water supply schemes more efficiently.
  The system includes a 24-hour toll-free number and an online complaint submission and tracking mechanism that can be
  accessed by all Department of Water Supply and Sanitation officials. Submitted complaints are registered by a private agency
  and forwarded to the relevant officials through email or text message for action. The third party agency monitors progress on
  a daily basis, and the complaint is escalated to higher levels if not rectified within a determined time frame. The system helps
  check on the performance of staff working in remote villages, improves the quality and speed of the service delivered, and
  makes water supply management more transparent and accountable.

57.	 Ex post monitoring of infrastructure. Technical evaluations of infrastructure after comple-
tion of construction were carried out in five of the seven selected case studies (Afghanistan,
Azerbaijan, Indonesia Nepal, and the Philippines) to assess the physical condition and func-
tionality of completed subprojects, and to identify some of the technical challenges that com-
munities faced in maintaining and sustaining their infrastructure. Summary results from three
of the evaluations are shown in box 11. The evaluations emphasize the importance of O&M to
communities and relevant government agencies, and will enhance efforts to improve O&M ar-
rangements in future operations and other government efforts.



  Box 11. Results from Technical Evaluations
  Afghanistan. According to a recent report on subproject sustainability, 29 percent of subprojects in NSP were found to be
  functional and in good condition due to good construction, quality materials, and adequate maintenance. Fifty-six percent
  were considered to be functional, but not in good condition (that is, at least one key component in poor condition) due to
  either lack of adequate O&M, poor or incomplete construction, poor materials and design flaws; and 14 percent of subprojects
  were not functional due to natural disasters, breakdown of key components, or insufficient operational funding.a

  Indonesia. The technical evaluation for the PNPM Project (2012) found that 82 percent of the infrastructure inspected was
  “high quality,” 14 percent “acceptable quality,” and 4 percent was considered “failed.” Some of the issues faced by the subproj-
  ects were attributed to design quality, cheap building materials, and inadequate oversight during construction (for example,
  poor drainage in roads, buildings, and water subprojects; hydraulic design deficiencies in water supply subprojects; and water
  supply fixtures falling quickly into disrepair).

  Nepal. Short- and long-term sustainability studies on the RWSS during the span of the two project phases included technical
  reviews of the water schemes. Technical sustainability results from the latest study, Batch V (conducted three years after sub-
  project completion) indicate that 78 percent of the water schemes are highly sustainable; 18 percent are sustainable, and 4
  percent are moderately or not sustainable.b Issues faced by the last category include damages due to floods or landslides and
  water depletion. Design and construction quality overall have been rated very high (over 95 percent).

  Sources: NSP Subproject Sustainability (2013); PNPM Rural Impact Evaluation (2012); Nepal RWSS Sustainability Studies (2012)

  a. The technical evaluations of NSP subprojects differentiate by subproject type. Canals and karez (type of water scheme) had
  the highest percentage of subprojects assessed as functioning and in good condition (on average 71 percent), while only
  one-third of the culverts, protection walls, and water supply network subprojects were found to be in a similar positive state.
  Microhydro plants, shallow wells, solar panels, and tertiary roads had no subprojects that were assessed to be fully functioning
  and in a good condition.
  b. In the case of the Nepal evaluations, technical sustainability considers three areas: source yield, condition and functionality,
  and functioning of taps.
Section IV: Conclusions and
Recommendations

58.	 This review looked at four key aspects of O&M systems (institutional arrangements, ca-
pacity building, financing, and technical considerations) and found several examples of good
practices. Nonetheless, few projects had hard data to quantify the effect of their O&M systems,
and fewer still had analyzed the links between these different system elements and the overall
success of O&M. This lack of robust data is in part due to the fact that O&M systems (and their
success or failure) are typically not recognized until after the typical investment lending project
cycle. Nevertheless, the project documentation reviewed and the case studies analyzed have
provided some basic insights into some of the key obstacles to and options for improving O&M
within these types of programs, along with materials related to O&M in various sectors that
might be useful to project teams.

59.	 Overall, the review found that O&M arrangements appear to be more successful in
single-sector projects (for example, roads, water supply), where the project generally works
with and builds the capacity of the specific sectoral agency that is responsible for ensuring that
O&M arrangements are in place and actually carried out. For example, in the Peru and Nicara-
gua roads sector programs, the projects supported the creation of a national road maintenance
agency and microenterprise formation for maintenance of rural roads, but when the projects
ended, these were absorbed into the road maintenance agency budgets. Additionally, the re-
view found that O&M is more successful for toll goods investments, such as water supply
and irrigation, where communities and households can be easily billed for services and systems
are already established to support such payments. O&M arrangements are less successful for
other public goods projects, where access to and benefits from the infrastructure are more
difficult to control and collecting user fees is more challenging. The review also found that
rural communities more often carry out basic or routine maintenance rather than peri-
odic maintenance, where costs tend to be higher and technical requirements greater. Proper
periodic maintenance generally requires technical and financial support from local government
and traditional line ministries.



                                                44
                                                                Section IV: Conclusions and Recommendations • 45




60.	 The review found that effective O&M systems generally include the following elements or
practices:
     •	   Institutional arrangements. Establishment of O&M committees at the beginning
          of the project with O&M plans that clearly define the roles and responsibilities of
          the different stakeholders, include a schedule of routine maintenance activities,
          initial user tariffs and collection mechanisms for at least two to three years after
          construction, along with estimated O&M costs for the lifespan of the infrastructure.
          Another key element is establishing formal links with local government authorities
          and line agencies, with their roles and contributions to O&M included in the plans,
          with relevant representatives signing an agreement on completion of construction.
     •	   Capacity building. Capacity-building activities covering all aspects of O&M—from
          the planning, implementation, and post-construction stages—should be provided
          for key stakeholders, including the communities, local government authorities, and
          private companies (to the extent that they are involved in design and supervision of
          construction). These activities should also include information campaigns (as seen in
          the water supply sector in Nepal) to encourage appropriate behavior in support of
          O&M, such as proper use of infrastructure, fee payment, and so forth. Preparation and
          distribution of simple pictorial manuals or guides that can help communities perform
          the necessary O&M activities have also been very useful. Finally, the frequency and
          timing of the capacity-building activities are important. Post-construction training
          has been effective in Nepal RWSS and follow-up technical support for a year or two
          after completion of the subproject was helpful in addressing real-time O&M issues as
          they arose.
     •	   Financing strategies. Most projects are able to cover short-term financing needs
          for routine O&M through basic user fees and donated labor. However, long-term
          financing appears to be a major challenge to O&M sustainability. O&M financing
          for water sector projects appears to be more successful because user fees are more
          easily charged and collected compared to other types of infrastructure, such as rural
          roads or bridges, where it is difficult to limit access to the benefit of the investment
          and where user fees are more difficult to collect. Public goods subprojects should,
          therefore, formally explore O&M cost-sharing arrangements with local government
          units or line ministries for periodic maintenance and major repairs (such as in the
          Azerbaijan, Philippines, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Peru, and Nicaragua projects).
     •	   Technical issues. Effective O&M by communities also depends on the appropriateness
          of infrastructure design, the quality of materials, and supervision of construction.
          Well-constructed infrastructure generally requires less maintenance in the first few
          years after construction; infrastructure that falls into disrepair soon after construction
          is usually the result of bad design or low-quality construction materials. While only
          a few projects conducted a technical audit or sustainability study to examine these
          issues, results from Afghanistan showed that the majority of the subprojects in good
          condition were those that were less technically complex with quality designs and
          materials.
46 • Operations and Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure in Community-Driven Development and Community-Based Projects




               61.	 This study presents six recommendations to improve the sustainability of O&M systems of
               community-driven and -based infrastructure:

                     i.	    CDD (and other rural infrastructure) investment projects should always include
                            at least one O&M results indicator. Over 40 percent of the 54 projects reviewed had
                            such an indicator in the results framework, which task team leaders indicated helped
                            keep projects focused on O&M.

                     ii.	   Explore the possibility of making second and subsequent block grant financing
                            conditional on the setup and operationalization of necessary O&M arrange-
                            ments. Two of the successful cases reviewed for this study, the Afghanistan National
                            Solidarity Program and Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project make funding for subse-
                            quent grants contingent on the beneficiary community having successfully complet-
                            ed an earlier subproject, which includes sustainable O&M of the constructed infra-
                            structure.

                     iii.	 Analyze and include information on O&M costs and responsibilities in the pro-
                           cess of subproject prioritization by communities. All of the successful projects
                           reviewed required O&M plans and procedures to be in place as part of subproject
                           proposal submission, but some were more detailed than others. In the case of Azer-
                           baijan, the subproject design and prioritization process included different subproject
                           technical options, with short- and long-term O&M costs, which guided final subproj-
                           ect selection.

                     iv.	 Pilot and evaluate different ways for financing public infrastructure O&M (partic-
                          ularly roads). For example, several projects, including the Philippines CDD program
                          (KALAHI-CIDSS) and the Peru and Nicaragua Roads projects formalized cost-sharing
                          arrangements with local government authorities or line agencies.

                     v.	    Research the role that public-private partnerships can play in commercializing
                            O&M efforts as an alternative to existing community-based mechanisms, such as in
                            the India Punjab RWSS, and in the Nepal RWSS with the introduction of the insurance
                            scheme for emergency maintenance).

                     vi.	 Given the lack of robust evidence of the end results of O&M arrangements, projects
                          should conduct longitudinal technical and qualitative studies focusing on O&M
                          arrangements and sustainability issues. These could also include piloting and eval-
                          uating different O&M design variation arrangements within a project to see what spe-
                          cific elements or approaches work best (for example, when and how the O&M com-
                          mittees are set up; how often and when capacity-building activities are conducted;
                          who is trained; and so forth).

               62.	 Finally, to assist task teams in planning for O&M design within their projects, this paper
               includes: (i) a list of relevant questions to be considered in planning for O&M design and imple-
               mentation (annex 3); (ii) links to useful O&M materials (annex 4); and (iii) a list of O&M measures
               and a timeline for their monitoring and evaluation (annex 5).

                      Annex 3
           Questions for Task Teams when
           Planning for O&M Design and
          Implementation in CDD Projects
Community Capacity
     •	   What degree of local capacity is available at the community level for planning, design,
          procurement, contract management, and supervision of small-scale infrastructure
          projects? How can this capacity be supported or enhanced? Are there trained
          engineers in the community who can lead or represent communities on technical
          matters including O&M?
     •	   How will capacity be mobilized to manage O&M responsibilities?
     •	   Are there competent local contractors or private firms who can be hired for O&M?

Technical Support
     •	   How can communities be provided with appropriate technical support at the design
          and construction stages, to improve both the quality and cost-efficiency of small-
          scale infrastructure (including various design choices, costs and O&M requirements)?
     •	   How much emphasis do community participation processes and community capacity
          development place on technical aspects of asset management?
     •	   Are O&M plans technically adequate, itemized, and costed out? Do they include costs
          for routine maintenance and wear and tear, as well as periodic maintenance and
          capital repair?
     •	   Are O&M plans reviewed and approved by technically competent experts?
     •	   Do local governments and line ministries have adequate technical capacity to support
          communities?

Financing
     •	   How will O&M be financed after subproject completion—will it be financed by
          communities or will there be cost sharing or resource allocation from local authorities
          or agencies?
     •	   Do local governments and line ministries have the resources to support O&M? If so, do
          they have multiyear budgeting, or do they have annual budgeting?
     •	   If communities finance O&M expenses, how will fees be charged and collected? Will
          users pay fees based on usage, or based on norms (for example, household size), or
          some other criteria that will ensure fair contribution to O&M requirements?
     •	   Are O&M funds set up prior to construction completion, and are they based on
          anticipated mid-term O&M outlays, or on how much community members can afford?

               Institutional Arrangements
                      •	   What are the institutional arrangements for ensuring the sustainability and
                           effectiveness of O&M (for example, maintenance plans, resource allocation, clearly
                           defined roles and responsibilities assigned across communities and different levels of
                           administration, governance structures, and so forth)?
                      •	   Are ownership and management responsibilities (which can be assigned to different
                           entities) clear?
                      •	   Can communities legally own assets? If not, will local government or relevant line
                           ministry formally include the built infrastructure in their log of assets?
