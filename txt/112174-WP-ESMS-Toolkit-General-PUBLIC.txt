Welcome & How to Use
This ESMS Toolkit
       Environmental and social responsibility is becoming more and
       more important in today’s global economy. There are thousands
       of environmental and social codes and standards in the world
       today. The codes and standards define the rules and the
       objectives. But the challenge is in the implementation. An
       environmental and social management system helps companies
       to integrate the rules and objectives into core business
       operations through a set of clearly defined, repeatable
       processes.

       In the following pages, we provide tools to build or enhance your
       company’s environmental and social management system
       (ESMS), such as sample documents, blank forms, flowcharts,
       checklists and templates. There are tools for each of the nine
       elements in your ESMS.

       As you go through the Toolkit, you may want to refer back to the
       companion publication, the ESMS Implementation Handbook,
       which gives more background on each of the nine ESMS
       elements.

       It is important to remember that simply creating a book of policies
       and procedures is not the end – it is just the beginning. Policies
       and procedures need to be implemented and turned into
       consistent processes. Continual improvement requires people
       who are committed to the effort. It requires trained people who
       have the right attitude, skills and knowledge. It requires
       leadership. Our hope is that, with this in mind, your company
       can use our ESMS tools to help accelerate the journey of
       continual improvement, for the benefit of the company, as well as
       your employees and stakeholders.

Introduction

                 Policies are the foundation of your Environmental and Social
                 Management System (ESMS). They are the rules that you
                 expect your people to follow and the public statement you
                 make about what your company believes in and how you
                 strive to conduct your business.

                 The process of adopting environmental and social policies
                 provides a company with an opportunity to think about and
                 discuss what is important. Ultimately, it also enables you to
                 gain the commitment and support of senior management as
                 they approve and communicate the policies.

Sample CEO Letter announcing the ESMS - Internal
To all employees of our company:
Our vision is to become one of the most respected and admired companies in our area. We aspire
to conduct ourselves in an ethical and responsible manner. Corporate social responsibility, which
includes environmental, labor rights, and community issues, is a growing concern to investors,
consumers and to all of us as people.
To integrate corporate social responsibility into our day-to-day business activities, we are
developing and implementing an environmental and social management system (ESMS). A
management system consists of trained, committed people routinely following procedures and
continually improving.
I ask for your full cooperation in this important initiative. We believe that corporate social
responsibility must be a foundation of our long-term growth and profitability. Not only is it an integral
part of our overall business strategy, but it is also the right thing to do. It is the right thing for our
customers, our suppliers, our shareholders, our communities and for you, as a core part of this
company.
As we strive to successfully implement our ESMS, we will train and involve you throughout the
process. [Person’s name and title] is in charge of this corporate social responsibility initiative and I
will personally ensure that the system is effective. Each of you has a direct line of communication
with [person] for any suggestions or concerns. I thank you for your efforts and your continued
dedication to our success.

Identification of Risks and Impacts
Introduction

               Identifying your risks can seem like a daunting task, but don’t
               be overwhelmed. You can scale your program to be
               appropriate for the size and complexity of your company.
               But remember, small companies can have the same risks
               and potentially severe environmental and social impacts as
               large companies.

               Think of your risk identification and assessment as a value-
               added activity, an opportunity to gather information that will
               help you effectively improve your operations. Risk
               identification and assessment is an ongoing process;
               situations change over time, so the assessment should be
               repeated at regular intervals.

               As you identify the risks for your company, consider the
               different risks that women and men may encounter. You
               should also consider the risks to people outside your
               company – your external stakeholders.

               We present four tools related to this element:

                   •   Risk Identification Worksheet

                   •   Process Mapping Tool

                   •   Physical Mapping Tool

                   •   Risk Assessment Form
       2. Identification of Risks and Impacts

Risk Identification Worksheet
Instructions:
This worksheet can help you identify the key risk areas for your company so that you can focus your
efforts on the most important issues. It will not tell you whether or not the risk has led to a negative
impact for your company; rather, it will call attention to the specific risk areas that are most likely to
become problems. You can then use that information to focus your attention on those risks and
decide what further actions are necessary to prevent or respond to any potential negative impacts.
You should consult with people inside and outside of your company who are knowledgeable about
these issues as you complete the worksheet. For each box, circle the appropriate answer.

Process Mapping Tool
Instructions:
A process map is a flowchart that visually illustrates the flow of activities of any given process from
beginning to end. Below is an example of a blank process map. In order to develop a process map,
you first identify all your company’s processes. Then, you identify the inputs (what is needed to
carry out that activity - e.g. water, energy, raw materials or chemicals) and outputs (what is left from
that activity – e.g. waste, emissions or by-products) for each process step.
Process maps are particularly useful in identifying environmental risks, occupational health and
safety hazards, and areas of process improvement. They can help you pinpoint inefficiencies within
your workflow so that you can streamline processes and maximize productivity, which can benefit
your business and your workers.
After you complete the process map, consider each step and identify the following:
   •   Occupational health and safety hazards;
   •   Risks to the environment and communities; and
   •   Opportunities for waste reduction and resource efficiency
It is essential to include people from all levels of your company in this process. Supervisors and
workers, especially, can offer valuable insight into the way things are actually done in your facility
since they are doing the day-to-day work. If you can’t bring everyone together to complete the
process map, you should ask supervisors to consult with the workers they oversee in order to obtain
their input, and then incorporate that information into the process map.
After you have identified the risks, you should start thinking about possible solutions. There are
many different types of solutions that you may consider; you may want to revise your production
practices completely or simply increase the use of personal protective equipment by your workers.
The solutions that you choose will form the basis of the Action Plans you will prepare as part of your
Management Program (Chapter 3).

Physical Mapping Tool
Instructions
A physical map is another helpful tool to identify risks in your company. First, prepare a map of the
layout of your facility (below is an example for a fruit processing facility). The map should include all
the areas where production activities and various business operations take place, and illustrate how
they are connected to one another. You can also use this map when you develop your emergency
preparedness plan. Once you have the physical map, you should do a walk-through of the facility to
identify existing or potential problems. You should conduct the walk-through during working hours
with a team that includes supervisors and workers, since they often know what the problems are
and have ideas about necessary improvements. Whenever you observe a problem or potential
problem, write it down and mark it on the map.
      2. Identification of Risks and Impacts

              HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO LOOK FOR DURING THE WALK-THROUGH:

•   Where are people most likely to become injured? Identify trip, slip and fall hazards (from
    falling objects or a fall from an elevated area), as well as areas where someone could
    become injured by vehicles.
•   Are equipment, tools, and machinery designed and maintained efficiently to reduce worker
    strain? Can they be operated safely?
•   Where are workers exposed to hazardous chemicals, pathogens, excessive dust, noise,
    sun, and extreme temperatures? Do workers have appropriate personal protective
    equipment (PPE)? Is it being used correctly?
•   Is the work area lighting sufficient?
•   Are chemicals labeled and safely stored with compatible materials? Are there any existing or
    potential leakages from containers?
•   Where could fires, explosions, or the accidental release of hazardous materials occur? Is
    there adequate and appropriate response equipment close to those areas?
•   Are exit doors unobstructed and well-marked? Are they unchained and equipped with panic
    bars?
•   Are any passages blocked due to the layout of the facility or improperly stored materials?
•   Which areas have high levels of water consumption or discharge? Identify all potential water
    consumption and discharge sources.
•   Are input materials being used efficiently? Is material wasted at any point?
•   Where is most of the waste produced in the facility? How is the waste managed?
•   Has your company’s use of land negatively affected nearby residents (e.g. through emission
    of pollutants or land encroachment)?
•   In general, are there places or work processes with clear bad habits?



After the walk-through, meet with the team and discuss your observations. You can also discuss
previous incidents or accidents and their consequences, so that you can take steps to prevent
similar situations in the future.
The information you collect in the walk-through will form the basis of the Action Plans you will
prepare as part of your Management Program in Chapter 3.

don’t get overwhelmed. This risk assessment form will help you assess the significance of each risk
so that you can prioritize the risks that most need your attention, and devote the necessary
resources to addressing them. You should prioritize the risks that have the highest probability of
occurring and those that would have most severe impacts if they occurred. Once you have
prioritized certain risks, you can develop an Action Plan. You should first seek to avoid the risks
altogether, and prevent the risk from becoming a problem. If that is not possible, you can take steps
to minimize any potential negative impacts of the risks.
Complete the risk assessment form below by first filling in the risks that you identified using the tools
above. Then, assess the probability (low, medium, high, extreme) that each risk will occur, and
assess the potential severity (low, medium, high, extreme) of the impacts. For example, a major
flood or earthquake may be unlikely to occur (low probability), but the damage to your staff and to
your facility could be extremely high (high impact).
   As you assess the probability of each risk, you should consider the circumstances of your
    facility and its local context. You may ask yourself questions such as:
    (1) How many times has this risk led to a negative impact in the recent past? For example, if
        you typically have one chemical spill each year, it is likely that this trend will continue.
    (2) Is your location particularly risky for any reason? For example, are you located on a fault
        line or within the typical path of tropical storms?
    (3) Have there been any recent changes in your situation that may increase your vulnerability
        to risk? For example, have you had an influx of new workers who have not been fully
        trained in safety procedures and may be more likely to make mistakes?
   In order to assess the severity of the possible negative impacts of each risk, you should
    consider the possible scope of the impact. How many people would be impacted if the risk
    were to occur? Would it result in extreme injuries or the deaths of workers? Would it destroy
    your infrastructure? Would it impact the local community and environment as well? Would you
    lose your operating permits? For example, a fire could negatively impact all of your workers,
    destroy your facility, and even spread to the local community and environment.
   As you prioritize the risks to address, you should also consider opportunities to increase
    efficiency and save money by reducing water and energy consumption, waste generation, and
    other similar considerations.

Management Programs
Introduction

               Your Management Program should include Action Plans and
               procedures to help you address the risks that you identified
               and prioritized through the tools in Chapter 2. You should
               first seek to avoid any potential negative impacts of the
               risks; if that is not possible, you should take steps to
               minimize the impact of the risks; finally, if you are
               unsuccessful in those efforts, you can offset or compensate
               for negative impacts after they have occurred.

               We present five tools related to this element:

                   •   Root Cause Analysis

                   •   Action Plan Chart

                   •   Outline of Procedure

                   •   Supply Chain Management Tool
       3. Management Programs

Root Cause Analysis
Once you have identified and prioritized your risks, you should try to identify their underlying root
causes. The root causes are often deficiencies in your management system, such as inadequate
procedures or improper training.
You can use this root cause tree diagram to brainstorm and map the underlying factors that can lead
to negative impacts for each prioritized risk.


Instructions
   •   The risk or problem that you
       prioritized through your risk
       assessment is the treetop.
   •   The root causes are the roots
       of the tree. Root causes are
       gaps in the implementation of
       your management system.
       Group similar root causes into
       the appropriate ESMS
       element: Policy, Identification
       of Risks and Impacts,
       Management Programs,
       Organizational Capacity and
       Competency, Stakeholder
       Engagement, and Monitoring
       and Review.
   •   In the area outside of the tree,
       you can include information about external factors that may influence your business but are
       beyond the direct control of your company. These may include your external environment,
       such as the weather or a natural disaster, and other factors, such as government policies,
       economic trends or market forces.
   •   As with the other exercises, you should conduct this activity with a diverse group of
       employees to ensure that you capture different perspectives within the company.


The root cause tree diagram is a useful tool to help you move beyond the surface-level challenges,
and dig deeper to identify root causes.
      3. Management Programs

You can also use the "5 Whys” technique to facilitate a robust conversation about root causes.

Example: There is a chemical spill in your facility. (The Problem)

       1. Why? – The container holding the chemical leaked. (First why)
       2. Why? – There was a hole in the container. (Second why)
       3. Why? – The container is old and has not been replaced. (Third why)
       4. Why? – The workers did not know that it had to be replaced. (Fourth why)
       5. Why? – The worker was not trained in the chemical handling procedures. (Fifth why -
          identified root cause is a gap in Organizational Capacity and Competency.)
These tools will enable you to build a management system that addresses underlying issues that
contribute to problems to create more systematic and lasting preventive solutions.

Action Plan Chart
Instructions
Use this chart to identify the actions you will take to address the prioritized risks, and to determine how you will manage those actions.
In the chart below, list the risks that you identified and prioritized in the previous section. Then, determine which actions you will take to avoid,
minimize, or compensate/offset the negative impacts of each risk. Assign a responsible staff member to each action and set a deadline to ensure
that he or she will implement the action. You should also identify the resources required to complete the action, and the operational procedures you
need to adopt to ensure the long-term sustainability of the action.
Risk:      Insert the risks that you prioritized here. For example, worker exposure to high concentrations of dust.
Objective: What do you want to achieve broadly? What are your performance targets?
               For example, reduce workers’ exposure to dust.

Outline of Procedure
As you implement your action plan, you should define the procedures that you will follow.
Procedures clearly systematize actions so that they become routine, daily processes and practices.
Procedures and work instructions can be communicated in different formats, such as text,
flowcharts, or pictograms. You should use the format that is most effective for your company staff.
The outline below includes the important components of a well-defined written procedure.



        Title: Procedure X

        Procedure identification number:
        Number of pages:
        1.0 Purpose: What is the objective of the procedure?

             procedure based on? Where can you learn more?
             For example: This may include related company polices, relevant national or local
             laws, and industry standards.
        7.0 Records: Where are the outcomes of the procedures documented?
             For example: Worker injuries may be recorded in an accidents log and worker
             issues may be recorded in personnel files.
        8.0 Approving authority: Who is responsible for approving these procedures?
             For example: The General Manager is responsible for approving this procedure.
        9.0 Issue date: When was the procedure issued?
        10.0 Revision date: When was the procedure reviewed and revised? (Procedures
             should be continually updated and improved).

Supply Chain and Contractors Management
In addition to managing risks within your company, your management system should extend to your
primary suppliers and contractors. The table below can help you make sure that you are
incorporating them into your ESMS appropriately. As you go through the table, think of critical ways
you can manage risks.
Suppliers and contractors should have ownership and accountability for their own management
system, but you can help them build their internal capacity to do so. You can help them adapt the
concepts and tools provided in the ESMS Handbook and Toolkit to develop their own ESMS.

                                   Create a checklist/rating system to evaluate the social and
                                    environmental performance of new and existing suppliers and
                                    contractors.
Management Program                 Define action plans to address the identified risks within your
                                    supply chain. If you don’t have the ability or leverage to influence
                                    environmental and social performance improvements among your
                                    suppliers and contractors, you may want to consider gradually
                                    replacing them.
                                   Incorporate supplier and contractor ratings into business
                                    planning.

Organizational Capacity            Train relevant staff (including procurement, sourcing, and
and Competency                      compliance departments) to identify environmental and social
                                    risks among your suppliers and contractors.

Emergency Preparedness             Assess emergency preparedness among your suppliers and
and Response                        contractors and help them develop the capacity to plan for
                                    emergencies.
Stakeholder Engagement             Engage with external stakeholders to identify risks in your supply
                                    chain or risks caused by your suppliers and contractors.
External Communications            Implement accessible grievance mechanisms so you can receive
and Grievance                       and address complaints about your suppliers and contractors.
Mechanisms

Ongoing Reporting to               Report back to communities affected by activities performed by
Affected Communities                your primary suppliers or contractors on your behalf.
                                   Inform these communities about results of actions taken.
Monitoring and Review              Review your suppliers and contractors’ management systems on
                                    a periodic basis and mandate changes as needed.

Organizational Capacity and Competency
Introduction

               Your ESMS extends beyond documented policies and
               procedures. You need trained, committed people at all levels
               in your company to effectively implement your ESMS. This
               does not mean that ESMS implementation should become
               everyone’s full-time job, rather, the new responsibilities
               should be incorporated into the relevant job descriptions and
               performance should be evaluated based on the consistent
               implementation of assigned duties as defined in procedures.

               In order to develop your organizational capacity, you have to
               train your staff appropriately. You should utilize progressive
               training techniques: initially, the training should raise
               participants’ awareness about the ESMS; next, training
               should develop participants’ commitment to the ESMS; and
               finally, it should teach participants how to implement the
               ESMS. Each training module should have a specific goal
               related to this progression: (1) raise awareness; (2) gain
               commitment; and (3) teach people the knowledge and skills
               they need to implement the ESMS.

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Introduction

               Even with good systems in place, emergencies can and do
               happen. Therefore, it is essential to plan in advance. You
               should try to prevent emergencies from occuring, but you
               also need to train your employees so they know what to do
               in case something does happen. You don’t need to plan for
               every single possible accident or emergency. Use your risk
               assessment to focus on the emergencies that are most likely
               to happen or would cause the most harm. Then you can
               develop and implement a suitable emergency preparedness
               and management plan for each prioritized emergency
               situation.

               As part of the plan, you should create detailed procedures
               that outline the steps you will take to prepare for and
               respond to an emergency. We provide samples of response
               procedures for some common emergencies: fires, flooding,
               and chemical spillages.

               We present four tools related to this element:

                   •   Emergency Scenario Mapping

                   •   Sample Fire Response Procedure

                   •   Sample Chemical Spill Response Procedure

                   •   Sample Emergency Flooding Response and
                       Preparedness Procedure
       5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

Emergency Scenario Mapping
Through your risk assessment, you will assess and prioritize the emergency scenarios that are most
likely to occur in your area or would have the most severe impacts, and then create a
comprehensive emergency preparedness plan so you can minimize the damage to your company
and workers in case of emergency. This sample list includes the most common types of
emergencies, all of which can result in significant worker injury or death, as well as disruption of
operations and destruction of property.
Possible manmade or natural emergency situations include:
   •   Storms, including tornados, typhoons, and hurricanes (many can result in flooding)
   •   Other natural disasters, such as flooding, earthquakes and associated tsunamis, and
       volcanic eruptions
   •   Fire
   •   Explosion (manmade or accidental)
   •   Civil unrest
   •   Chemical spill or release of hazardous substances
You can use the risk assessment graph to map the probability and severity of these possible
emergency situations.

   3.7. Other responsibilities as defined in the work instructions.

4.0 Work Instructions:
    4.1. FIREFIGHTING INSTRUCTIONS
      a.   The cardinal rule in firefighting is to preserve life, and then property.
      b.   The person who discovers the fire shall call for in-house assistance immediately
           after discovering the fire. Do not enter a burning room or building without another
           qualified person to assist. Alert other employees immediately.
      c.   Determine if the fire can be extinguished within an appropriate time limit with the
           portable equipment in the building. If the equipment is sufficient, use it to extinguish
           the fire. If not, call the fire department, activate an alarm and evacuate the building.
      d.   The person who discovers the fire should notify the telephone operator and provide
           the exact location and nature of fire.
      e.   The telephone operator will notify the following individuals in turn:
             i.     Engineering control room;
             ii.    Time office;
             iii.   Operations manager;
             iv.    Maintenance department;
             v.     EHS manager;
             vi.    All other heads of departments; and
             vii.   House doctor.
   5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

   f.    The telephone operator will remain on duty and serve as the information and control
         center unless instructions or conditions dictate otherwise.
   g.    As soon as the electrical department is notified, the electrician shall cut off the power
         supply of the affected area, bring the elevators (if available) down to the ground level
         and provide an adequate lighting arrangement (with emergency lighting if extra light is
         required) for firefighting or evacuation.
   h.    The maintenance department shall reach the fire hydrant pump room (if safe) for
         smooth pump operation.
   i.    The work area supervisor (or the shift in-charge) will make appropriate decisions
            regarding building evacuation and firefighting with the help of an internal trained team
            and/or notifying the city’s fire department.
4.2. BUILDING EVACUATION: It is essential to make decisions quickly and evacuate the
     premises in order to prevent the loss of lives. The evacuation procedure should be handled
     with expertise and without delay. When evacuation from the building is necessary,
     everyone must leave through the nearest exit or as advised. In labor-intensive industries,
     many people will have to be evacuated in a very short time. In the past, many workers in
     the textile industry, for example, have lost their lives due to blocked or locked exists, or an
     insufficient number of exits. Make sure exit routes can be used in case of an emergency.
    a. Close but do not lock doors behind you as you leave the building.
    b. Employees and visitors should gather near the designated muster point in a safe area
            that is upwind from smoke or toxic gases and will not hamper emergency vehicles or
            services when they arrive.
    c.      In order to ensure that everyone is accounted for, conduct a head count of all
            employees and visitors.
    d. Employees are not to re-enter the evacuated building until they are so advised by the
            designated officer (operations manager or safety manager).
    e. Only trained and competent personnel equipped with suitable PPEs can perform any
            required rescue operations (for a trapped employee/visitor, for example).
4.3. MEDICAL AID: Treat all minor injuries with first aid, but remember that first aid is only
     temporary. First aid provides the immediate treatment that is needed before a doctor can
     reach the victim onsite, or before the victim can be transported to a doctor. What you do in
     the critical moments after an injury occurs could save a life, so it is important to know the
     basic first aid procedures. Review them often so you will be prepared if you suddenly find
     yourself in an emergency situation. The most important thing to do when someone is injured
     is to survey the scene to determine if the situation is safe, or if the victim must be moved
     from a dangerous location to a safe place. Call for emergency medical help immediately for
     all life-threatening situations and send people to guide the emergency team to the victim.
4.4. FIRST AID FOR FIRE INJURIES AND BURNS
   a.    Move patient to fresh air.
   b.    Move the patient from the heat of fire.
   c.    Do not allow crowding around the patient.
      5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

       d. Remove or cut away clothes from affected parts of the body.
       e. Open buttons and loosen clothing.
       f.  Pour chilled water on the affected parts.
       g. Apply any antiseptic cream.
       h. Get a doctor.
   4.5. ASPHYXIA: If the patient has difficulty breathing or there are symptoms of collapse:
       a. Give artificial respiration with respirator or mouth-to-mouth respiration.
       b. Supply oxygen.
       c.  Take the patient to the hospital or to receive medical help.
   4.6. SHOCK: If the patient perspires, has a low pulse and the body is cold:
       a. Cover the victim with a blanket. (Do not touch burned parts.)
       b. Make sure the victim remains lying down.
       c.  Elevate feet if you do not suspect head or neck injury or leg fracture.
       d. Get medical help.
       e. Monitor vital signs.
       f.  Prevent loss of body temperature.
       g. Take the patient to a hospital immediately.

5.0 Emergency Response Team: The purpose of the Emergency Response Team is to deal with
    catastrophic accidents within the company. The team’s responsibilities are to immediately meet
    when an emergency situation is reported and to determine the course of action.

                  have personnel on site.
            ii.   Designate a weather monitor, who will report weather conditions and keep the
                ERT Coordinator up to date on conditions before, during and after a flood. Involve
                local government and liaise with other businesses.
          iii.  Give the ERT Coordinator the authority to implement the plan, based on
                predetermined checkpoints (e.g. when the approaching water is within a certain
                distance from the facility). This responsibility includes shutting down operations
                and sending personnel home.
          iv.   The ERT Coordinator shall ensure that the manager(s) carry out predetermined
                tasks at each warning stage of a storm. To guarantee this, task checklists should
                be distributed to all those involved, completed and returned to the ERT
                Coordinator.
          v.    Assess levels of insurance coverage for flood damage.
          vi.   Install appropriate system to warn employees in real-time.
          vii.  Provide safe shelters or structures that can protect employees and designate a
                safe evacuation route to them.
          viii. Provide radio and communication systems and appropriate PPE.
       b. Advance preparedness steps
          i.    Identify all critical areas of a facility, and make sure someone on all shifts knows
                the proper shutdown procedures and is authorized to implement them.
          ii.   Maintain an updated list of telephone numbers and contacts for local emergency
                response agencies and the industrial property insurance company. Contact local
                authorities to plan and coordinate activities before the need for emergency action.
                That way, both you and they will be better prepared.
          iii.  Arrange backup communications, such as two-way radios or cellular phones, and
5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

           have spare batteries and a diesel-driven emergency generator on site.
   iv.     Arrange an off-site emergency communications control center, such as a hotel
           meeting room, in case it becomes too dangerous to remain on site.
   v.      Determine which company records are vital, and make plans to protect/relocate
           them.
   vi.     Identify a hot site (an off-site data processing location where you can continue
           business immediately).
   vii.    Maintain ongoing agreements with contractors for supplies and repairs that may
           be needed after a flood. If possible, use contractors who are from outside potential
           flooded areas. Local contractors may be over-committed.
   viii.   Order emergency supplies and maintain them throughout potential flooding
           season.
   ix.     Have straps or other means on hand to brace/anchor yard storage, signs,
           plantation vehicles, and roof-mounted equipment from the flood.
   x.      Protect/relocate vital records.
   xi.     Inspect all fire protection equipment, such as sprinkler control valves and fire
           pumps.
   xii.    Ensure that the ERT members who volunteer to stay on site have proper supplies
           and equipment (drinkable water, nonperishable food, medical, flashlights, and
           walkie-talkies).
   xiii.   Have cash on hand for post-flood needs, such as buying food and supplies, or
           paying employees and contractors.
   xiv. Repair and fill aboveground tanks with water.
   xv.     Fill fuel tanks of generators, fire pumps and all company-owned vehicles.
   xvi. Protect computer and machinery with tarpaulins and waterproof covers.
   xvii. Isolate, neutralize or remove from the site any chemicals that can react violently
           with each other.
   xviii. Shut off gas to minimize fire loss.
   xix. Shut down all noncritical and nonessential electrical equipment.
c.    During the Flood: Emergency response personnel should stay at the facility only if safe
      to do so.
   i.      Patrol the property continuously and watch for roof leaks, pipe breakage, fire or
           structural damage.
   ii.     Personnel should remain in a place that has been identified as safe the flooding.
   iii.    During power failure, turn off electrical switches to prevent reactivation before
           necessary checks are completed.
d. After the Flood
   i.      Secure the site.
   ii.     Survey for damage.
   iii.    Survey for safety hazards such as live wires, leaking gas or flammable liquids,
           and damage to foundations or underground piping.
      5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

            iv.    Call in key personnel and notify contractors to start repairs. Make sure safety
                   systems are fully implemented before work is allowed to begin.
            v.     Begin salvage processes as soon as possible to prevent further damage: cover
                   broken windows and torn roof coverings, clear fallen trees.
            vi.    Clean roof drains and remove debris from roof to prevent drainage problems.
            vii.   Visually check any conductors and exposed insulators before restarting main
                   electrical distribution systems.


5.0 First Aid and Rescue Operations
       a.     In case of an injury, call the ERC. Call for local Government Emergency Services
              directly if the situation is urgent or serious and inform ERC subsequently as soon as
              practicable.
       b.     Do not conduct rescue operations unless you are trained to perform a proper rescue or
              the situation is safe for conducting a rescue operation.
       c.     Do not move an injured person, especially when there are signs of spinal injury or bone
              fracture, unless it is absolutely necessary to do so for safety reasons.
       d.     Keep the injured person comfortable, warm, and lying down.
       e.     First aid treatment should be administered, preferably by trained persons.

6.0 Emergency Response Team: The purpose of the Emergency Response Team is to deal with
    any catastrophic accidents. The team should meet immediately when an emergency situation is
    reported to determine the course of action.

Stakeholder Engagement
Introduction

               Many different groups of stakeholders interact with your
               company as you conduct your business. A stakeholder is
               any person or organization that has an interest in, is affected
               by, or perceives that is affected by your company.

               You should engage with your stakeholders to understand
               the impacts that your business has on them and reduce
               reputational risks from anti-company sentiments or negative
               campaigns. Regular and systematic interactions with
               stakeholders can earn their trust and create a positive image
               for your company. In addition, stakeholders can provide
               valuable feedback to help you avoid or minimize possible
               negative impacts from your operations.

               We present three tools related to this element:

Stakeholder Mapping Tool – Identification and analysis
Instructions
   1. Conduct this exercise with a cross-functional/departmental team.

   2. Create a list of all the relevant stakeholders for your company. Relevant stakeholders
      include: stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by your company;
      stakeholders who have an interest in your company operations; stakeholders who may have
      complaints or concerns related to your operations; stakeholders who have an ongoing
      relationship with the company; and stakeholders who can influence your company
      operations. You should be as specific as possible in your list. For example, you should list
      each of your main clients and suppliers independently, and disaggregate communities by
      identifying legitimate local leaders or other relevant actors.

   3. Discuss each stakeholder group and record each one’s key concerns, issues and interests
      related to your company.

   4. Place these stakeholders on the stakeholder map according to the degree to which they are
      impacted by your operations and their capacity to influence your company operations.

  6. Stakeholder Engagement

5. Categorize the stakeholders according to their current relationship with your company:
   supportive, supportive with conditions, neutral, negative. Stakeholder engagement
   should serve to maintain positive relationships with supportive stakeholders and help you
   address the concerns of less-supportive stakeholders. Remember, stakeholders’
   relationships with the company can change over time. We recommend that you conduct this
   type of analysis periodically to ensure that you are engaging with your stakeholders
   appropriately.
6. Prioritize your stakeholders for engagement.
7. Create strategies to engage with the prioritized stakeholders. As you determine your
   engagement strategies, keep current initiatives of the company in mind. You should also
   create tiered engagement strategies for stakeholders in each of the four quadrants on the
   stakeholder map.

       o   Quadrant 1: Involve as needed
       o   Quadrant 2: Proactively approach and support
       o   Quadrant 3: Keep informed
       o   Quadrant 4: Respond to concerns
8. Review the stakeholder map at regular intervals and when there are major changes in your
   company or the local context. You should also review the stakeholder map with external
   groups to obtain their feedback.

Impact Zoning Tool for Identifying Affected Communities
Instructions
The term “affected communities” includes any individuals or communities that are located in
proximity to the company’s facilities and are directly exposed to actual or potential adverse impacts
on their environment, health and livelihood due to company activities.

A quick and practical technique for identifying affected communities is through an “Impact Zoning
Map” (see box below). By mapping your company’s sphere of influence for different types of
environmental and social impacts, you can begin to identify distinct groups by impact area. You can
then use that information to prioritize the key stakeholders for consultation.

You should assign priority to individuals and groups who are directly adversely affected by your
company’s activities; however, it can be challenging to distinguish between who is directly affected
and who is not. Communities that live just outside of your designated impact area can still feel that
they are impacted by your company, and may feel they have been arbitrarily excluded from the
engagement process.



                 HOW TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH IMPACT ZONING


        1. Draw a sketch map of the key design components of the project, both on- and
            off-site, that may give rise to local environmental and social impacts (e.g. land
            area used/affected; air and water pollution receptors, etc.). This may be
            performed more efficiently by using aerial photographs or satellite images.
        2. Identify the broad impact zones for each of these components (e.g. the area of
            land take, air and water pollution receptors, etc.).
        3. After identifying and mapping broad stakeholder groups, overlay those groups
            with the impact zones.
        4. Through consultation with legitimate stakeholder representatives, verify which
            groups are potentially affected by which impacts.

       6. Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder Engagement Plan Worksheet
Instructions
After identifying your most important stakeholders, you should develop a plan to engage them. You
should have a higher level of engagement with the most affected groups and with groups that have
the most influence on (or potential to influence) your business.

At a minimum, you should always implement an external communication procedure to receive
communications from the public and adjust your management program accordingly. In the case of
adversely affected stakeholders, you should also implement a grievance mechanism so that you
can address complaints that may arise. You should also actively engage adversely affected
stakeholders in consultations to regularly provide them with clear and meaningful information.
These two methods of engagement will enable these communities to express their concerns and
suggestions on an ongoing basis. Finally, you should report back to your stakeholders and explain
the results of actions that your company may have taken to address the issues identified during the
consultation process.

The table below provides examples of stakeholders that may be impacted by, or may influence,
your operations. Once you have created a stakeholder map and identified the concerns, you can
create an engagement plan and determine the engagement method, the necessary information to
be disclosed or reported back to your stakeholders, and the key information you would like to obtain
from your stakeholders.

External Communications and Grievance
Mechanisms
Introduction
               Grievance Mechanism

               A grievance mechanism establishes a channel for affected
               community members to contact you – openly, confidentially
               or anonymously – with inquiries, concerns or formal
               complaints. It creates an alternative way for community
               members to communicate with your company as part of your
               formal stakeholder engagement process.
               External Communications
               Even if your company has not identified any affected
               communities during your stakeholder engagement process,
               you must establish and maintain a publicly available and
               easily accessible channel for members of the public to
               contact you (e.g. through a phone number, website, or email
               address). External stakeholders can provide you with
               valuable information through this channel, such as:
               suggestions on product improvement; feedback on
               customers’ interaction with your employees; and comments
               from regulators, NGOs and individuals regarding your
               company’s environmental and social performance.

Ongoing Reporting to Affected Communities
Introduction

               The final, critical step towards building and maintaining a
               good relationship with your stakeholders is to keep them
               informed about your company’s response to their concerns
               or complaints. Therefore, you should report back to
               affected communities and explain the actions that your
               company has taken to address the issues that were
               identified during the engagement process, and the outcomes
               of those actions.

Monitoring and Management Review
Introduction

               Monitoring and review are critical components of the ESMS
               because these two activities enable you to check and adjust
               your system. You need to monitor your action plans to
               ensure that they are implemented and that your procedures
               are being followed. You also want to make sure that your
               ESMS is addressing the most relevant risks and promoting
               lasting improvements in your company. The goal of the
               ESMS is to inspire a fundamental shift within your company;
               the ESMS can help you transition from a reactive approach
               to a preventive approach. Instead of addressing problems
               after they have already occurred (corrective actions), the
               ESMS enables you to prevent issues from becoming
               problems in the first place (preventive actions). Monitoring
               and management review provide you with the necessary
               information to make that transition.

               We present two tools for this element:

Auditing Guidance
Instructions
This auditing guidance provides a comprehensive overview of the steps that an auditor would take to
assess various aspects of your business. You should review this auditing guidance to gain insight into
the types of issues and questions that auditors consider. This will broaden your view of potential risk
areas and elements of the ESMS beyond those that you may have targeted in your initial risk
assessment.

                                                    A. PREPARATION

     Collect audit and inspection reports on the company’s environmental and labor performance for the previous
     two years.

     Collect corrective action plans generated from previous audits or inspections and review the status of each
     action item that was agreed upon. Are they all closed out? Focus your review on open items and the
     underlying factors that prevent you from completing the corrective action plan.

     Ascertain the general level of PPE use on the organization. Ensure that auditors wear the same PPE as
     employees are required to wear: head, hearing, eye, skin protection, protective boots, clothing, etc. Do not
     allow any auditor to enter work areas without the clothing/gear required for the operations activity and that
     employees are required to wear.

     Obtain site plans for all the relevant operational areas. Ensure auditing team has a working knowledge of the
     operations to be evaluated.

     Research and refer to current local environmental and labor laws and regulations.
     Basic labor code issues: (i) regular weekly work hours, (ii) labor contract provisions, (iii) rest periods, lunch,
     etc., (iv) overtime requirements, limits and exceptions, (v) hour averaging and banking hours, (vi) minimum
     wage, (vii) social system payment liability, (viii) annual leave, (ix) laws to protect disadvantaged workers, (x)
     severance pay.
     Basic environmental code issues: (i) wastewater, (ii) storm water, (iii) spill prevention and response, (iv)
     construction/demolition/remodeling, (v) hazardous materials, (vi) hazardous waste, (vii) toxic chemical
     release, (viii) air emissions, (ix) solid waste.

     Review regulatory permit(s) conditions and specific requirements along with most recent review and
     corrective action reports.

     Review certification(s) audit reports (e.g. ISO 14001, OSHAS 18001, BSCI or SA8000) for nonconformance,
     mandatory remedial actions, recommendations, etc. Summarize status of items (open or closed).

     Review any government inspection reports, third-party audit reports, etc.


     Review the stakeholder engagement plan and records of grievances by external stakeholders. Pay attention
     to: emergency preparedness and response capability to include the community if necessary; use of
     chemicals and accidental releases of hazardous materials affecting community, e.g. dyes and chlorine;
     discharges of wastewater or other wastes to areas affecting local communities; exacerbation of flooding;
     limits of water availability use and physical access; diminution of quality of life due to the operation.

     Pay special attention in observation/document review/interviews to issues identified in previous reports.
      9. Monitoring and Review

    Research and understand the national and local context of labor union rights and activity, local environmental
    groups and community activist organizations.

    Schedule sufficient time to conduct the scope of the audit. Announce the availability of confidential meeting
    schedules with employees; schedule, arrange and conduct while protecting employee confidentiality.




                              B. INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT

    Meet with the senior management and department managers before conducting audit activities to review
    ESMS issues and the purpose of the audit.

    Share an agenda and itinerary for the meeting with senior management and local supervisors.


    With department managers, review the prior audit reports and performance to date in meeting corrective
    actions.

    Discuss non-retaliation against cooperating workers; inform management that future audits will include
    reviews of the continued employment of workers interviewed.




                                       C. OPERATIONAL WALK-THROUGH

    Conduct operational walk-through following production processes. Refer to previous relevant physical walk-
    through assessments of the facility; determine if all previous nonconformance/action items are closed out - if
    not, why not?

    Minimize the number of managers and supervisors that accompany you on the walk-through. One or two
    escorts of non-supervisory staff based on knowledge/responsibilities are usually sufficient.

    During the walk-through, be aware of your body language and the message this sends to workers; ensure
    that you are equipped with/wearing the same PPE required of employees.

    Take note of all things observed that require attention:
        1.   Water used indiscriminately for watering as well as washing and cleaning
        2.   Water wastages/inefficiencies
        3.   Energy wastage
        4.   Evidence of spillages
        5.   Dry cleanup and collection of organic solids
        6.   Harborage or other unorganized storage of materials
        7.   Wastes and discards
        8.   Workplace availability of data on hazards or banned or restricted chemicals in use (MSDS/ICSC)
        9.   Movement of materials: hand trucks, forklifts, etc. Are the passageways and transit routes clearly
             marked; is color-coding used for non-pedestrian movement?
        10. Obvious hazards for heads, hearing, sight, life and limb: workplace hazards attenuated; employee
            awareness?
        11. PPE used as prescribed, available, replaced at no cost; employee awareness
        12. Are employees able to explain jobs and responsibilities?
      9. Monitoring and Review

        13. Evidence of QA team activity

    Verify that fire exits in buildings (e.g. storage or maintenance areas, administrative buildings, etc.) exist and
    open on demand; no means to prevent exit; panic bars in good working order; clear egress once exit opened;
    emergency exits clearly marked; nearest exits clearly marked; hose cabinets equipped with hoses, nozzles,
    etc.; prohibited areas clearly marked; electrical cabinets closed and sealed; lockout/tag-out procedures and
    tools (tags, locks, warning labels and signs) clearly available near electrical cabinets; first aid cabinets and
    equipment; emergency lighting; emergency preparedness and evacuation plans in place; and that employees
    are trained on using these.

    Ask an employee to show you how to get out, assuming that there is now a fire; follow the employee; ask
    another to tell/show you what happens if he/she was just injured.

    Indoor working conditions should be verified for adequacy if there is potential for risks such as heat, light,
    noise and dust. Use measuring devices to determine air quality, noise level, and temperature.

    Following the walk around, conduct a walk-through of the dormitory facilities, canteens, washrooms and
    changing rooms (if relevant). Note the condition and adequacy of these areas.

    Suggest best practice to supervisors and managers during the walk-through; ensure that the suggestion is
    filtered by processes/operations practicalities.

    Give sufficient attention to all ESMS elements during the operation/dormitory walk-through. Knowledge of
    procedures, training using the procedures, awareness of complaints management and resolution procedure,
    employment rights, HR policy and provisions, etc.

    Pay special attention to areas identified in previous corrective action requests. Focus on open non-
    conformances from previous audits: why did they occur? Elucidate the underlying cause and make an effort
    to diagnose and prescribe preventive and ameliorative measures. The individual who is responsible for the
    item is not as important as why it occurred and how the company can prevent non-conformances and
    unplanned events in the future.




                                           D. INTERVIEWING WORKERS

    Select at least 5 percent of workers, max. 100 workers. Conduct individual and group interviews for balanced
    response.

    Select workers who are representative of the workforce population (gender, race, age, religion, functional
    departments, etc.).

    If the factory has contracted or migrant workers, make sure to include them as well.


    Do not allow supervisors or managers to influence selection of workers for interviews or the interviews.


    Conduct on-site interviews in areas that protect worker confidentiality and where the worker would feel
    comfortable. Make sure supervisors or managers are not in or near the space where the interviews are
    conducted. Keep them away from the selection and interview process.

    Conduct interviews early in the audit to allow for follow-up.
  9. Monitoring and Review

Make sure to tell the workers that everything they say is confidential and that management has been warned
against retaliation.

Be sensitive to cultural and gender issues.


Plan for an average of fifteen minutes per interview; however, use common sense in terminating interviews
that are becoming nonproductive and extending interviews with people who are candid or openly addressing
critical issues.

Formulate questions prior to the interviews to make sure you cover all specific areas of the ESMS review
through the aggregated interviews. Always ask employees how processes may be improved, water use
reduced, energy saved, waste reduced, etc.

If you plan to take notes, ask the workers if it is OK and clearly explain reason for taking notes. Try to
minimize note taking as much as possible during the interview. Finish writing your notes immediately after
the interview, so you have accurate documentation.

Have your worker representatives recommend a preferred approach to building rapport with workers.


Ask workers specifically about follow up on previous corrective action plans. What non-conformances remain
open; what issues presented through the complaints management and resolution mechanism remain open?

Make sure your questions address the following:
LABOR ISSUES
     Do workers know about and understand company’s policies related to labor and working conditions?
     Do workers understand their rights under the law related to freedom of association and collective
        bargaining?
     Do workers understand how their wages are calculated for base time, performance and overtime?
     Are workers aware of any dismissal, transfer, demotion or other punitive action against workers due
        to their exercising their rights under either their contracts or local or national law?
     Ask workers about the status of trade unions, worker committees or other worker groups and
        whether there is management interference.
     Ask questions to determine conformance to discrimination and sexual harassment policies.
     Do workers understand the company’s grievance mechanism, and do they feel it is operational and
        free from retaliation?
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES
     Do workers feel safe and protected in their jobs? For example, are they provided with PPE that is
        appropriate and works? Is their physical environment free of hazards? Are they expected to reduce
        physical hazards or are engineering controls in place? Are there job hazards assessments done
        routinely and when the processes or materials change? Have issues submitted through the
        complaints management and resolution mechanism been addressed?
     Do they feel there is adequate safety equipment, such as extinguishers/hydrants and first aid kits?
        Are there sufficient safety drills if an emergency, such as a fire, typhoon, flood or windstorm, were to
        occur and necessitate an evacuation from buildings? Witness the emergency mock drills and make
        note of shortcomings; ask an employee to pretend he/she has just been injured and explain what to
        do next.
     Are they instructed and trained on these risks at regular intervals?
     Have any workers been involved in accidents at the facility and, if so, what happened afterwards?
      9. Monitoring and Review

         Is the environment comfortable to work in, in terms of temperature, exposure to heat and sun?
         Do they feel that chemicals, waste and other substances are stored or disposed of safely and
            appropriately at the facility? Is there sufficient access to Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs)
            and/or International Chemical Safety Cards (ICSCs) and appropriate training in their use? What is
            the management’s response to any expressed issues through the complaint management and
            resolution mechanism?
    If the organization employs contract workers, make sure to ask questions that address possible violations
    and areas of abuse. Do you feel different from a permanent employee? Why?
    Conduct some worker interviews off-site if possible.




               E. INTERVIEWING AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

    The stakeholder mapping exercises and stakeholder consultation meetings should help identify the relevant
    population that is affected by the facility and its activities.

    Select a sample of individuals that represent the views of this affected community. This group may include
    members of the public as well as NGOs, campaign groups, trade unions, local businesses and government
    authorities. If possible, target NGOs that are industry-specific. Seek out former employees if possible, but
    filter out disgruntled former employees or those with a personal agenda against the company.

    Gauge awareness of the grievance mechanism. Has it been tested? Does it work? Does the company
    utilize it in practice or ignore it? Is it taken seriously?

    Be sure to include representatives from indigenous or marginalized groups in these interviews.


    Make sure your questions address the following:
         How have the facility's operations affected the physical environment (air, water, land) near them?
         Has this resulted in either air, land or water contamination?
         Has wildlife been affected by the facility's activities?
         Has the facility's business impacted local livelihoods or access to traditional
            hunting/fishing/breeding/religious/other grounds due to natural habitat conversion?
         Have any health risks or deterioration to well-being been associated with the facility from exposure to
            toxic chemicals, from air emissions or noise pollution? Note any neighbors or employees who have
            become ill or have ill children.
         Have any contagious or vector-borne diseases been on the rise due to an influx of workers in the
            area or increase in local vectors (e.g. mosquitos, flies)? Is the community aware of an increase in the
            rat/mouse or other vermin population?
         Have these affected groups had any clashes with security hired at the facility?
         Have any of these groups been approached or invited by the company running the facility to discuss
            their concerns at meetings? Have any of their grievances been addressed or investigated? Has the
            company followed up on questions?
         9. Monitoring and Review

                                           F. ON-SITE DOCUMENT REVIEW

    LABOR ISSUES:

    Make sure you review the relevant documents for the following areas:
    1.    Human resources: Management-worker committee meeting minutes, memos and letters, budgets
          related to implementing labor policy, training material, logs and curricula or written communications to
          workers that address all issues, training records and instructor qualifications.
    2.    Working conditions: Contracts for all workers; policies and procedures related to wages, benefits, hours
          and leave; evidence of communication and training on wage calculation; personnel files; time cards;
          payroll records and pay stubs (selected without management interference); criteria used to set
          performance pay bonuses; and employment and termination records.
    3.    Are employees’ payment methods secured? Can employees opt to have payments deposited into an
          account? Are employees paid in cash at the facility (which can lead to significant risks during their
          commute)?
    4.    Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining policy, agreement and documentation (such as minutes and
          records of collective bargaining sessions).
    5.    Discrimination: Discrimination policy; related procedures; documentation handling discrimination issues;
          diversity training and attendance log; hiring, promotion and termination records; gender demographics in
          facility at worker and manager levels.
    6.    Retrenchment: Policies and procedures for workforce reduction, severance and transition;
          documentation of prior workforce reductions; minutes of management meetings and communications to
          workers on this issue.
    7.    Complaint management and resolution mechanism: Documented procedure, communications, records
          and logs of grievance handling.
    8.    Child labor: Procedure for age verification, documentation of apprentice program, birth and medical
          records and school records of workers.
    9.    Forced labor: Employment contracts (as well as for those workers hired through recruitment agencies),
          payroll records, timesheets and wage deduction, worker passports and IDs.
    10. Health and safety: Accident and medical treatment logs, equipment safety logs, logs of fire and safety
        drills, health and safety risk analyses, government health inspection reports, safety certificates and
        training curriculum and logs, and evidence of changes to all of this when company processes, methods,
        chemicals, materials are changed, reordered, etc.

    Select files and/or records at random to generate a representative sample of the workforce population and
    functional distribution in the factory. Seek some files to corroborate interviews conducted earlier.

    Balance your time and effort investigating all areas of labor standards at work. Document review is
    particularly critical for wages, working hours, health and safety, use of sub-contractors, hiring and termination.

    If the operation employs contract workers, address potential areas of abuse in the document review.
    Specifically review the contract with the workers.

    Identify all significant incidences of non-conformance in preparation for your management meeting.


    ENVIRONMENTAL AND OHS ISSUES:

    Make sure you review the relevant documents for the following areas:
    1.    Emergency response and preparedness: Examine the facility's emergency response procedures and
         9. Monitoring and Review

          accident reports, as well as documents indicating that workers have been trained on these issues.
    2.    Environmental management: Examine any company environmental policies and environmental
          management system policies and reports, including sustainability reports, energy consumption records,
          guidelines and monitoring, resource use and waste generation. Note the status of previously identified
          non-conformances.
    3.    Insurance: Identify documents that indicate legal permits have been obtained, insurance policies are in
          place and the relevant legal authorities notified of the facility's activities.
    4.    Technical: Documents on production processes, and storage, purchase and maintenance of facility
          equipment. Availability of MSDS/ICSCs and employee training and orientation to the specific risk posed
          by materials in use; response to submissions through the complaint management and resolution
          mechanism.
    5.    Waste disposal: Policies, procedures and guidelines on elimination and recycling of waste emissions
          and effluents to air, water and land, including monitoring of the quantity and quality, treatment and
          disposal of all waste, including wastewater and solid waste; are employees/area supervisors queried for
          opinions on improvements?
    6.    Hazardous material: Inventory of chemicals and toxicology sheets (MSDS/ICSCs from
          ILO/WHO/EU/UNEP, etc.). Avoid total reliance upon manufacturer's statements. Does procurement
          mandate furnishing such materials (MSDS/ICSC)?
    7.    Health and safety: Check for the existence of logs of accident and fatality rates and monitoring of these
          statistics; health and safety guidelines or handbooks for workers; job hazard analyses and engineering
          corrections to eliminate hazards at the source, as opposed to requiring employees to mitigate
          environmental hazards; provision of appropriate PPE that cover actual, defined technical, physical,
          biological and chemical hazards in the workplace; records of OHS Committee meetings, training, Tool
          Box safety meetings, etc.
    8.    Work environment: Look for guidelines, reports, logs and "ecomaps" of the facility work environment that
          monitor emissions of dust, odors, sources of noise and vibrations and worker exposure to heat and cold.
          LEL meters and audible and visual alarms are mandatory wherever there may be accumulations of dust
          or ambient dust.




                                   G. CLOSING MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT

    Conduct a closing meeting with senior management and department managers.


    Present your preliminary findings with particular emphasis on the positives as well as areas for improvement
    and why. All new and previously existing non-conformances must be addressed. Seek clarification on any
    findings or issues raised during the audit.

    Work with the department managers and supervisors on a corrective action plan that details specific actions
    to be taken and timelines for their completion.

    Go over any outstanding corrective action requests from previous audit reports.


    Make sure senior management signs off on the corrective action plan.
