       For a selected EA in the first stage of sampling, segmentation denotes an action during the enumeration in the field; the field team divides the entire
      EA into two or more almost equal-size subdivisions. Afterward, the survey will be done in one subdivision randomly selected among all subdivisions of
      the EA. Segmentation is applied for EAs identified as large during the enumeration step by the survey team.

      high given the initial size of these EAs as already reported the 2008 EAs database. To correct, the initial size in the EAs database was taken into
      consideration, but this correction was done for a just few number of EAs (45 EAs among the total of 623 EAs).

      electricity_community is the percent of households in the community with electricity; mean_price_paddy_rice is the mean price of paddy rice across
      the seasons as available in the local community; remoteness is an index capturing how remote the community is in terms of access to services; sd_
      price_white_rice is the standard deviation in the price of white rice across the seasons as available in the local community. EPM = Enquête Périodique
