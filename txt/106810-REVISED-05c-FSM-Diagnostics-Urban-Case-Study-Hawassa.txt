Executive summary

Introduction
This report summarizes the main findings of a case study on fecal sludge management in
Hawassa, Ethiopia. It is part of the project entitled ‘Fecal Sludge Management: Diagnostics for
Service Delivery in Poor Urban Areas’, funded by the World Bank Water and Sanitation Program
(WSP). There are five city case studies as part of this project (Balikpapan, Dhaka, Hawassa, Lima
and Santa Cruz). The specific objectives of the Hawassa study were:

        To provide quantitative and qualitative data on the sanitation situation in Hawassa from a
         socio-economic perspective, specifically as it relates to FSM;

        To do the above in such a way that the data is representative of the city as a whole but also
         providing a separate picture of the situation in low-income areas, primarily through
         qualitative means in the Hawassa case;

        To provide initial recommendations to guide discussions around future interventions in the
         sanitation sector in Hawassa, by contributing credible data and analysis; and

        To inform the development of analytical tools and guidelines, by “road -testing” draft tools
         using primary data collection.


Methodology
The study followed an overall research framework developed as part of the inception period, which
set out research questions and sub-questions. Data collection instruments were then developed so
as to answer these questions. Four data collection instruments were used in Hawassa, two
quantitative and two qualitative. The quantitative instruments were a household survey and
transect walks. The qualitative instruments were key informant interviews and focus group
discussions.

The study team led on methodology design and data analysis, while data collection was
undertaken by separately-contracted consultants under the leadership of WSP. All data collection
was undertaken by JaRco Consulting based in Addis Ababa, with the exception of key informant
interviews which were undertaken by World Bank short-term consultants.

The household survey primarily aimed to collect data from households regarding their current use
of fecal sludge management (FSM) services and preferences for future FSM services. The
sampling allowed conclusions to be drawn about the city as a whole on a representative basis. The
transect walks enabled a subjective and qualitative assessment of physical and environmental
conditions within a community. The key informant interviews aimed to address key questions about
how both the ‘enabling environment’ and the operating environment affects FSM services (past,
current and future). Finally, the focus group discussions with residents of informal settlements
aimed to gather qualitative data that would complement, validate, or challenge conclusions drawn
from the household survey data.

Sampling for quantitative instruments was derived from the sampling for the household survey, for
which there were two sub-samples. For sub-sample A, the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were
menders (‘villages’), with initial stratification by “sub -city” according to their population to ensure
relatively broad geographical coverage. Sub-cities are the primary administrative division within the
city, with kebeles below them and menders the smallest unit. There are population data for sub-

                                                                                                       ii

cities and kebeles based on the last census, but no population data for menders. A list of the 162
menders was collected from all the 20 kebeles. For sub-sample B, the PSUs were also menders,
but they were purposively selected from using secondary data and expert opinion (of a WASH
consultant based in Hawassa) of where the poorest areas are. The same list of 162 menders was
used for selection, with no duplication. However, during data analysis it became clear that there
were problems with the way the local survey firm had undertaken sampling, data collection and
data entry for sub-sample B. This rendered the data from sub-sample B unreliable and therefore it
has not been used in this report. The Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs) were households in both
cases.

Analyzed results were presented to key stakeholders, representing the city administration, regional
water bureau, federal ministries and the World Bank WSP in Ethiopia, during validation meetings in
November 2015. These provided an opportunity for discussion around key findings and comments
to inform completion of this report.

These key data are incorporated into the fecal waste flow diagram shown below. This shows that,
while there is effective access to at least some form of on-site sanitation facility throughout the city
(resulting in no reported open defecation through the household survey and limited evidence
through other data collection tools), not all fecal waste is being effectively managed through the
later stages of the FSM service chain.

The highly permeable volcanic soils underlying Hawassa facilitate the infiltration of leachate from
pits and soakaways, resulting in the great majority of tanks and pits operating for many years

                                                                                                      iii

without the need to be emptied. Only about 10% of households in Hawassa reported having ever
had their pit or tank emptied. However, it also means that there is an increasing pollution load
reaching the lake which is one of the city’s main attractions.

Of greater significance in terms of current FSM needs is where households in less formal areas are
abandoning or covering pits once they are no longer in use (due to being full, or perhaps collapsed,
or no longer accessible for another reason). In such cases, households resort to finding or
constructing alternative facilities – but given reported concerns about the space to continue to do
this becoming increasingly scarce as the city urbanizes, eventually this option will become non-
viable and emptying will be required. A further challenge faces the city as it becomes more densely
populated. The soil’s absorption capacity will eventually be exceeded, putting the (little-used as
highly contaminated with natural fluoride) local groundwater sources and Lake Hawassa at greater
risk of contamination. These foreseen risks are indicated in the fecal waste flow diagram by the
brown shading of the large green arrow representing pits that are abandoned and covered over.
As Hawassa is growing and developing very fast, action will be required sooner rather than later to
improve fecal sludge management. The diagram indicates the need for the city administration to
identify priority areas for the introduction of sewerage options, while improving sanitation and FSM
services more generally.

The Service Delivery Assessment developed from the study shows that, in general, Hawassa’s
FSM service context is making progress in relation to the three major components of the
assessment: enabling, developing and sustaining services. However, when looking into the details

                                                                                                  iv

for each component, this reveals that greater attention has been given to improving the provision
and promotion of toilet infrastructure and to some extent the provision of emptying services to
support this. Greater weaknesses are identified in relation to the existing treatment facility and the
effective disposal of dried fecal sludge, or any actions to develop options for fecal sludge end-use
applications. The greater component of ‘treatment and disposal’ of fecal sludge in-situ (the 70%
shown on the diagram, where containment relies on local soils to continually absorb leachate from
pits and tanks) may be satisfactory for now, but as areas of the city become more densely
populated and soil infiltration capacity is surpassed, increased risks of localized surface ponding of
effluent and pit collapse are anticipated. Residents of low-income areas also voiced concerns that
the decreasing space to build new pits when current ones become full make this practice
increasingly difficult to sustain. Without greater attention given to investing in the future needs of
the city, risks to public health will increase. This will be particularly the case in the expanding low-
income areas, where concerted efforts will be needed to address issues of inequity and lower
service outcomes. To improve FSM services in Hawassa as a whole – and most notably for those
vulnerable to poor services and resulting health risks – greater attention needs to be given to
investment in a range of services that will meet the requirements of being appropriate, affordable,
available and adapted to the needs of all users.

The Prognosis for Change surmises that overall, the market for FSM services is functioning. The
few households whose pits fill up are able to get them emptied safely and the fecal sludge is, in
general, disposed of at the fecal sludge treatment plant. While only about 10% of households in
Hawassa reported having ever emptied a pit or tank, demand for services in Hawassa is likely to
increase as the population grows and becomes more dense. Households who have relied on
covering, abandoning and replacing full pits are unlikely to be able to do so in the future.

A key implication of the study findings is that the city administration should be planning ahead in
much more detail. While the city service delivery assessment shows that basic elements of service
delivery are there, important weaknesses in the enabling environment, relating to the planning,
expenditure, operation and maintenance and expansion of services, remain. This is a significant
challenge and in the medium-term the city administration must ensure households and the city
council are involved in and committed to any plans, since they will have implications for standards
and servicing of on-site sanitation facilities. In the shorter term, the administration must resolve the
issues facing the market for FSM services, which is currently in flux due to price variations within
and between public and private sector operators. The private sector can and should play an
increasing role in service provision, under strengthened regulation by the city administration.
Formalizing their role through licensing, alongside an increase in tariffs, is likely to support this.
The key recommended actions for Hawassa City Administration are therefore:
        Consult households and Hawassa City Council on the development of city-wide sanitation
         plans, especially where they affect changes to standards affecting containment
         infrastructure (septic tanks, pits and eventual connection to new sewerage systems);
        Resolve market-based issues for FSM services, through price review and negotiating an
         increased role for formalized private sector provision with licensing and regulation,
         alongside an increase in tariffs;
        Identify priority areas for development of sewerage networks – based on likely pollution
         risks to Lake Hawassa and saturation of soils;
        Address constraints at the existing fecal sludge treatment plant and negotiate land
         purchase to co-site the eventual construction of a new treatment plant, wastewater
         treatment plant and solid waste disposal facility.

1          Introduction and Research Framework

1.1        About this report
This report summarizes the main findings of a study on fecal sludge management in Hawassa,
Ethiopia. It is part of the project entitled ‘Fecal Sludge Management: Diagnostics for Service
Delivery in Poor Urban Areas’, here inafter “the FSM research project”. This work is funded by the
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) of the World Bank. There are five city case studies as part of
this project (Balikpapan, Dhaka, Hawassa, Lima and Santa Cruz).

This project is led by Oxford Policy Management (OPM) in partnership with the Water, Engineering
and Development Centre (WEDC) at Loughborough University. The full TOR for the project can be
provided on request. The overall objective of this assignment is: “to work with the WSP urban
sanitation team to develop the methodology, design, develop survey instruments and undertake
analysis of data collected from four field case studies (linked to World Bank operations projects),
refine the diagnostic tools and develop decision-making tools and guidelines for the development
of improved FSM services.” The scope includes the need for city -wide fecal sludge (or septage)
management services with a focus on poor urban communities.

This document is one of several that make up the deliverables for the FSM research project, and is
not a stand-alone report. It does not contain much background information and the assumed
audiences are the World Bank team together with others familiar with or interested in the Hawassa
city context, including the relevant municipal, regional and federal authorities. The inception report,
available on request, contains more background information on the project and the methodology,
including the Research Framework.

The report’s structure is detailed below. It begins with background to the research and the city,
moving into several sections analyzing the overall urban sanitation context, which are not specific
to FSM. Thereafter, the report focuses on FSM services and the market in particular.


1.2        Study rationale and objectives
It is common for poor people living in the urban areas of most low-income countries to use on-site
sanitation facilities, or to defecate in the open. Even when improved on-site options are used to
contain excreta, in many cities there exist limited formal services for collection, transport and
disposal or treatment of the resulting fecal sludge. Few instances of resource recovery through
processing fecal sludge exist. The service delivery gaps within and between the stages of the
sanitation service chain become more apparent as urban sanitation access increases. Failure to
ensure strong links throughout the fecal sludge management (FSM) service chain results in
untreated fecal sludge (FS) contaminating the environment, with serious implications for human
health.

Despite this, there are few tools and guidelines to help city planners navigate complex FSM
situations, despite increasing demand. This study builds on existing frameworks and diagnostic
tools, in particular the City Service Delivery Assessment scorecard, Fecal Waste Flow Diagram,
and the Economics of Sanitation Initiative toolkit – as indicated in Figure 1. The diagnostic and
decision-support tools are themselves based on tried-and-tested strategic planning approaches
and frameworks, with a focus on practicality, while the overall study aimed to update and develop a
wider range of tools and guidelines based on the results of five case study cities. In most of the
study cities, this has been supported by interaction with city stakeholders involved in ongoing

World Bank funding. Acknowledging the difficulty of reforming FSM services in cities, the political
economy dimensions of FSM are explicitly included as part of the overall analysis.

How the full set of diagnostic and decision-support tools and program design guidelines fit together
is represented in the following diagram, which is fully explained in accompanying study documents
available on request.

The specific objectives of the Hawassa city case study are:

        To provide quantitative and qualitative data on the sanitation situation in Hawassa, from a
         socio-economic perspective, specifically as they relate to FSM;

        To do the above in such a way that the data is representative of the city as a whole but also
         providing a separate picture of the situation in low-income areas, primarily through
         qualitative means in the Hawassa case;

        To provide initial recommendations to guide discussions around future interventions in the
         sanitation sector in Hawassa, by contributing credible data and analysis; and

        To inform the development of analytical tools and guidelines more broadly, by “road-testing”
         draft tools using primary data collection.

The Hawassa case study was primarily socio-economic rather than technical. It did not aim to carry
out technical inspections of infrastructure or produce detailed maps with neighborhood-level
analysis and recommendations. For those who have worked on sanitation in Hawassa for some
time, there may be few surprises, but the report does offer representative data to back up what has
previously been reported in smaller or more general studies.

                                                                                                     2

1.3         Research framework
During the inception stage, the OPM/WEDC team developed a Research Framework (RF), based
on the overarching research questions implicit in the TOR and draft research protocol. From these
questions, a logical set of project components were developed, and data collection instruments
devised that would help in the collection of data for the indicators making up each component. The
approach taken in the research is to place all components – as well as ensuing results – of the
study, within the context of the FSM service chain, to optimize its relevance and effectiveness. This
is clear from the full version of the RF in the inception report, with all components and questions
arranged along the service chain.

The initial structure of components from the inception report is reflected in Table 1 below. The
study methodology used for the Hawassa city study is described in the next section.

2                     Methodology

2.1                   Overall design
A key component of the case study was primary data collection. The study was intended to have
six different data collection instruments, four quantitative and two qualitative, each of which
contribute to various project components shown in Table 1 above.

However, in reality two of the data collection instruments (observation of service provider practices,
and testing fecal sludge characteristics) did not take place during the data collection period, as
explained further below. In addition, while samples of drinking water were taken and analyzed
during the Transect Walks, samples of drain water were not taken, because the drains were dry
during the period of data collection (see limitations in Section 2.4). The full set of instruments is
summarized in Table 2 below, showing those that were not conducted in italics.

Detailed research protocols for the instruments in the table above are available in a separate
instruments report, available on request. This section briefly summarizes each instrument, and the
following section describes the sampling approach.

Household survey: The household survey aimed to collect data from and about households using
on-site sanitation regarding their use of FSM services and preferences for future FSM services.
The household survey informs multiple components of this research. The sampling was carefully
planned so as to allow conclusions to be drawn about the city as a whole on a representative
basis. Questionnaire sections included household members and characteristics, use of water and
sanitation infrastructure, usability and observation of latrines, satisfaction and planning on
sanitation, filling up and emptying, and last time emptying.

Transect walk: The transect walk enabled participants to make a subjective and qualitative
assessment of physical and environmental conditions within a community. During the walk,
participants make systematic observations, discuss their observations and record their findings
using a standard reporting format. The information collected complements information collected
from household questionnaires, observations, and sample collection and analysis. For this study, a
transect walk provides information about the broad environmental risks to public health, in
particular with respect to the presence of fecal material and solid waste, and the likelihood that
these enter drainage channels and water sources. When all observations are complete,
participants ask community members a few short questions to gain information about typical
behaviors in the community that could be a source of risk (people defecating in the open or
throwing feces out with solid waste, uncontrolled latrine emptying or dumping of fecal sludge, etc.)
and the frequency of those behaviors throughout the year (daily, weekly, seasonal, etc.). These
walks were designed to give an overall picture of conditions in a neighborhood, with the aim of this
being built into a city-wide picture. They did not aim to allow detailed maps to be drawn with FS
flows to be physically tracked, nor did they aim to make operational recommendations at the
neighborhood level. Further discussion of this issue is in Section 5.

Testing water supply quality: During transect walks, samples of drinking water supplies were
taken from a selection of PSUs in the city and tested for levels of E. coli. The results can help to
identify the extent to which there is an association between poor FSM services and resulting levels
of fecal contamination in the local environment (i.e. in water supplies). This information, together
with results from transect walk observations, reported behaviors and practices associated with
sanitation in the community and other data sources, helps build up a picture of the public health
risks from poor FSM services, also with contamination levels (hazard), exposure and vulnerability.

Key informant interviews (KIIs): Key informant interviews (KIIs) are the way in which primary
information was sought to address key questions about how both the ‘enabling environment’ and
the operating environment affects FSM services (past, current and future). KIIs were held with
stakeholders having responsibility or interest in FSM services at city-level and beyond, allowing the
enabling and operating environments to be better understood in relation to their influence in the
city.

Focus group discussions (FGDs): The objective of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with
residents of low-income areas was to gather qualitative data that would complement, validate, or
perhaps challenge responses made during the household survey. Questions focused on obtaining
information relating to household sanitation and FSM practices (particularly identifying the
practices of “others” as individuals are reluctant to talk honestly about their own, or their family’s,
practices), service levels, past interventions, risks and other issues associated with FSM services
that affect their community.

Instruments not applied
Observation of service provider practices: This method aimed at making visual inspections
about fecal sludge (FS) handling from pits or tanks to final disposal, in particular watching service
providers go about their business. It required the identification of hazards, hazardous events and
an assessment of possible risks at each stage (containment, emptying, conveyance, treatment and
end-use or disposal) of the fecal sludge management chain.
The survey firm JaRco advised that, despite making several attempts to observe public or private
service providers of emptying services, no household latrines or communal latrine blocks within the
defined study boundary requested emptying services during the data collection period, although a
number of institutions, hotels and public toilet blocks were using emptying services. With the study
focusing on household-level FSM services, the practices associated with public and institutional
facilities were not of direct interest to this aspect of the study.

Testing FS characteristics: Assessment of the characteristics was intended to take place at three
stages of handling: (i) during removal, as this would influence the removal methods that could be
used, (ii) after removal, as this would influence how the fecal sludge can be transported and
treated, and possible resource recovery options, and (iii) after treatment, as this would determine
the resource value of the end product derived from the fecal sludge. For the same reasons as
given above in relation to observation of service provider practices, no samples were taken during
the data collection period. In addition, JaRco were unable to find laboratories able to carry out the
required tests for FS characteristics.


2.2        Sampling

2.2.1      Sampling for the household survey

In the sampling, the aim was to give a representative understanding of the city-wide situation.

The sampling frame for the household survey contains all urban areas within the boundaries
Hawassa city. These boundaries were defined by the boundaries of the 7 sub-cities making up the
main body of Hawassa.3

Originally, there were two sub-sample areas (denoted A and B). Sub-sample A is representative of
the city as a whole, while sub-sample B focused on poor urban areas (identified as the 30 Primary
Sampling Units, or PSUs, which are the lowest-income menders4 in Hawassa) without any attempt
to be statistically representative. However, during data analysis it became clear that there were
problems with the way the local survey firm had undertaken sampling, data collection and data
entry for sub-sample B. This rendered the data unreliable and therefore it has not been used in this
report.5 Explanation of sampling for sub-sample B is left in this section to give an idea of the
objectives.




3
  One additional sub-city about 20km from Hawassa, separated by several rural kebeles, was excluded.
4
  A mender is equivalent to a village, which comes under the administration of a kebele. A kebele is the smallest
administrative unit in Ethiopia, equivalent to a “ward” or neighbourhood
5
  The initial datasets received from the survey firm were not cleaned properly and had an uneven number of HHs per
PSU and sub-sample. Furthermore the GPS coordinates for both sub-samples were not within the sample frame. The
issue of the uneven number of HHs was due to manual error in recording the HH number and was subsequently
corrected by the survey firm. The issue with the coordinates was due to multiple GPS coordinate formats being used and
formats being recorded incorrectly; these were corrected by assumption but not to the extent whereby the coordinates
could be used to validate sub-sample fidelity.

                                                                                                                     7
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


The aim of sub-sample A was to get city-representative estimates at minimum cost and minimum
administrative burden. Therefore, it has a relatively small sample size, for example compared to
what would be necessary for studies with different objectives (e.g. an evaluation aiming to attribute
impact to an intervention).

Sub-samples and sampling units

        For sub-sample A, the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were menders (‘villages’), with initial
         stratification by “sub-city” according to their population to ensure relatively broad
         geographical coverage. Sub-cities are the primary administrative division within the city,
         with kebeles below them and menders the smallest unit. There are population data for sub-
         cities and kebeles based on the last census, but no population data for menders. A list of
         the 162 menders was collected from all the 20 kebeles.

        For sub-sample B, the PSUs were also mender, but they were purposively selected from
         using secondary data and expert opinion (of a WASH consultant based in Hawassa) of
         where the poorest areas are. The same list of 162 menders was used for selection, with no
         duplication.

        The Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs) were households, in both cases.

Sample sizes

To estimate the sample size for sub-sample A, the statistical software EpiInfo was used. The
sample size needed to generate city-representative estimates which, with a confidence level of
90%, was predicted to be 360 households, given other variables in the power calculation. 6 Surveys
placing a premium on representativeness would aim for 95% confidence, but it was decided that
90% was enough to give us a good idea of FSM services used in the city. It was decided to use the
same sample size for sub-sample B, for ease of comparison and understanding. The power
calculation would be identical for sub-sample B, but since the sampling is purposive rather than
random, there is no specific level of confidence. The total number of households surveyed across
both sub-samples was therefore 720.

Sampling methodology

Sub-sample A – city-wide

Firstly any menders which are outside our sampling frame are excluded. For this survey, that was
all the mender in Tulla ‘sub-city’ 20km from Hawassa and separated by rural kebeles, since these
menders are effectively a separate conurbation.7

PSUs were allocated to each sub-city according to population. This stratification process was
carried out by first rounding to one decimal place, and then again to an integer.8 This creates PSUs
of roughly equal size in terms of population. A random sample was taken from these PSUs using
the statistical software package Stata; ‘seeds’ were used to avoid systematically selecting menders
in sub-cities in the same order.

6
  This is based on an expected frequency of an average of 80% using non-networked sanitation (across all cities in the
study), a design effect of 2, a PSU/cluster size of 12, a total number of 30 PSUs, and a margin of error of 5%. For the
city-wide sample, our indicator of interest is the proportion of households using on-site sanitation (OSS), which for
Hawassa was found to be 100%.
7
  In other cities (e.g. Dhaka) whole PSUs were excluded which were predominantly characterised by university areas,
business districts, government administrative areas and diplomatic areas. However, in Hawassa there are no whole
mender like this, so instead these areas were excluded at the household-level sampling.
8
  For example, if a city’s population is 200,000 and a sub-city has a population of 25,000, then that sub-city should have
4 of the 30 PSUs ((25,000 / 200,000) * 30, rounded to nearest integer).

                                                                                                                        8
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


Households (SSUs) were sampled using systematic random sampling. 12 randomly selected HHs
were interviewed from each PSU. Populations of the menders were estimated from the populations
of the Kebele (e.g. if there are 5 menders in a Kebele of 1,800 households the population of the
menders is estimated to be 360 HHs). Households were selected using a random walk method; the
sampling interval is the population of that mender divided by 12. Enumerators started in any corner
of the mender, visiting the nth HH as per the sample interval. If the selected household were not
present the enumerators would return a further 2 times. If the HH were not present on the third
time, or they refuse to respond, then replace that household with the n th+1 household. If there are
still problems, then follow this procedure for the nth-1, then nth+2 and so on. Where the nearest
household is a building of more than one floor containing more than one household, the
enumerator is to randomly select a floor of the building.

Sub-sample B – low-income areas

After the selection of sub-sample A PSUs, a list of the remaining menders was collated. From this
50 PSUs were purposively selected as those which can be considered by local expert opinion to be
the poorest in the city. From those 50 menders, 30 were purposively sampled again, on different
criteria. The aim was to get a balance in geography and population density (e.g. even if all the very
poorest mender are in one sub-city, try and get some marginally less poor ones in geographically
diverse areas).

The sampling approach for sub-sample B within the full study was designed for cities like Dhaka
and Lima, where low-income settlements are quite large and homogeneous. To that extent, it may
not be as appropriate for secondary Ethiopian cities like Hawassa, where low-income areas are in
small pockets interspersed with other types of land use, and therefore not large enough to be
whole PSUs. In effect, Hawassa may not have 30 whole menders which can be distinguished as
“low-income” and sufficiently distinct from the rest of the city.

For sampling households/SSUs, the same process was followed as in sub-sample A.

2.2.2      Sampling in the other instruments

Key informant interviews (KIIs): The total number of interviews required, as well as the range
and extent of questioning, was influenced by the availability of current and reliable data from other
sources, as well as constraints on time and resources. Selection of interviewees was purposive,
based on advice received from stakeholders and existing knowledge of the World Bank consultant.

Focus group discussions (FGDs): 10 FGDs were held with households from 10 sub-sample B
PSUs, which were randomly selected from the total of 30 sub-sample B PSUs in low-income areas.


2.3        Fieldwork implementation
Pretesting, training and piloting: Initial pre-testing was carried out by JarCo to refine the
instruments before 4 days of enumerator training. During the training, all data collection
instruments were piloted in urban communities in both higher-income and lower-income areas, as
part of field practice for the enumerators. The team then joined a debriefing session before starting
data collection.

Field team composition: Three field teams were deployed for data collection. Each team was
composed by one Supervisor and five Household Enumerators. In addition to that there was one
qualitative team composed of one supervisor and two qualitative researchers. An experienced



                                                                                                    9
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


Field Manager was responsible for ensuring overall management, field implementation and quality
assurance.

Data collection: The field teams collected the majority of the data from the 60 sampled PSUs over
two weeks commencing 21st February 2015. On average, each team spent one day in a PSU.
Each household interviewer conducted the survey in six households per day, and thus each team
with two interviewers completed 12 households in a cluster in one day. For the transect walks
(TWs), two teams of three participants conducted all 40 TWs over ten days. For the household
survey, data collection was carried out using android mobile phones with and an Open Data Kit
app, on which the enumerators received specific training and which was used during field practice.
For other instruments, data collection was paper-based.

Data entry, cleaning and analysis: The household survey data were downloaded from the mobile
phones at the end of each day of fieldwork, while data from other instruments were manually
entered into Microsoft Excel. JaRco carried out data cleaning using various data quality checks,
including range checks, skips and internal consistency checks. After data cleaning checks, data
were then transferred into the statistical software Stata. Data were analyzed using Stata in OPM’s
offices in Oxford. Further extensive data cleaning checks were undertaken by OPM.


2.4        Limitations
This study has various limitations which are important to explain, so that readers understand the
strengths and weaknesses of the data and what conclusions can and cannot be drawn from the
analysis. These should be considered in the context of the objectives of the study (see section 1.2
above). These are:

     Technical factors – household surveys conducted by enumerators skilled in social research
      are designed to ask questions that can be responded to by the householders themselves.
      Such enumerators are not required to make technical inspections of sub-surface infrastructure,
      as this requires a different skillset. In a social survey, the household’s response is taken at
      face value (e.g. about the destination of their blackwater) as the basis for establishing the
      conditions experienced by the household at the time of the study.

     Sampling method – sample surveys are designed to estimate indicators for a broader
      population. Therefore, they cannot produce detailed data for specific neighborhoods without
      dramatically increasing the sample size and appropriate stratification. The sample size is
      relatively small, compared to what would be necessary for an impact evaluation, for example.
      In a similar vein, transect walks aimed to build up a broad picture rather than specific maps or
      explanations for individual neighborhoods. In addition, the study only focuses on residential
      areas and households, not institutions.

     Definition of Hawassa – the definition of Hawassa used is the administrative boundaries of
      the sub-cities forming the main body of the city, rather than any other definition in use. The
      Tulla ‘sub-city’ 20km from Hawassa was therefore excluded, as were any rural kebeles.

     Seasonality – The data collection took place in February and March, which is at the end of the
      dry season (November to January) and at the start of the first rainy season (February to May).
      Peak average rainfall occurs in April and during the main rainy season (June to October). The
      survey timing influences results, which in this case most likely influenced: the groundwater
      table being lower than average, stormwater drains being dry and demand for emptying septic
      tanks and pits limited. Other influences may also have been operational, such as changes in
      water usage patterns and people’s movement in and out of the city.


                                                                                                    10

3          Background to Hawassa city

3.1        Hawassa overview
Hawassa, the capital of the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), is one of
the newly emerging cities in Ethiopia. Located on the shores of Lake Hawassa in the Great Rift
Valley, Hawassa has a mean annual rainfall of about 950 mm and temperature of 20°C. The main
rainy season generally extends from June to October.

The catchment of Lake Hawassa is fundamentally formed of Pliocene-age volcanic rock.
Significant faults and ground cracks in the rock result in a highly permeable soil type which leads to
there being highly productive, unconfined aquifers in the area. The depth to the static groundwater
level varies from a few meters in the low-lying areas to up to 40m deep in elevated areas (Ayenew
and Tilahun, 2008).

The city’s water source comes mainly from deep boreholes outside of the city through a piped
municipal network. The groundwater below the city has a high fluoride content. During times of
disruption to the municipal supply, there is evidence that households in the peripheral areas of the
city resort to using wells to supplement their supply, but this water is used for non-consumption
purposes.9

The Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (CSA, 2015), gives the estimated population of Hawassa
for 2015 as 351,469, with an annual population growth rate of just over 4%. The population is
relatively young, with 65% under 25 years of age and around 5.5% over 50 years of age.

                                                                 The city administration is divided into 8

      access;
     old kebeles within the city: medium to high density; and
     newly developing informal peri-urban areas: high density within those on the city boundary,
      while those encroaching towards the city are currently more rural in nature.

Newly developing areas are inhabited by the very poor, with buildings in these areas largely semi-
permanent as the areas are formally assigned for redevelopment. Where residents are challenged
as to the legality of their status, they may end up paying to temporarily legitimize their stay.

Under the constitution of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People’s Regional State,
Hawassa City Council is the highest government body, holding city-wide leadership responsibilities
in relation to political, economic, judicial, administrative and security matters. Hawassa City
Administration (HCA) is the highest executive body mandated to oversee the delivery of all
municipal services. The Head of the HCA is the Mayor, under whom sit three main structures: the
HCA Executive Body, Municipality Services and eight sub-city Administrations. The HCA Executive
Body directly oversees activities of the different sectoral departments, authorities and offices
established to deliver services. The Municipality Services Manager and Deputy Manager have
executive roles to deliver services including Sanitation, Beautification & Park Development
Services, and Plan Preparation & Monitoring Services, each led by a coordinator. The Water
Supply and Sewerage Enterprise is the department responsible for fecal sludge management
(FSM) services in Hawassa.

3.2                       Hawassa’s sanitation context
Available data for Hawassa city indicates that improved water supply access in 2014 was 85%.11
The household survey conducted for this study identified that 97% of households throughout the
city have access to an improved water point.12 The fast population growth of the city means that
filling the gap between demand and supply of water in the city remains a major challenge, although
additional surface water sources are under construction to supplement current supplies from
groundwater sources outside the city.

Development and Park Service is responsible for the coordination of solid waste management
services in the city.

Definitions used in Ethiopia, or the Millennium Development Goal for sanitation, relate to the type
of user-interface (i.e. the latrine itself), without reference to how or where the latrine discharges
fecal waste beyond this containment stage, through to further stages of the sanitation service
chain.

For the purposes of this study, the focus is primarily the management of fecal sludge from
household latrines (i.e. the containment stage) through to end-use/disposal (see Figure 4 below).

                                                                                      End-use/

The case study does not focus on the structural condition of the latrine itself, rather the extent to
which it contains / does not contain fecal sludge and what happens to the fecal sludge from this
stage onwards. For this reason, later sections of this report refer to different categories for
household sanitation facilities and assesses fecal sludge management in relation to the service
chain above.

An assessment of access to sanitary latrines based on location within the city does not form part of
this study, but within the three broad classes of housing area and density (given in Section 3.1),
the sanitation services have been broadly identified to be as follows:

   In the well-defined housing and industrial areas, buildings are served by mostly septic tanks
    and soakaways. Septic tanks are emptied periodically using vacuum trucks.
   In the old kebeles, most of the houses are served by pit latrines. In some cases there are
    several households sharing one latrine. Some of these pits are emptied regularly, but in other
    cases pits are abandoned and new pits constructed.
   In the newly developing informal low-income communities in the peri-urban areas, there are a
    range of latrine types used, but with a number of households having no toilets at all. This has
    led to some level of open defecation.

Low-income areas are known to be mostly expanding in the southern area of the city, between the
city center and Tabor Hill.


3.3        Hawassa’s FSM context
Later sections of this report identify the scale of FSM services, based on qualitative and
quantitative data from the study. Here, we present the roles legally assigned to the key actors
involved in sanitation and FSM from federal to local levels, based on the key informant interviews
and field experience. How this plays out in reality is covered in Section 9.

The development of towns is supported both by the Federal and Regional governments. The
Federal Government prepares policies, strategies and development plans in consultation with
Regional counterparts. The range of Regional bureaus and offices, constituted under the Regional
Government, then have a responsibility to guide the development of the regions’ towns and rural
areas, supporting towns in implementing policies and strategies in line with development plans and
programs they are committed to deliver. The support is often in the form of capacity building,

institutional home.

4          Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams

4.1        Introduction
Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams (also known as SFDs) in their current form arise from some of WSP’s
previous work on urban sanitation (Peal et al., 2013). In short, an SFD is a visualization of how
excreta flows along the sanitation service chain. At each stage of the chain, the proportion of each
household’s excreta which is or is not effectively managed to the next stage of the chain is
indicated.14 At the end of the chain, the proportion of excreta which is effectively managed is
indicated as “safe”, with the remaining proportion deemed “unsafe”, and the primary destination of
that fecal sludge indicated in general terms (e.g. receiving waters, general environment, drains
etc.)15

Thus far, SFDs in different cities have been undertaken using different methodologies, as is often
necessary in the context of poor data availability. Furthermore, most SFDs so far (including those
in the 12-city study) were undertaken using secondary data and expert estimates. This study is one
of the first to use primary household survey data and field-based observations to construct SFDs.
A group of urban sanitation experts is currently developing the ‘roll-out’ of the use of SFDs, for
which other methodologies will be developed.16


4.2        Methodology
For this analysis, several key indicators from the household survey were used. In particular, data
from the following household survey questions was used:17

     A. “What kind of toilet facility do members of your household usually use?”

     B. “Where do the contents of this toilet empty to?”

     C. “What did you do when the pit or septic tank filled up last time?”

     D. “What was [the fecal sludge] emptied into?”

Of these, question ‘B’ is one of the most crucial for the construction of the SFD. It should be noted
that the household’s response is taken as given. It was not possible to confirm responses by
observation since enumerators were selected for a background in social research and not
sanitation. However they were trained to observe ‘above-ground’ components, so observation of
slab, water seal, superstructure, etc. was carried out in all households where permission was
given.

Given that ‘B’ is based on househo ld response, possible sources of bias include the household not
knowing the true answer, or knowing it but answering differently for fear of being identified as
practicing illegal behavior (e.g. pits/tanks connected to drains). The former is certainly likely, the
14
   Previous iterations of SFDs distinguished between safe and unsafe management, but here we refer to
effective/ineffective management. This progression has been made because it is difficult to know the safety of the
process, but if the excreta is managed to the next stage of the sanitation service chain we can say it is effective.
15
   It is acknowledged that FS may pass from drains into other water bodies, e.g. rivers, but the diagram focuses on the
primary destination.

   Full response categories for these questions are included in the survey questionnaire, to which there is a web link in
Annex C. In particular, it should be noted that the response categories to question B above were: (i) Directly to piped
sewer system, (ii) Septic tank connected to "piped sewer system", (iii) Septic tank with no outlet, (iv) lined pit with no
outlet, (v) septic tank connected to drain, (vi) lined pit with overflow to drain/elsewhere, (vii) unlined pit, (viii) directly to
sea, lake or river, (ix) directly to drain/ditch

                                                                                                                                     17

latter does not seem to be an issue given the vast majority of households who willingly disclosed
illegal behavior.

To analyze this data, an SFD matrix is created, as shown in Figure 5 below. It shows which data
sources are used and how they are analyzed into levels of effective / ineffective management of
fecal waste through the stages of the service chain – with results in the next section.

First, the household survey data on use of infrastructure (questions (A) and (B) above) is used to
allocate households to five categories shown in the column marked (1) in the figure below:

     (i)      “Sewered (off site centralized or decentralized)” – toilets connected to sewers (not
              on-site sanitation)
     (ii)     “On-site storage – emptiable” – on-site toilets (either pits or tanks) which can be
              emptied and are emptied from time to time
     (iii)    “On-site storage – single-use / pit sealed” – on-site toilets where pits or tanks are
              sealed and/or abandoned once they have filled up
     (iv)     “On-site non-storage – straight to drain/similar” – on-site toilets which connect to
              drains or open water bodies (e.g. hanging latrine, or latrine with a pipe connecting the
              pan directly into a drain)
     (v)      “Open defecation” – self-explanatory


The question of emptiability is key. Category (ii) above is denoted as emptiable, meaning that this
containment option involves a pit or tank which fills with excreta and is therefore emptied from
time-to-time rather than abandoned or sealed when full. In Hawassa, pits/tanks are not legally
allowed to be connected to drains. Between the two extremes of a closed system and a system
which never fills up, there is a spectrum of scenarios. This is partly reflected in the data below.

The data from questions (A) and (B) at the beginning of this section are allocated in column (2) in
Figure 5 below (a key shows the meaning of the color-coding of cells by data source). Next, the
proportions for each of the stages of the chain are allocated. As can be seen from the emptying
column, marked (3), a certain proportion of the population’s excreta which makes it to that stage is
emptied by a service provider, and the rest is not emptied. This is estimated by dividing the number
of households which reported emptying their pit (question (C) above), by the number of households
using emptiable technologies (questions (B) above).

The rest of the matrix follows similar logic. The full SFD matrix for the city-wide sample in Hawassa
follows. This section has given a brief overview of where the data underlying the SFD comes from.
The SFD itself is more intuitively appealing and presented in the next section.

It should be noted that since the data comes from a household survey, the proportions in the matrix
are proportions of households, not proportions of people or of excreta volumes.18 In Hawassa, the
mean household size for sub-sample A was found to be 5.5.




18
  Excreta volumes depend on a series of factors, not only population, and are quite hard to estimate. The use of a
population-related variable (number of households) is proportional to the amount of fecal microorganisms excreted and
therefore to the potential public health hazard.

                                                                                                                        18

Firstly, the household survey results and secondary data used as inputs to the SFD are shown in
the tables below for the city-wide analysis. After that, a separate SFD matrix and diagram for the
city is presented.

4.3.1         Survey results as an input to SFD

As can be seen in the table below, the majority of households use a pour / manual flush toilet
(36%) or a dry pit latrine with slab (36%). Use of a pit latrine without a slab is reported by 19% of
households, while a cistern flush toilet is reported as used by less than 10% of households. No
households reported practicing open defecation.

also because the FSM arrangements for shared latrines will be different to those of ‘private’
latrines. Accountability for dealing with full pits or blocked drains to septic tanks, as well as
payment for FSM services, may be less clear-cut in a ‘shared’ situation, recognizing that the term
‘shared’ could refer to a number of scenarios. The technology and service would be the same as
private household facilities, while noting that shared pits / tanks would be likely to fill up more
quickly, depending on the number of users.

As can be seen from Table 5 below, 81% of households reported using an improved facility as their
main latrine, where 32% of households used a private facility and 49% of households a shared
toilet. Of the 19% of households reporting use of an unimproved facility in the table above (pit
latrine without slab), 6% of these are reported as private facilities, while 13% are reported as
shared facilities. Overall, 62% of households used a latrine (improved or unimproved) which was
shared between 2 or more households – making this a significant element of sanitation provision in
the city.

As noted above, the most important question is where the fecal matter goes after flushing or
similar. The standard question in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) incorporates this
into the overall sanitation question (see WHO/UNICEF core questions available at
www.wssinfo.org). For this case study, an additional question was asked in order to get better
quality data.19 Household-reported data is relied upon for this indicator, while noting that
households may not always know the full detail, especially if they are renting. Furthermore, with a
socio-economic survey rather than a technical survey, it was not possible to physically verify what
lay below the latrine or toilet. Nonetheless, the enumerator training included ensuring that the
enumerators fully understood distinctions between the response categories. 20

Further discussion about the potential public health risks associated with the management of
blackwater, within the broader context of FSM services in Hawassa and the city as a whole, is
presented in Section 5.

The results are shown in Table 6 below. The first point to note is that no households reported
discharging blackwater in a way that might be considered to be a high risk – i.e. blackwater
discharging directly into the environment (such as through discharging to open drains) that would
put people at risk of contact with fresh excreta. The majority of households (57%), reported
arrangements that could be considered to be of low risk to public health, through the use of lined
septic tanks or pits, with slow leaching of fecally contaminated effluent into the ground in a situation
where the groundwater is not used for domestic purposes. 43% of households reported
arrangements considered to potentially pose some risk – where tanks and pits are either partially
lined or unlined and have no formal outlet (i.e. to a soakpit), or where they have an outlet – such as
to an onsite soakpit. In these cases, fecal sludge may end up finding a way into the environment,
such as through overflowing pits and tanks. Where the fecal sludge leaches into the ground, the

   As stated above, the question asked was “Where do the contents of this toilet empty to?” The question is answered by
all households, regardless of whether they owned a private toilet, managed a shared toilet or used a shared toilet.
20
   In Table 6, the data are reported as per the response categories used in the questionnaire, with footnotes in the table
below qualifying aspects of the data. The response categories used were developed on the basis of discussion with
experts on sanitation in Hawassa regarding prevalent containment options.

                                                                                                                        20

extent to which this poses a health risk is subject to further discussion – considered in Section
4.3.2.

61% of households use pit latrines and 39% some form of septic tank. Thus, with 100% of
households using on-site facilities, it could be reasonably expected that this would result in a
strong market for FSM services.

In order to assess the potential demand, households were asked whether their pit or tank had ever
filled up. The vast majority of households answering the question (92%, n=265) stated that their pit
or tank had never filled up, with only 8% reporting that their pit or tank had ever filled. Of the
households reporting that their pit or tank had filled up, 35% reported that the average time to fill
was less than 1 year and 65% that the time was less than 2 years. The average age of sanitation
facilities was reported as 10 years (n=302), with a median age of 8 years.

Given the prevalence of partially or unlined septic tanks and pits, together with the low reporting of
tanks and pits filling up, it is likely that significant volumes of contaminated effluent are infiltrating
into the ground below and immediately around these facilities, given the soil conditions in
Hawassa. The implications of this for public health are explored further in Section 5.

Finally, it is worth considering the reported household behavior in the context of pits filling up. This
was assessed by asking about the action taken by the household when their pit last filled up. As
can be seen in Table 7 below, the majority of households who answered this question reported
taking action that results in an existing facility being abandoned – leaving the household reliant on
another facility.

                                                           %      No. of households

It is difficult to interpret the implications of these responses, as the number of respondents to this
question is much higher than those reporting that their pit or tank had ever actually filled. This may
be for various reasons, including households answering the question about the pit/tank filling rate
in relation to their current facility but the question on past action taken in relation to a previous
facility.

                                                                                                        21
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


Of significance is that 31% of those responding stated that they had emptied and reused the pit or
tank. This accounts for only 10% of the total city-wide sample of 360 households, for which the
emptying methods and types of service provider used are considered in more detail in Section 6,
as part of the assessment of demand and supply for FSM services. Given that such a high
proportion of households answering this question (64%) covered and abandoned their pit, it is
likely that many households were answering on the basis of the previous question in the survey
(whether their pit/tank had ever filled-up) with respect to that particular pit currently in use. It would
therefore be wise to value the data in Table 7 more highly. Given 112 out of 360 households
answered this question, it could be concluded that 31% of the total sample had experienced any
pit/tank filling up (as opposed to 8% reporting that they had experienced the current specific
pit/tank filling up).

4.3.2      Presentation of SFD

Using all these results, together with secondary data gained during key informant interviews and
observation of the fecal sludge treatment facility at Alamura (see Section 7 for more details), the
SFD matrix and diagram were constructed for the city-wide sample. They are presented in Figure 5
above and Figure 6 below.

SFDs work on the principle of the matrix shown above (Figure 5). Household toilet technologies
and associated containment methods are shown on the left, with intermediate steps and primary
destination of the fecal sludge along the sanitation service chains shown to the right.

It is clear from the SFD that, for households with a containment facility that could be emptied, only
a small proportion of these facilities are reported as actually being emptied. The majority of fecal
sludge removed from pits and tanks is considered to reach the treatment facility (including when
emptying is reported as done by an informal provider), with only a small percentage reported as
being removed informally by households themselves or neighbors (refer to Section 5 and 6 for
more detail) and limited evidence of trucks dumping fecal sludge to land before reaching the
treatment plant. The efficiency of treatment at the fecal sludge drying beds is unknown and goes
undocumented, so a figure of 50% is used to account for seasonal variation in treatment capacity,
as discussed further in Section 7.

The majority of emptiable pits and tanks are reported as not being emptied. Where people are
using pits that are abandoned and replaced once full, it is highly likely that these are all in fact
simple, unlined pits, otherwise this would represent a significant abandoned investment. If this is
the case, then the fecal sludge in these pits (accounting for 20% of total facilities) will eventually
leach into the ground.

Where people are using septic tanks (lined or partially-lined) and lined pits, Figure 6 below is
based on an assumption that the fecal sludge that remains unemptied also remains in these pits
and tanks and even if it is interacting with the groundwater, there is no risk to public health or
environmental contamination, at present. The proportion of fecal sludge in this component (70%) is
therefore considered to be effectively ‘managed’.

Given the rapid growth of the city, the SFD also highlights that, for this 70% of contained fecal
sludge, which can be considered as effectively managed at present, the situation is going to
change over time. Shifting settlement patterns in Hawassa will result in the saturation of soils,
increasing levels of groundwater contamination and increasing reliance on poorly constructed
unlined pits in low-income areas. All this will contribute to a greater proportion of the fecal sludge
becoming unmanaged, with likely increasing risk to public health and environmental contamination

risk to the lake and other water bodies in and around the city. This is discussed further in Section
5.

The actual change in risk as a result of the change to the fate of fecal waste flows from a future mix
of facilities would require a much more detailed study. This has been indicated schematically in the
SFD that follows, by mixed green and brown shading for those on-site sanitation facilities which are
not reported as being emptied but are abandoned when full.

As noted above, the mixed green and brown shading for the facilities reported as not being
emptied indicates an anticipated change in the overall risk from the fate of these fecal waste flows
over time. The situation will reach ‘crisis point’ when there is insufficient sub-soil absorption
capacity for the total liquid effluent load being generated. As buildings are built in more central and
planned areas of the city at above say 3 storeys high, there will be a need for sewerage systems to
service those buildings. Other more informal and out-lying areas of the city are likely to maintain
the existing pattern of low-quality sanitation systems, while septic tanks will become more common
in the intermediate areas.


4.4        Implications of the SFD for FSM in Hawassa
The SFD shows that, while there is effective access to at least some form of on-site sanitation
facilities throughout the city (resulting in no reported open defecation through the household survey



                                                                                                     23
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


and limited evidence through other data collection tools), not all fecal waste is being effectively
managed through the later stages of the FSM service chain.

For many, the actual ‘management’ of fecal waste within their containment facility is strongly
influenced by the poor construction quality (resulting in partially lined or unlined tanks and pits) and
the soil conditions, resulting in those tanks and pits operating for many years without the need to
be emptied. Effluent from septic tanks is being managed through the use of on-site soakpits, or
steady leaching from the tank into the soil where tanks are not fully lined. As the city becomes
more densely populated, this practice will become increasingly untenable as the soil’s absorption
capacity is exceeded – with the resulting need to identify priority areas for the introduction of a
range of sewerage options. In some specific cases, or as an interim solution, there may be the
need to consider the use of well-constructed septic tanks, anaerobic baffle reactors (ABRs), or
other improved on-site containment systems supported by more responsive FSM services.

Of greater significance in terms of current fecal sludge management needs is where households in
less dense areas are abandoning or covering pits once they are no longer in use (due to being full,
or perhaps collapsed, or no longer accessible for another reason). In such cases, households
resort to finding or constructing alternative facilities – but given the reported concerns about limited
space to continue to do this, eventually this option will become non-viable and emptying will be
required. This is discussed further in later sections. It is likely that in most of these instances the
pits will be of low quality and poorly lined, putting them at risk of collapse if they are emptied
mechanically. It is also unlikely to be considered cost-effective to put them back into service by
having them emptied – unless this is done informally.

Creating the conditions for better containment and resulting safe emptying for all of these situations
will require a combination of interventions, which are considered further in the Intervention Options
assessment, under Section 10).

5            Public Health Risk Assessment

5.1          Introduction
A key component of the wider FSM study is to identify the extent of public health risks resulting
from poor FSM services within each city. The Hawassa study did not conduct all instruments
intended to support an assessment of the public health risks (i.e. observation of household latrine
emptying, testing fecal sludge samples taken during emptying and testing samples of drain water
were not undertaken, as explained in Section 2.1). Therefore, the limited data available from
Transect Walks and water quality tests can only provide an indication of the level and location
along the sanitation service chain of possible adverse public health impacts.

Methods adopted within the data collection instruments to do this include:

       -   Identifying types of household facility and emptying services used (supported by direct
           observation of the cleanliness and functionality of the facility), during the household survey;

       -   Scoring hazards and vulnerability factors observed during transect walks (see explanation
           below), along with information about local practices that could result in fecal contamination
           in the environment (see Annex C for information on the scoring system used and the
           summary of results);

       -   Measuring fecal contamination levels in local water supplies, to identify potential levels of
           exposure to risks; and

       -   Asking for perceptions of risk related to emptying services, during focus group discussions.

Collating and analyzing results from the data collection instruments provides information about
sources of risk through the service chain. This includes how clean and operational toilets are kept
within the household, and the extent to which infrastructure provides effective handling of fecal
sludge and wastewater through the city.

Given the very limited extent of data collected for this part of the study, it can only provide a
general indication of risks at positions along the service chain. The study is not intended to report
on specific locations or flow paths of fecal sludge movement within the sampled PSUs.21

For more information about the sanitation-related diseases and the significance of safe
management of fecal sludge to protect environmental and public health, see Cairncross and
Feachem (1993, pp.11-25), and Strande et al (2014, pp.1-4).


5.2          Results: risks through stages of the FSM service chain

5.2.1        Containment: household facilities, levels of sharing and practices

The standard of household containment facilities has been identified from the household survey, as
indicated in Section 4.3.1.

From the survey, reported levels of sharing show that 62% of households overall were using a
shared facility, of which 49% of households used an improved shared latrine and 13% an
unimproved shared latrine. Interestingly, ownership of private household latrines was high, with

80% reporting ownership of a private latrine (on plot) and 14% a shared latrine (on plot). Use of
communal toilet blocks was reported by 6% of respondents and use of public toilet blocks by less
than 1% of respondents.

Standards of cleanliness for facilities, observed during the household survey, show that 78% of
observed latrines had a cleanable slab and 66% no visible fecal or urine contamination on the floor
or slab (9% had feces only and 26% urine only visible). 82% were considered to offer reasonable
privacy to the user and all were reported to be operational at the time of observation.

Practices around the disposal of child feces can also introduce risks to both households and
potentially the wider public. 92% of households who reported their practices (n=122) identified safe
methods when managing the feces of children under 5 years old. 2% reported that their children
use the latrine and 90% that their children’s feces are put/rinsed into the latrine. Of th e 8% who
reported unsafe practices, 6% throw the feces out with solid waste, while the remaining 2% of
households either buried the feces, or put them into a ditch or drain. As 17% of households
reported storing their solid waste in a public place before collection, this practice could have
implications for contamination of the local neighborhood in low-income areas, given the highly
informal nature of solid waste collection practiced in these parts of the city.

Self-reported prevalence of diarrhea stated by the respondent during the household survey are
shown in Table 8 below. As can be seen, prevalence is low.

A question asking about the prevalence of diarrhea in children under 5 (for up to 4 children per
household) resulted in the highest prevalence rate reported for the youngest child, at 9% of
responses (n=158).22 The DHS survey data of 2011 shows that 13% of children under 5 were
reported to have had diarrhea in the 2 weeks preceding the survey, with diarrhea most common
among children age 6–23 months (DHS, 2011). While results from self-reported prevalence cannot
be taken as robust, this does indicate that children within the city may be more at risk from fecally
contaminated environments than adults, as would be expected.

Diarrhea prevalence is only one indicator of a contaminated environment. It is increasingly
understood that nutrition outcomes, especially stunting (reduced height-for-age) are strongly linked
to sanitation through multiple transmission pathways. While stunting has numerous determinants,
living in contaminated environments does appear to be a major causal factor.

5.2.2        Emptying: household practices around emptying services

As seen in the results from the household survey and discussed in the earlier section, all
households make use of on-site sanitation facilities discharging to lined, partially-lined or unlined
tanks and pits. The majority of these pits and tanks are in use but very infrequently emptied, or are
being abandoned and replaced when full. No households reported discharging blackwater into the
environment (drains, ditches or open ground).


22
     Responses given for additional children were at too small a number to be of any significance.

                                                                                                     26
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


Satisfaction expressed about the safety of emptying services was reported to be high, with 79% of
households reporting the use of emptying services stating they were either very satisfied or
satisfied with their safety. Risk as perceived by householders will not be the same as actual risk
resulting from the process – but focus group discussions reported that the emptying process is not
considered to introduce risks, either in the emptying or transportation stages. Trucks have not been
seen to spill fecal sludge, or contaminate the local area – and no one reported identifying risks
from the trucks transporting fecal sludge within the city.

The most likely source of risk will be as a result of the delay from needing a pit or tank emptied and
the services becoming available. This is discussed further in Section 6.4 considering the supply
capacity, but here it is worth noting that although it is at a small scale, households do sometimes
experience pits/ tanks overflowing. Of the households who have called on emptying services
(n=35), the main reason has been identified as the pit or tank being nearly full (95%) with 5%
reporting a pit or tank overflowing.

In response to a question in the household survey, 10% of respondents stated that greywater is
discharged into septic tanks along with blackwater, while 41% of households discharged greywater
directly into a soakpit. 26% discharged greywater to an open drain, ditch or to open ground. This is
backed up by observations during the transect walks, that noted the presence of limited drainage
infrastructure close to homes in over half of the PSUs, but any evidence of the presence of
greywater in only two of them. The transect walks also confirmed that no blackwater is discharged
into the environment, at least beyond the boundary of the household.

Unfortunately the study has not been able to make direct observation of emptying services for
households (while services are clearly used by businesses such as hotels). Given the limited
access to emptying services throughout the city, it has not been possible to gather evidence on
which to make informed judgements about the standards of service provision and consequences
for public health risk from those practices, over and above what is reported here from the limited
data in the household survey and focus group discussions.


5.3        Results: risks from wider environmental risks and practices
Solid waste

The 40 transect walks (30 conducted city-wide and 10 in low-income areas) confirmed that solid
waste dumping is the most frequent visible problem relating to environmental sanitation across the
city. Solid waste was reported as being discarded in drains and by the roadside, typically on a daily
basis, in over half of the city-wide locations and in seven out of 10 of the low-income areas. Given
that some households dispose of child feces with solid waste (see Section 5.2.1 above), this could
introduce a certain level of risk, particularly in areas with informal solid waste collection services, or
where children play in drains and in or around solid waste piles.

Public latrines / open defecation

The transect walks identified three city-wide locations in which a public latrine had some form of
fecal contamination. This was either from feces accumulating around the facility, or the facility itself
overflowing. Residents of those PSUs noted that open defecation occurred around two of the
public latrines on a daily basis. In a further six PSUs, residents reported that people defecate in the
drains “most weeks” and around the market in one further PSU.

During transect walks held in low-income areas, in one PSU residents reported that people
defecate near to the public toilet “most weeks”, around a tobacco farm in another PSU, and


                                                                                                        27

“around the road” on a daily basis in one other PSU. The extent to which open defecation is
currently occurring in Hawassa has not been possible to determine. For the purposes of this study,
it is considered to be at less than 1% of the total population, so is not included in the SFD for the
current status of the city. However, it is clear that the situation is likely to worsen, with resulting
levels of open defecation increasing, over time.

In only one of the PSUs was a diarrheal outbreak reported as having occurred in the last 1 year. In
this PSU, the public latrine was observed as overflowing, while residents reported both
uncontrolled dumping of fecal sludge by the public latrine and that people defecate around the
public latrines on a daily basis.

The presence of animal feces was also noted during the transect walks. In only one of the PSUs
in low-income areas was this reported as being widespread, while in seven of the 30 city-wide
PSUs and in two of the 10 low-income area PSUs animal feces was reported as being seen but
“limited to a few locations”. Donkeys are commonly used in Hawassa as a means of transportation,
so this is not a surprising finding. The implications of environmental contamination by animal feces
are not directly a part of this study – the results are simply noted here for information.

Water supply

Samples of drinking water supplies were taken in 19 PSUs, 10 from the city-wide sample and 9
from the low-income areas. The following table shows the number of PSUs in which total coliforms
and E.coli were detected at different levels.

Unless otherwise indicated, all supplies were from the town water supply to a dwelling – but these
may have been a private house or public building such as a school, cafe, clinic or hotel. As shown
in Table 9 below, contamination in the form of total coliforms was detected in seven of the city-wide
locations and in eight of the low-income areas. More significantly E.coli was detected in drinking
water sources from three of the city-wide locations (none of which were identified as being “High
income”) and in six of the low-income areas.

(n=9)


This suggests that fecal contamination of water supplies is occurring in a number of locations and
is more likely to occur in low-income areas. The extent of risk to consumers of the water will
depend on household practices and behaviors around treatment of water before drinking and using
it for other domestic purposes. 77% of households in Hawassa report having a piped water supply
into their yard or plot, with a further 10% having water piped into their home. 8% of households rely
on public taps and 5% get water from other sources (neighbor, vendor or well).

5.4        Implications: assessing the public health risk from poor FSM
Risk to public health, as a result of poor FSM services, comes when there is human exposure (i.e.
some form of contact) to the hazard (i.e. fecal sludge that contains pathogens), through an event
(such as walking barefoot over fecal sludge, working or playing in drains that carry fecal sludge
discharged from latrines, drinking water contaminated with pathogens from fecal sludge).

The study has identified that the most widespread source of environmental contamination is solid
waste – and where this includes fecal matter it could present a risk to public health. While fecal
contamination of water supplies was most commonly found in low-income areas, assessment of
the findings has so far not identified a strong association between the contamination and other
external factors including poor solid waste management, lower access of household latrines or the
presence of public latrines. Further investigation would be necessary to identify the sources of
contamination.

While current practices for managing containment and emptying of pits and tanks cannot be
directly linked with any risks to public health at present, what is of concern is how these practices
are coming under increasing pressure from the rapid expansion of the city. Where low-income
areas are growing in size and housing density, pressure on available space is becoming an
increasing concern. The current practice of abandoning or covering pits when they are full and
using alternatives will become increasingly non-viable as space runs out. The potential outcomes
are unknown, but may include more overflowing pits, or increased dependency on communal or
public facilities

Decreasing space to dig new pits

This issue was raised a number of times during focus group discussion (FGDs) held in low-income
areas – where people have up to now been abandoning pits – usually temporary ones – and
digging new pits, or reverting to other forms of sanitation. However, respondents acknowledge that
this practice will not be possible for much longer, as they are running out of space to dig new pits.
The implications for this on increased risk of direct fecal contamination from overflowing pits or
reversion to latrines shared with more households or even open defecation, as well as a growing
need for desludging services, cannot be quantified at this stage – but must be raised as a major
concern for any plans to address the informality of settlements and tenure security.

Contamination of groundwater

The household survey identified that 97% of households throughout the city have access to an
improved water point. Given this, and a significant number of people reporting using septic tanks,
the rate of emptying pits and tanks could be expected to be higher than reported. A number of
factors are likely to affect this situation – most notably the interaction between the groundwater
table and the contents of the tanks.

As indicated in the overview, the soil type in the area is volcanic rock that has a high permeability,
while the groundwater table is also within a few meters of the surface in much of the low-lying
areas around the lake. This would result in significant leaching from soakpits, unlined or partially
lined pits and tanks into the surrounding soils. Implications for health risks from the movement of
pathogens and eventual interaction with the groundwater (influenced by the depth of groundwater
below the surface throughout the year) is considered negligible – given people’s reliance on
treated water brought in from outside of the city and minimal, if any, use of groundwater taken from
shallow wells within the city for domestic purposes (especially drinking). However, the real
possibility of resulting pollution of Lake Hawassa in the near future must not be under-estimated,
as discussed further in Section 10.

                                                                                                    29
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


Pit / tank filling rates and emptying

As noted later in Section 6.3.1 in relation to pit filling rates, participants of focus group discussions
held in some of the low-income areas indicated that pits can fill with groundwater during the rainy
season, then the level drops during the dry season. The filling of pits from groundwater rising
above the base of the pit could result in the pit contents effectively ‘fluidizing’ on a regular basis,
with the content being ‘washed-out’ into the sub-soils.

This situation may be considered as “under control” at present, given that the demand for FSM
services is extremely low, as unlined pits and tanks take a very long time to fill. However, the
chance of localized fecal contamination from rapidly-filling pits and tanks will only increase as more
and more are poorly constructed, especially as low-income areas expand rapidly and become
more densely populated. Without the development of a viable service sector for pit and tank
emptying, this increases the risk of pits and tanks not being emptied before they overflow.

6            FSM service potential demand and supply assessment

6.1          Introduction
In economic theory, markets for goods and services operate on the basis of demand and supply.
This chapter provides a brief assessment of demand and supply for FSM services in Hawassa. At
this stage, it is important to note the difference between potential (or notional) demand and
effective demand. The potential demand for FSM services is considered to be the type and
quantity of services which would be demanded in the absence of any market failures or distortions.
This is different from effective demand, which is the type and quantity of services actually
purchased in the context of current supply and current prices.

Reasons for a gap between potential demand and effective demand in Hawassa include: (i) many
pits and septic tanks are unlined or partially lined with contents leaching directly from the chambers
into the soil, rather than fecal sludge being stored within a sealed tank and only settled effluent
discharging through a soakpit, (ii) poor operation of septic tanks, which are allowed to back-up
before being evacuated instead of regular desludging to maintain correct function of the tank and
soakaway, (iii) service providers may not be able to physically access households, (iv) market
prices for services may be higher than consumers are willing or able to pay.

On the supply side, the types of FSM services the market is currently providing to households are
considered.23 Dimensions of supply include the number of service providers of different types
(manual, mechanical etc.), the geographical areas they serve, the prices they charge, and so on.


6.2          Methodology
This sub-section sets out key dimensions of demand and supply, and the data collected related to
those, from the various instruments. The study did not set out to collect data on all of these
aspects, given the broad scope of the research and the limitations of some of the instruments
used.

6.2.1        Demand

In the research framework (see section 1.3), there is the following question: “What is the existing
customer demand and preferences for FSM services?” i.e. the current effective demand. This is
discussed below in three parts: (a) physical and economic determinants of household demand, (b)
household satisfaction with current services, and (c) the barriers which households face in
obtaining FSM services. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather covers those points
which were important for answering the questions in the research framework.

Physical and economic determinants of household demand

It is useful to separate the physical and economic determinants of household demand, because the
differences between them have implications for any interventions to either stimulate or respond to
that demand. Physical determinants are related to demographics, geography and infrastructure,
whereas economic determinants are more to do with markets and finance.

Some of the main determinants are set out in Table 10 and Table 11 below, which list various key
determinants and the way they have been measured in the research instruments, as well as if a
decision was taken not to collect data in this area.
23
     FSM services are also demanded by the government, businesses etc. but households are the focus of this study.

                                                                                                                     31

3. Financial
Ability to pay (ATP) – poor people do not always have the           No formal assessment of ability and
available finance to pay for FSM services.                          willingness to pay, as this was to be
                                                                    added at the request of the World Bank in
Willingness to pay (WTP) – people may have access to the            each city. However, we did collect data

4. Incentives
Tenancy status – households who rent property from a
landlord may not have authority to deal with sanitation matters.
Landlords may not want to pay for tenants’ ongoing services,
                                                                  Household survey question
connecting latrines instead to a direct discharge. Tenancy status
therefore influences the incentives and decision-making role of
the likely service purchaser.
Alternative sanitation options – if there is space, then            No data, since it is hard to gauge what
households can dig a new pit and cover the old one. If there is     options are open to households. We did
not, the household may still abandon the latrine and use an         however ask in the household survey
alternative option (shared/public latrine or open defecation)       what they planned to do next time their pit
rather than use an FSM service                                      or tank filled up.

Household satisfaction with existing services

Household satisfaction with the performance of service providers will be a determinant of demand.
This was addressed in two ways through household survey questions based on a four-point Likert
scale.24 Firstly, households were asked to rate their satisfaction level with various aspects of the
sanitation facilities used, including quality of construction, ease of access, privacy and cleanliness.
Secondly, households which had used an emptying service the last time their pit or tank filled up,
were asked to rate the service provider on price, overall service quality, safety and ease of
obtaining service.25

Other barriers which households face in obtaining FSM services

Some reasons for a gap between potential and effective demand for FSM services that may be
operating in Hawassa are already listed above (e.g. physical access to households and willingness
to pay). However, there are other potential barriers which households may face in securing FSM
services. Some of these barriers to accessing services have not been possible to predict ex ante.
These were therefore explored in the qualitative research, particularly through FGDs with
community members in low-income areas. Several of the discussion questions focused around
perceptions and opinions of existing services, and what participants would like to see in terms of
improved services in the future. Discussions were semi-structured, with participants able to discuss
questions more openly, so allowing for the identification of further determinants of demand not
otherwise addressed in the household survey. The full list of topics and questions addressed can
be found via a link in Annex D.

6.2.2      Supply

On the supply side, the research questions were around the current status and quality of FSM
service delivery, with a focus on assessing current technical and institutional capacity (i.e. the
scope and quality of services). This was assessed mainly through the report submitted by the WSP
consultants, using interviews with Hawassa City Administration, service providers and operators of
the treatment plant.

The following areas were considered:

        Physical capacity
            o Scale – number of service providers, their staffing capacity and areas they serve
            o Clients – number of clients in past month

        Technical/institutional capacity
            o Formality – whether formal (i.e. licensed/registered) or informal
            o Compliance – local regulations, or fines/persecution imposed

Answers on all these dimensions were not always available or forthcoming. Naturally, households ’
satisfaction with service providers (see previous section) was also relevant.


6.3        Findings – household demand for FSM services
The results in each key area are presented below, with an overall assessment provided in the
concluding section, alongside implications for FSM in Hawassa.

24
  Categories included “very satisfied”, “satisfied”, “dissatisfied” and “very dissatisfied”.
25
   A low proportion of households responded to this question (35 out of 360), so there are few observations for these
indicators.

                                                                                                                  33

6.3.1       Determinants of household demand

6.3.1.1 Accessibility of location

Whether a service provider can actually get to the facility requiring emptying (as well as the
household’s perception of this) will be a key determinant of demand for services. Data to assess
accessibility were collected from several angles and analyzed starting from road / path systems in
the PSU, before focusing down to the household level and, ultimately, the facility itself.

Some of the transect walk data sheds light on the kinds of housing density, paths and roads
observed in the studied areas. Table 12 provides scoring data for city-wide and low-income
areas.26 The main issue is that housing density is a significant issue in low-income areas only, with
paths and roads not likely to pose significant limitations on access for services either at a city-wide
level, or in low-income areas specifically. In terms of implications for FSM services, what can be
concluded from this table is that while mechanized emptying equipment may find it relatively easy
to access all areas of the city, reaching individual households may prove to be difficult in some low-
income communities.

     Notes: Definitions used to score Housing density, Paths and Roads are given in Annex C. Scores indicate relative
     impact on effective FSM (see footnote below and the table in Annex C), while values per parameter show the
     percentage of transect walks for which this score was given. There were 30 and 10 TWs held in city-wide and low-
     income PSUs respectively.

The type of building also influences the extent and nature of the emptying likely to be required,
though a large number of variables will affect this. Table 13 below shows that the majority of
households in Hawassa live in private residences (95%), mainly single-storey construction (92%)
and a few multi-storey (3%). The remaining 5% occupying shared residences. On this basis, the
majority of emptying arrangements will be within the control of the home owner/occupier.

  Scores of 1-5 have been developed to address a range of physical factors in the built environment for each city study.
The scores provide a quantitative value to represent the qualitative assessment of each factor, relative to the impact from
that physical aspect of the PSU on achieving effective and safe FSM services. A score of 1 represents the lowest impact
and 5 the highest impact. Annex C includes further explanation of the scoring mechanism.

Focusing on the toilet itself, Table 14 below shows the accessibility of the main pit/tank structure,
followed by the presence of a purpose-built access point to enable emptying (as would be
expected with a correctly-constructed septic tank for example).

Table 14           Accessibility of toilet for emptying equipment
                Access for emptying equipment                 %         No. of households

                Good access                                  47.8               172
                Access point for emptying                     %         No. of households
                Yes, purpose-built                           68.6               247
                Yes, squatting plate must be removed         16.4                59

Overall, from the perspective of accessibility it is clear that ‘geographical access’ to the toilet itself
is a concern for almost a third of households (28%), while there may be reasonable access
reported to gain access into pits and tanks for emptying.

Filling rate

Data on the type of containment is already shown in Table 6 in section 4.3.1 above. As noted
earlier, data were not collected on the volume of pits and tanks, since household estimates of this
were thought to be unreliable. However, households were asked how long it usually took for their
pit to fill up, which was considered more relevant, and a more reliable indicator for households to
estimate. The results are in Table 15 below. It should be noted that out of 265 households
responding to the question on whether their pit/tank had ever filled up, only 23 households (<9%)
answered “yes”. The data shows that among households in Hawassa who have reported their
pit/tank as having ever filled up, 35% are taking less than 1 year to fill and 87% less than 4 years.

Table 15           Average time taken for pit or tank to fill-up

                                                        %          No. of households
                      Less than 1 year                 35                   8
                      1-4 years                        52                  12
                      5-10 years                        9                   2
                      >10 years                         4                   1
                      Total                            100                 23


Considering data on sharing of latrines, the mean number of households reported to be using a
latrine which was shared was 5.3 (n=223). Where toilets are shared, it is worth considering the
numbers of people sharing in more detail, as is shown in Table 16 below. This comes directly from
data reported by all households, as opposed to estimations based on secondary data. It should be
noted that the average household size was 5.5.

Just under a quarter of latrines were shared with fewer than 5 people (i.e. one household), with
over 50% of people using latrines shared by between 5 and 15 people and over 20% using latrines
shared by more than 15 people. This supports perceptions expressed during FGDs about high
reliance on shared facilities, but perhaps suggests fewer households sharing each latrine than
indicated when respondents stated the number of households they shared a latrine with.

Where facilities are shared between households, they can expect to fill more rapidly than those
used by single families. However, filling rate is also affected by the size of pit, construction (extent
of lining) and soil characteristics. While the household survey did not include an assessment of the
physical characteristics of the facilities, participants in FGDs did refer to certain characteristics of
pits in low-income areas. In eight locations participants identified that emptying services had never
been used. Of the factors identified as possibly influencing this, they included:

    -    soil conditions: sandy soil and stony soil was noted as occurring at depth in three locations.
         While pits in these locations might fill up during the rainy season, the level in the pit drops
         again in the dry season;
    -    depth of pits: in two locations pits were reported to be anything from 5m to 10m deep.

The implications of this, coupled with the soil characteristics, water table and other factors are
considered in more detail in Section 5.

Financial aspects

Collecting data on willingness to pay (WTP) and ability to pay (ATP) was beyond the scope of this
study. However, data were collected on the price paid the last time an FSM service was used, and
whether households thought that price was fair.

First though, it is worth briefly considering finance for containment. Households were asked how
much they spent (in cash, including materials and labor) to build their toilet at the time when it was
built, if they spent cash at all. City-wide the average financial cost of constructing an improved
facility was US$156 (n = 178), while the cost for an unimproved facility was US$84 (n = 39).

Table 17 below presents the average cash contribution reported by households for all toilet types
(improved and unimproved) – for city-wide and according to wealth quintiles. Although the figures
are somewhat variable between the quintiles, it does indicate that all households are making a
significant contribution to latrine construction – most notably those in the lowest quintile, when
compared to their income level.

Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


Regarding repairs or maintenance to toilets in the past 12 months (including repairs to the toilet
mechanism, superstructure, or drainage arrangement), the average expenditure was US$114 (n =
51).27

Overall, households are investing significant resources in both the construction and maintenance
of their sanitation facilities. While 51% of households have spent money in maintaining their
sanitation facilities, these costs amount to 80% of the original investment for the construction of the
facilities.

With regard to payment for FSM services the last time emptying took place (Table 18), the mean
amount paid was US$61 (n = 34). 32 households (94%) paid a flat rate for the emptying service
and paid the full amount on delivery. These costs are considered further, in relation to the official
tariffs and reported charges made by private and municipal service providers, in Section 6.4.1 and
Table 21. For about half of household respondents, these costs were perceived to be high, while
the other half considered them to be fair.

                                                       US dollars         No. of households

                                    * Exchange rate: 1 ETB (Ethiopian Birr) = 0.048 USD



6.3.1.2 Incentives

The incentives that drive demand for improved FSM services are influenced by who is responsible
for the ongoing maintenance to keep toilets functioning. The household survey shows that 85% of
respondents own their property, so they will have greater influence over how their latrine is
managed. 80% of households used a private household toilet (on plot), with landlords reported to
be responsible for managing toilets in 30% of cases. This value does not tally completely with the
15% of people reporting to be in rented property. This may illustrate some confusion over the
definition of ‘landlord’ when responding to the specific survey questions, or be influenced by the
occupancy of government-owned “kebele houses”. These are large houses in the older parts of
Hawassa, often originally owned by a single family, but now with several families living in them and
paying nominal rents to the local government.

However, it can be ascertained that, with high numbers of households using an on-plot private
toilet, they are more likely to be responsible for servicing that toilet and/or what it is connected to
(i.e. a septic tank or pit). Most households are therefore key stakeholders in decision-making
around investments and plans to improve infrastructure and FSM services to support ongoing
functionality of the sanitation service chain.

Where households invest in a toilet facility, they are likely to have stronger incentives for seeing it
continue to function. 33% of facilities were reported as being strongly improved (with an overall
durable superstructure, cleanable slab, a roof and providing privacy, possibly with a water seal)
and a further 10% being basically improved (with a durable superstructure and cleanable slab).




27
  Most households reported that this expenditure was mainly for repairs to the toilet bowl/slab or to the superstructure
(82%), while only 8 households (16%) incurred costs for emptying their pits/septic tanks in the last 12 months.

                                                                                                                     37

6.3.2      Household satisfaction with current services

Households were asked to express their satisfaction with current services – both the sanitation
facility itself and the emptying services used – across a range of factors, as shown in the following
Figure 7 and Figure 8.

The majority of households (60-78% in all cases) reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the
sanitation facility, across all four characteristics in the question. Dissatisfaction with all four
characteristics was at a similar level (25-30%), with levels of being very dissatisfied limited to less
than 10% in each category. In this case all 360 households responded.

                  Very satisfied (%)         Satisfied (%)    Dissatisfied (%)    Very dissatisfied (%)


For the households who reported using a service provider (35 households, or 9% of respondents),
satisfaction levels (either satisfied or very satisfied) were between 65-80% for all four categories of
service provision. Levels of dissatisfaction were less than 35% in all four categories, with price
receiving the highest level for dissatisfaction (dissatisfied and very dissatisfied combined at 35%)
and the ease of obtaining services gaining the highest response for very dissatisfied at 20%.

The issues of price and gaining services are verified by comments made during the FGDs in PSUs
where participants had used emptying services. Respondents noted that households can be
waiting up to 3 months for a government truck to be available to provide emptying services, as the
public operations have restricted capacity. The private truck operators have much greater capacity
to response and often charge a much higher fixed rate per emptying. As a result, the flat rate per
emptying is typically 600 ETB (approximately USD 30) for the government service, compared to
1,600 ETB (approximately USD 77) for the private provider service. The private providers are
reported as being able to respond more quickly to requests, which will be influenced by their level
of capacity compared to the level of demand. Other aspects of service quality and safety were not
raised during FGDs as issues of particular concern.

Households were also asked their intended action once their pit or tank fills-up (whether it had filled
previously or not). The results are shown in Table 19 below. Less emphasis is given to this data
than what action was taken after the pit last filled up, as these intentions may not be carried out.
Nonetheless, it does indicate a strong degree of intention to use the mechanical emptying market –
with 78% of respondents inferring use of a mechanical emptier. Making use of mechanical
emptying services is by far the preferred intention – but in reality this is not the action that most
households have taken in the past.

The household survey data do not give insight into the reasons why people’s preferred option is
different to current practice, but responses given during FGDs in low-income areas do provide
some idea of the barriers households currently face in obtaining FSM services, as discussed in the
next section.

6.3.3      Barriers faced by households, in obtaining FSM services

Focus group discussions (FGDs) held in low-income areas identified that the key barriers faced by
households in obtaining FSM services relate to (1) cost / affordability, (2) access to services and
(3) legality of residence affecting latrine design and operation.

In relation to cost and affordability, householders living in low-income areas do not have the
financial resources to build a good latrine that could be easily and safely emptied. They also find
the emptying services expensive. The service providers charge fixed fees per trip and these are

                                                                                                                      39
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


recognized as very expensive by people who have used them – although in the vast majority of
cases, people are not making use of these services. Households are clearly aware of the services
on offer from the government and private operators, as well as the costs being charged for these
services. There was a reported lack of government subsidy, or direct financial support, to make
emptying services more affordable, but an expression of demand for these services if they were
“affordable”.

In relation to geographical access, the transect walks identified the main limitation for service
providers in low-income areas was housing density. This is indicated in Table 12. Respondents in
a number of FGDs also identified poor physical access to their area and to the households
themselves (dense housing and narrow pathways between them) as a constraint to using current
emptying arrangements (i.e. the mechanized vacuum tankers). In more formal areas of Hawassa
however, access for service providers to households does not appear to be a significant barrier.

The issue of tenure security is more complex and a significant barrier affecting households in low-
income areas within the city, particularly as these areas continue to expand and become more
densely populated. Households often arrange for an initial temporary shelter to be constructed on
an unregistered plot of land, sometime paying builders to construct them at night so it is ‘built’
before the authorities can prevent them from doing so. While they also do not have permission
from the Municipality to construct toilets, the household will generally construct a temporary,
unimproved and shallow (1-2m deep) pit latrine. When the pit fills up or collapses, it is abandoned
and a new pit dug. This practice is widespread and occurs while families have space to dig
replacement pits, but increasingly a lack of space is putting pressure on these households. Those
living in low-income areas identified that they have no incentive to build toilets that would require
emptying, as they are not prepared to make the investment in an improved toilet when it is in
danger of being destroyed by the authorities. They are effectively barred from receiving formal
containment or emptying services.

Households living in poorer areas of the city in general may end up using shared latrines, or one
of the few communal or public toilet facilities provided by the government or an NGO. 6% of
households in the city-wide survey were identified as using a communal (off-plot) latrine facility (as
distinct from the 14% using an on-plot shared facility) and less than 1% using a public (off-plot)
facility.

A further barrier for households identified during the FGDs was a lack of technical knowledge
and broader awareness about how to construct good latrines, effectively manage and maintain
them. Respondents said that with government support in the way of materials and training,
households would be prepared to provide labor and skills to improve their existing latrines or build
new improved ones. However, they see far less of a role for households in emptying these latrines,
unless and until: a) people have no other option (i.e. they run out of space to dig a new latrine pit),
b) they have permission to more permanent build latrines that are designed to be emptied, and c)
the cost and waiting times for services are reduced.


6.4        Findings – supply of FSM services
As set out in section 6.2.2, questions on the supply side of FSM services related to the current
status and quality of FSM service delivery. This was divided into assessments of physical capacity
of service providers (number of providers and the scale of service reach) and technical /
institutional capacity (the scope and quality of services).

6.4.1      Services effectively supplied

The first stage of the supply analysis is to consider what services are supplied in the market, where
effective supply intersects with effective demand. Some relevant context was already provided in
Section 4.3.1, especially in Table 6 and Table 7. These tables show that when pits have previously
filled up, some people do empty them, but the majority of households abandon the pit and make
use of an alternative. The data show that city-wide, only 10% of households in Hawassa have
emptied a pit or tank.

The households which reported having their pit or tank emptied last time it filled up were also
asked the emptying method and type of equipment used. The results are shown in Table 20 below.
This highlights that in all instances, some form of mechanical emptying was reported to be used. In
most cases, this was carried out by a formal private provider, followed by an informal provider, then
by the utility. Together these account for 77% of reported emptying methods.

These households were also asked about where the fecal sludge was discharged during emptying.
Households were only asked about the initial discharge point, as they would not always be in a
position to know where service providers eventually discharged to. All 35 households responded
that the contents were (initially) discharged into a machine/tanker.

Emptying by a member of the household, neighbor or “other” means was reported to account for
23% of emptying methods used. It would be surprising if a mechanical machine was employed in
all of these cases, but with the responses about the initial discharge point backing this up, it would
appear that use of a mechanized arrangement predominates, when people do actually empty their
pits or tanks. This is also supported by the high reported levels of satisfaction with the quality and
safety of emptying practices, as shown previously in Figure 8.

With regard to the type of payment made for services, almost all responding households (n=34)
reported paying a flat rate (94%), with only 6% of households (n=2) reporting being charged a
volumetric rate. As reported in Table 18, the average amount paid for emptying is approximately
USD 86 for formal private services and USD 70 for formal municipal services. However, costs
reported in the household survey vary by a factor of 16, from USD 14 to USD 230 for a formal
private provider, even with 94% of responses from the city-wide sample reporting a flat rate rather
than a volumetric charge.

The approved charge rates (applicable only to the WSE services) given by the General Manager of
Hawassa City Water and Sewerage Enterprise (WSE) are shown in Table 21 below. This highlights
the variation in official and unofficial charges for services provided by private operators and those
provided by the municipality. It is interesting to note that the prices reported directly from
households in the survey are almost twice the currently approved rates, and close to the
commercial rate. Even if this is a result of additional ‘informal’ fees being paid to the drivers, it


                                                                                                    41
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


indicates that the current rates paid are commercially viable. The General Manager also pointed
out that actual charges made by private operators are often more like ETB 1,500 (or USD 72 –
which compares with values reported during the FGDs), as operators are unable to achieve cost-
recovery based on the official rates and find that households are willing to pay more anyway. This
is placing greater strain on the Municipality for services, which they feel unable to respond to at
present.

In addition, the Municipality is proposing an increase to the official tariff, to achieve greater parity
between charges made by the public and private operators. An increase in fees will also support
the costs associated with trucks travelling to the existing drying beds – which places significant
wear on the vehicles travelling on the unmade and rough road as they travel up the hill to the site,
especially with a full load and during the rainy season. These costs are also shown in the table
below. At these rates, they are more like the charges reported during a focus group discussion in
one of the low-income areas of the city – which suggests that some households are already being
charged at the higher proposed rates for private operators. The full set of results in the table
highlights that household survey data are broadly consistent with other data sources.

Variations in charges will be affected by the capacity of the trucks used. The specific capacities
have not been determined, but are known to vary between those used by the private and municipal
operators. It is likely that the capacity in the range of private trucks is larger (between 7-10m³),
while those of the municipality are in the order of 4-6m³.

6.4.2      Service provider capacity

Mechanical emptying services

FSM services in Hawassa City are provided either by the municipality (Water and Sewerage
Enterprise, WSE) or private service providers.

    The municipality owns two vacuum trucks that carry out up to six trips per day. However, at the
     time of the study one of the municipal vacuum trucks had broken down and was out of action –
     and had been for some time. WSE expressed an intention in late 2015 to purchase a further
     two trucks, which may affect the decision to re-adjust the charge rate.
    There are five privately owned vacuum trucks registered with the Water and Sewerage
     Enterprise. In addition, a further four or five vacuum trucks provide emptying services
     exclusively for hotels, resorts and restaurants in the city. In total, up to twelve vacuum trucks

28
  These costs compare with an average of USD 57 for emptying by informal operators, as reported in the household
survey (n=6).

                                                                                                                   42
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


    can be operating in the city at any one time – although only up to seven are available to serve
    domestic properties. The private providers do not operate only in Hawassa, but sometimes
    move to other towns to gain additional business.
The private providers are considered by households to provide a faster response service, but they
are also reported to be unofficially charging much higher rates than the approved tariff. This places
greater pressure on the municipality, which charges lower rates, and feels that the level of demand
they face is putting pressure on their operators and the trucks themselves. As a result, the General
Manager of the Enterprise identifies that current capacity for FSM service delivery in terms of
materials, financial and human resources is insufficient, especially in light of the increasing
demands of a rapidly expanding city.

During interviews with city stakeholders, it was mentioned that private vacuum truck operators
complain they do not secure enough emptying jobs to make their work financially viable. The
seasonality of this work is in any case a commercial challenge. Together with the felt inadequacy
of the official tariff rate, these operators go on to identify themselves as operating from ‘ outside of
the city’ and are therefore able to charge unofficial tariffs when serving customers within the city.
Implications of this practice on future licensing of the operators is addressed in Section 9, the
Prognosis for Change.

Manual emptying services

The household survey did not identify any manual emptying service operating in Hawassa –
although in a few instances emptying of pits/ tanks was reported as being carried out either by the
household themselves, a neighbor, or a means “other” than a recognized emptying provider (see
Table 20). This accounts for only 8 households, or 2%, of those surveyed. Only one household
identified using a manual emptier in any intended future emptying. Interviews conducted by the
WSP consultants confirmed that manual emptying is virtually non-existent in the city.

Factors affecting household decisions about which service provider to use

The main decision households make is between using the vacuum trucks operated by the
municipality, or those operated by private providers, or to abandon their full pit/tank. Both providers
appear to offer a safe and efficient service, with no concerns reported during FGDs about the
emptying or transport practices introducing risk to people’s health, or contaminating their
compound, neighborhood or the city from poor operating standards and procedures.

The key factors affecting the choice between private and public emptying are cost and speed of
response. As identified in Table 21, the average fees reported as charged by private and public
providers (from the household survey) are not that different. However, actual fees more typically
charged by private providers, including in central areas of Hawassa, can be more than double
those more typically charged by the municipality. Set against cost is the bureaucracy that affect the
response times of the municipal services – particularly given the lack of capacity they currently
have. In spite of the private operators being registered with the Water and Sewerage Enterprise,
they are in a position to act more independently and informally when it comes to charging
households, as they provide a more responsive service. Waiting times for the municipal tanker in
some areas were reported as being up to 2-3 months – especially during the rainy season when
demand for emptying is at its greatest. Respondents stated in the FGDs that they would like the
municipality to address the waiting times when using the Enterprise truck, so that services can be
available as and when needed.

7          Fecal sludge treatment and possible end-use options

7.1        Fecal sludge characteristics
During the study, including the period in which survey data was piloted and conducted in Hawassa,
the survey firm was unable to arrange to take samples of fecal sludge being removed from
household latrines, or communal latrines used by households as their main latrine. This was
reported as being due to a lack of demand for emptying services from households during that time,
notably as it was during the dry season in Hawassa when demand for emptying services by
households is known to be extremely limited. However, it may also be that the sample areas were
not sufficiently extensive to pick up the emptying of septic tanks in more formalized areas of the
city, or from communal toilet blocks shared by households in the more informal settlements. As a
result, field-based samples for testing fecal sludge characteristics were not made available.
Despite this, fecal sludge emptied from commercial properties and institutions (hotels, offices,
public toilet blocks, etc.) continued to be emptied and transported to the fecal sludge treatment
plant, with discussion about the quality of services and treatment provided informed by those
operations.

Interviews held with vacuum truck drivers identified that trucks make on average four trips per day
in the dry season. This is reported to double during the rainy season, as a result of pits and tanks
being unlined and filling more quickly either by filling from below as the groundwater table rises, or
the inflow of surface run-off. With the city being a tourist destination, there are many large hotels
and resorts with dedicated vacuum trucks that can be emptying and disposing of fecal sludge at
least once a day. In addition, industrial effluents are likely to already be a significant contribution to
what is taken to the treatment plant. This will increase over time as the new industrial zone
expands – having an impact both on the treatment capacity of the site and the potential end-use of
treated fecal sludge.

Vacuum tankers were observed discharging fecal sludge at the treatment plant during the survey
firm training and while the WSP consultants were conducting interviews. The discharge from these
tankers was noted as being extremely liquid – with only a small proportion of the discharged fecal
sludge having any significant solids content as the tanker reached the final stages of discharge.
These tankers were identified as having emptied fecal sludge from hotels and other non-household
sources in Hawassa. It is to be expected that in such cases, significant volumes of wastewater will
be entering into the pits and tanks – from water used in cistern-flush or manual flushing toilets,
together with water used for anal cleansing and possibly greywater from showers, sinks and other
outlets in hotels and restaurants. This, combined with the limited access to fecal sludge emptying
services for households in Hawassa, will result in weak fecal sludge arriving to the drying beds.

The discussions that follow are based on limited data made available during this study. Any further
developments to the current treatment facility and detailed designs for any new treatment facilities
will require much more detailed investigation into the full range of domestic, commercial and
industrial effluents being collected and transported to treatment – both at present and anticipated in
the future.

7.2          Current treatment and possible future options
The Water and Sewerage Enterprise has a treatment plant located at the top of a hill near the city
and about an 18km journey from the city center. The location is known as Alamura. The treatment
system is made up of eight drying beds, with a total area of approximately 2,500 square meters,
and each bed thus has a surface area of approximately 300m².

The treatment process consists of dewatering of the fecal sludge by percolation of liquid through
the sand beds, and evaporation. The drying beds are open to the atmosphere and will be
significantly affected by the variation in rainfall and weather patterns between the dry and wet
season.

A maximum of 12 tankers (10 private and 2 municipal) operate throughout the year. An estimation
can be made about the volumes of fecal sludge potentially reaching the plant in the dry and wet
seasons, using data available from interviews and observations.

An estimation of the capacity of the plant size needed to take the loading of total solids (TS load)

proportion coming from hotels and other commercial outlets which will have a lower percentage of
TS as compared with FS from on-site systems)

Sludge loading height: 0.2m (the typical depth of FS on a drying bed)

The volume of fecal sludge arriving to the site each day (see Table 22 above for values):

         Dry season = 176 m³/day

         Wet season = 384 m³/day

Daily volumetric capacity required is therefore:

         Dry season = 176 / 0.2 = 880m²/day

         Wet season = 384 / 0.2 = 1,920m²/day

With each bed having an area of 300m², the number of beds required is:

         Dry season: 3 drying beds

         Wet season: 6.5, or 7 drying beds

On this basis, the eight drying beds would appear to be adequate. However, this is only true where
the treatment plant is operating as it is designed to, with effective monitoring, management and
planned maintenance. Observations made during both the dry season (March 2015) and soon after
the end of the wet season (November 2015) indicated very different conditions.

In March, no overflow from the beds was seen, as well as a number of beds containing dried
sludge, which could be emptied if required to take additional discharges of fecal sludge.

During a visit to the plant shortly following the rainy season (November 2015), fecal sludge was
observed to be bypassing, or overtopping, a number of the beds and accumulating in an informal
“pool” of fecal sludge further down the hillside (see images below). The condition of the beds was
also found to be poor, with damage to retaining walls around the drying beds and excessive plant
growth on the sludge.

What this indicates is that, despite the installed capacity of the drying beds being potentially
adequate, the treatment plant is not being effectively managed and its condition is deteriorating.
Exacerbating the issue of available capacity is that the wet season is the time when demand for
emptying increases – although at the same time the number of sludge trucks actually reaching the
treatment plant may be affected by the condition of the road, which is reported to become
impassable to heavily-loaded tankers when very wet.

Systematic monitoring of tanker effluent discharge and plant effluent (volume or quality) is not
taking place. The plant operators and manager do not appear to have the necessary skills,
competency or incentives to ensure good practice operation, maintenance and oversight of the
facility, in an effort to achieve optimal functioning of the plant. As a result, the strain on current
treatment capacity will only be exacerbated and eventually fail, given the almost total lack of
attention to monitoring and regulating the tankers, or operation and maintenance of the plant.

The situation at present does not appear to be creating a public or environmental health risk, partly
due to the remote location of the site where there is little human activity. However, there may well
be greater flows of untreated fecal sludge downhill during the peak of the wet season. If the
treatment plant continues to deteriorate, as well as access to it, there is more chance that informal
and/or illegal dumping of fecal sludge could occur, or that overflow from the plant will increase to
such an extent as to have a wider and greater effect on residents or farmers around the site.

Future treatment / re-use options

Once dried, fecal sludge is manually removed from the beds and the sand layer levelled to take
further discharges of fecal sludge. The means of disposal of the dried fecal sludge is not clear and
not documented. Fecal sludge is currently thought to be disposed of in open spaces around the
plant. It may be further utilized by local farmers on an informal basis, but there was no evidence of
this established. The municipality has indicated that Hawassa City Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection Agency (NREPA) plans to conduct tests on the fecal sludge to ascertain
the possibility of using it in the future as a soil conditioner. Given the weak nature of the fecal
sludge, it is extremely unlikely that other uses of dried fecal sludge (such as for biogas generation
or as a solid fuel) would be viable under current conditions.

Interviews identified that operation of the treatment plant may be contracted to a private sector
institution in the future. The decision for this would need to be taken by the Water and Sanitation
Enterprise. A clearly defined management structure, monitoring system and financial arrangement
would need to be developed. Such an arrangement is thought likely to help improve the operation
of the facility and could also promote use of processed sludge as a way to generate further
revenue to manage the plant. However, given the weak nature of the sludge currently received, the
capacity limitation of the existing beds to accept additional loading, operational challenges relating
to the site, including its location and access, a thorough assessment of private investment potential
and implications would be needed.

As such negotiations are occurring, there is a more strategic and pressing need to secure
additional land for the site of a new, extended fecal sludge treatment facility, co-sited with a
sewage treatment plant as and when this becomes a reality. This site would benefit from also co-
siting a new solid waste disposal site – as the location of the current site is known to be
problematic.

8          City Service Delivery Assessment

8.1        Introduction
The FSM City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA) is a crucial part of the analysis of FSM
services. It answers an overarching question around the quality of the FSM enabling environment,
the level of FSM service development and the level of commitment to FSM service sustainability.
The aim of the CSDA is to allow an objective assessment of FSM service performance through all
stages of the service chain, so as to identify priorities for reform. The prognosis for change
assessment (in the next section) then attempts to explain why some the CSDA looks like it does.

Like the Fecal Waste Flow Diagram (see section 4), the CSDA format builds on an approach
developed under the 12-city study (Peal et al. 2013). In turn, the 12-city method was based on
similar exercises in water and sanitation (e.g. Country Status Overviews produced by WSP).

The CSDA is arranged around three broad areas: enabling services, developing services, and
sustaining services. This is illustrated in Table 23Table 23 below, alongside the key question
associated with each area, and the indicators used.

8.2        Methodology
The CSDA aims to be objective and transparent, so the analysis is clear and stakeholders can
engage with it and update it over time as the situation improves. It is primarily a qualitative
analysis, based on a review of key documents and interviews with stakeholders at the city level. As
set out in section 2.1, WSP’s overall study design was that the OPM/WEDC team designed the
methodology, but did not do primary data collection. For analyses such as the CSDA and PEA, it is
very hard to separate data collection from analysis. Therefore, the collection and preliminary
analysis was conducted by a short-term consultant contracted by WSP.30

There are several questions beneath each of the nine overall indicators in Table 23 above, with 21
questions in total. For each question, there are objective criteria to enable a score to be given for
the city, with 0 (poor), 0.5 (developing) or 1 (good) on that question. Each question is scored along
the whole service chain from containment to disposal. An example is given in Table 24 below, for
the first question under the “policy” indicator.

30
  The analysis for the CSDA and PEA chapters of this report are therefore strongly based on the internal report
produced.

                                                                                                                  49

Once all of the questions are scored, the next step is to aggregate those scores into a city
scorecard, by summing together the scores for each indicator (policy, planning etc.). Because
there are different numbers of questions for each indicator, a final step is required, which is to
normalize the scores to a total out of 3 for each indicator. This is achieved by dividing the city score
for that indicator by the maximum possible city score, multiplying by 3, and finally rounding to the
nearest 0.5. This process delivers the overall CSDA scorecard.

The output for Hawassa is shown in Figure 9 below.

8.3        Findings
The overall CSDA scorecard for Hawassa is shown above. An explanation for each score allocated
to the full set of questions is shown in Annex B, while the following summarizes the implications of
those results.

8.3.1      Enabling

The extent to which components of the enabling environment are making progress (in relation to
policy plus to some extent planning and budgeting, at least for the construction of household
facilities) is the result of recent advances at national level for enhancing urban sanitation services
throughout Ethiopia. While FSM services are not explicit in existing documents, they are being
incorporated into the upcoming National Integrated Urban Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy – which

                                                                                                    51

will account for aspects of fecal sludge emptying, through to treatment and end-use. The overall
national objective has, up to now, focused on the safe containment of excreta. Upcoming
frameworks will account for the sanitation service chain beyond household containment and the
importance of both improving hygiene standards and addressing aspects of environmental
protection. The WASH Implementation Framework (WIF) and MoU between ministries of Health;
Education; Water, Irrigation and Energy; and Finance and Economic Development are seen as
providing a strong basis from which to deliver services. While the national enabling environment is
strengthening, implementation within Hawassa faces a number of challenges and opportunities.

   Institutional roles for sanitation are clearly defined in Hawassa, though they are stronger in
    relation to upstream services (containment, emptying and transportation), while aspects of
    treatment and end-use arrangements are less developed. This is all due to be addressed in the
    Integrated Urban Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy. The Municipal Enterprise Development
    Office is tasked to support the development of small and micro enterprises – but this has not
    been strongly developed for FSM services up to now. Private emptying service providers are
    somewhat uncoordinated and not strongly regulated at present. NGOs and other non-state
    providers generally limit their role to providing (communal) latrines in low-income areas, but do
    not offer follow-up support for the operation, maintenance and servicing of these facilities. A
    proclamation addressing private sector roles for liquid waste management is under preparation
    at national level and will eventually be adapted by Regional government and Hawassa City
    Administration, accounting for the local context.
   National targets, investment plans and budgets have been developed as part of the One
    WASH National Program (OWNP). A lot of significance is placed onto the OWNP, which is
    seen as a key mechanism through which WASH services will be enhanced throughout
    Ethiopia. This in turn places substantial responsibility on Hawassa Municipality to identify city-
    level targets, investment plans and associated budgets for the full range of sanitation and FSM
    services. Currently, budgets are focused on the provision of (public) toilet facilities and their
    operation and maintenance (cleaning, emptying, repairs, etc.) but not on aspects of treatment
    and disposal of fecal sludge. A new Hawassa City master plan is in preparation. This gives
    greater attention to sanitation than in previous plans, including both developing a sewerage
    network for the new industrial zone and possibly central areas of the city, and developing the
    capacity for FSM service delivery within Hawassa.

8.3.2      Developing

Recent capital investment in sanitation in Hawassa has been very low throughout all stages of the
service chain and is considered as be insufficient to meet current service requirements, or account
for the needs of the expanding city population. The range of service options currently available to
all users is considered as adequate in relation to containment facilities, in that the Municipality and
NGOs provide public and communal latrines in low-income areas and the Municipality is also
considering alternative facilities (including mobile latrines) to serve the poorest. This is reflected in
the reported 81% use of an improved latrine (private or shared). However, FSM emptying and
transport service options remain very limited and in low-income areas are constrained by cost,
access and durability of pits, with market growth for emptying services constrained by the lack of
demand for their services at present. There is clearly a problem in that demand for the cheaper
utility-operated trucks can result in a 2-3 month waiting time during the rainy season, while the
private sector operators often fill this gap.

The availability of capacity and resulting quality of services is considered as adequate – to the
extent that the status quo is not posing a risk to public health, either through direct contact with
fecal sludge in the open, or through use of the groundwater. There are however no defined
standards at present with which to measure the quality of service delivery – either in relation to the

                                                                                                       52

extent of sharing facilities, or monitoring performance of service providers and treatment facilities.
The Municipality is continually looking to improve on this and currently takes a forward-looking
approach to FSM services and sanitation provision for the city more broadly.

8.3.3      Sustaining

Support of sustained services, operation and maintenance of existing services, achievement of
standards at current demand levels, and development of the sector to respond to growing demand
are less developed – especially in relation to the stages of emptying through to treatment and end-
use.

A significant constraint to responsive FSM services is the lack of demand for emptying from
households. This severely constrains the market for private sector engagement or public
investment in not only improved emptying, transportation and treatment options to serve a wider
range of households, but also restricts households from being encouraged to improve containment
infrastructure that can be emptied affordably and safely. More reliable and affordable emptying
services would encourage households to invest in more durable pits and tanks, as the first stage in
improved non-networked systems as part of a future mix of networked and non-networked
sanitation options. This also has an impact on potential end-use of fecal sludge products given that
the fecal sludge discharged from commercial customers is typically very weak strength and at
present located away from the customer base.

8.3.4      Implications of the CSDA scorecard

The resulting CSDA scorecard of the FSM city service delivery assessment in Figure 9 reveals
firstly that in general, Hawassa’s FSM service context is progressing and considered to be
developing for the three major components of the assessment. The details within each of the
components of the CSDA framework and through the various stages of the service chain show a
very mixed picture, influenced by the unusual contextual factors affecting the city.

When looking into the details for each of the three components, this reveals that greater attention
has been given to improving the provision of household-level infrastructure and to some extent the
provision of emptying services to support it. The greatest weaknesses are in relation to the existing
treatment facility and the effective disposal of dried fecal sludge, or any actions to develop options
for fecal sludge end-use applications. ‘Treatment and Disposal’ of fecal sludge in-situ (through
relying on the capacity of local soils to continually absorb leachate from pits and tanks without
undue impact on public health or the wider environment) may be resulting in a satisfactory
outcome for now, but as areas of the city become more densely populated the infiltration capacity
is likely to be surpassed. This could eventually introduce risks through localized surface ponding of
effluent (especially during the rainy season where the ground becomes saturated) and increasing
pit collapse.

Perhaps not surprisingly, despite the weaknesses of the emptying services, the outputs of current
services people receive and overall service outcomes in terms of management of fecal sludge
within the city, come out more strongly. This is affected by how existing household containment
infrastructure (pits and tanks) are currently functioning (refer to Section 5.4). There were concerns
voiced that the decreasing space to build new pits make these practices increasingly difficult to
sustain. It is important to note that, without greater attention given to investing in the future needs
of the city, risks to public health will increase. This will be particularly the case in the expanding
low-income areas, where concerted efforts will be needed to address issues of inequity and lower
service outcomes. This suggests that, to improve FSM services in Hawassa – and most notably for


                                                                                                     53

those most vulnerable to poor services and resulting health risks – greater attention needs to be
given to investment in a range of appropriate, affordable and available services.

In addition to this, there are associate needs arising to i) identify the extent for sewerage services
in the central area of the city as it moves towards the construction of multi-storey dwellings and ii)
plan facilities and services to respond to the expected increased demand from the development of
the new industrial area.

An assessment of the combined challenges that need to be addressed to achieve sustainable
services in the face of such change, together with the incentives to be addressed, resulting likely
intervention options and actions to take forward are considered in the following sections.




                                                                                                    54

9          Prognosis for change

9.1        Introduction
This chapter provides a Prognosis for Change (PFC), by considering the positions of various
stakeholders, in particular the institutions and incentives at play. In the sanitation sector, key
studies considering these questions include a multi-country study carried out by WSP with OPM
(WSP, 2010) and a series of papers by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI, 2013). In
addition, SANDEC’s recent FSM book includes a chapter on stakeholder analysis, which is a key
methodology in this kind of assessment (Strande et al., 2014). Through this PFC, it is intended to
understand three things, outlined below.

Firstly, a PFC considers how “institutions” function. Here, institutions are defined as “the rules and
norms governing human interaction”, rather than a narrowe r definition of organizations. Institutions
can be formal, such as codified laws – one example in FSM might be a by-law about where fecal
sludge can be legally dumped. More importantly, institutions also can be informal, such as social
norms. For example, prevailing attitudes towards reusing fecal sludge in agriculture are an informal
institution.

Secondly, a PFC considers the incentives which institutions provide to stakeholders. A stakeholder
is any individual or group with an interest in the outcome of a policy. In FSM, some examples of
relevant stakeholders may include (but are certainly not limited to) sludge truck companies, the
City Council, or slum-dwellers. Stakeholders can be defined broadly or narrowly as required by the
breadth and depth of the analysis. For example, the earlier three stakeholder examples could be
narrowed to recent entrants to sludge truck market, the planning department of the city council, or
female slum-dwellers. This would allow more nuanced analysis rather than taking whole groups as
homogenous.

Finally, a PFC considers how stakeholders exert influence. Here, influence is defined as the formal
or informal power to cause something or to prevent it from happening. A city council may have
formal legal power, but if all their by-laws are openly flouted by service providers without fear of
punishment, then their influence is very low by that measure. However, they may have informal
power to influence FSM in other ways, for example in the ways their employees act regarding
regulation of truck companies.

In addition, in order to be practically useful, a PFC should also consider the implications of the
findings for effective engagement in a reform or change process. This involves an assessment of
the options for engagement, and weighing them up in the context of the prevalent power dynamics
and the likely response of stakeholders.


9.2        Methodology
In this study, developing a PFC was only one concern alongside a large number of other research
priorities, as set out in Section 2.1, near the beginning of the report, which lists all the project
components. There was therefore a balance to be struck. The approach in this broad study was to
link a focused PFC closely to the city service delivery assessment. The aim is therefore to explain
why the CSDA is as it is – in other words, to explore why the service delivery blockages exist, and
what entry points are available to try and resolve them.

Undertaking a PFC is a primarily qualitative exercise. It relies on targeted interviews or focus
groups with stakeholders, alongside secondary data in the form of key sector documents, reports
and studies. As noted in the CSDA methodology section, the OPM/WEDC team did not conduct

                                                                                                    55

primary data collection and preliminary analysis under this project, which was done by other
consultants contracted by the World Bank. Reports from these consultants were the primary
source of data for constructing this PFC. In order to keep the length of this report manageable, only
a brief summary of the full analysis conducted by the team is provided in this section.

Developing a PFC requires a structure in order to be clearly analyzed and communicated. There
are a bewildering number of tools available, which can be applied to particular questions so as to
explore some of the issues described above. Many tools which are commonly used, including in
this study, are contained in a World Bank sourcebook (Holland, 2007). Rather than take up more
space with explanation here, it is better to go straight into the findings. Briefly, however, the main
tools used include stakeholder mapping, process mapping and stakeholder analysis.


9.3         Findings

9.3.1       Hawassa’s FSM context

As noted above, the main objective is to explore why the CSDA results are as they are.
Considering the stages of the chain, the Hawassa CSDA shows good scores around containment,
fairly good scores for emptying and transport, and weaker scores for treatment and disposal. Along
the service delivery components, the main overall trends to note are that, for “emptying” onwards,
there are specific weaknesses in planning, expenditure, equity, O&M and expansion. The aim of
this chapter in the Hawassa context is to try and explain why this is the case, and what the
prognosis for change is.
It is worth reconsidering Hawassa’s context and the responsibilities of key actors, which were
already set out in section 3 above. In summary, three key characteristics of Hawassa’s context
include:
    (i)       Rapid population growth alongside horizontal expansion of the city into peri-urban areas
              which are currently rural. If the current population growth rate of 4% is sustained, the
              population will grow from around 350,000 in 2015 to more than 600,000 in 2030. This is
              likely to be accompanied by increased population density.
    (ii)      All households use a latrine or septic tank of some kind, according to the household
              survey, with about 81% using an improved type of latrine. Since 42% of households
              share facilities with more than 15 people, one might expect rapid filling rates, but
              demand for emptying is low. Only about a third of households had ever experienced a
              pit or tank filling up. This is probably due to the soil type, which allows most of the fecal
              sludge to leach away into the ground. Even then, only 31% of those experiencing a
              pit/tank filling up actually emptied it, with the rest covering and abandoning it and using
              another. Overall, this means that only 10% of households in Hawassa have ever
              emptied a pit or tank.
    (iii)     Emptying services, public and private, do exist and are used, but the market is in flux
              with the government provider intending to double the tariff. Private providers are already
              charging double the government rate, and many people are willing to pay them because
              the waiting time for the government trucks can be 2-3 months (especially during the
              rainy season). The fecal sludge treatment site has been constructed to a reasonable
              standard, but is poorly managed (e.g. limited record-keeping, collapse of some drying
              bed walls, considerable bypassing of sludge). Furthermore, it suffers from limited
              access during the wet season on account of the poor road conditions.
Demand for FSM services will only increase until sewers are built and become operational in new,
planned developments, which is unlikely to happen in the short term. With the population rising fast

                                                                                                         56
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


and becoming more dense, and there being less space to abandon full pits and construct new
ones, it is likely that emptying rates will increase.

However, some private providers complain of underutilization of their services, so it is likely that
there is spare capacity which could respond to increased demand in the short term, if people are
willing and able to pay the market rates. The current market situation could therefore prevail for
some time and there is not likely to be any sense of urgency in reforming the situation. There are
no immediate proposals for significant reform on the table, except for the likely tariff increase.

9.3.2       Mapping institutional responsibilities

As set out above, the focus of the PFC is how institutions function, the incentives which those
institutions provide to stakeholders, and how those stakeholders exert influence. It is therefore
important to understand who those stakeholders are, alongside their formal and informal roles. A
useful tool for this is stakeholder mapping, as set out in Table 25 below.

Stakeholders are categorized by type (e.g. national or local government, private sector etc.), and
their formal role in FSM in Hawassa is listed. In the next column, the reality of how they operate
(often informally) is described. A final column summarizes the core challenge represented by how
that type of stakeholder operates. Only an abridged set of stakeholders (e.g. only a few at the
national level) is included in the interests of space.

Overall, the message of the above table is that most stakeholders seem to be performing their
roles adequately and the FSM service chain is functioning well in comparison with many other
cities in Ethiopia and the region. However, there are weaknesses which need to be addressed
(especially proper containment and a clearer tariff structure) and things could break down quickly
in the event of heavy rainfall or a rapid population influx.

9.3.3      Illustrating static and dynamic problems

It is helpful to consider the issue of FSM in Hawassa in two dimensions. The first dimension is
static: that is, the snapshot of how households are dealing with their fecal sludge as shown in the
SFD. Here there are not too many problems, at least during the dry season, notwithstanding likely
groundwater contamination from effluents leaching into the soil. The second dimension is dynamic
– in other words, how the SFD may have looked like five years ago and how it may look in five
years’ time. Here, the city has been growing rapidly (and looks set to continue to do so) in three
dimensions:

        horizontally – expansion into peri-urban areas which were previously rural

        vertically – replacement of single-storey housing with multi-storey housing, including the
         proposed replacement of kebele housing with condominiums, which is a government policy
         across the country

        demographically – 4% population growth leading to a city of >600,000 people by 2030.

Taking the dynamic perspective, the SFD may look a lot worse in five years’ time if some key
issues are not addressed by the city authorities. Three of the most important key issues specifically
relating to FSM services are (i) containment in existing buildings, (ii) the construction of new
buildings, and (iii) the performance of the emptying market. In addition, ensuring provision of
adequate and reliable water supplies be essential to support the expansion of sanitation services
(particularly as any sewerage systems are developed), as well as protecting groundwater and
surface water sources from increased pollution loads.

With respect to new building construction, it will be important for key stakeholders to take a
coherent position with regard to quality of containment and planning for the full sanitation chain. In
particular, this will require dialogue between the Water and Sewerage Enterprise and the Design &
Construction Department (who have the role of inspecting new buildings). As new migrants to
Hawassa arrive, existing households rebuild or expand their dwellings, and developers build
condominiums, they must be incentivized to invest in sanitation options which offer the potential of
effective FSM. The WSE will presumably be involved in extending water supply to these new
buildings, so must at the same time insist on proper containment and accessibility for emptying
services (until a sewerage network is in place).

Even taking the static perspective and looking at existing buildings, it would be important to
promote properly lined pits that can be safely emptied, since in the future abandonment will
become less feasible due to lack of space. The Urban Health Extension Workers can have an
important role in communicating this to households.

Thus far, the analysis has mostly focused on containment, but it is worth considering the rest of the
service chain in more detail, in particular the emptying market and the WSE’s current operations.
There are three main issues, some of which were set out in Section 6:
        Slow responsiveness and associated low market share of WSE;



                                                                                                    59
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


        Tariffs not aligned with cost recovery and willingness to pay (i.e. loss-making utility and
         revealed higher WTP due to private sector market share); and
        Regulation of private sector emptiers who are currently operating informally (i.e.
         unregulated).

These are explored in the next sub-section using a tool called process mapping.

9.3.4      Illustrating the market problem

The market for emptying in Hawassa is in flux. The WSE is experiencing excess demand and the
private truck operators the opposite. Tariffs and licensing in this market could be reformed. On the
tariff side, private truck operators are successfully getting households to pay double the municipal
rate. Given the private sector has triple the market share of the WSE according to this survey, this
proves willingness to pay higher tariffs, at least on the part of households currently participating in
the market. Those who are not willing to pay those rates must wait for the WSE trucks to become
available. On the licensing side, there is anecdotal evidence that some truck operators are
benefiting from being based “outside” of the jurisdiction of Ha wassa (literally and metaphorically),
reportedly coming from the town of Shashemene and elsewhere. This is inefficient given the
additional fuel costs they must incur, and they have less oversight from city authorities. There may
also be a role for the regional level of government here (e.g. Regional Water Bureau) given this is
an issue going beyond the city.

It is possible to illustrate both these issues by using a tool called process mapping. This aims to
understand the interaction of formal and informal “moments” in a process, and to identify entry
points for engagement. It is important to identify the roles of stakeholders in a process, how and
where they exert influence over the process, and the incentives they face in the informal system.
Currently the WSE is the formal emptier. There is acceptance that the private sector operators
exist. Some, but not all, are registered with the WSE – various interviewees mentioned trucks
coming from outside the city boundaries. Therefore, elements of the private sector emptying
market remain informal. None are licensed from a technical perspective. The market therefore
contains elements of the formal and informal which are hard to disentangle.

The process for a household emptying a pit in Hawassa is shown in Figure 10 below. The central
column shows the formal process which is supposed to be followed by the household and the
WSE. The right-hand column, however, shows elements of the informal process, i.e. what really
happens in many cases. The left-hand column then shows possible entry points for reform.

There is no question around whether the WSE should be operating trucks. There is a clear benefit
to them being able to service public buildings and public toilets, as well as being in place for
emergencies, as well as providing indirect economic regulation in the market place through
competition with private operators. Arguably, however, the private sector may be better placed to
serve households on a day-to-day basis, since they are more responsive to demand and have
better incentives to deliver a good service. This is supported by cross-country evidence as well as
the current situation in Hawassa. The WSE is currently operating at a loss on its emptying service
because the tariffs it charges are lower than its running costs – if the emptying service was in the
private sector they would quickly go out of business. The WSE and its staff have little incentive to
improve the emptying service because it is subsidized by the rest of the business and nobody is
losing their job. The incentives at play are further discussed below.

This issue of how the emptying market should be structured is something to be discussed at the
level of the city administration, which has jurisdiction over the WSE (a market actor). It is inevitable
that this market will grow. If the household emptying market is left primarily to the private sector,
then some kind of licensing and/or regulation would be necessary to help them make the change
from informal to formal providers. One possible reform, and stakeholders’ likely response, is
discussed below.

9.3.5      Stakeholders’ likely response to reform

This section discusses likely responses of stakeholders to increases in government emptying tariffs
and licensing of private sector emptiers. The former is potentially desirable because the WSE’s
service is currently operating at a loss and households are clearly willing to pay more. The latter is
potentially desirable because households are likely to get a better and cheaper service from a
formal market with transparent pricing and competition. In this context of incomplete information on
the part of consumers, and the resulting unpredictable pricing, private sector emptiers are likely to
increase their producer surplus (and by extension, profit).


                                                                                                                   61

It is inevitable that demand for services will increase over time with population growth and
densification (making abandoning pits unviable), and more trucks will enter then market. Many
aspects of the private sector emptying market are informal, and some form of regulation or
licensing would bring them into the formal sphere. Most truck companies are already registered as
businesses under Ethiopian law, and some are registered with the WSE as service providers to the
public, as noted above. Others are supposed to operate for their institutions only (mostly hotels) so
are operating illegally if they serve the public (which some reportedly do on the side). Still others
are coming from outside the city boundaries. There are many approaches to licensing or regulation
which could be explored. One idea is explored further below.

The likely response of stakeholders to the proposal of a simultaneous increase in government
tariffs and licensing of private sector emptiers is explored in Figure 11, with further discussion
below. The magnitude of the increase in tariffs is assumed to be c.50% (to around 1100 birr). The
private sector could still charge whatever they like if the market will bear it (which currently is
reportedly up to 1500 birr). If these reforms were proposed separately this could be analyzed
separately with different results.

and licensing of private sector emptiers”

Increasing tariffs is rarely popular with households anywhere in the world, because some will have
to pay more, but the fact is that the private sector has three times the market share at sometimes
double the government tariff. Nonetheless, households cannot be expected to be in favor of tariff
increases. The city council, given their political role, are reportedly opposing tariff increases at
present (as happens in many countries), presumably for fear of becoming unpopular. Ensuring
equity is also a reasonable concern but arguably the best way to ensure equity is a functioning
market with well-known prices that ensure a good service. With respect to licensing regulators,
households may be marginally in favor if they thought they would get a better service but are
unlikely to be that interested. The city council may be slightly in favor of anything which formalizes


                                                                                                    62

markets in Hawassa, but their response to the proposed tariff increase is likely to dominate. The
city council obviously has more influence over the decision, but they will be aware of public
opinion.

With respect to private truck operators, they can be expected to oppose both reforms.
Formalization and licensing will decrease the likelihood that they capture more producer surplus
(because pricing and terms may become more normalized), and they will incur costs by conforming
with regulations (e.g. around safety equipment etc.). Their influence over the decision is likely to be
low, however, unless the owners are well-connected people which is unlikely to be the case. If they
are involved in the discussions as suggested above, this would increase their influence (but also
make them more likely to support proposals which they see as fair). The formalization of their role
could also bring them benefits later on (which they may not perceive at the time) in terms of the
size of the market increasing. For example, as the market is functioning well and Hawassa’s FSM
services are seen to be successful, it could mean more parts of the city staying on non-networked
sanitation services rather than converting to sewerage over time.

On the supportive side, relatively unimportant stakeholders are the health department, the Design
& Construction Department and NREPA and federal ministries. All are likely to have a broad
interest in FSM services improving in Hawassa, but all are marginal with respect to the proposed
reform. The health ministry leads on sanitation in general, but has little jurisdiction over the specific
issues in question (tariffs and licensing). The only way they are relevant is in their influence over
the city administration and city council.

The city administration can be expected to be in favor of the proposed reforms, in contrast to the
city council. This is likely because, as a technocratic institution with an interest in Hawassa being
seen as successful, they will want to see services improving and the environment protected. As the
guarantor of the WSE, they will be keen to improve cost recovery so as to avoid having to
subsidize it. They also have significant influence given their overall leadership on municipal
services. Their relationship with the city council is important in this respect.

Finally, the WSE can be expected to be in favor of both reforms. The increase in the tariff will stop
them losing money on emptying services, and will make the market less disjointed. They may well
increase their market share, but it is not clear that this is their objective. With respect to licensing,
the same rules will surely apply to them, but a more formal private sector will improve overall FSM
services in the city which the WSE should be keen to see. Their influence over these decisions is
low as compared to others, but the city administration is likely to consider them as important
stakeholders in any decision so their view is likely to carry some weight.

With respect to concrete approaches to licensing, the best initial approach may be to formally
license operators who are permitted to serve households and/or discharge fecal sludge at the
plant. The aim would be to protect customers, workers and the environment. Licenses could be
granted annually after providers fulfil certain criteria which could include: (i) technical inspection of
emptying equipment, (ii) vehicles are roadworthy, (iii) workers have access to deworming, (iv)
workers have adequate safety equipment. These would best be discussed in an open forum
including the emptiers themselves so they are committed to any outcome, as was done
successfully in the case of Dakar, Senegal. In terms of the institution best-placed to manage the
licensing, it could not be the WSE because they are a market actor. The Regional Water Bureau
may be better placed. This is not a specific recommendation of the study but rather an explanation
of the issue. Discussion of intervention options is in the next chapter.

Overall, it may not be too difficult to get agreement for licensing of private service providers, given
the increasing role they are playing in the city. The tariff increase is a more thorny issue. However,


                                                                                                       63
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


the city council may well agree to it if they can be persuaded that willingness to pay is already high
and it is likely to be richer households who use the services anyway.


9.4        Implications for FSM in Hawassa
This section concludes the PFC by setting out a summary of the implications of this analysis for
FSM in Hawassa.

Overall, the market for FSM services is functioning. The few households whose pits fill up are able
to get them emptied safely, and the fecal sludge is in general safely disposed at the treatment
plant. Given that FSM is dysfunctional in so many cities, this is fairly good by comparison.
However, demand for services in Hawassa is likely to increase with a larger and denser population,
and those households who have relied on covering and abandoning full pits are unlikely to be able
to do so in the future. Overall, only about 10% of households in Hawassa have ever emptied a pit
or tank, but this figure is likely to rise. The status quo of abandoning pits is not sustainable. There
will not be space to do so, and it risks the integrity of the lake which the city holds dear.

The question is whether the city administration is likely to be able to respond to increased demand
for FSM services. Currently the answer appears to be no, given the excess demand experienced
by the WSE trucks even under current market conditions. A key implication of this analysis is that
the city administration should be planning ahead in much more detail. The CSDA shows that the
basic elements of service delivery are there, but important weaknesses in planning, expenditure,
O&M and expansion remain. These are the key challenges. The message of the PFC is that in the
medium-term the city administration must get households and the city council on board with any
plans, since they will have implications for containment infrastructure. In the shorter-term, they
must resolve the issues in the market which is currently in flux due to the variability of prices. The
private sector can and should play an increasing role in service provision. Formalizing their role
through licensing, alongside an increase in tariffs, is likely to support this.

10         Intervention options
This section proposes interventions to improve fecal sludge management services in Hawassa and
provide an effective enabling environment within which those services can be appropriately
developed and sustainably managed. These interventions are informed by the survey data that
highlight problems with existing services (as most clearly represented in the fecal waste flow
diagrams). The interventions most directly affecting service delivery are then considered in the
context of results from using the broader detailed diagnostic tools, in particular the city service
delivery assessment (CSDA) and the Prognosis for Change (PFC), as presented in other sections
of this report.

The intervention options presented here are intended to support the further development of
detailed recommendations as and when other more detailed studies are undertaken in the city. As
such, this section does not identify or propose specific and detailed actions to be taken, who is
best placed to undertake those actions, what information is needed in advance of taking action
(such as additional feasibility studies), or the likely outcome of those actions.


10.1       Identified weaknesses, through the service chain
The key starting point for presenting weaknesses in the existing services is the fecal waste flow
diagram, as it identifies the extent to which fecal sludge is managed (or not) through the current
sanitation service chains.

From the diagram, “problems” or “weaknesses” in the process of managing wastewater and fecal
sludge at the key stages in the chain can be highlighted, pointing to areas where interventions are
needed to improve the status quo.

10.2       Proposed solutions, through the service chain
Taking the key problems highlighted in Figure 12 above, it is possible to identify feasible solutions
to address them, based on findings from the FSM study, and discussions with key stakeholders
within the city. These proposed solutions are grouped according to the type of containment/
discharge arrangements (i.e. the system type), considering possible interventions through the later
stages of the service chain.

At the level of analysis possible from this study using city-wide data, the solutions are not identified
on the basis of specific locations within Hawassa. This level of detailed analysis requires further
data sets and investigation. These findings can however offer guidance as to the types of
interventions to be explored in more depth as part of further work.

Table 26 on the following pages sets out possible technical interventions, whereas the sections
following the table consider interventions more related to the enabling environment of urban
sanitation, with a focus on FSM services. The options in the table are not necessarily mutually
exclusive and do not specify interim or staged approaches. These are discussed in the following
sub-section.

In summary, the key messages for action through the service chain are:

Containment: Standards of latrines must address quality relating to the construction of different
components of latrine (pits, pit lining, slabs, etc.), promote hygienic standards that can more easily
be maintained (e.g. cleanable slabs) and ensure easy access for emptying (e.g. design and
location of access points). Promoting the uptake of such standards may need to consider the use
of targeted subsidies to ensure minimum standards of facilities can be realized by all households
across a range of options. For septic tanks, a program to inspect the existing construction quality
can then promote, facilitate or enforce upgrading to correctly built and operated tanks. In addition,
for multi-occupancy and informal housing, attention is needed to reduce the levels of sharing
where this is excessive, with standards around required provision of additional private or public
latrines set to support this. Where current facilities cannot be emptied, promotion can be focused
on replacing or retrofitting (unlined) pits and tanks with smaller containment units designed for a
regular emptying cycle, such as every 2-3 years.

Emptying and transport: For low-income areas actions should consider the introduction of small-
scale emptying equipment, such as the hand-powered Gulper pump in use elsewhere in East
Africa, coupled with a simple means of transport such as a donkey cart or motor tricycle fitted with
a plastic water tank. As conventional tankers can operate in many parts of Hawassa (due to the
planned nature of access roads and housing plots), it may be helpful to consider a mix of “low -
tech” operators with simple equipment (mechanical and manual pumps), “high -tech” operators
working with vacuum tankers and passive tanks (i.e. operating with no pressure or vacuum) for
hauling removed fecal waste to the treatment site beyond the city boundary. An enhanced role
could be identified for those private tanker services who come under the jurisdiction of the City
Administration, as they become registered/ licensed, regulated and operate to agreed performance
standards. Their role could be further strengthened through the gradual introduction of scheduled
desludging as containment infrastructure improves and emptying services become more available,
affordable and in demand. In addition, experience from elsewhere shows that, in order to run a
viable business, operators need control over when and where they can discharge the pit contents.

Planning for increasing emptying capacity as demand increases will be essential. To support this, a
price review and price adjustment mechanism will be needed. Year-round access to the current
fecal sludge treatment plant must be ensured, including the upgrading and maintenance of the
access road.

Treatment and end-use: At the existing treatment plant, systematic monitoring of tanker effluent
discharge and plant effluent is necessary. The plant operators and manager must be fully trained
to understand and carry out their roles to ensure good practice operation, maintenance and
oversight of the facility, with incentives to achieve optimal treatment capacity from the plant. At the
same time, more suitable site(s) to increase treatment capacity and effectiveness will be needed,
accounting for future demand and possible markets for end-use products. Over the medium term,
land will be needed for this and/or sewage treatment, and given the difficulty of siting such
facilities, the process of identification and acquisition of the land should start as soon as possible,
to avoid serious problems in 10-15 years’ time.

An assessment of the market for a range of possible end-use products can then lead on to seeking
capital funding and partnerships with plant operators for the preferred option. The experience from
Dakar, Senegal of the FSM Market Structuring Program (PSMBV) would be worth exploring
further. This program identifies institutional structures, customer-based services, private sector

incentives and regulation, as well as technical innovation and development through the full FSM
service chain.31

Environmental protection: Finally, in relation to protecting the groundwater from excess pollution
and Lake Hawassa from the implications of this: studies should be conducted or continued to
identify major risks, mitigate against them and install appropriate sewered sewerage options into
critical areas, where necessary.

10.2.1 Towards city-wide incremental improvements

This section has so far identified and proposed recommended actions to improve service delivery
options for on-site sanitation systems in Hawassa. There is clearly a need to anticipate the extent
to which networked sewerage will become a part of future sanitation service options as the city
expands, becomes more densely populated and receives improved access to reliable water
services. Recommendations for sewerage services (including treatment options) do not form a part
of this study. However, a strategy to incrementally and sustainably transition towards greater use
of networked sanitation options, reduce reliance on unimproved services and gradually improve all
on-site systems will be essential.

This can be visually represented in Figure 13 below, which shows a broad “trajectory of change”
over time for city-wide sanitation in Hawassa. This starts at ‘Time 0’ with the current situation. The
key strategies for achieving improved on-site facilities and accompanying effective off-site sewered
options are that:

   over time, any open defecation and use of manual emptying options (reported as non-existent
    in the household survey, but considered to be possibly in use and/or becoming used as the city
    population grows rapidly) must quickly disappear. In addition, the extensive current practice of
    covering pits when they become full and digging new pits or reverting to ‘other options’ must be
    phased out.
   in their place, the use of on-site facilities with either on-request or regular emptying and
    controlled dumping or designated treatment must increase. Alongside this must be a gradual
    development of sewerage options (decentralized, non-conventional and conventional
    arrangements), with treatment, as the urban density increases.

10.3       The Service Delivery Context: priorities to address
Based on analysis of broader findings from the FSM study, the following sub-sections consider the
key areas of the Enabling Environment (as defined and grouped within the Service Delivery
Analysis of Enabling, Developing and Sustaining components) and identifies actions to support any
infrastructure-focused investments in Hawassa. While drawing on the CSDA results, it also draws
on good practice and relevant experience from elsewhere.

NOTE: It should be noted that this study focuses on the provision of current and future services for
fecal sludge management in Hawassa, where households are using on-site sanitation services and
are likely to do so for some time into the future. The authors of this report recognize that Hawassa
city authorities are planning the construction of an industrial district to accommodate the expanding
population and associated industry, with the inclusion of a sewerage network and treatment plant.
A sewered component of enhanced sanitation service access does not form part of the scope of
this study – not only due to the focus on FSM, but also to the assumption that any process
associated with a future planned introduction of sewerage to existing settlements will be subject to
extensive feasibility studies covering a range of possible options followed by detailed design of the
preferred option.

10.3.1 Enabling: policy, planning and budget

Policy: the federal policy and strategy framework for sanitation and FSM is relatively well
developed. The resulting area for attention is to ensure the translation of federal FSM-specific
policy and strategy objectives so that they are incorporated into regional strategic plans and
objectives for integrated WASH services in SNNPR and Hawassa city in particular. The One
WASH National Program (OWNP) is a strong federal mechanism for driving this process forward,
given its high political profile, buy-in from the four key Ministries and external support from leading
donors. With the Integrated Urban Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy recognizing the roles of the
Ministry of Urban Development and Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Climate Change, there
is a clear opportunity to develop plans and objectives focused on addressing the sewerage and
FSM needs for Hawassa in an integrated way. At the city level, these plans and objectives must
account for the needs of all citizens.

Institutional roles: key stakeholders operating within Hawassa City Administration know their roles
around sanitation and FSM services and perform them well – at least to the extent that they are
required to ensure provision of latrines, management of treatment facilities and ensuring
environmental standards are maintained. However, there remain areas where the planning function
within the municipality requires strengthening, to enable closer integration with regional strategic
plans and objectives, and to make the best use of the upcoming Integrated Urban Sanitation and
Hygiene Strategy. WSE would benefit from having a stronger role, in close collaboration with the
regional Water Bureau, for regulating private sector providers, as well as strengthening its internal
capacity to oversee a wider range of integrated non-networked sanitation, FSM services and
sewerage services for Hawassa. Plans and objectives affecting all the relevant regional bureaus
must ensure that attention is given to equitable services, if stakeholders are to develop sustainably
managed, comprehensive and inclusive sanitation services to address the growing and changing
service needs of city residents in the future. For this to happen, attention should be given to
improving the monitoring and enforcement of service functions, and developing the capacity of
WSE, and the Health Department in particular, to engage with the community and ensure needs
are being addressed. This process will be supported by more promotion of sanitation services
(sanitation marketing and behavior change communication) and perhaps the introduction of smart
subsidies targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable. In addition, mechanisms to support and
encourage stronger inter-agency cooperation, reporting arrangements and response standards will

                                                                                                     73
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


be essential for FSM services to be sustainably delivered, monitored and incrementally adapted to
suit the changing urban environment within the city.

Service provision and planning: beyond containment, FSM emptying services through to treatment
and end-use need greater attention – especially in response to the growing population and limited
budgets to address current and future needs. With improvements to improve containment and
ease of emptying of household sanitation infrastructure, demand for fecal sludge emptying and
transport services can be generated that in turn incentivize growth in those stages of the chain.
Enforcement of building codes by the Design and Construction Supervision Department needs to
be stronger if correctly-built pit latrines and septic tanks are to be rolled out through the city.

Budget: anticipated funding from the One WASH National Program needs careful planning and
management, to target priority areas appropriately. A significant infrastructure-based component of
the OWNP budget is the provision of additional public toilet blocks within the city. This provision
must be planned with the full service function in mind, with appropriate containment arrangements
(such as septic tanks) installed and connected to emptying services and/or eventual connection
into piped networks as these become available and within a suitable distance from the blocks.
Examples of such arrangements include toilet blocks discharging into decentralized (or semi-
centralized) treatment facilities such as anaerobic baffled reactors (ABRs) with effluent discharged
through planted drying beds, or connected into the expansion of centralized sewerage systems.33

10.3.2 Developing: equity and outputs

Choice / reducing inequity: attention is needed to increase the scope, flexibility and availability of
emptying services – but this will only come in response to improvements made in containment
facilities. Standards for the correct construction of on-site facilities will be needed – with sanitation
marketing and other promotional activities to encourage uptake of a range of technical options.
This may be enhanced through the use of carefully targeted subsidies. Introducing scheduled
desludging on a gradual basis can support improved emptying reliability and quality of
arrangements.

Outputs: the FSM service chain functions well in comparison to many other comparable cities.
Most notable weaknesses for attention, as in so many other cities, are around the construction of
safe pits and tanks, and the treatment and end-use/disposal of treated fecal sludge. Options to
enhance treatment capacity are being explored and should consider for example covered drying
beds (as used in Kampala, Uganda or Lusaka, Zambia), with attention to optimal location,
management and performance. Developments in the earlier stages of the service chain can offer
incentives to those running emptying services to increase access, reduce costs and improve
service levels.

10.3.3 Sustaining: O&M, expansion and service outcomes

Service standards and cost recovery: a more robust monitoring system for discharges at the fecal
sludge treatment plant should be initiated, to identify the extent of capacity overload, if any, and to
enable monitoring of the plant’s functionality. Movement of trucks should be more closely
monitored, supported by improved transport routes – especially the access road up to the fecal
sludge treatment plant – and monitoring operations at the solid waste disposal site, to ensure no
discharge of fecal sludge there during the rainy seasons. Addressing cost recovery issues will
require attention given to developing appropriate mechanisms for generating revenue streams.
This may be in the form of a ‘sanitation tax’ added onto water sales – where the costs are
33

Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


associated with the level of service provided. Such an approach is successfully being implemented
in Hai Phong, Vietnam where households connected to the sewer are charged a fee for
wastewater services, while households who are not connected to the sewer are charged a lower
‘environmental fee’. Any proposals for Hawassa should ensure sufficient revenue is raised to cover
costs associated with collection, treatment and disposal of fecal sludge, as well as sewerage
service functions.

Demand and sector development: Demand for FSM services is low and limited in coverage. This is
reflected by the lack of FSM actors serving households (more focus is to the commercial and
industrial dwellings) and inadequate government response to the growing scale of the problem.
Sector development needs to come first, with improved service options available, marketed and
more widely applied. It may be best to focus use of municipal tankers for serving public institutions
and emergency responses, while developing a regulatory framework for non-municipal service
providers. Greater clarity in the process of registration, licensing and regulation of the existing
private providers, with transparency in costs and review of pricing mechanisms will support the
development of these services to required standards. Initial external financial support and “friendly
regulation” can help more actors enter the market. Demand will only achieve any significant level
for service options to become self-sustaining when prices are affordable and services more
responsive.


10.4       Resulting prioritized interventions: guidelines for action
Considering results from the City Service Delivery Assessment and Prognosis for Change
(Sections 8 and 9 respectively), it is possible to recommend where actions are most needed in
relation to the non-technical components of the enabling environment (such as policy and planning,
institutional arrangements, capacity and financing), to support technical responses.

For such actions to be effective, recommended interventions must respond to how well developed
the enabling environment currently is. Based on the assessed status of FSM service development
using these tools, the following Service Delivery Action Framework tables present a range of non-
technical, ‘institutional’ interventions. Actions are grouped according to the current status of the
enabling environment: Basic, Intermediate or Consolidating.

The set of recommended actions have been developed from good practice and informed by the
experience of the authors in relation to the enabling environment for urban sanitation. They are
tailored to how well developed the enabling environment currently is, with a view to strengthening
it. As the actions account for the current realities in a city, they must be recognized as essentially
sequential and should be viewed as dynamic; that is, actions are proposed as being at the Basic
stage before moving towards the Intermediate, then the Consolidating stages. Where a city is
identified to already be delivering FSM service needs from one of these stages, the resulting set of
actions are taken from the ‘next stage’.

The recommended sets of actions are shown within the boxes that have a bold outline
                                                                                             ‘Action’
and shading.

As progress is made through these stages, actions can shift from being mainly about identifying,
reviewing or building awareness of services, through to actions that are more about establishing,
strengthening and promoting commitment to services, and on towards actions that are about
strengthening, consolidating and expanding engagement to achieve a more sustainable range of
enhanced services. The actions also move from prioritizing public health protection (which may
include developing temporary measures), to ensuring the protection of the environment and
looking at the potential for the re-use of fecal sludge end products. In the case of Hawassa, it is

                                                                                                    75
Report of a FSM study in Hawassa, Ethiopia


clear that a strong focus on protection of Lake Hawassa from adverse effects of contamination is a
significant priority – and specific interventions may be necessary to ensure this is maintained as
sanitation services are addressed.

The actions proposed for Hawassa in the Tables that follow (Table 27 parts a), b) and c)) can be
considered to be most appropriate to the current situation both in Hawassa and in Ethiopia more
broadly, associated with the status in relation to the “trajectory of change” in Hawassa (see Figure
13) as the enabling environment develops and strengthens.

As well as protecting Lake Hawassa, any improvements to sanitation services in the city should
also seek to achieve the following overarching aims:
   Ensure the needs of vulnerable family members (including elderly and disabled people,
    pregnant women and small children) are considered in the provision of facilities and services;
    and
   Adopt an integrated response to addressing sanitation, solid waste and drainage infrastructure
    and services. Only in this way can equitable, functional and sustainable services be delivered.

11           Conclusions and recommendations
The study has identified three key challenges facing Hawassa in ensuring continued provision of
safe sanitation services to all citizens of the city, including the development of FSM services.
These are in relation to:

    Addressing growth and associated densification of settlements throughout the city
    Ensuring equitable services as areas expand and service levels for household facilities adapt;
    Addressing the limitations and constraints of the existing treatment plant while improving the
     location, access, treatment and management of future treatment; and
    Achieving sustainable growth and expansion of services through all stages of the service chain,
     to match increasing demand.

Whatever interventions are proposed as a result of detailed, extensive and focused studies to
address these challenges, the findings of this study recommend that they must be sure to address:

    The extent to which sewerage options are needed and implemented for certain areas – such as
     industrial zones, in high-density areas and where on-site systems place a clear risk to polluting
     Lake Hawassa;
    Land requirements for future treatment plants, including wastewater treatment, fecal sludge
     treatment and solid waste disposal perhaps at a co-located site;
    Improving standards of containment facilities, especially for kebele and compound housing,
     with a particular focus on low-income areas;
    Building the capacity and appropriate division of roles for service providers, perhaps with a
     view towards the roles being focused around:
        customer services (i.e. what people pay directly for in terms of containment and emptying),
         where the private sector is often best placed to provide services;
        public services (that can be financed through taxation), in terms of the roles of facilitation,
         regulation and monitoring performance standards of the private sector actors, as well as
         management of treatment, disposal and end-use facilities; and
        integrating new infrastructure and services with enhanced drainage, water supply, solid
         waste management and urban upgrading.

Key recommended actions for Hawassa City Administration

In the medium-term (containment and emptying):
         -    consult households and Hawassa City Council in the development of city-wide
              sanitation plans, especially where they affect changes to standards affecting
              containment infrastructure (septic tanks, pits and eventual connection to sewers); and
         -    identify priority area for development of sewerage networks – based on likely pollution
              risks to Lake Hawassa and saturation of soils.


In the shorter-term (emptying, transport and treatment):
         -    rehabilitate and improve access to the treatment plant, and install adequately trained
              staff and effective operational and monitoring systems;
         -    resolve market-based issues for FSM services, through price review and negotiating an
              increased role for formalized private sector provision through licensing and regulation,
              alongside an increase in tariffs; and

                                                                                                        80

Annex C               Public health risk assessment: scoring used

Transect walks: Participants used a standard reporting format to allocate scores to help represent
a qualitative assessment of the relative impact from physical and environmental conditions on
being able to achieve effective and safe FSM services in that locality.

Categories included in the conditions that were recorded included: drainage infrastructure and use
(noting the presence of storm water, greywater and/or blackwater); evidence of open defecation,
dumped fecal sludge or solid waste; public latrine coverage; access to water points; housing
density; conditions of roads and paths. Each category was pre-allocated 5 observed responses,
ranging from very poor conditions (scoring 5) through to very good conditions or no evidence found
(scoring 1). Scores of 1 therefore represent the lowest impact and 5 the highest impact on FSM
services. Results from the 40 transect walks (10 in city-wide PSUs and 10 in low-income area
PSUs) are shown in Table 28 below.

For certain categories relating to FSM (for example evidence of open defecation, fecal sludge,
blackwater in drains) that scored 3 or more, participants identified the location of the observation,
how often the particular risk occurred in the area, by asking members of the community for
information, and the mechanism for human contact and contamination route (through people
walking in bare feet, entering drains, blackwater in drains overflowing near to homes, etc.).

Tables showing the format for all scoring conditions during the Transect Walks and for collecting
further details where high risks were seen, are available from the links in Annex D.

Definitions used to identify scores for housing density, paths and road access are shown in the
following table.
