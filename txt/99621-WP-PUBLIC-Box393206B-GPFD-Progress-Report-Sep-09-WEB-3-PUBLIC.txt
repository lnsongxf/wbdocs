A MESSAGE FROM NIELS HARILD
                                 I am delighted to introduce this, my last Annual Progress Report on the work
                                 of the Global Program on Forced Displacement (GPFD). When we began the
                                 program in 2009, our aim was to raise awareness within the World Bank
                                 Group (WBG) and more widely about the development impacts of conflict
                                 induced forced displacement, on the displaced, and on their host and return
                                 communities. Our vision was to shift the prevalent view at the time that
                                 displacement was primarily a humanitarian issue to be dealt with by
                                 humanitarian agencies. Our conviction was that the WBG could play a
                                 significant role in addressing forced displacement as a development challenge
                                 through its unique convening power and robust analytical, technical and
                                 operational tools and instruments.

                                 This vision grew out of a long career with UNHCR during which it became
                                increasingly clear that the approach to dealing with refugees both in the
immediate aftermath of crisis and during the long periods they were displaced was creating a dependency that
was slowly eroding the capacity and dignity of refugees and preventing them from living meaningful lives. In
addition, there seemed to be limited attention to the impacts on their host communities or in preparing for their
return home. I saw this firsthand when I was part of the core team sending several hundred thousand
Cambodians home from camps in Thailand in 1991-1992 and realized that a holistic development approach,
emphasizing self-reliance and the wider engagement of development institutions and actors, would have made
this process more successful. After some years in the WBG, I saw an opportunity to pursue this critical agenda
from within a major development institution working closely with partners, including UNHCR.

As I reflect on the last six years I am pleased to see the progress we have made on promoting GPFD’s
objectives. This report highlights these achievements, the obstacles in achieving them, and identifies the
opportunities and challenges ahead.

Earlier this year UNHCR released the latest figures on forced displacement; they are sobering and a reflection
of the ongoing crises across the globe including the growing European migration crisis unfolding before our
eyes. There are now over 60 million people impacted by displacement, either as refugees, internally displaced
persons (IDPs) or as asylum seekers. Displacement has significant personal, social, economic and political
impacts, and when protracted, as in the case in many fragile and conflict affected situations, it is a threat to
economic development and the fight against poverty. However, when the displaced are offered solutions to
restore some normality to their lives and be self-reliant, often they are able to contribute to their host
communities and be better prepared to return home if the situation stabilizes. The key focus of GPFD’s work
has been to find more effective development approaches to forced displacement in crisis situations, in
protracted situations, and when solutions are found, and to support the policies and responses of affected
governments and their partners.

Over the last year and a half, GPFD has continued to strengthen and deepen its analytical and operational
work alongside teams from within and outside the WBG to ensure that the development dimensions of
displacement are widely understood and incorporated into programs and projects. Building on a strong body of
analysis, we have engaged on some 40 country situations, which included support to the design and
implementation of programmatic interventions that mitigate the social and economic impacts of forced
displacement. We have pioneered new and innovative approaches to analysis and operations and provided




                                                       1
technical advice and support to WBG country teams. We have, wherever possible, seized the power of
partnership at global, national and local level to take the action needed to transform the lives of the displaced
and bring prosperity to their host and return communities.

I am encouraged by the high level of political commitment the forced displacement agenda has recently
received, illustrated by the ground breaking joint visits of the UN Secretary General and WBG President to the
Sahel, Great Lakes and Horn regions of Africa; the excellent collaboration between the WBG and UNHCR, as
well as with our bilateral, multi-lateral and civil society partners. For example, the WBG President and UN High
Commissioner for Refugees have agreed to a more systematic strategic collaboration moving forward.
Recently, the G7 highlighted the importance of addressing the impact of forced displacement in the 2015
communiqué.1 I like to think that these developments are in some small way an outcome of the commitment
and drive of GPFD over the years.

We are making progress, as illustrated in this report. But challenges remain and addressing them is a shared
responsibility. In this crucial year for international development, with the expected agreement of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) and new approaches to financing, and the forthcoming World Humanitarian
Summit (WHS), we have an opportunity to recast how development and humanitarian agencies work on forced
displacement. We must work to strengthen the Solutions Alliance to facilitate the global, regional and national
responses. Collective advocacy and action by us all on this important development challenge is key to meeting
the SDGs. Over the next year, we plan to bring together the analytical and operational evidence and
experience to date in a major flagship report on forced displacement and development. In addition, we must
continue to mobilize significant additional financial resources to address the development challenges of forced
displacement and ensure it is included in WBG supported national development programs. The time is ripe for
further steps to complete a paradigm shift from considering forced displacement only as a humanitarian issue,
towards a more holistic approach that considers the development, security and political aspects as well.

Based on the achievements to date, and the increased international attention to the issue, I am confident that
GPFD is well positioned moving forward to ensure an enhanced development response to forced displacement.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This annual progress report provides an overview of the work of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Global Program on
Forced Displacement (GPFD) over the period 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2015. Conflict induced forced displacement
has emerged as one of the most critical development challenges of the 21st century. At the start of 2015 the total
number of displaced people as refugees, IDPs or asylum seekers had reached 59.5 million, the highest on record.
Many of these live in situations of protracted displacement, and the average period of displacement is now 17 years.
Forced displacement can, if not addressed, have negative impacts on poverty reduction, economic growth, peace and
stability. The ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa, and the growing Mediterranean migration crisis, illustrate the
magnitude of the challenge. Governments facing increasing refugee and IDP numbers are looking to the international
community and the WBG to find more effective ways of addressing the development needs of the displaced and their
host and return communities.

For the past six years GPFD has worked to: (i) increase WBG awareness of the development impact of forced
displacement, and (ii) improve the WBG contribution to an enhanced development response that supports economically
and socially sustainable solutions. GPFD is the WBG’s main source of analysis, technical knowledge, staff capacity and
operational advice for WBG regional and country teams working on forced displacement. In collaboration with other
multilateral, bilateral and non-governmental partners GPFD also supports the development of national and international
policies and programs to address the economic and social impacts of forced displacement.

Soon after the publication of the last progress report, a Mid-Term Review (MTR) of GPFD was completed. The MTR
highlighted the strategic relevance of GPFD both within and outside the WBG and found it to be on track towards
meeting its objectives. Given the growing international profile of the issue of conflict induced forced displacement, the
MTR recommended a significant scale-up of the program.

During the reporting period, the WBG underwent a number of important organizational changes with the aim of aligning
human and financial resources towards to the achievement of the Twin Goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and
promoting shared prosperity for the 40% of the population in developing countries. To strengthen knowledge and client
responsiveness, 14 Global Practices (GPs) and 5 Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs) were established by the
WBG. As part of the restructuring, the MTR recommended that GPFD be located in the new CCSA on Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence (FCV), and it moved from the Social Development Department (SDV) to the FCV CCSA on 1
July, 2015.

The past 18 months have been the most successful time so far for GPFD. Attention to the issue of forced
displacement and development is on the rise in the WBG. The recent joint visits of the UN Secretary General and the
WBG President to the Sahel, Great Lakes and Horn regions of Africa underscored the importance of addressing forced
displacement across the political, security, development, and humanitarian spectrum. The announcement of two, large-
scale WBG operations focusing on displacement in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa demonstrates the progress that
has been made. Forced displacement is a central theme of the new WBG MENA strategy and work program. Given the
growth in displacement numbers, clients are requesting WBG technical and financial support to develop targeted
programs to assist the displaced and their hosting and return communities. This demand for GPFD operational,
analytical, partnership and knowledge services has grown over the reporting period and as a result, forced
displacement is considered a key priority for WBG senior management, the work of the FCV CCSA and for teams in
affected countries.

 OPERATIONAL SUPPORT: Since its inception, GPFD has worked closely with regional and country teams to
support the development of programs during the three phases of displacement: in crises, in periods of protracted
displacement and when solutions have been found in displacement or return situations.

During the past 18 months, the GPFD has worked with the WBG’s Africa (AFR) Region on regional initiatives in the
Great Lakes, the Sahel, and Horn of Africa. A fourth regional initiative, centered on the Lake Chad Basin (LCB), is under
preparation. The initiatives, launched following the joint visits of the WBG President and UN Secretary General to the
regions, aim to promote peace and security and increase resilience and economic opportunity for the most vulnerable
including displaced populations. GPFD supported the operationalization of these initiatives. Through joint analytical
work with UNHCR the initiatives have been able to identify the extent, causes and character of displacement and
appropriate development responses. Pilot programs are now being developed to improve livelihoods and economic
opportunities, improve access to services and facilitate better integration of displaced and host communities. GPFD has
played a key role in the design of these projects and programs and during consultations with development partners,
regional institutions and country governments.

In the MENA region, the Syria crisis is the largest source of refugees and IDPs. While the challenges posed by large
scale displacement flows have traditionally been regarded as humanitarian in nature, the duration and scale of the
population movements in the MENA region have revealed the long term development impacts that these crises have on
the displaced and hosts alike. GPFD has contributed to the development and implementation of a number of key
operations in response to the Syrian refugee outflows in Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. The design and implementation of
these operations build in part on the experience of pilot State and Peace building Fund (SPF) grants managed by
GPFD and have leveraged $50 million of grant financing in Jordan and $75 million in Lebanon. There has been less
support to IDP populations in some parts of MENA largely due to access issues. Some national programs, for example
Iraq, have been adjusted to address the vulnerability of IDPs. As part of the WBG’s response to the Syria crisis, GPFD
is supporting the MENA region’s remote pilot damage assessment for the Dar’a Governorate to explore the potential of
using satellite imagery to compile damage data to facilitate future development planning.

GPFD has also continued to provide country-specific support in the ECA, SAR and LAC regions. In Ukraine, where
there are now more than 2.3 million people affected by displacement (of which 1.4 million are IDPs), GPFD has worked
with the Country Management Unit (CMU) to develop a new operation to address internal displacement. GPFD also
contributed to the WBG-led Inter-agency Recovery and Peace-building Assessment (IRPA) by providing demographic
profiles and information on the conditions of displacement. Working with country teams GPFD has also undertaken a
number of operationally focused analytical reports, for example on the Central African Republic (CAR), which will inform
the upcoming WBG regional initiative on LCB. To ensure that a displacement lens is incorporated within the new WBG
Country Engagement Model (CEM) GPFD has contributed to the development of the Systematic Country Diagnostics
(SCD) and Country Partnership Frameworks (CPF) in affected countries, for example: Chad, Jordan, Lebanon, and
Mali; the lessons of which are being fed into WBG strategies and programs.

ANALYTICAL WORK: Over the reporting period, GPFD has worked to further strengthen the evidence base for
development work on forced displacement to inform WBG strategic and operational decision making. The program of
analytical work has been developed in close collaboration with WBG teams, bilateral and multilateral partners, NGOs,
and research institutions. Three comprehensive and influential studies on forced displacement and development have
been completed on the Sahel, Great Lakes and the Horn of Africa. These were co-developed and co-funded by GPFD
and UNHCR and contributed significantly to the design of the WBG’s regional initiatives. Over the past 18 months, the
WBG has expanded its efforts to quantify the impacts of forced displacement on host countries and to estimate the
welfare impacts for host communities and displaced populations through Economic and Social Impact Assessments
(ESIAs). GPFD is currently compiling a comprehensive overview of all WBG ESIAs on forced displacement, as well as




                                                           6
major studies that have components that measure the social and/or economic impact of forced displacement in its
various forms. GPFD has provided technical inputs to a number of analyses, for example in Lebanon, Northern Mali
and Somalia, and is providing inputs and support to ongoing work in the Africa, MENA and ECA regions.

GPFD has also worked to develop and complete analytical work on a number of key themes that will inform global
policy and operational development. This includes work on: forced displacement and the WBG's Twin Goals,
sustainable refugee return, urban displacement, land, livelihoods, and gender and displacement in the Great Lakes
Region.

PARTNERSHIPS: Partnership is a key element of the work of GPFD and is essential for the achievement of the WBG
objectives. Following the MTR GPFD has focused significant attention on further strengthening internal and external
partnerships on the development response and solutions. Over the last year and a half, GPFD has established a strong
platform for an exchange of views and experiences and to foster co-operation with bilateral, multilateral and other
partners at global, regional and country level on the development challenges of conflict induced forced displacement.

GPFD has maintained strong and productive working partnerships with bilateral agencies. Financial support to GPFD
provided by its key partners, including Switzerland, Denmark and Norway, has been essential in enabling GPFD to
focus on the objectives of the program and push the boundaries of forced displacement work within and outside the
WBG. GPFD’s bilateral partnerships include: Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, the
US State Department, USAID, BMZ, Turkey and DFID. The power and value of these partnerships is evidenced in the
strategic consultations GPFD has conducted with these partners during the reporting period. Examples of this
engagement includes: (i) dialogue on forced displacement policy with DFID, the Netherlands and Switzerland; (ii)
discussions on joint research and implementation of a new forced displacement policy in Germany; (iii) implementation
of the JESSRP project in Jordan with Canada, and (iv) the design of the Solutions Alliance and strengthened
collaboration on AFR and MENA with Denmark and Norway. Finally, with Turkey, GPFD has established a new
working partnership with the Government, building on its role as a new member of the Solutions Alliance and host of the
WHS.

Many of GPFD’s bilateral partners were actively involved in the establishment of the Solutions Alliance in Copenhagen
in April 2014. This coalition of humanitarian actors, development organizations, affected states, donor nations,
academic and research institutions, the private sector and civil society is working to promote and enable a transition for
displaced persons from dependency towards increased resilience, self-reliance and development.

GPFD continues to work with affected Governments. For example, GPFD invited the Ugandan Refugee Commissioner
to speak at the 2015 FCV Forum as part of a session on UNHCR’s Alternatives to Camps policy. In Jordan, GPFD
works closely with the authorities in response to the refugee crisis, and a Government representative participated at the
latest GPFD annual meeting in Copenhagen. GPFD has continued to gather lessons from around the world to inform
WBG project and country teams, as well as external partners on the development of operations and policies.

GPFD has intensified collaboration with UNHCR through a program of joint analytical work in the Great Lakes, Sahel,
Horn of Africa, Syria, and more recently, the Lake Chad Basin (LCB). The partnership with UNHCR is reinforced by the
recent agreement of the WBG President and UN High Commissioner to hold regular strategic consultations on the
development dimensions of forced displacement. GPFD has continued to work closely with UNDP and OCHA, both at
HQ level in Geneva and New York, as well as in the field.

GPFD has also expanded its partnership with NGOs such as Save the Children, the International Rescue Committee
(IRC), and Search for Common Ground, to benefit from their presence on the ground, their respective thematic
expertise, and to ensure knowledge sharing. GPFD was closely involved with the establishment of the Solutions




                                                            7
Alliance in 2014 and has since contributed to its data sharing working group and Somalia chapter. Recently, GPFD
participated in discussions with UN partners to include the issue of forced displacement in the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), the WHS, and other major post-2015 conferences. Finally, GPFD has maintained strong partnerships
with research institutions, for example through its participation in the workshop organized by RefugePoint on solutions
to forced displacement, held in Boston in 2015.

 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT: A key recommendation of the MTR was to improve knowledge management and
communications for GPFD. The program has therefore worked to improve the quality and quantity of its knowledge
management activities so as to better share information with partners on globally relevant analytical work and
operational experience and outcomes. The team has developed a proactive knowledge management plan, which
emphasizes effective, regular dissemination of achievements.

During the past 18 months, GPFD has organized several high profile events. This includes the “Alternatives to Camps”
discussion during the WBG FCV Forum; an event with the Brookings Institution on the Great Lakes displacement
report; and a WBG “Solutions Café” in the margins of the WBG 2015 Spring Meetings, where key figures from senior
management discussed the importance of forced displacement for the development agenda. More recently, GPFD
organized an event on forced displacement during the retreat of the WBG’s GSURR department.

Responding to a call from partners at the last annual meeting of the program, GPFD has launched a new website,
www.worldbank.org/forceddisplacement, which makes it easy to retrieve analytical work and events related to the
program. In order to build a cadre of task team leaders and managers across the WBG with knowledge of the
development challenges of forced displacement, GPFD has developed a training module for the FCV Core Course and
successfully rolled out its first course on forced displacement for WBG staff for in the summer of 2015.

MOVING FORWARD: In its six years of existence, GPFD has established a robust body of analytical, technical and
operational expertise and is now seen as the custodian of global knowledge, experience and lessons learned on forced
displacement and development in the WBG. There is growing recognition of the immense global development
challenges and opportunities associated with conflict induced forced displacement, and the issue is receiving
prominence on the international agenda. However, unless it is addressed, forced displacement will pose a real threat to
the achievement of the new SDGs and the WBG’s Twin Goals. GPFD is well positioned to play a catalytic and
transformative role in enhancing the development response to forced displacement challenges at the policy and
operational level.

There is strong commitment from the WBG to this agenda. GPFD will continue to build on its, analytical, technical, and
operational strengths and work closely with WBG teams and affected governments to address the development needs
of IDPs, refugees, returnees, and host communities alongside other development, humanitarian, political and security
actors. Building on the momentum over the past 18 months, GPFD plans to significantly scale up and expand its
activities, both within and outside the WBG, in order to meet the increased demands for its services.

Following demand from the AFR and MENA regions, GPFD will lead a major WBG flagship report on the economic,
social and fiscal impacts of forced displacement and operational experiences to date. This will help to guide the WBG’s,
Governments’ and partners’ development work on forced displacement moving forward and will feed into the

1. INTRODUCTION
Forced displacement is one of the most critical challenges of the 21st century. The UN Refugee Agency
(UNHCR) estimates that by the end of 2014, 59.5 million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide as a
result of persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations. This represents the highest level
of global displacement since World War II. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC),
by the end of 2014, 38 million people were forcibly displaced within their own countries as IDPs, amounting to a
15% increase compared to 2013, and the highest figures ever recorded by the organization.2 In 2014, an
average of 42,500 people became
                                              Figure 1: IDPs and refugees from 1989-2014.
refugees, asylum seekers, or IDPs
every day, and one in every 122
humans is now either a refugee,
IDP, or seeking asylum. Almost
nine out of ten refugees (86 per
cent) are in regions and countries
considered     economically  less
developed, and over half the
displaced are women and girls.

Most displaced live in a form of
“second exile”, caught between the
inability to return to their homes
and the lack of durable solutions
for integration. The average length
of displacement is now 17 years,
with only 126,800 refugees able to
return to their home countries in                                                                           Source: IDMC (2015)

2014 being the lowest number in
31 years. The Syrian crisis has underlined the magnitude of the issue of protracted displacement, with
ramifications across the Mediterranean. Emerging and ongoing crises in Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan,
CAR, Ukraine, and more recently in Yemen, continue to pose significant challenges for the humanitarian,
development, political and security communities. Conflicts around the world represent a growing economic
strain, as the costs of supporting IDPs and refugees continue to rise.3

GPFD was established in 2009 with the objectives to increase WBG awareness of the development impact of
conflict induced forced displacement and improve the WBG’s contribution to an enhanced development
response that supports economically and socially sustainable solutions. GPFD works on three categories of
displacement: emerging crises, protracted displacement, and situations where solutions have been found for
the displaced and their host and return communities.

In these contexts, the program provides analysis, technical expertise and operational advice to WBG regional
and country teams on the issue of forced displacement and works with its external partners to improve the
quality of the WBG response and share lessons learned. The purpose of this progress report is to inform
internal and external partners of the work and results of GPFD and to serve as a tool to engage development
practitioners on the issue of forced displacement.

Forced displacement can have negative development impacts, affecting human and social capital, economic
growth, poverty reduction, the Millennium Development Goals and SDGs, and environmental sustainability. At
the same time, displacement can have some positive effects if the displaced are allowed and able to develop
skills and coping mechanisms in situ and contribute to economic growth. Both in protracted displacement and
when solutions emerge, developmental responses become critical to addressing the needs of the displaced
and their host or return communities. These needs include: (i) access to land, property and housing; (ii)
livelihoods; (iii) services delivery; and (iv) accountable and responsive governance (see figure 3).

To deliver the program’s overarching objectives, GPFD pursues four core lines of activity:



                    Operational support to WBG and external partners to strengthen
              1     their responsiveness to forced displacement;

                    Analytical work on countries, regions, or themes related to forced
              2     displacement and development;

                    Partnerships with governments, multilateral organizations, donors,
              3     academic institutions and NGOs;

                    Knowledge dissemination to share operational approaches and
              4     lessons learned.



This report is structured around these four lines of activity.

In the past 18 months, the WBG has seen a dramatic increase in client demand for development work on
forced displacement, particularly in the AFR and MENA regions. To meet this demand, GPFD is scaling up its
analytical, operational and partnership support to country and regional teams. Senior management across the
WBG is giving the issue greater priority as illustrated by the recent joint visits of the WBG President and the UN
Secretary General to the Sahel, Great Lakes, and the Horn, with announcements of operational funds directed
to forced displacement. The WBG is increasingly considered an important actor in global policy discussions on
forced displacement and in efforts to find lasting solutions.

With its new location in the CCSA on FCV, GPFD is centrally located as the custodian of global knowledge and
lessons learned on forced displacement and development in the WBG. The following sections provide an
overview of GPFD’s key achievements and activities for the reporting period 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2015.

2. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
This section presents highlights of the planned, ongoing and completed operations that address the
development challenges of forced displacement in the WBG. The sub-sections are organized alphabetically
according to WBG regions, namely: Sub-Saharan Africa (AFR), East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Europe and
Central Asia (ECA), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), South Asia (SAR), and Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC). The AFR section will focus first on the regional initiatives in the Sahel, Great Lakes, Horn and
Lake Chad, as these have been priorities for GPFD in the past 18 months. Country descriptions are included in
each section where relevant. These operational highlights represent a sample of the work the WBG is
undertaking to address forced displacement from a development perspective. The text focuses on GPFD’s role
where it has been active, and the work of other WBG task teams and departments.



AFR: Sub-Saharan Africa
Regional Initiatives in Africa
During the past 18 months, AFR has launched regional initiatives in the Great Lakes, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa.
A fourth, centered on the LCB, is under preparation. The initiatives are all premised on the assumption that greater
regional cooperation and integration, and enhanced development, will support efforts to promote peace and security in
regions affected by conflict. All of the initiatives seek to increase resilience and economic opportunity, including for the

most vulnerable. They provide regional investments in energy, connectivity, trade, agriculture and rural livelihoods to
boost economic prosperity. They address issues such as health, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV), women’s
empowerment, and social cohesion to improve access to basic services and help communities rebuild following conflict.
The initiatives focus on particularly disadvantaged groups, including displaced populations and border communities.
Activities under each regional initiative are clustered into two main interrelated pillars: (i) vulnerability and resilience, and
(ii) economic cooperation and regional integration. They all have a specific focus on forced displacement, which is seen
as a priority area for attention. In addition to programmatic investments, the initiatives include substantial analytical
components, focused on identifying the drivers of conflict, facilitating conflict-sensitive program design, and determining
the extent, causes, and character of forced displacement in each of the regions.



      QUOTE: COLIN BRUCE | DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION

      “”In Africa, we cannot achieve the Twin Goals of the WBG - eliminating absolute poverty
      and boosting shared prosperity - unless we address forced displacement. Displaced
      populations are among the poorest and most disadvantaged on the continent, and they
      demand our attention as a development institution”.



The rationale for focusing on displacement is clear. Africa hosts more than a third of the world’s displaced
population, accounting for more than a quarter of the global total of refugees and the largest number of IDPs.
Five countries - DRC, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia and CAR - have generated more than 80 percent of those
displaced, while sixty percent of refugees in the region are hosted by just five countries: Kenya, Chad, Ethiopia,
South Sudan and Uganda. Most of the countries generating and hosting displaced persons are International
Development Association (IDA)-countries. Given the protracted nature of most displacement in the countries
covered by the regional initiatives, a purely humanitarian response is no longer sustainable. The initiatives have
therefore adopted a longer-term development perspective and are piloting programs focused on improving
livelihoods and economic opportunity, increasing access to services, and facilitating better integration of
displaced and host-communities.

The fact that the regional initiatives have a specific focus on forced displacement can be credited to the work of
GPFD. As the custodian of WBG expertise and knowledge on forced displacement, GPFD was called upon to
provide displacement input to the design of the initiatives. During the process of design, extensive consultations
were conducted with development partners, regional institutions, and the countries themselves. There was
unanimous agreement on the importance of addressing forced displacement, largely due to the involvement of
GFPD in the consultations, and the hands-on expertise it brought to the discussions. The program also
managed early assessments of displacement and development in close collaboration with UNHCR, which led
to the leveraging of some $250 million in operations to address displacement needs. Details of each of the
displacement programs in each of the regional initiatives are presented below.

Sahel Region
The five core countries of the Sahel – Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger – face displacement issues, driven
by conflict in Mali and neighboring countries, particularly CAR, Nigeria, and Sudan. While the conflict in Northern Mali
has eased somewhat over the last year, Boko Haram activities in Northern Nigeria have emerged as a major driver of
forced displacement for Niger and Chad. Among the Sahel countries, Chad is the most seriously affected by forced

displacement in neighboring countries, hosting around 453,000 refugees at the end of 2014, equivalent to 34 refugees
per 100 inhabitants, the fourth highest level in the world. At the end of June 2015, there were around 137,000 Malian
refugees, mostly in Mauritania and Niger, and around 90,000 IDPs within Mali.

The WBG Africa region included forced displacement as one of the main challenges to be addressed in the regional
Sahel Initiative document. GPFD was requested to provide strategic and technical input to the formulation of the
displacement aspects of the initiative. A scoping study on ‘Forced Displacement of and Potential Solutions for IDPs and
refugees in the Sahel’ was undertaken jointly by GPFD and UNHCR in 2013, and contributed to the formulation of a
regional policy framework for sustainable solutions to displacement and towards the operationalization of a
development response. Following discussions with ECOWAS and the WBG on security and development in October of
2013, the WBG was requested to provide language on displacement in the ECOWAS regional strategy for security and
development in the Sahel. Building on this work, more recent activities have included a face-to-face baseline survey
with displaced Malians as well as monthly follow-up interviews with baseline respondents using mobile phones. This
work has been led by the WBG Macro-Fiscal Global Practice, with technical advice and co-funding from GPFD.

In terms of strategic and operational involvement, GPFD has provided input into the Chad and Mali Systematic Country
Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) exercises to ensure appropriate WBG inclusion of
displacement issues into these documents. GPFD has also provided review comments and otherwise engaged with the
Task Team Leaders (TTLs) of relevant projects to promote the integration of displacement considerations into projects

in the region, particularly in the targeting of development support. This has included the “Mali Reconstruction and
Economic Recovery Project” and the regional pastoralist project.

Going forward, two of the core Sahel countries, Chad and Niger, will be included in a sub-regional assessment of the
social and economic impacts of forced displacement in the LCB, building on initial scoping work supported by GPFD in
FY15 (see Lake Chad section below). The work will be undertaken jointly with UNHCR and will have a particular focus
on Boko Haram. Country studies are planned for both countries, as well as for Nigeria and Cameroon.

Mauritania
GPFD has been collaborating with the WBG’s Global Practice on Social, Urban, Rural & Resilience (GSURR)
over the last few years to prepare the "Islamic Republic of Mauritania: Sustainable Livelihoods for Returnees
and Host Communities in the River Valley Project”. This project was approved in February 2014 and is financed
by a Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) of $2.85 million.

The development objective of this project is to improve access to livelihood support for returnees and
host communities and to enhance conflict prevention and risk management mechanisms in Brakna and
Trarza in the Senegal River Valley area. The specific objectives are to: (i) contribute to reducing food
insecurity through support in the provision of production inputs for 3,830 households, with emphasis on
women and youth, (ii) enhance capacity for women and youth for 1,500 households, (iii) establish and
strengthen community-based organizations to work with communities to identify, develop, implement
and evaluate their own community development plans; and (iv) promote social cohesion efforts by
strengthening 22 community structures on issues as local conflict prevention, risk management and
participatory monitoring and evaluation.

Great Lakes Region
In 2013, the WBG launched the Great Lakes Regional Initiative (GLRI) “Reviving the Great Lakes”,4 designed to work in
support of achievement of the Peace Security and Cooperation Framework (PSCF) for the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) and the region. GPFD undertook early and upfront engagement with the GLRI, to ensure that it gave
particular consideration of the regional implications and poverty impacts of the 3.3 million people who remained forcibly
displaced within the Great Lakes region (GLR). $100 million was allocated under the GLRI for a project to address the
vulnerabilities of the displaced and their host communities. This “Great Lakes Region Displaced People and Border
Communities Project” intends to improve the integration and socio-economic development prospects of those affected
by forced displacement, including the local communities which host the displaced.

As a first step in defining a response to forced displacement under the GLRI, GPFD funded a joint UNHCR-WBG study,
highlighting the development dimensions of forced displacement in the region. GPFD’s support went to hiring a team of
consultants who completed field work for the study under the oversight of WBG staff. The report, titled “Forced
Displacement in the Great Lakes Region: A Development Approach”,5 analyses the extent, causes, and character of
forced displacement in the GLR, and also presents opportunities to foster and utilize refugees’ economic potential. The

actors alongside humanitarian actors to tackle development challenges such as: access to land, inclusion of the
displaced in mainstream service delivery and in wider development strategies, building on the economic contribution of
the displaced and addressing their unique vulnerabilities.

The report was disseminated at three events, all funded by GPFD – one joint panel at The Brookings Institution in
Washington, DC, and two others in Kinshasa and Goma, DRC. The project team for the “Great Lakes Region
Displaced People and Border Communities Project” have used the process of undertaking the report and
disseminating the findings to engage a wider set of development actors and donors to define responses to forced
displacement in the region. The partnership between UNHCR and the WBG in undertaking the report has been
particularly instrumental in securing greater in-country communication between the two actors, with stronger definition of
comparative roles, complementarities and unique organizational strength to address forced displacement.

The task team for the project has also directly acted on the recommendations of the report in the initial design phases of
the $100 million “Great Lakes Region Displaced People and Border Communities Project”. Four distinct, but closely
linked, pieces of work are now underway to implement this project in DRC, Zambia and Tanzania and at a regional
level. These openings for implementation of the project have been created through a number of actions including:
raising awareness with client governments of the WBG’s willingness to finance and define development responses to
forced displacement, particularly protracted displacement, with particular emphasis on the potential economic and social
benefits for hosting regions and nations; raising awareness with WBG country management of the commitment and
technical capacity within the WBG to respond to forced displacement; and working with UNHCR to identify areas of
complementarity in bringing solutions to protracted displacement.

Based on confirmed Government demand, the “Great Lakes Region Displaced People and Border Communities
Project” is now moving ahead in DRC, Zambia and Tanzania. The project will focus on: (i) livelihoods and sustainable
access to socio-economic services for IDPs, returnees and refugees in the DRC; and (ii) achieving the local integration
of the former Burundian refugees in Tanzania and former Angolan refugees in Zambia and improving the development
prospects in the settlements where they have continued to live for more than forty years. In addition, the project will
support a regional process for reaching solutions on forced displacement, being initiated and led by the Office of the
Special Representative of the Great Lakes.

targeted provinces. The proposed additional financing will: (i) assist displaced and host communities to rebuild
socio-economic infrastructure destroyed by conflict; (ii) support communities of IDPs who decide to remain in
their area of displacement and their hosts by expanding socio-economic infrastructure that has become
overburdened; (iii) strengthen the community level conflict prevention and management training to improve the
likelihood of peaceful reintegration of returning community members and minimize tensions between the
displaced and their host communities; and (iv) provide short-term and longer-term livelihoods opportunities to
returnees, to those wishing to settle in their areas of displacement, and to those who have hosted them.

Both local authorities and development partners have been unanimous in indicating accessibility as a crucial
and urgent ingredient for both stabilization and development. Therefore, road rehabilitation will be a main
activity intended to create short-term employment opportunities. The project has selected strategic corridors
where road rehabilitation will serve to improve rural households’ access to social services and markets. The
selected corridors coincide with the areas in the East with the heaviest concentration of displaced people, most
of whom have settled only 15 – 20 km from their village of origin, often along a main road, where they feel more

secure. Road rehabilitation will be carried out along with investments to strengthen agricultural value chains in
strategic corridors combining a high density of population at risk and a high agricultural potential.

Tanzania
In Tanzania, the Government has requested participation in the regional project in order to fund the sustainable
integration of 200,000 long-term refugees from Burundi, who have recently been awarded Tanzanian citizenship. The
former refugees or New Tanzanians (NT) have mostly been living in three settlements in the western regions of
Tanzania, where they have remained for forty years. Together with the Ministry of Home Affairs and UNHCR, the WBG
task team is contributing to the development of a government-led ‘Strategic Plan for Local Integration’ (SPLI), which will
outline all the activities to be undertaken in support of the NT settlements and their wider hosting districts. Using funds
from GPFD and UNHCR, the task team is currently supervising three pieces of analytic work in support of the
finalization of the SPLI. These are: (i) an assessment of the possibility to increase secure access to land for NT, (ii) a
technically and spatially sound plan of socio-economic needs in the settlements and surrounding districts, (iii) an
assessment of improving livelihood status in the new settlements.

Although still in the early stages of project design, it is envisaged that in Tanzania, the “Great Lakes Region,
Displaced People and Border Communities Project” will work in support of the SPLI. In particular, the project
will direct funds to local government authorities to undertake investments, which will support integration and
extend local government administration to the settlements. The settlements have been largely administered
through a humanitarian approach with parallel UN funding, and the project will underpin a transition to inclusion
in more mainstream government-led development processes. At the central level, the project will support a
transition of authority of the settlements from the Ministry of Home Affairs to other responsible line Ministries.

Zambia
In Zambia, the Government has requested participation in the regional project in order to continue to support
the continued local integration of those refugees from Angola, who have been given residency rights in Zambia
after a protracted displacement of more than forty years. These former refugees are in the process of relocating
from the settlements, where they have lived for four decades, to two newly designated “Resettlement Areas”
where they will receive full land rights. A “Strategic Framework for Local Integration (SFLI)” was designed to
support this resettlement process but has suffered from some weaknesses, including the use of a short term
humanitarian approach to design and fulfill the socio-economic needs in the resettlement areas. A recent
spatial and technical planning consultancy, funded by GPFD, has identified a number of planning flaws in the
current design of the resettlement areas, which is undermining the relocation process. In addition, this
consultancy suggests how to situate the socio-economic needs of the resettlement areas more strongly within
development planning processes for the wider districts and regions, a perspective which was lacking in the
SFLI. This analysis will lay the ground work for the project to identify development investments that extend
benefits to the wider districts and provinces, which has been explicitly requested by the Government in Zambia.

Regional Engagement
Lastly, to help ensure collaborative regional engagement, the project task team is working with The Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General to the Great Lakes Region on regional responses for durable solutions. In this process, the
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to the Great Lakes Region seeks to work with political, humanitarian and
development partners (AU, International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), IOM, OCHA, UNHCR and
the WBG) to help Governments in the region develop a shared vision and common actions to better address forced
displacement. In order to achieve this objective, a joint action plan will be developed along three lines: (i) awareness
raising and sensitization on the reality of displacement in the GLR; the impact on security; development for displaced

populations; and host communities and host countries; (ii) a policy formulation plan, based on a technical expert group,
leading up to a high-level meeting, and (iii) a research program to further develop evidence supporting the development
of a long-term policy response to displacement. This is intended to lay the ground for a major donor conference for
durable solutions in the region. In support of this process, GPFD is funding a consultant based in Nairobi to coordinate
key agencies. The consultant is collaborating directly with the Special Envoy to give practical support to this new
initiative and to link it with the work of the project task team.

Horn of Africa Region
The Horn of Africa (HOA) covers Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and
Uganda. Despite its rich endowment in human, social, and natural capital, the region is plagued by a complex
history of insecurity, weak governance, increasing environmental degradation, entrenched poverty, and a range
of persistent development challenges including conflict induced forced displacement. With technical and
advisory support from GPFD, the WBG launched the “Regional Initiative in Support of the Horn of Africa in
October 2014”. The initiative highlighted protracted forced displacement as one of the most complex and
pressing regional development challenges and identified the need to “address the economic and social impact
of protracted displacement on affected host populations, and enhance the productive capacities and coping
mechanisms of displaced populations to allow them to contribute to the local economy in their areas of
displacement, and promote durable social and economic reintegration for voluntary returnees”.

The initiative brought together WBG and UNHCR country teams, respective government counterparts, and
other multilateral and bilateral partners to identify the most appropriate policy and development interventions to
address forced displacement, mitigate the impact on refugee hosting communities, promote peace and
security, reduce poverty for both refugees and hosts, and achieve sustainable development in the Horn. The
approach adopted by the WBG/GPFD in the Horn of Africa represents a new more collaborative way of working
on forced displacement and has established the foundations for a mechanism for regional and national policy
and operational dialogue. Dialogue has been initiated with the Horn country governments on the importance of
both a country level and a regional response, with the latter facilitated through the regional institutions such as
EAC and/or IGAD to address displacement as a development issue. The ongoing analytical and program
development work supported by GPFD, GSURR and country offices to understand the dynamics of
displacement and explore possible solutions across the region, will yield important lessons for the region but
also for addressing other crises or protracted displacement situations.

Forced Displacement and Mixed Migration in the Horn of Africa Study
As a central part of the Horn Regional Initiative, GPFD, in collaboration with UNHCR, co-funded a joint
WBG-UNHCR study on “Forced Displacement and Mixed Migration in the Horn of Africa” 6 which aimed
to: (i) analyze the forced displacement and development nexus, (ii) explore the mixed migration
phenomenon, (iii) assess the impacts of refugees and migrants on hosting areas and communities, (iv)
identify ongoing innovative interventions, and (v) propose entry points and practical steps to address
the development dimensions of forced displacement and mixed migration in the HOA. The study, which
was initially designed, led and managed by GPFD, drew from a rich body of literature, in-depth
interviews, and focal group meetings with displaced persons (refugees, returnees, IDPs), host
communities, government agencies, UN and bilateral partners, and NGOs. Gradually management has
been transferred to GSURR and country offices in an effort to mainstream the displacement work into

the WBG’s operations. This is the first time that the development and strategic implications of
displacement and a coordinated response in the HOA has been discussed with governments and other
multilateral and bilateral partners. The findings of the study and the HOA Initiative has facilitated a
comprehensive dialogue on the development of solutions that will address the humanitarian and
development needs of the displaced, migrants and the hosting communities.

The study illustrates how every country in the HOA has, in some way been affected by forced displacement
and mixed migration and that most of the displacement situations have lasted for more than 20 years. While
endemic armed conflict remains a major cause of displacement, it is rarely an isolated cause of displacement.
In most cases, a complex set of circumstances drives displacement, including poor governance, environmental
degradation and food insecurity, and lack of economic opportunities. The protracted nature of forced
displacement in the HOA has had both negative and positive effects on refugee and hosting communities alike.
Major refugee camps are in relatively poor, underdeveloped, and economically marginalized borderlands and in
relatively remote areas in host countries. Displaced and migrant populations in general, but women in
particular, confront a range of severe protection challenges emerging from a constellation of poverty,
uncertainty, insecurity, conflict, sexual and gender based violence and flight.

The study identified a number of recommendations for further policy and operational dialogue across
the region. This included: (i) enhancing social cohesion between displaced and host communities and

increasing their self-reliance by building on their human, social, and financial skills and capital; (ii) improving the quality
of social and economic ties between displaced and host communities; (iii) strengthening the resilience of host
communities, while preparing the displaced for durable solutions; and (iv) equipping refugees to secure livelihoods,
resources, and assets so as to have a better chance of returning and also contributing to host economies. Countries in
the region have certain displacement-specific laws and human rights instruments at the disposal, and it was therefore
recommended that development solutions be tailored with these in mind.

Regional Operation on the Development Response to Displacement in the Horn of Africa
GPFD is currently working closely with the AFR and GSURR to design a regional operation to support Djibouti, Ethiopia
and Uganda to address the impacts of refugee presence on the host communities. The project aims to improve access
to social services, expand economic opportunities and enhance environmental management for host and forcibly
displaced households in the targeted areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia and Uganda. The operational approach will be
Community Driven Development (CDD) oriented and will involve: (i) building grassroots institutions, (ii) ensuring voice of
all communities including refugees in decision making, (iii) strengthening decentralized government administrative
functions, as well as (iv) investing in public service delivery and social mobilization to enhance the social cohesion
among the beneficiary communities.

Regional HOA Operation: Djibouti
Djibouti hosts over 20,000 refugees, mainly Somalis, in the Ali Addeh and Hol Hol refugee camps. The surrounding
host population faces greater food insecurity and has limited access to basic social services and livelihood
opportunities. In addition, Djibouti has been the main transit route for migrants from HOA countries traveling to the
Middle East and Europe seeking better economic opportunities, with departure points around the Obock town in
Djibouti. The recent crisis in Yemen between Houthis and the Yemeni Government, has caused the influx of Djiboutian
and foreign nationals into Obock town, increasing pressure on local services and consequently on residents. The
proposed project would directly contribute to addressing the impacts of refugees on host areas around the refugee
camps of Ali Addeh and Hol Hol; in the city of Obock, and potentially Balballa area around Djibouti Ville. The project
would address vulnerabilities such as poverty and unemployment, deficits in human development and social service
delivery, environmental degradation, and limited access to basic infrastructure.

Regional HOA Operation: Ethiopia
Ethiopia is the largest refugee hosting country in Africa. At the end of 2013, there were 433,936 refugees in Ethiopia as
a result of droughts, conflicts, political events and civil wars in neighboring countries, including Somalia, Eritrea, South
Sudan, and Sudan. The majority of refugees in Ethiopia are hosted in the four regions of Ethiopia, which are: (i) the Afar
Regional State; (ii) the Benishangul-Gumuz Regional State; (iii) the Gambela Regional State; and (iv) the Somali
Regional State. These regions are defined by the Government of Ethiopia as “Emerging Regions” and are the least
developed regions in the country, characterized by challenging weather conditions, poor infrastructure, extremely low
capacity, high level of poverty, and very poor development indicators. The proposed regional displacement project will
contribute directly to the Government’s Growth and Transformation Plan II objectives of expanding access to and
ensuring quality of social services, and thereby achieving MDGs in the social sector; support provision of basic social
services; and strengthen the economic opportunities and livelihoods of refugee hosting communities for the
underserved communities in the Emerging Regions (Gambela, Somali and Benishangul-Gumuz).

Regional HOA Operation: Uganda
Uganda is the third largest refugee-hosting country in Africa. As a result of ongoing conflicts and instability in the DRC,
Somalia and South Sudan; Uganda is currently hosting over 433,000 refugees and asylum-seekers. About 190,000 are
Congolese refugees mainly hosted in South-West and Mid-West Uganda, and close to 167,000 are South Sudanese




                                                              22
mainly hosted in Adjumani, Arua and Kiryandongo districts. The proposed regional project will support sustainable
livelihoods, environmental protection, and community infrastructure under the Settlement Transformative Agenda (STA)
refugee-hosting districts in North, Mid-West and South West of Uganda. This will help achieve self-reliance and local
settlement for refugees and to promote social development in the refugee hosting areas.

An Assessment of Uganda’s Approach to Refugees
As part of the regional study described above, GPFD has provided funding to a study assessing Uganda’s
approach to refugees. The Government of Uganda has been taking a number of steps to strengthen the self-
reliance and resilience of refugees and host communities. The draft National Development Plan II (NDP II,
2015/16-2019/20) has refugee-specific strategy known as the Settlement Transformative Agenda (STA), an
initiative led by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) with the aim of achieving self-reliance and local
settlement for refugees, and to promote social development in the refugee hosting areas. The Government of
Uganda (GOU) has requested the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and the WBG to support the
Settlement Transformative Agenda (STA). In response to the Government’s request, the UN and WBG are in
the process of developing the Refugee and Host Population Empowerment (ReHoPE), a self-reliance and
resilience program for refugee and host communities in Uganda. GPFD is providing technical support to the
WBG Uganda country team and GSURR with the development and implementation of ReHoPE. This study will
assess and analyze the evolving refugee policy and practice in Uganda in order to: (i) better understand how
well the policy framework has contributed to the refugee’s well-being and self-reliance; and (ii) identify lessons
from Uganda’s experience.

The Peculiar (?) Dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp
Another study which came about following the regional study on forced displacement and mixed migration in the HOA is
the study on Kakuma Refugee Camp. Kakuma, which is located in the Turkana County (Northwestern Kenya), has




                                                         23
been hosting refugees since 1991. The humanitarian assistance and care and maintenance programs in Kakuma were
devised to address the immediate needs of the refugees. The refugee assistance program, as currently managed, is
not financially sustainable, since it is based on the assumption that refugees would receive full assistance for their basic
needs until such time as they cease to be refugees. In order to transform the refugee program into one that would
address the developmental needs of the refugee and host communities, UNHCR has launched the “Turkana Initiative
on the Integration of the Refugee and Host Community Economies”, in partnership with the County Government and
development partners. The overall objective of this initiative is to re-orient the refugee assistance program to contribute
to: (i) improve the socio-economic conditions of the refugee and the host communities; (ii) better prepare the host
community to take advantage of emerging economic opportunities in upcoming extraction and potential irrigation fed
agriculture; and (iii) reduce over-dependence on humanitarian aid and prepare the refugees for durable solutions.

As part of the Initiative, UNHCR organized the Turkana Roundtable on the Integration of Refugees and Host
Community Economies on 27-28 November 2014 in Lodwar, Turkana County. The Roundtable, which was co-
facilitated by GPFD, was opened by the Governor of Turkana County, H.E. Josphat Nanok and was attended by Hon
Daniel Nanok (Member of Parliament for Turkana West) as well as representatives of the national and county
governments, UN agencies, bilateral aid agencies, civil society, refugees, and host communities. The Roundtable
participants noted that the protracted humanitarian aid delivery model is not suited to the strong socio-economic
interaction between the refugee and host communities. There was a clear consensus on the need for a different
approach to refugee assistance. One of the key action items of the Roundtable is the joint UNHCR-WBG ESIA on “The
Peculiar (?) Dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp: An Economic and Social Impact Analysis”. GPFD, alongside
UNHCR, is providing substantial financial and technical inputs to the study.

The objective of the proposed ESIA is to assess the macro, micro, and social impact of the presence of refugees on the
host communities in the Turkana County in Kenya. While there have been a variety of descriptive studies about the
interactions between refugees, the aid community, and hosts in the vicinity of Kakuma camp, these have not yet been
able to provide estimates of the net benefits to locals of the presence of refugees and aid. When completed, the results
of this work will: (i) inform policy discussions on integrating the refugee and host community economies by clarifying the
concepts and (ii) inform the WBG development response to displacement induced macro-fiscal, environmental and
social impacts through existing or stand-alone operations.

Eastern Sudan
Eastern Sudan has a total population of approximately 4.5 million. The 2006 signing of the Peace Agreement between the
Government of Sudan and the Eastern Sudan Front was a landmark step towards paving a way for economic and social
development in Eastern Sudan. The region remains fragile however, subject to multiple sources of stress. As a “host
community” to refugees and IDPs, most of the population of Eastern Sudan suffers from acute poverty and limited
development prospects, not dissimilar from those experienced by the IDP and refugee population in their midst. Having had
refugees and IDPs in Sudan for many years, forced displacement represents a significant conflict stress factor for the Sudan.

GPFD has been key in designing the WBG’s current development response on displacement issues. GPFD supported
the establishment of the Transitional Solutions Initiative (TSI) for Eastern Sudan, a joint partnership between the UNDP,
UNHCR, and the WBG with the objective of developing a coordinated and comprehensive response to displacement in
the region. TSI has developed two pilot projects to begin addressing the displacement needs in post-conflict Eastern
Sudan. One of them is the UNDP-UNHCR’s “Transitional Solutions Initiative for Refugees and their Host Communities,
Eastern Sudan – Phase 1” and another is the WBG’s “Sustainable Livelihoods for Displaced and Vulnerable
Communities in Eastern Sudan Project” (SLDP). With technical oversight from GPFD, the WBG was able to secure
$3.08 million for the initial phase of SLDP through the SPF.

SLDP targets IDPs and their host communities in Kassala state with the objective of strengthening the capacity of local
stakeholders, including state authorities, displaced persons and vulnerable host communities to plan and deliver
services and develop sustainable livelihoods. The project pilots an approach whereby local community groups plan,
prioritize and decide on local development activities and manage the implementation of projects. Local community
groups select business initiatives and small-scale community works, proposed by community members, to receive
grants, training, and advisory support from the project and key stakeholders. The benefit received from the project is
thereafter trans-passed to other beneficiaries in the community via agreed upon internal systems. The approach is
executed through extensive facilitated community consultations and is intended to empower IDPs and host
communities to become drivers of their own development, rather than recipients of aid.

As of project midterm (March 2015), 7 in depth studies had been conducted to technically backstop project intervention,
including value chain analyses of prominent livelihood opportunities (agriculture, mechanics, metal carpentry, poultry, and
livestock); examination of community social dynamics (gender, decision-making, and conflict); study of credit instruments;
and capacity assessments of local stakeholders. Knowledge generated from these studies has served to inform
community mobilization and implementation. Approximately 33% of the intended beneficiaries had received livelihoods
grants and associated packaged services from the project at the midterm. Preliminary findings indicate that the pilot has
increased income and economic wellbeing of target beneficiaries, while data on planning capacities needs to be collected.
Should the results materialize as planned, the intended impact is to positively contribute to increased resilience and
reduced vulnerability to the stresses of displacement. The model being developed by SLDP, following the results of formal
evaluations, is marked for consideration in other regions in Sudan acutely affected by forced displacement.

South Sudan
South Sudan became independent on July 9, 2011 after a six-year transitional period that ended decades of war
between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM). Four years after
independence, South Sudan remains one of the world’s most conflict-affected and fragile countries, and has not been
able to emerge from cycles of violence. The outbreak of conflict in December 2013 within its borders, which morphed
into an inter-ethnic conflict, suggests that South Sudan is trapped in a cycle of violence. Although oil production places
South Sudan in the lower middle-income group, it has some of the lowest social and infrastructure access indicators in
the world. In South Sudan, two projects have a particular focus on forced displacement, namely the Local Government
Service Delivery Program (LGSDP), and the Safety Nets and Skills Development Project (SNSDP).

South Sudan – Local Government Service Delivery Program
LGSDP aims to support improvements in local governance and service delivery by simultaneously strengthening
community engagement and local government capacities in the planning, implementation and oversight of local
development activities. The design of project activities was informed by upfront analytical work to ensure that the
displaced and returnees are included in community mobilization and consultation mechanisms and in the prioritization
of project investments in service delivery and small scale infrastructure. The project ensures the representation of
displaced populations, including returnees in particular, in the constitution of local government bodies has been ensured
through guidelines issued by the Local Government Board, providing for representation of the displaced through defined
committee quotas. The displaced people and returnees also actively contribute to setting priorities, in terms of which
local infrastructure that is to be rehabilitated. The process for social and resource mapping focuses specifically on local
conflict drivers and mitigation, and measures to enhance cohesion between the displaced and host communities.

Project implementation commenced in the latter part of 2013 with a First Track Initiative (FTI) in Lakes and Western
Equatoria, Upper Nile and Jonglei states. In Lakes and Western Equatoria, the Project has been active in 4 counties
and 12 payams; but implementation deferred in Jonglei and Upper Nile following December 2013 crisis. To date, four
Counties in Lakes and Western Equatoria States have received the development grants in two installments and have

been implementing PDG-funded projects. So far, completed projects include: 11 boreholes, 10 classrooms and 2 out-
patient blocks, 11 boreholes and a 43.5km stretch of manual road clearing. In addition, six more counties in Lakes,
Western Equatoria, Warrap and Eastern Equatoria States are being prepared to receive the Grants in FY2015/16.
Three more States during FY2015/16 will be added, bringing a total of seven out of the ten states under the project. An
informal process audit has confirmed that the representation of displaced populations, including returnees in community
mobilization and institutions. The LGSDP has introduced community level reconciliation and conflict management
following the December 2013 conflict.

South Sudan - Safety Nets and Skills Development Project
The second project, SNSDP, aims to provide access to income opportunities and temporary employment to the poor
and vulnerable and put in place building blocks for a social protection system in South Sudan. It is intended to
particularly target youth and women (including those in protracted displacement or have not been fully integrated) in
poor households.7 Skills gaps and Market Needs Assessments have been completed in two urban areas and the Skills
training pilot has been planned. Roll-out has been deferred, however, due to the conflict situation in the country and the
limited opportunities in the market for skills based employment. Nevertheless, given the increased number of destitute
people, owing to the December 2013 crisis which has not yet been addressed, the work on public works to provide both
opportunities for cash transfers and to build some basic infrastructure is being planned with specific efforts at
disaggregating and effectively targeting refugee returnees, IDPs and locals.

South Sudan: Enhancing Understanding and Informing Programming through Support for Return and
Reintegration of IDPs and Refugees
This technical assistance has the objective of supporting the Government of South Sudan through diagnostics, design
and implementation support for relevant strategies and policies so that the development needs of the displaced are
addressed under the IDA funded LGSDP and thus contribute to sustainable solutions for returnees, IDPs and their host
and return communities. Specifically this is expected to support:

        (i)       Displacement Diagnostics: LGSDP’s design was informed by a GPFD commissioned study on the
                  displacement-development nexus, in order to have a more granular understanding on returning refugees,
                  IDPs and refugees in South Sudan, including flows and dynamics of new and old internal displacement.
                  This updated the information base for LGSDP’s field implementation one the hand and also the WBG's
                  emerging portfolio and programming by other stakeholders, including donors, NGOs and the
                  Government.
        (ii)      Implementation effectiveness: Support systematic evaluation at Mid-Term and End-Term the efficacy of
                  displacement sensitive approaches adopted and implemented by LGSDP, to inform necessary
                  modifications for the current project, as well as other current and pipeline operations in the Banks portfolio,
                  as well as programming by other stakeholders.
        (iii)     Implementation design modifications: Based on the periodic updates on displacement dynamics and the
                  systematic evaluation of implementation effectiveness, LGSDP will make necessary modifications in its
                  approaches at community mobilization, infrastructure creation and service delivery with respect to meeting
                  the needs of the displaced as well.



7
     This will enable them to have (i) short term monetary transfers linked to participation in public works, and (ii) access to livelihood
    opportunities through comprehensive skills development training comprised of technical, entrepreneurship and life skills. An
    inclusive and participatory process will be facilitated by NGOs, to identify the poorest and most vulnerable households to benefit
    from the Public Works component.

QUOTE: RAOUF MAZOU
UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE IN KENYA ON GPFD AND THE HORN

“The Bank’s regional initiative for the Horn of Africa (HoA), and the specific focus on displacement
as one of its three pillars, is a welcome innovation in the way that displacement issues are handled
in the region. In support of this initiative, the Bank’s Global Program on Forced Displacement led an
assessment of displacement and development in the HoA, co-funded and in close coordination with
UNHCR. The process brought together the Bank, UNHCR and counterparts in Government, creating
a new platform for dialogue on future approaches to displacement challenges, not only in Kenya, but
for the region. Going forward, we should build on this as a new way of doing refugee business,
taking this new platform from the country to the regional level, for comprehensive approaches to
displacement solutions.

In Kenya, one by-product of the assessment was the consideration of a new approach to refugee
management, following the recent influx of refugees from South Sudan into the Kakuma refugee
camp in Kenya’s Turkana region. The Governor of Turkana sought a new approach to refugee
management in Turkana County, working with the Bank and UNHCR, aimed at creating a
government-led regional development program, which would improve the socio-economic situation
for both the Kenyan nationals and the refugees. This would allow the refugees to be self-reliant,
build assets and maintain/develop skills until their eventual return to their country of origin, while, in
the interim contributing to the local economy. The Kenyan nationals would see improved socio-
economic and infrastructure gains, which would remain after the return of the refugees. Finally, this
approach would reduce the need for funding for basic upkeep for the refugees and allow UNHCR to
utilize its limited financial resources on protection, the search for durable solutions and critical
lifesaving activities.

As a foundation for this initiative, the Bank was asked to undertake a socio-economic impact
assessment of the Turkana region, which would set the stage for the design of a development
program, as part of the Turkana County Integrated Development Plan. Quick funding by GPFD was
essential in getting this work started. UNHCR also provided funds to GPFD to support this study.
The Bank’s local office also later provided supplementary funding.

From a policy perspective this initiative is important, not just for Kenya, but for displacement
situations in other countries as well. The political messaging is important, as it signals that this
Government has the courage and foresight to acknowledge that return of the refugees will take time
and that it is therefore necessary to establish long-term policies which recognize the economic
potential of refugees, so that their presence is viewed as an asset for Kenya and its affected host
population, rather than a liability.

If GPFD had not included a displacement focus in the Bank’s regional initiative, it is very unlikely all
this would have happened”.

Lake Chad Basin Region
While forced displacement in the LCB region8
is a compound consequence of social,
economic and environmental factors, conflict-
induced forced displacement due to the
intensification and regionalization of the Boko
Haram insurgency in Nigeria has emerged as
a major issue associated with an estimated
new caseload of 1.5 million IDPs in Nigeria,
82,000 IDPs in Cameroon (IOM, April-May
2015), and 133,000 refugees in Cameroon,
Chad and Niger (UNHCR, May 2015).9 From
a relatively localized conflict in the Nigerian
northeast, the Boko Haram insurgency has
gradually spread throughout the rest of the
country and, recently, across the border to
Niger, Cameroon and Chad. Most refugees
and IDPs that are forcibly displaced due to
the conflicts are being hosted in areas
characterized as lagging regions, such as the
Far North region of Cameroon, and Diffa, an
arid area in recurrent food crisis in                            This forcibly displaced man found
southeastern Niger.                                              shelter with his friends in a church

From April 24 to May 16 2015, the GSURR
country office task team conducted a joint
scoping mission to plan an “Assessment of        Photo Credit: reprinted with permission from UNHCR. (UNHCR,
                                                 2015)
the Social, Economic and Environmental
Impact of Forced Displacement in the Lake Chad Basin”. GPFD provided technical advice to the task team and
funded the activity. The specific mission objective was to design and scope a regional assessment to analyze
the development dimensions of forced displacement including the extent, causes, character and social and
economic impact of forced displacement in Nigeria and the adjacent countries of the LCB (Niger, Chad and
Cameroon).

The mission team found that in all the countries visited and under consideration (Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and
Chad), there is an important overlap between lagging and under-served regions and areas affected by forced
displacement. While conflict is the entry point for the forced displacement dynamics observed in the region, the
mission team also identified economic factors, natural hazards, climate change, environmental shocks,
demographic pressure, disruption of traditional livelihoods and transhumance as key drivers of forced
displacement and mixed migration in the region. Respective WBG CMUs as well as national governments are
supportive of addressing the development issues of forced displacement, while humanitarian assistance
agencies, such as UNHCR, UNOCHA and IOM, together with national authorities and development partners,

have been at the forefront of the response to displacement in the LCB, both in protracted and ongoing
displacement situations.

Based on the findings from the scoping mission, the task team has recommended that a comprehensive and
holistic forced displacement assessment should be carried out jointly with UNHCR in the LCB. The assessment
will not only look into the causes of forced displacement at the regional and country-specific level, but also
include a series of highlight studies on critical emerging issues including gender, youth, mixed migration, and
micro-level social and economic impacts of forced displacement. In terms of countries of study, the task team
suggested that country specific analysis should be conducted in Nigeria and Cameroon, updates of forced
displacement analysis should be administered in Chad and Niger (previous Sahel Study countries), and
impacts of forced displacement in CAR on Cameroon and Chad should also be assessed.

The task team aims to finish the desk-based study by the end of September 2015 and to initiate fieldwork in
Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad in early October. Country and regional level assessments are expected to
wrap up in December 2015, and the final forced displacement assessment report will be finalized in April 2016.
The team has already started to engage CMUs and national governments in order to mobilize support to
address issues relevant to forced displacement and the assessment. Additionally, the team is working on
deepening the partnership with UNHCR at the country level, and on mobilizing regional resources to carry out
the assessment in a cost-effective fashion.

Central African Republic
The CAR has spiraled from a long-term crisis of poverty and chronic fragility, into an intercommunal conflict and
a complex humanitarian emergency. Since early 2013, the crisis has forced more than 1 million people, that is
more than a quarter of CAR’s population, to flee their homes. According to OCHA, as of June 22, 2015, the
country continued to count at least 399,000 IDPs and the number of refugees from CAR in its neighborhood
has reached a new peak with at least 458,000.

Therefore, a study was undertaken by GPFD in late 2014, based on the specific demand by the CAR WBG country
team to determine the implications of the large scale displacement for the country and the region as a whole, in
particular with regard to economic recovery. The major findings of the study are briefly summarized below.

    •    Since December 2013, particularly Muslim neighborhoods throughout the country have been
         systematically targeted by violence. As a consequence, almost the entire Muslim population of the
         capital Bangui has fled, and the few who remained have been sheltering in what has effectively
         become a ghetto. Displacement patterns have been similar in the provinces, such as Bossangoa and
         Bouca, where there had been a sizeable and well-established Muslim presence before the crisis. As a
         result, markets have failed as transport networks and market intermediaries, roles traditionally played
         by members of the Muslim community, have disappeared.

    •    Displacement of members of the Muslim minority, has greatly contributed to the decrease of
         commodity supply and negatively impacted price levels. According to estimates, 75 percent of large
         Muslim wholesalers have fled their homes, implying a drop of related sales by 90 percent, which has
         significantly affected the country’s import-dependent economy. For instance, most of the trade in
         Bangui, including food and other imported commodities, was done by about 40 Muslim wholesale
         vendors, 30 of which had fled the city during the crisis. The drop in supply also impacted the price level
         that has surged since the beginning of the crisis: for example, maize, millet, and groundnuts in August
         2014 were 30-70 percent higher than in March-April 2014, according to FAO/WFP.

    •   In February 2014, the UN raised concerns that 96 percent of farmers were without access to seeds to
        plant for the next agricultural season, as many of the traders, wholesalers, and interlocutors were
        Muslims that had departed or were displaced. Moreover, the livestock sector, which was in great part
        controlled by Muslims, has considerably declined due to theft, looting, mass slaughter, and
        outmigration of animals. In 2012, the pastoral sector accounted for an estimated 35 percent of
        agricultural GDP or 15 percent of GDP and represented an estimated 30-40 percent of the country’s
        total exports, with herders predominantly being Muslim Fulani (Peuhl). Their exile contributed to a
        contraction of the livestock sector by up to 77 percent, with a further contraction estimated to 67
        percent for cattle and 77 percent for small livestock and poultry in 2014 compared to 2013.

    •   The crisis in CAR has spilled over into neighboring countries in many respects, particularly due to the
        high numbers of refugees and the disruption of traditional transhumance patterns. In all host countries,
        the refugee influxes have added pressure on food security and access to social services. Humanitarian
        conditions in the border areas of Cameroon have been desperate, while in Chad, clashes between
        refugees in temporary sites and host communities have resulted in fatalities. Also the consequences of
        cross-border transhumance interruption have been significant for the pastoral economy, creating
        bottlenecks of livestock where the spread of disease and competition over resources raise significant
        challenges.

While the humanitarian consequences of the large-scale displacement due to the CAR crisis are dire, the
economic recovery of CAR also appears to be hampered by the absence of Muslim economic operators.
Muslims in CAR have traditionally had a dominant place in the commerce and livestock sectors and have been
considered by many as the backbone of the economy. Many were traders and shopkeepers who imported
staples and they also ran the meat industry. The departure of the great majority of the traditional Muslim
economic operators is hampering the country’s economic recovery in a way that is still to be quantified in

macroeconomic terms. Thus, a full resumption of economic activities requires measures that help to create
conditions favorable to the return of the Muslim economic operators.

The study has been provided to UNHCR and its outcomes have been integrated into the new Country
Engagement Note (CEN) for CAR that has been approved by the WBG Board on July 30, 2015.

Cote d’Ivoire
In Cote d’Ivoire, an evaluation study has been launched of the pilot project for the return of IDPs, the “Projet
d’Urgence pour le Retour des Personnes Déplacées Internes” (PUR-PDI). The preliminary report will be
available end of July 2015. The additional financing of the Post-Conflict Assistance Project has allowed the
construction of 323 houses to support the return of IDPs in western Cote d’Ivoire this past year; and an
additional 177 houses are planned in the coming six months. This activity is part of a larger community
development component, which includes: (i) construction of social infrastructures, (ii) social cohesion activities,
and (iii) support to livelihoods in 200 communities.

Philippines
One of the first activities undertaken by GPFD was to fund a Political Economy Analysis (PEA) of forced
displacement in Mindanao, Philippines in 2011.10 This report provided recommendations for analytical and
operational interventions to better understand and address the causes and impacts of displacement. The main
effects of this study have been to address development challenges of land conflict in the region. The WBG
Philippines country team is currently starting joint work with IOM in support of the Transitional Justice and
Reconciliation Commission (TJRC), which was formed by the Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) in the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro in 2014. The mandate of the TJRC
includes generating recommendations to address marginalization through unjust dispossession of land.
Working in partnership with the TJRC "Land Study Group", the joint WBG-IOM team will:

      (i)   Contribute to the development and identification of concepts, meanings, and identities associated with
            the land issue for Christians, Muslims and indigenous peoples;
      (ii) Analyze the triggers and impact of displacement or dispossession as a result of the conflict;
      (iii) Undertake a literature review of the history of land dispossession;
      (iv) Map existing policies, programs and initiatives related to land conflict in Mindanao;
      (v) Provide recommendations on land reparations;
      (vi) Analyze legal and social feasibility of a potential local solution to land conflict in Lanao del Sur
            province;
     (vii) Facilitate private sector forums on land issues to identify proposed solutions to local conflicts.

This work will contribute to the Study Group's report to the TJRC Commissioners and, in turn, form part of the
basis of the TJRC's final report to the Government and MILF Peace Panels, due in October 2015. Additional
resources will be provided by Australia, IOM, and the KTF.

Azerbaijan
Approximately 7 percent of Azerbaijan’s population (around 595,000 people) is displaced, having been forced to leave
their homes in response to the 1992-1994 conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. This makes Azerbaijan one of the countries
with the highest number of IDPs per capita in the world. This group is particularly affected by circumstance-driven
inequalities. In 2011, the WBG estimated the poverty rate of IDPs to be 25 percent, compared to 20.1 percent among
the non-displaced. IDPs remain a core stratum among the poorest 40% of the population in spite of public investment,
which has helped to relieve living conditions through improved housing and infrastructure.

Partnership between the WBG and the Government in assisting IDP communities in the country dates back to the initial
post-conflict period in the mid-1990s. The WBG’s analytical work on livelihoods and self-reliance among IDPs has
helped influence the design of national policies towards a higher level of self-reliance among IDPs. The current IDP
“Living Standards and Livelihoods Project Loan”11, in the amount of $50 million, became effective in February 2012. The
project objective is to improve living conditions and increase the economic self-reliance of targeted IDPs through: (i)
provision of grants to finance demand-driven micro-projects in rural infrastructure (e.g., repair of access roads, school
refurbishment); (ii) renovations of collective centers where many IDPs are housed; and, (iii) building opportunities for
rural employment and livelihood support services. Over 300 hundred communities in 32 administrative districts and
cities are being serviced under the project. An estimated 185,500 community members are expected to benefit from
infrastructure investments and livelihood support. The WBG and the government are currently preparing AF, which is
expected to become effective by the end of FY16. The project has benefitted from ongoing discussions and advice from
the GPFD, drawing on global and regional expertise.

The community-driven nature of the project lends itself well to citizen engagement activities. Under the current project,
the target of having 50% of the total beneficiaries be female is close to being reached, with 49.2% of beneficiaries being
women. To date, 177 communities have undergone community mobilization and have implemented micro-projects and
66 collective center renovations have been completed or are near completion. All targeted youth (1300) have graduated
from or have participated in training programs; all income-generating groups (200 communities representing 2239
individuals) have been formed and 163 have already received grants; and micro-loans are fully disbursed (1608 direct
beneficiaries). A key project component is to support IDPs to help increase and diversify their sources of income. To
date, 200 cooperative, business community groups have been formed and have received technical and business
management trainings. Once the groups have developed detailed business action-plans, registered as formal Limited
Liability Companies (LLCs) and opened bank accounts, they are provided with grants averaging 9000 AZN
(approximately 9000 USD) to procure assets and supplies to start their chosen IGA. To promote ownership, the
community groups also contribute approximately 500 AZN of their own funds. The groups are comprised of between
10-12 women and men and decision-making is participatory.

The IGAs are varied in nature and build on skills IDPs bring from their home communities. Initially, many groups chose
activities related to cattle, sheep rearing or crop production, but activities are increasingly diversified and include:
beekeeping, bakery, carpet manufacturing, event management, used building materials collection/sales, poultry rearing,
and management of retail shops, cafés, and beauty salons. An internal review points to important benefits in terms of
increased incomes and employment as well as less tangible benefits such as a renewed sense of purpose, pride and
sense of community. The capacity of IGAs to offer employment is possibly one of their most important features, and
many group members report that the employment offered by the IGAs was crucial in improving morale and providing
constructive and productive daily activities. None of the groups offered the opportunity for full-time employment yet, but

all the groups visited offer part-time work to all group members, using a rotational schedule. Despite the short time that
these income-generating groups have been operating, most already generate robust incomes (up to 1,500 AZN in profit
per month).

Beyond the immediate economic gains, both implementing partners and beneficiaries note important indirect benefits.
Through the business trainings, grants and ongoing support from the implementing partners, a significant degree of
trust seems to have been restored among community members. Beneficiaries have expressed a renewed sense of
confidence in themselves and in the future of their communities. All the encountered groups have confirmed their
intentions of prioritizing benefits to further expand the business as a way of employing and helping more community
members.

Georgia
In the aftermath of conflicts in in 1992 and 2008, Georgia faced the displacement of more than a quarter of a
million people within the country, amounting to 5-6% of its population. The Ministry of IDPs and Refugees from
the Occupied Territories of Georgia (MRA) is responsible for coordinating responses of governmental and non-
governmental agencies to internal displacement.12 The approval of the State Strategy on IDPs in 2007, and of
the two Action Plans on Displacement, one for 2009-2012 and a subsequent one for 2012-2014, were
important steps in framing Government policy to meet the needs of IDPs. The Action Plan backs up the
Strategy with plans to provide long term solutions to the accommodation needs of IDPs, reduce their
dependency on the State, and support the integration of vulnerable IDPs into the state social assistance
programs, based on clear and transparent criteria, until their return becomes possible.13

The work of the WBG14 builds on a long trajectory of involvement on IDP issues in Georgia, including an
assessment of IDP needs carried out in 2012, an assessment of IDP livelihoods programming in 2013,
activities with the Georgia Municipal Infrastructure Project to address the housing needs of IDPs, as well as
efforts made under the “Georgia IDP Community Development Project” that closed in 2013. Through this work,
the WBG has developed solid relationships with governmental and non-governmental partners in multiple
sectors and with bilateral partners.

Currently, the WBG is supporting the Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories,
Accommodation and Refugees on IDP issues through technical assistance to facilitate potential transition from
status-based to needs-based assistance for IDPs. To analyze the impact of this potential reform, an ongoing
study seeks to understand the daily realities for IDPs and to compare the needs of IDPs with non-IDPs citizens.
The study is composed of three sections: (i) desk analysis to identify available data and literature on IDP
housing, access to services, and access to social assistance; (ii) qualitative analysis, including focus groups
and interviews with IDPs and non-IDPs to understand citizen perspectives on how policies are affecting them
and views on the shift from status based to needs based assistance; and (iii) quantitative analysis, i.e. data
collection and/or analysis of existing statistical data, reports, and surveys of state institutions (such as the IDP

   Relevant Governmental bodies include Including the Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Affairs (MHLSA) who administers the
 disbursement of IDP allowances, the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) in charge of the Municipal
 Development Funds (MDF) under which much housing rehabilitation has occurred, the Ministry of Justice responsible for issuing
 house ownership documents for IDPs, and the Ministry of Interior in charge of land issues and construction in connection with the
 new houses. The MRA also chairs various coordination fora (such as the Steering Group on IDPs) aimed at increasing information
 sharing and policy development between government, international donors, and implementing agencies.

The current technical assistance work in Georgia has benefitted from the GPFD’s extensive work on political
economy analysis. An understanding of how political economy can affect the potential for reform in Georgia is
embedded into the analysis and will be embedded into recommendations. Recommendations will be shared
with GPFD’s community of practice and this global knowledge will ensure that final recommendations to the
Government reflect global best practices.

Turkey
A review of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Turkey in 2014 was an opportunity to put greater
emphasis on understanding the constraints to eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity
in the country. There was concern over the regional dimensions of poverty in Turkey - the south-east
lagging behind the rest of the country on many dimensions of poverty – and under-development, which could
be compounded by the impact of the Syrian crisis. With Turkey now hosting the largest number of refugees in
the world, amounting to over 2 million people,15 analysis on this issue was key to understanding the effects on
hosting communities. An initial scoping mission and desk review by GPFD helped a task team and the country
office to formulate an engagement with the Government on the Syrian refugee crisis. There is now proposed
work with the Government on a large-scale survey that will help quantify the impact of the crisis on Turkish host
communities, with the potential to inform Government policy. The availability of initial seed funding for this work
from GPFD was instrumental in leveraging additional resources from other WBG sources and from SIDA.

Ukraine
As of mid-2015, more than 2.3 million people are displaced both internally (1.4 million) and outside of Ukraine (900,000)
since the outbreak of conflict in Eastern Ukraine in March 2014. As the conflict continues, both humanitarian and
development impacts are felt by both displaced and host communities. Humanitarian needs - such as emergency
provision of shelter, food, and basic needs for the vulnerable - are increasingly paired with development and poverty
reduction issues-service delivery deficits, overburdened social welfare services, joblessness, increasing social tensions,
and deteriorating debt and credit relations. Long-term displacement contributes to recurrent cycles of insecurity, can
erode citizen confidence and imposes burdens on state structures and public finance. As a result, conflict and
displacement have contributed to social instability, labor and price distortions, service delivery deficits, and the rise of
divisive identity politics, particularly in the east of the country.

In response to the crisis, GPFD was requested to prepare a social context analysis of forced displacement that
surveyed the scope, triggers, and impacts of the displacement crisis at national, oblast and raion levels. This analysis
informed the subsequent Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment (RPA) for Ukraine that GPFD, other WBG
colleagues, the EU, and UN concluded in April 2015. GPFD analysis provided baseline and projection data for
assessments of sectoral impacts and projected recovery costs for conflict affected areas of eastern Ukraine, ensuring
that the developmental impacts of forced displacement were mainstreamed into the costing and operational
recommendations of the RPA while raising the profile of the development impacts of forced displacement for
counterparts in the Ukrainian government. GPFD provided analysis of WBG operations in similar situations of forced
displacement within other countries to inform recommendations and prospective programming for Ukraine. GPFD’s
displacement analysis for Ukraine was a key component of GSURR’s Knowledge Product on ‘Conflict Mainstreaming’
for Ukraine to inform future WBG strategy and operations to be more conflict and displacement sensitive. GPFD’s
analysis is also contributing to the design of a combined governance/conflict filter to be applied across the WBG’s
portfolio in Ukraine, informing a prospective WBG operation on community social support which will include a focus on

communities hosting IDPs, and providing a foundation for possible future WBG programming focused on the
development implications of the displacement crisis.

In FY16, GPFD has been asked to continue to update its displacement analysis as the crisis continues, work
with the Ukraine team in further analysis and survey efforts of displaced populations and host communities, and
contribute inputs as part of Ukraine’s upcoming SCD and CPF development efforts. GPFD will also play a key
role in providing global experience and lessons from other country contexts in designing policies and programs
- particularly on issues such as return triggers, employment and livelihood support, and social cohesion.

Colombia
Protracted armed violence between the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), Criminal
Bands (BACRIM), the Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) and the Government has led to one of the highest
levels of internal displacement in the world, amounting to over 5 million people by the end of 201416. Since the
publication in 2011, of the “Victims Law”, the Government continues to gradually deploy a set of individual and
collective reparation measures, including land and financial restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, psycho-
social support and guarantees of non-repetition. GPFD engaged with the Victims’ Unit in the early development
and implementation of the Victims’ Law and the WBG developed a package of Programmatic Knowledge
Services (PKS) to promote sustainable implementation practices that learn from small-scale pilots targeting
violence prevention, citizen security, reconciliation and land restitution. GPFD also supported a proposal to the
Colombia Peace and Post-Conflict Fund to catalyze in this approach.

Since 2012, 96,912 requests for protection of land assets from IDPs have been met, 1,194 titles to occupants
have been awarded, and important contributions to the regulation of the restitution chapter of the Restitution
Law have been offered, while supporting the design of decrees about land restitution to ethnic minorities. The
grant has also supported the Land Restitution Unit (LRU) to organize the processes for land restitution. As a
result, 24 land restitution offices have been established throughout the country and 72,62317 requests for
restitution have been received. A total of 25,406 of the requests have been processed18, of which, 9,695 have
been included in the RTDAF19, and 1,852 cases have been decided. Regarding ethnic minorities, 19 cases
have started the judicial process, of which one is already resolved.



MENA: The Middle East and North Africa
The civil war in Syria has made that country the largest source of cross border and internal displacement worldwide,
with 7.7 million IDPs and 4.0 million refugees. Turkey hosts the largest number of exiled Syrians (over 2 million),
followed by Lebanon (1.2 million), Jordan (630,000), Iraq (250,000) and Egypt (139,000). This influx raises the total
population of Lebanon by almost 30 percent and between 5-10 percent for Jordan. Adding to the alarmingly high totals
from Syria in the region is new displacement of least 3.0 million people in Iraq and 309,000 people newly displaced in

Libya. The combined effects of these crises has made MENA the region the world’s largest producer and host of forced
displacement.

In addition to displacement caused by recent conflicts, several of the countries in the MENA region continue to host
refugees from previous conflicts, including an estimated 5 million Palestinian refugees, 750,000 Iraqis from previous
wars, and 48,000 Sahrawis living in refugee camps in Algeria, displaced by the conflict in Western Sahara. Overall, the
magnitude of the problem puts the MENA region at the center of the global displacement crisis.

MENA: WBG Response
While the challenges posed by large-scale displacement flows have traditionally been regarded as
humanitarian in nature, the duration and scale of these population movements in the MENA region have
revealed the significant long-term development impacts that these crises have on the displaced and hosts alike.
These effects on governance, housing, service delivery and livelihoods are most keenly felt in host areas that
may have already experienced deficits prior to forced displacement inflows.

Governments are normally reluctant to borrow in order to finance expenditures related to refugees, yet the
WBG’s MENA region has been able to support the displaced and host governments and populations in a
number of ways, including providing multi-sectoral expertise in dialogue with Governments and an ability to
leverage partnerships and funding from other key actors.

The WBG’s operational portfolio addressing displacement needs in the MENA region has grown over the last
several years. In the early stages of the Syrian crisis, projects tended to focus on the needs of refugees and
directly affected host populations and were typically implemented by NGOs. However, as the burden of hosting
Syrian refugees began to weigh more heavily on receiving governments, WBG support has moved toward
support for host communities and governments to complement continuing, largely humanitarian support being
given to refugees. In practice this has meant that the WBG has focused on activities aimed at safeguarding
development achievements, promoting social stability, enhancing service delivery, and emphasizing the role
that good analytics can play in understanding the social and economic impacts of regional displacement. There
has been less support to IDP populations in Syria or Iraq, largely due to access issues, yet national programs
(e.g. social protection, education and health operations) have adjusted, in the case of Iraq, to be more
cognizant of the vulnerability of IDPs.

The WBG has significantly increased the amount of analytical work it conducts in the region, augmenting its
ability to design appropriate operations, provide technical advice, convene stakeholders, and engage in policy
dialogue with local clients. GPFD has served as a custodian of WBG knowledge on displacement, both
commissioning and directly conducting much of this research for external and internal consumption.

Many governments are struggling with the challenge of protracted refugee presence in their respective
countries. In addition, discourse on forced displacement is politically sensitive, even controversial. As a result,
financing displacement-oriented operations remains a challenge as the region’s middle-income countries are
not eligible for concessional financing from the WBG and are reluctant to borrow for what they view as a global
public good. Moreover, applicable trust funds are insufficient to meet demand. In the fifth year of the region’s
crises the WBG has leveraged $50+ millions of grant financing in Jordan and $75 million in Lebanon, amounts
that are clearly not commensurate with the scale of the challenge facing these countries.

GPFD’s Regional Work in MENA
At a regional level, GPFD’s operational engagements include:

•   GPFD led the SPF-funded “5M: Displaced People in Jordan/Lebanon” project designed to pilot approaches to
    mitigating the impact of Syrian crisis in select localities in Lebanon and Jordan. Save the Children was engaged to
    implement activities focusing on early childhood development, education and livelihoods. The work on the SPF
    grant inspired wide discussion in the WBG country team on how best the WBG could support mitigation of the
    impact of Syrian refugees and a portfolio review was undertaken to this end. Activities under this program recently
    came to a close.

•   GPFD is part of core task team of the “Jordan Emergency Services and Social Resilience Project” (JESSRP),
    designed in response to the Syrian crisis to address the strains on municipalities regarding local public service
    delivery to refugees as well as host communities, who are increasingly adversely affected by the crisis.

•   GPFD is also part of the “Lebanon Municipal Services Emergency Project” providing advice to the task team to
    help address urgent displacement-related community–level service delivery impacts in selected municipalities.

GPFD is also playing a supporting role in:

•   Providing technical advice and content input for the survey instruments to be used in the upcoming Household
    Needs Surveys of refugee and host families in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. Additional GPFD support for this
    exercise includes funding made available for third party qualitative assessments of the impacts of Syrian refugees
    on host communities in these three countries.

•   GPFD is supporting the development of a WBG-executed capacity building exercise planned to assist the statistic
    offices in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and in Baghdad better assess the scope of forced displacement in Iraq.

•   GPFD has provided upstream technical advice for the recent $350 million loan to the Government of Iraq in support
    of reconstruction of “liberated areas” of the country. GPFD contributed advice on the viability and appropriate
    mechanisms for working with selected ministries and target locations in Anbar and Ninewa governorates, based on
    recent GPFD staff experience in the country and past social context analyses of the area.

•   At the corporate level, GPFD continues to participate in the development of a new MENA strategy within the WBG,
    with particular emphasis on the recovery and resilience pillars of the four pillar orientation of the emergent strategy
    that focus on the impacts of forced displacement on recovery and the resilience of refugees, returnees, and
    affected host and return communities.

Syria Information and Research Initiative (SIRI)
As part of the Syria Information and Research Initiative (SIRI) launched in end-2013, the MENA region launched a
remote damage assessment for the Dar’a Governorate on a pilot basis to explore the potential of using satellite imagery
supported by ground information through UN agencies and other humanitarian actors, to compile damage data and
assess damage impact for the Housing, Health, Education, and Agriculture sectors. This was coupled with an
assessment of secondary data by GPFD from select districts in Dar’a to assess displacement flows, return intentions,
drivers of displacement and enabling conditions for return. Based on the results of the pilot and lessons learned, MENA
region decided to scale up the assessment to cover six cities, i.e., Dar’a, Idlib, Latakia, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo, with a
focus on assessing damage in Housing, Health, Education, Transport, Energy, and Water and Sanitation sectors in the
cities, and Agriculture sector in the governorates. Importantly, there was also a recognition that any damage
assessment should be conducted in parallel with a needs analysis looking at drivers of displacement and enabling
conditions to draw the displaced toward home areas.




                                                           38
While reviewing the lessons learned during the Dar’a pilot and determining the scope of the scaled up assessment,
GPFD emphasized the importance of understanding the change in the human terrain due to displacement resulting
from the conflict, in order to better assess the needs of the population in particular. Recognizing that recovery needs
would have to be defined and assessed keeping in view the enabling environment that would have to be created for
future return of the displaced population, the assessment team reached out to GPFD to lead this aspect of the
assessment.



 QUOTE: SHANTAYANAN DEVARAJAN | MENA CHIEF ECONOMIST

 “Over the last few years, along with the severity of the Syrian crisis, the WBG’s work on forced
 displacement has increased exponentially in the MENA region. As the WBG developed pilot
 programs, analytical work and later lending and grant funded operations to address
 development needs in connection with forced displacement, it has been very important to draw
 on the expertise, flexible resources and knowledge of the Global Program on Forced
 Displacement.
 Input from GPFD has recently been particularly important to provide the platform for sharing
 experiences between the MENA and AFR regions on how best to tackle the growing
 displacement related development challenges in the two regions, leading to agreement on
 undertaking a major “flagship” assessment of the economic impact and operational experiences
 of forced displacement. This work will be led by GPFD in close collaboration with the MENA
 and AFR Chief Economist offices and the effort will be co-funded.
 Lastly and perhaps most significantly, GPFD’s input has been inspirational, concrete and
 hands-on in the development of the new MENA strategy, one of whose pillars has a strong
 focus on refugees and forced displacement. We continue to draw on GPFD’s expertise as the
 strategy is being finalized for Board presentation in September; and we will need GPFD even
 more in the future when we apply the strategy to client dialogue, partnership engagement, and
 design of WBG operations.



GPFD provided insight on the drivers and enabling conditions that would influence the future movements and
potential return of displaced populations based on tapping existing surveys available in the public domain and
social media analysis. This is the first time such a damage and needs assessment approach has been used to
assess perceptions remotely. The primary study period was scoped to January 2014 through December 2014,
though data up through June 2015 that enhances understanding of population shifts and needs was included
as available. The cities of focus were Dar’a, Aleppo, and Homs. GPFD examined correlations that appear to
exist between the status of basic services (damage) and displacement flows. Generally, across the three cities
examined in this assessment, the most influential factors pushing and pulling displacement and return flows
were security, shelter, access to land and livelihood assets, restoration of basic services, and political as well
as kinship affiliation considerations. Each city has a unique signature of drivers and enabling conditions that
impact population movements and return decisions. A key conclusion of this innovative analysis was that




                                                          39
enabling conditions that pull IDPs and refugees back home should be durable enough to ensure continued
recovery and reintegration over time.

MENA Policies and Practice for the Economic Inclusion of Refugees
GPFD also contributed to the WBG paper, “Policies and Practice for the Economic Inclusion of Refugees”,
examining the modalities for the economic inclusion of refugees in advanced industrial economies. The
underlying assumption of this work is that employment is a key indicator of integration, ensuring self-
sufficiency, economic well-being and independence. The paper develops and elaborates a three-fold typology
of facilitating, constraining and mediating variables to assess the process of economic inclusion. Refugee
access to labor markets is most likely to be spontaneous but can be enhanced by facilitating factors such as
language skills, training and qualifications recognition. These are sometimes incorporated into national policy
frameworks for refugee integration. Conversely, the paper shows how structural and situational factors such as
refugee status determination procedures constrain or act as barriers to access. Finally the paper shows how to
demonstrate that wider mediating variables, such as macro- and micro- economic conditions and fiscal policy,
delineate contextual conditions which determine employment opportunities and labor market access.

Challenges in MENA, going forward
It is unlikely that the conflicts driving forced displacement in MENA – particularly those related to Iraq, Syria, and Yemen
– will be resolved anytime soon. Continued violence in the region will increase the numbers of refugees and IDPs and
the duration of displacement may exceed fifteen years if present trends continue. Current policies and interim support
strategies are inappropriate and unsustainable for this scale and length of forced displacement.

A second challenge results from assessments of the damage in key cities within Syria that indicate that it will take many
years of reconstruction, once that is possible, before people will be able to go back to their homes in that country. In
addition, surveys of Syrian refugees in the region and evidence from inside of Syria suggest that up to 20 percent of
forcibly displaced Syrians have no intention to return to homes of origin. This amounts to 2.2 million persons choosing to
remain in place or to move to locations in the region or within Syria other than their homes of record.20

A third challenge results from the majority of refugees and IDPs in the region that have settled in urban areas outside of
formal camp settlements or in public (or unfinished) buildings. These individuals and families are increasingly
unregistered and enmeshed in an informal survival economy that is often exploitative and detrimental to host
populations.

Without sustained policy dialogue with clients and continued support in the form of developmental operations and
analytical work, the long-term impacts of forced displacement in MENA will contribute to a reversal of development
achievements, additional strains on public finance, and deteriorating social cohesion.

Afghanistan
According to UNHCR, conflict in Afghanistan has resulted in a current number of more than 2.7 million
refugees and 683,000 IDPs. More than 5.8 million Afghan refugees have returned to their country since
2002. In the region, Pakistan and Iran host more than 2.4 million refugees, and in addition, Pakistan has
715,000 IDPs and an even larger number of irregular migrants. Recent military operations in North
Waziristan have displaced more than 13,000 families across the border into Afghanistan, making forced
displacement an important regional issue. Due to a variety of reasons, but especially a lack of job
opportunities, shelter/access to land and, in some instances security, around 15% of these returnees
did not return to or remain in their communities of origin and have become displaced for a second time.
Simultaneously, growing insecurity has resulted in increasing numbers of new IDPs in different parts of
the country. While many have moved to the larger cities, including Kabul, in search of livelihood
opportunities and security, others have migrated to neighboring countries in search of jobs.

A WBG/UNHCR study (2011) 21 identified mixed motives among urban IDPs, regarding return to place of
origin, comprising both push and pull factors. Two key challenges affecting IDPs and refugee/IDP
returnees were identified. First, a lack of restoration of property rights and landlessness were seen as
the main obstacles to durable solutions. Insufficient documentation, competing land claims and land
grabbing, and judicial corruption have hindered the resolution of property disputes. The inability to
reclaim lost lands has undermined the sustainability of previous returns. A weak judiciary further
hampers the access to land and rights for returnees and IDPs (UNHCR 2011). Second, lack of shelter
and insufficient job opportunities or services in rural areas also prevent IDPs from returning home or
sustainably resettling elsewhere.

The body of research on forced displacement in Afghanistan has been conducted by humanitarian
actors for humanitarian actors. But despite considerable investment and effort by both development and
humanitarian actors, refugee return has proven hard to prioritize in the government’s development
policy agenda. Instead, there has been hope and an assumption that once immediate needs and
displacement-related vulnerabilities are addressed, long-term solutions would be mainstreamed into
national priority programs. However, this has not always been the case and returnees and IDPs are
generally among the most vulnerable sections of society. International research suggests that forced
displacement should not only be viewed as a humanitarian challenge, but equally as a development
concern. A regional shift in thinking is therefore necessary to ensure poverty reduction and growth as
well as to reduce societal vulnerabilities of forcibly displaced groups and their host communities.

The WBG has commissioned a stock-taking exercise in order to assess the quantity and quality of
existing data collected by humanitarian agencies, bilaterals and others. The inspiration for this study
came from GPFD, which is also funding it, while the design, drawing on GPFD global experience, was
jointly developed with the WBG Afghanistan country team. UNHCR was also consulted and will work
with the WBG on this important exercise. The stock-take will identify the current socio-economic and
spatial profile of IDPs and returnees, capture ongoing development in the area (increased number of
returnees), and identify areas where further analysis is required in order to provide policy
recommendations to the Afghan Government. The main objective is to lay the ground for more effective

Sri Lanka
The Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka were ravaged by the internal armed conflict over almost three
decades and is estimated to have cost the lives of about 70,000 people. On May 19, 2009 the President of Sri
Lanka announced the end of the conflict and brought back the entire Northern Province under Government
control. Large-scale displacement occurred during the conflict, especially in the last period of the intensified
armed conflict in 2008 and 2009. The conflict stunted development in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and
also negatively affected growth in the country at large. Despite the conflict, the Government, assisted by donors
including the WBG, implemented several programs for emergency welfare, livelihood assistance and
rehabilitation in these areas.

In order to start reconstruction of the North, the Government prepared a 180-day plan, which included four
main activities: (i) demining; (ii) return and resettlement for IDPs; (iii) provision of basic welfare, infrastructure,
and social services; and (iv) support to resume livelihoods of the IDPs. The WBG prepared the “Emergency
Northern Recovery Project” with the Government and the project was approved in December 2009. The
development objective of the project was to support the Government’s efforts to rapidly resettle the IDPs in the
Northern Province by creating an enabling environment.

Project design was simple and incorporated lessons learned in past and on-going projects in the region, as well
as in other post conflict operations in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. These lessons highlighted the need to: (i)
provide immediate help to returnees; (ii) balance livelihood support with the rehabilitation of public services and
basic infrastructure; and (iii) ensure adequate implementation arrangements are in place right from project
start-up. The inclusion of technical and financial auditing design elements improved the accuracy of the costing
of geographically scattered civil works ($60 million), while ensuring their construction quality and proper
contract management.

At negotiations, the project’s primary target group was 100,000 IDPs out of a total of 290,000 people who were
living in Government camps in July 2009. A large majority of the IDPs targeted under the project were people
displaced consequent to intensified fighting between Armed Forces of the Government and the rebels of the
North in 2008 up to May 2009. The project assisted not only the IDPs in the welfare camps, but also the IDPs
who returned from relatives, friends and abroad, amounting to 147,414 persons.

This is one of the largest WBG projects focusing on forced displacement in a difficult environment. GPFD is
continuing to engage with the country team to extract lessons for the design and implementation of future
operations.

3. ANALYTICAL WORK
Over the past year, GPFD has focused its analytical work on strengthening the evidence base for development
work on forced displacement. GPFD is currently compiling a comprehensive overview of all WBG Economic
and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) of forced displacement – a work stream that is receiving increasing
attention. The program has also spearheaded three key studies in the Sahel, Great Lakes and Horn regions of
Africa, which have examined the development dimensions of forced displacement and informed the WBG’s
regional initiatives. GPFD is in the process of completing its work on a number of key thematic issues, such as
sustainable refugee return, urban displacement, land, livelihoods and gender. Following demand from the AFR
and MENA VP offices of the WBG, as well as their respective Chief Economists, GPFD will lead a major
flagship on the economic, social and fiscal impacts and operational experiences of forced displacement in
FY16. This work will help to cement forced displacement as a development issue for the WBG, and the findings
will inform the WBG and its partners’ work on forced displacement going forward, as well as feeding into the
discussions at the WHS in May 2016. Dissemination of this analytical work over the past year has contributed
to an increase in awareness across the WBG of the development impact of conflict induced forced
displacement and to a strengthened WBG response, evidenced by the growing number of operations that
address the social and economic impacts on the displaced and their host or return communities.

Thematic Analytical Work
Analytical Work on Economic and Social Impacts of Forced Displacement
Over the last 18 months, the WBG has expanded its efforts to quantify the impacts of forced
displacement on host countries and to estimate the welfare impacts for host communities and displaced
populations through ESIAs. The goal of this work is to strengthen operational responses that relieve
fiscal pressure on host countries, restore access to infrastructure and services, and support welfare
improvements for the poor and vulnerable displaced and host populations.

A starting point for this body of work was the mixed methods approach developed by GPFD, Oxford
RSC, FAFO, and PRIO and documented in the “Guidelines for Assessing the Impacts and Costs of
Forced Displacement”, “Assessing the Impacts and Costs of Forced Displacement – A Mixed Methods
Approach, Volume I”, and “Volume II: Study on Impacts and Costs of Forced Displacement – State of
the Art Literature Review”. The methodology was first applied in Jordan in 2012 to assess the impact of
the influx of Syrian refugees. However, the exercise did not adequately quantify the fiscal impact of
forced displacement. Subsequent dialogue between the WBG and the Government led to: (i) the $150
million “Emergency Project to Assist Jordan Partially Mitigate Impact of Syrian Conflict” that aims to
maintain access to essential healthcare services and basic household needs for the Jordanian
population affected by the influx of Syrian refugees; and (ii) the $53 million “Jordan Emergency Services
and Social Resilience Project” that provides assistance to municipalities and host communities to
address immediate service delivery impacts of Syrian refugee inflows and strengthen municipal capacity
to support local economic development.

GPFD is providing technical support to a number of these ESIAs and building on this momentum by
preparing an overview, illustrated by the table below, not only of ESIAs as such, but also of major
studies that have components that measure the social and/or economic impact of forced displacement
in its various forms. The methods and outcomes of these assessments will feed into the flagship
analytical work to be undertaken in FY16.

A selection of these assessments is discussed in detail on the following page.

influx of large numbers of Syrian refugees that has led to a surge in demand for public services, projected to
raise public expenditures over the period by $1.1 billion. This work has assisted the Government to identify
policy and investment priorities for support from the international community, including concrete projects to
build resilience in hosting communities, such as the $10 million WBG-supported “Lebanon Municipal Services
Emergency Project” that aims to address urgent community priorities in select municipal services, targeting
areas most affected by the influx of Syrian refugees.

Socio-Economic Impact of the Crisis in North Mali on Displaced People
In Mali, the “Socio-Economic Impact of the Crisis in North Mali on Displaced People” evaluated the impact of
the crisis on IDPs in Bamako, refugees in camps in Mauritania and Niger, and returnees in the regional capitals
of Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal, using data from a face-to-face household survey and follow-up interviews with
baseline respondents using mobile phones. Beginning in August 2014, the WBG has tracked the welfare of
displaced people in Mali on a monthly basis. The baseline survey showed that better-educated and wealthier
households fled the crisis, the welfare of the displaced declined considerably, and significant amounts of
durable goods (20-60 percent) and animals (75-90 percent) were lost. Follow up interviews have revealed that
over time the impact of the crisis has diminished, and by February 2015 most eligible children were going to
school and employment levels and number of meals consumed were at pre-crisis levels. The survey data also
show that different ethnic groups chose different places of refuge, and depending on their location, the
narrative of the crisis and the solutions they envisage are vastly different. GPFD provided crucial support for
this work by mobilizing resources from the KTF, providing co-funding of $75,000, facilitating discussions with
UNHCR, and providing technical input to the concept note and survey instruments. This innovative work is of
importance to frame future policy and planning dialogue with affected governments and UNHCR on how best to
promote solutions to forced displacement.

The Peculiar Dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp: An Economic and Social Impact Analysis
In Kenya, GPFD provided substantial seed funding of $250,000 (including $50,000 from UNHCR), and the
country office provided co-financing for “The Peculiar Dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp: An Economic
and Social Impact Analysis”. GPFD was intimately involved in the preparation of the Concept Note, approved in
May 2015, for this analysis. The study will evaluate the economic and social impact of refugees on host

communities in Turkana County. Recognizing that there are other factors impacting on the welfare of host
communities over the 20-year lifespan of the camp, the analysis aims to construct a counterfactual to isolate
the changes caused by the presence of refugees. An original survey was carried out in Kakuma in June/July
2015 and another town to collect data on household demographics, remittances, employment opportunities and
trends, wage rates, and prices in food, labor, cattle and housing markets. Apurva Sanghi, the WBG’s Lead
Economist in charge of the Kakuma study, published an external blog post inspired by the study on the
Brookings website titled “The peculiar economics of a refugee camp: “Yes in my backyard”,22 about the need to
“do things differently” and giving his perspective on the economics of displacement and the effect on host
populations.

MENA analytical initiatives on the economic and social impact of crises in Syria and Iraq
In MENA, several analytical initiatives are underway to evaluate the economic and social impacts of the crises in Syria
and Iraq including the impact of forced displacement. In addition to the Lebanon Economic and Social Impact
Assessment of the Syrian Conflict described above, impact assessments have been completed in Iraq KRG, Lebanon
and Jordan, and the Levant region and additional studies are underway in Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan.

•    GPFD provided technical input to the design of “The Kurdistan Region of Iraq: Assessing the Economic and Social
     Impact of the Syrian Conflict and ISIS” and provided ongoing support to the team, including funding for an expert
     from GPFD to participate in the mission and contribute technical inputs. The assessment quantifies the
     macroeconomic and fiscal impacts of the Syrian war and Islamic State insurgency on the Kurdistan Region of Iraq
     and the cost of restoring access to and quality of services to pre-crisis levels.23

•    The WBG is leading an initiative in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq to evaluate the socio-economic impact of the regional
     crises on Syrian refugee and host community populations. Data on living conditions, access to services and
     economic opportunities, coping strategies and economic status are to be collected via a specialized household
     survey and a sub-component of the survey will be carried out on a semi-annual basis to continue to monitor and
     adapt support as needed. GPFD facilitated $1.1 million of funding of this activity including $900,000 from a
     Denmark-led EU project and $200,000 from UNHCR. GPFD also provided technical input to the Concept Note,
     design of the sampling strategy and development of the survey questionnaire.

•    A study on “The Economic Effects of the Syrian War and the Spread of the Islamic State on the Levant”, while not
     supported by GPFD, is part of the growing analytics on the economics of forced displacement. The study uses a
     global computable general-equilibrium framework with new detail on six Levant countries - Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
     Lebanon, Syria and Turkey24 - to quantify the direct and indirect economic effects of the Syrian war and the
     advance of the Islamic State on the Levant including labor force and population effects of refugee flows. The study
     shows that refugee hosting countries lose in per capita terms but gain in aggregate terms as the influx of refugees
     boosts their population numbers, increasing demand for goods and services (aggregate consumption and
     investment) and labor supply.

•    GPFD has provided technical advice during the concept stage for the “Iraq Crisis Response” study, which will
     assess the impact of the Islamic State and oil price-related crises on IDPs and households left behind in IS
     controlled areas.

•   In Lebanon and Jordan, GPFD has provided technical input to the Concept Note for a study on the “Welfare and
    Needs of Syrian Refugees”, which will: (i) compare the socio-economic profile of refugees with that of the Syrian
    population before the crisis and with the hosting populations of Jordan and Lebanon; (ii) provide a welfare and
    vulnerability assessment of Syrian refugees including a poverty profile, the socio-economic characteristics of higher
    poverty and where pockets of deep poverty are located; (iii) analyze key drivers of welfare and poverty; and (iv)
    model monetary and non-monetary vulnerability. Data will be drawn from three existing UNHCR databases.

    displacement in Libya and Tunisia and a Concept Note is being prepared.

Somalia Household Survey, SKOPE, and Somaliland Poverty Assessment
In Somalia, three studies that focus on the displacement dimensions are underway and completed. They are:
(i) the Mogadishu Household Survey, (ii) the Somalia Knowledge for Operations and Political Economy Study
(SKOPE), and (iii) the Somaliland Poverty Assessment. The pilot for the Mogadishu Household Survey has
been completed, with fieldwork aligned with the two other Somalia studies for comparability. SKOPE fieldwork

Poverty Assessment, completed by the Poverty GP and AFR, completed an intermediate report in
January 2015 and finalized findings in June 2015. The report found that more than 1 in 3 people in the
settled parts of rural Somaliland and more than 1 in 4 people in urban Somaliland were living in poverty.
Lack of employment and high food prices were cited by households as a larger risk to welfare than
conflict.

South Sudan IDP study
GPFD has provided technical input to the Concept Note and funded an STC to provide input to the
design of an IDP Study in South Sudan that aims to assess the economic needs of IDPs and host
communities in urban areas. The National Bureau of Statistics has yet to finalize the design. The
proposed design of the project is to conduct a multi-sectoral in-depth assessment of IDPs to guide
recovery programs. The main sectors covered will include livelihoods, water & sanitation, infrastructure
as well as intentions and conditions to return. Basic information about education, employment and
general health variables will also be collected. These variables will help to create a general profile of
IDPs to understand their specific needs and how to address them, especially in the medium-term.

Joint WBG-UNHCR Regional Assessment of Social, Economic & Environmental Impact of
Forced Displacement in the Lake Chad Basin
As mentioned above, GPFD has provided support to conduct a joint WBG-UNHCR pre-assessment
mission with the objective of designing and scoping a regional assessment to analyze the development
dimensions of forced displacement in the LCB, including: the extent, causes, character and social and
economic impact of forced displacement in Nigeria and other adjacent countries of the LCB (Niger,
Chad and Cameroon, and possibly CAR). Subsequent to this mission, the UNHCR and WBG teams
have agreed to carry out a joint Regional Assessment of the Social, Economic & Environmental Impact
of Forced Displacement in the LCB aligned with the scope proposed in the mission report. This
assessment will analyze the forced displacement and development nexus; assess the impacts of
refugees on hosting areas and communities; identify ongoing innovative interventions; and propose
entry points and practical operational recommendations. This work will inform dialogue between
national governments and development partners on effective national and regional initiatives,
institutional reforms and public policies that address the development dimensions of forced
displacement.

Guidelines on Political Economy Analysis of Forced Displacement
In 2014, GPFD completed and published a set of guidelines on how to conduct PEA of forced
displacement.25 The note describes how and why to conduct PEA and illustrates how it can contribute to
understanding forced displacement crises with nine case studies: Casamance (Senegal), Colombia,
Cote d’Ivoire, DRC, Liberia, the Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe.

In this study, PEAs are presented as methods of informing policy dialogue and development operations
so that the interests of vulnerable forcibly displaced populations and their hosts are effectively
accommodated in resource allocation decision-making and in poverty alleviation initiatives. The key
elements of forced displacement PEAs include: (i) a review of the historical context and displacement

economic drivers, constraints and opportunities; (iv) needs of the displaced and hosts; (v) existing
policies, government/institutional context and operations; and (vi) recommendations. This work has
guided GPFD’s country-specific and regional analytical work during the reporting period.

Political Economy Analysis on Forced Displacement in MENA
GPFD has drafted a number of PEA on situations of forced displacement in MENA, at the country and
regional level. Thus far, GPFD has drafted and periodically updated these analyses for Libya, Turkey,
Iraq, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and the MENA region in general. These products typically
examine the legal and social context that displacement occurs within as well as the stakeholders
involved in each scenario (the actors, factors, and their interests) and the impacts of population
movements on host communities and governments in these countries and regions.

In addition, in July 2015, GPFD inaugurated a two-phased exercise entitled “The Mashreq Population
Displacement Analysis” that begins with the drafting of a knowledge product identifying and comparing
data on livelihoods and social stability impacts resulting from the Syrian refugee crisis in Iraq, Lebanon,
and Jordan. A second phase of activity is envisioned for the twelve months beginning in November
2015 that will conduct primary research on those factors that have merged as gaps in existing data or
require updating and monitoring to ensure the WBG’s understandings of livelihood and social stability
impacts arising from the regional crisis are current.

GPFD is also a regular contributor to ongoing reassessment of strategic direction in Yemen. Every four
weeks, GPFD provides updated forced displacement profiles for Yemen that detail the scope and
direction of movements, price data, and basic service delivery deficits in key locations based on key
informant data made available to GPFD.

Sustainable Refugee Return
Among the most important thematic analytical pieces commissioned by GPFD during the past 18 months is a report
on the “Sustainable Refugee Return: Triggers, constraints, and lessons on addressing the development challenges of
forced displacement”. The objective of this piece is to identify key conditions that influence the decisions by refugees in
protracted displacement regarding return to their home country or other coping strategies, and how these are affected
both by life in exile and by the situation in the country of origin. Based on a desk study of the existing literature and
eight country case studies, the report examines various displacement and return situations along with the role of
international assistance (including that provided by the WBG) to identify good practice examples and draw general
lessons that can be used to inform both WBG planning and advice to client governments, and the wider community of
development and humanitarian actors together with the governments of refugee origin and refugee hosting countries.

Preliminary findings of this work show that access to livelihood assets, such as land, financial resources and social
networks in the country of origin, together with the prospects for recovering these assets, is a key factor that influences
and facilitates refugee households in their decisions to return, even where they appear to be integrated in the host
country, and even where the overall security and developmental conditions in the country of return are far from
optimal. The analysis also suggests that the extent to which life in exile provides space to pursue livelihoods and build
up assets is significant for the ability to reintegrate and re-establish livelihoods for those who choose to return.
Conversely, the record of assistance to returning refugees is very uneven and generally has been inadequate to
support sustainable reintegration of returnees. The findings of the analysis also suggests that the international
community’s current paradigm of ‘durable solutions’ – voluntary return, local integration in the host country, or
resettlement to a third country – is too limited to capture the complexities and dynamics of refugee decision making
and coping strategies since it rests on the idea that ‘durable solutions’ are found when movements stop, that they are
a finite event. The voluntary return model underplays the fact that refugees are purposive actors who respond to
circumstances in their exile and country of origin through strategies that can include either returning, staying in exile, or
a temporary or permanent combination of the two involving staggered or cyclical return, or temporary or permanent
dispersal of family members between exile and return locations to maximize access to livelihoods, services or other
priorities for family wellbeing. These complexities and the fluidity of displacement and return is something that both the
international aid community and the governments of refugee hosting and origin countries need to recognize in their
strategies to address displacement and return and promote ‘durable solutions’. This report is expected to be
completed and disseminated during FY16.

Africa Forced Displacement Report and Portfolio Review
The objective of this work is to improve responses to the development challenges associated with forced displacement
in Africa by: (i) informing the regional and country assistance strategies of the WBG and other development partners; (ii)
influencing the policies and programs of client governments; and (iii) improving the relevance and effectiveness of WBG
operations in displacement-affected settings. The first phase of this work, which is now complete, summarizes the
demographics of forced displacement in AFR, legal and policy frameworks, and development challenges posed by
displacement. It also includes a detailed review of the WBG’s country strategies and operational portfolio to distill
lessons learned. The second phase of this work is envisaged as part of the flagship for AFR and MENA, mentioned
above, to be undertaken in collaboration with the Chief Economists for the two regions.

Forced Displacement and the WBG’s Twin Goals
Following the commitment of the WBG to the Twin Goals of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity,
GPFD set out the imperatives for addressing the development impacts of forced displacement to achieve these
goals. The articulation of these arguments supported GPFD’s advocacy within the WBG to ensure that
analytical work and operations recognize that: (i) displaced people who are poor also have unique




                                                              51
vulnerabilities that are impediments to achieving higher incomes; (ii) eliminating extreme poverty requires a
strong and sustained focus on the particular development challenges in fragile and conflict-affected settings,
including the significant impacts of forced displacement on the poor; (iii) efforts are required to mitigate the
impact of conflict shocks by supporting the restoration of livelihoods and economic opportunities for both those
displaced by conflict and their hosts; (iv) a healthy social contract should enable displaced people to contribute
to their fullest potential by removing impediments to their participation in the economic, social, and political life
of their host communities; (v) efforts are required to understand and address the dynamics of protracted
displacement and its implications for vulnerability, exclusion and increased poverty levels; (vi) the potential
contribution of displaced people to improved economic growth and poverty reduction should be recognized and
facilitated; and (vii) sustainability of any progress towards the Twin Goals rests, among other things, on the
voice and empowerment of all sub-national population groups, including IDPs, refugees, returnees and host
communities.

Urban Displacement
Recognizing that an increasing number of displaced persons worldwide now live in urban settings, GPFD has
made urban displacement a key thematic priority. This work stream aims to: (i) promote the mainstreaming of
forced displacement into the WBG’s urban sector; and (ii) improve the effectiveness of operational responses
to displacement in urban environments. Analytical work conducted by the program has presented statistics on
the urbanization of forced displacement, identified the opportunities and challenges posed by urban
displacement, described the specific vulnerabilities of the urban displaced, identified the key constraints on
addressing displacement in urban areas, and proposed strategies for addressing the long-term development
impacts of forced displacement in urban areas. This work has also set out the next steps for TTLs, including a
detailed checklist, to integrate displacement into their policy dialogue with Government counterparts, and to
mainstream displacement into analytical and operational work. To disseminate and validate this work, GPFD
brought together a group of senior urban TTLs in the WBG in 2015 responsible for active or pipeline operations
that deal with displacement in urban environments - including Jordan, South Sudan, Lebanon, Georgia and
Azerbaijan - and to facilitate interactions between TTLs on their experiences (see knowledge section below).

Gender in the Great Lakes
In collaboration with the WBG’s Learning on Gender in Conflict and Africa (LOGiCA) Program, GPFD has
authored a study focused on the gender aspects of forced displacement across the Great Lakes Region. This
study aims to provide: (i) an analysis of the gender aspects of forced displacement in the region; and (ii)
operational recommendations going forward on approaches to integrate gender in development responses to
displacement in the region. It also deals with the inclusion of male gender issues, particularly those pertaining
to male youth at-risk, as well as SGBV in the displacement context. During the reporting period, the study team
carried out field studies and focus group discussion in Burundi, DRC and Uganda. The study team, based on
the field research, prepared country-specific reports. In April 2014, a workshop was organized which brought
the team members from the three countries to prepare the final report. The draft final report of the study has
been prepared and shared with LoGiCA.

4. PARTNERSHIPS
Partnership is a key element of the work of GPFD and facilitates the achievement of GPFD/WBG objectives.
Over the last year and a half, GPFD has focused significant attention on further strengthening internal and
external partnerships following the MTR in 2013. The aim of this work has been to develop collaborative and
complementary approaches to addressing the development challenges of conflict induced forced displacement
amongst humanitarian and development partners; strengthen the dialogue on policy options with governments,
regional organizations, NGOs and internationally; identify the best operational responses to address the
development needs of the displaced and affected host and return communities; and secure the essential
internal and external financing for GPFD.



External Partnerships
Affected Governments
GPFD, with WBG country teams, is committed to working closely with affected governments to include
displacement considerations in national development planning and programs. Over the reporting period, GPFD
invited the Ugandan Refugee Commissioner to speak at the WBG FCV Forum during a session on UNHCR’s




                                                    53
Alternatives to Camps policy to share the Uganda experience more widely. In Jordan, GPFD has worked
closely with the Government to develop a comprehensive response to the refugee crisis through the
development of the JESSRP. Government representatives from affected countries were present at the latest
GPFD annual meeting. GPFD is now exploring options to work more closely with the G7+ and OECD
International Dialogue to ensure that the voice of affected countries on the issue of forced displacement is
represented in international fora.

Bilateral Partners
GPFD has maintained strong and productive working partnerships with bilateral agencies focused on
addressing the development dimensions of forced displacement and finding solutions to the growing and
protracted nature of displacement crises. Financial support to GPFD provided by its key partners, including
Switzerland, Denmark and Norway has been essential in enabling GPFD to focus on the objectives of the
program and push the boundaries of forced displacement work within and outside the WBG. The power and
value of these strategic partnerships is evidenced in the ongoing discussions and consultations on approaches
and solutions held during the year with Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, the
US State Department, USAID, BMZ, Turkey and DFID.

GPFD has worked with the Government of Germany on the development of a new policy on forced
displacement and will collaborate on key pieces of analytical work to shape future implementation investments.
GPFD and WBG teams have worked with the Canadian Government on the implementation of the JESSRP
project in Jordan that aims to mitigate the impacts of the Syrian crisis. Staff from GPFD visited the Netherlands
for consultations with the Government as it develops its response to forced displacement and work on the
Regional Development and Protection Program (RDPP) in the Horn of Africa. GPFD was able to share its
knowledge and expertise from the WBG Horn regional initiative. GPFD participated in the WBG strategic
consultations with the Government of Switzerland in 2015 during which displacement was identified as a key
development priority. GPFD continues to work with them on the Sahel, Great Lakes and Horn regions of Africa,
Syria, Colombia and Ukraine. GPFD has worked closely with the Governments of Denmark and Norway on the
design of the Solutions Alliance and to strengthen collaboration on strategic approaches in AFR and MENA.
GPFD has established a working partnership with the Government of Turkey as a new member of the Solutions
Alliance and Host of the WHS. During the year GPFD held consultations with DFID to strengthen collaboration
on analytical and operational work in Africa and MENA and in the run up to the WHS.

GPFD has invested significant time over the past year to work with bilateral agencies on joint analytical work.
For example, GPFD worked closely with Norway on the Sahel and Horn of Africa studies and with DFID on a
joint study on protracted displacement.

Regional Institutions
During the past year, GPFD has expanded its partnership base to improve collaboration with regional
institutions through the three regional initiatives in Africa. GPFD has worked closely with the EU on the
development of the EU policy on displacement and visited Brussels in June for consultations on the challenges
of displacement and implications for the European migration crisis. The New European Agenda for Migration,
agreed in May 2015, sets out the new policy for the EU and contains important references to the development
dimensions of both displacement and migration. GPFD will continue to work closely with DEVCO on the
RDPPs in the Horn, North Africa and the Middle East. Finally, GPFD has continued its collaboration with the
African Union (AU) on the Kampala Convention, with SADC on the Great Lakes Operation for Regional
Cooperation and Capacity Building and with ECOWAS on their regional strategy for security and development
in the Sahel.




                                                       54
UNHCR and other UN Agencies
Over the past year and a half, GPFD has intensified its collaboration with UNHCR on joint analytical and
operational work in the Great Lakes, Sahel, Horn, and LCB regions of Africa, as well as on the Syria crisis.
Financial support from UNCHR has been instrumental in facilitating this cooperation. This has ensured a
greater focus on the importance of addressing the development challenges of forced displacement within both
institutions and is reflected, for example, in the new UNHCR policy on ‘Alternatives to Camps’, as well as in the
WBG’s operational work. The partnership with UNHCR has been given renewed attention with the
establishment of a regular high level strategic dialogue between the UN High Commissioner and WBG
President. The purpose of this dialogue is to further strengthen the partnership on displacement and identify the
priorities to guide future joint analytical, policy and operational work. GPFD and UNHCR teams recently met in
Geneva to take forward their vision for greater strategic and operational collaboration and to explore better
ways to support affected Governments to incorporate a development approach to forced displacement in
national development policies and plans. UNHCR will work closely with the WBG on the proposed flagship on
forced displacement and development. In relation to this, a series of thematic events with practitioners from
both organizations is being prepared to facilitate more effective knowledge exchange on key development
issues and to agree areas for further analytical work.

The WBG/GPFD has actively participated in discussions with UNHCR and other UN agencies, including UNDP,
to promote the issue of forced displacement in the post-2015 debate and the SDGs, particularly Goal 1626. The
development aspects of forced displacement should thus be reflected in the 2016 WHS outcome document.
GPFD was represented at the Geneva ECOSOC in June 2015, organized by EU and IDMC, as well as the UN
Special Rapporteur on IDPs. GPFD also participated in the OCHA-organized seminar, “Coherence in Conflict”
in June 2015 in Copenhagen, which explored ways to strengthen the complementarity of humanitarian and
development assistance to fragile and conflict-affected countries.

The Solutions Alliance
Many of GPFD’s bilateral partners were actively involved in the establishment of the Solutions Alliance in
Copenhagen in April 2014 as a coalition of humanitarian actors, development organizations, affected states,
donor nations, academics, the private sector, civil society and other actors. The Solutions Alliance is chaired by
UNHCR, UNDP, IRC and the Danish and Turkish Governments, and is working to promote and enable the
transition for displaced persons away from dependency towards increased resilience, self-reliance and
development. In particular, the Solutions Alliance aims to: (i) support innovative solutions and concrete
operations in selected displacement situations; (ii) help shape the global policy agenda, including the post-2015
development agenda and the New Deal process, to recognize displacement as a development challenge as
well as a humanitarian and protection issue; and (iii) ensure that a diverse and growing group of partners form
a vibrant network and maximize the impact of their individual efforts.

The Solutions Alliance is now actively pursuing a global advocacy strategy that will support strategic planning
by affected states to address the specific legal, economic, social and political issues relevant to achieving
solutions. GPFD contributed to the design of the Solutions Alliance and is part of its data sharing working group
and its Somalia chapter (see below). GPFD’s work with the Solutions Alliance has established a strong platform
for an exchange of views and sharing of lessons on the development aspects of forced displacement and
facilitates country and global level policy dialogue and joint actions.

The Solutions Alliance Somalia
The Solution Alliance Somalia (SAS) is a Kenya-based forum for data analysis and exchange of information, as
well as creating a joint vision to address Somali displacement within the region. The members of the SAS
include: The WBG, UNHCR, the Danish Embassy (Danida), as well as the Regional Durable Solutions
Secretariat (RDSS), which includes DRC, IRC, and other NGOs working on Somali displacement.

One of the first deliverables of SAS is a regional durable solutions framework that will facilitate the collaboration
between the various organizations working on Somali displacement. The framework takes its starting point in
already existing frameworks, including the IASC framework on durable solutions for IDPs. A team led by IRC
and DRC has been working on developing the first draft of the Framework. In addition to tailoring the ISAC
indicators to fit the current context in Somalia, the team has been documenting the progress made by various
organizations to address durable solutions needs of the displaced in order to set the baseline to measure future
progress. In March 2015, GPFD co-organized the first SAS technical workshop that brought together technical
staff from the various member organizations of the SAS to develop the durable solutions results framework.
GPFD is working closely with members of the SAS to finalize the development of the results framework. In July
2015, GPFD made a brief presentation on the WBG’s involvement in the Solutions Alliance-Somalia at the
2015 UNHCR Annual Consultations with NGOs. GPFD’s presentation highlighted the WBG’s displacement-
related activities in Somalia and the role of the SAS.

NGOs
GPFD has strengthened relationships with NGO partners, such as Save the Children, International Rescue
Committee (IRC), and Search for Common Ground, so as to benefit from these agencies’ specific sector
expertise and close contact with affected people in order to move forward the global debate. GPFD has also
spearheaded the WBG’s collaboration with IRC on forced displacement, particularly by providing support to the
meetings of the WBG President and the President of the IRC in 2015, where they committed to working more
closely on mitigating the impacts of forced displacement in the run up to the WHS.GPFD and Danish Refugee
Council (DRC) have worked closely for several years on issues such as livelihoods, human terrain and the
Syria crisis. GPFD also partners with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) on strategic matters and has done
joint analytical work on land issues for the displaced in Cote d’Ivoire and Casamance.

Research Institutions
Over several years, GPFD worked closely with the Refugee Study Centre (RSC) at Oxford University on the
development of a methodology for economic and social impact assessments, as well as a paper on sustainable
refugee return. GPFD recently participated in the Humanitarian Innovation Conference at Oxford. The ongoing
collaboration with the Joint IDP Profiling Service (JIPS) is exploring how profiling of displaced populations can
be useful to development planning. Current collaboration with the independent research organization REACH
leverages that group’s regional presence, relationships, and expertise in collecting data on forced displacement
issues in MENA. GPFD participated in a workshop organized by RefugePoint on solutions to forced
displacement, held in Massachusetts in April 2015. Finally, collaboration with the Nansen Initiative is examining
the role of analytics and data gathering for the development of a protection agenda for those displaced
because of natural hazards and climate change.




                                                         56
Internal Partnerships
As discussed above GPFD is now housed in the WBG’s FCV Group and is able to ensure that the
displacement challenge is reflected in the WBG’s core work on fragility and conflict. Within the WBG, GPFD
has developed relationships with other CCSAs, for example on jobs and gender, as well as the GPs (GP
SURR, Social Protection, Governance and Poverty) to further strengthen WBG work on forced displacement.

KNOMAD
GPFD continues to work closely with the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development
(KNOMAD), a global hub of knowledge and policy expertise on migration and development issues, which
during the reporting period created a new Thematic Working Group (TWG) on Forced Migration, in 2014, and
nominated GPFD’s Manager, Niels Harild, as its Co-Chair, together with UNHCR’s Deputy High Commissioner,
Alexander Aleinikoff. An expert workshop in September 2014 identified the most important knowledge gaps on
the development impacts of forced migration and related policy issues and helped shape the work program of
the TWG. Based on the workshop results, the TWG will work on questions related to the socio-economic
impacts of forced migration (compared to economic migration), self-reliance of refugees and IDPs, personal
transfers to and from refugees and IDPs, public perceptions, the political economy in host countries, and return
to countries and communities of origin. The objective of the TWG is to develop evidence-based policy options
for protracted situations. In its first year, the TWG focused on the impact of displaced populations on urban
areas, personal transfers sent to and from refugees and IDPs, and an assessment of refugees' right to work.

Internal Evaluation Group (IEG)
IEG’s forthcoming “Evaluation of World Bank Group Activities in Situations of Conflict and Violence” benefited
from consultations with GPFD at its conception stage. The evaluation aims to assess and report on the quality
and results of WBG programs and operations planned and implemented under situations affected by localized
conflict and violence. Since there is no comprehensive list of countries faced with localized conflict and
violence, GPFD was part of consultations to help the evaluation team select the potential case studies and to
ensure that the issue of IDPs and refugees across national borders is properly recognized and discussed in the
evaluation.

One of the focus areas of the evaluation is how the WBG and the UN collaborate in situations of localized
conflict and violence. The program shared its unique experience of forging strong partnership between the
WBG and UN and other partners to deliver development responses to situations of crisis and protracted
displacement, ranging from strategic collaboration to country level engagement.




                                                      57
5. KNOWLEDGE, TRAINING & COMMUNICATION
Given the WBG’s commitment to addressing the challenge of FCV, and the urgency of delivering development
solutions to respond to forced displacement, GPFD’s role in promoting knowledge sharing on operational
approaches and lessons learned has grown significantly. Based on the results that the program has achieved
over the past few years, the team has developed a proactive knowledge management plan, which emphasizes
effective, regular dissemination of analytical and operational achievements. GPFD has also organized several
high profile events during the past 18 months, including the “Alternatives to Camps” discussion during the WBG
FCV Forum; an event with the Brookings Institution on the Great Lakes displacement report; and contributed to
a “Solutions Café” brainstorming session at the WBG 2015 Spring Meetings. GPFD also launched a new
website in June 2015, which will serve as a key platform to share analytical work with bilateral partners and to
communicate effectively with those outside of the WBG. The GPFD knowledge management plan also includes
a series of workshops, to be conducted for WBG task team leaders working on forced displacement. GPFD is
establishing a new Community of Practice (CoP) on the issue, building on new communication platforms
available to the team. To fulfill the expectations of its partners and meet the institutional needs of the WBG,
GPFD hired a dedicated consultant to craft a knowledge management plan. This plan answered key questions
about strategy, technology, processes, and people. Based on priorities for the program, GPFD identified three
broad categories of work: (i) training; (ii) communications; and (iii) dissemination. Progress made in each of
these areas is listed below.



Training
Forced Displacement Training
Towards the end of the reporting period, GPFD held the first of what it expects to become a series of forced
displacement trainings within the WBG. This two-day training supported senior-level TTLs working on
operations that respond to development challenges posed by forced displacement and included modules on: (i)
a toolbox for TTLs; (ii) guidance on how to respond to the development and political challenges or forced
displacement; (iii) discussion on the balance between vulnerability and resilience and costs and benefits; (iv)
presentations of case studies and WBG experience; (v) a peer-to-peer clinic; and (vi) networking and
community-building between TTLs.

32 senior staff attended the training, including a mix of Senior Social Development, Public Sector, Rural
Development, Urban, Operations, Economist, Country Economist, and Social Protection Specialists. Major
outcomes of the training were: (i) demand for spin-off sector and geography-specific trainings; (ii)
overwhelmingly positive feedback, with constructive comments on areas to enhance, such as requests for
longer trainings with step-by-step operationalization tools; (iii) the creation of a draft CoP design, which was
created on-site, with participants. This training was registered on the WBG’s Learning Management System
(LMS), enabling participants to receive credit for the course.

GPFD is in the process of developing a list of indicators for use in the planning of operations on forced
displacement. The preliminary list is being piloted in the preparation of the regional IDA project on forced
displacement in the Great Lakes, as well as in the regional MENA work on SIRI. Various TTLs have deemed
this list useful in the development of results frameworks and analytical work, and the program will continue to
further develop this list.




                                                      58
Core Course Displacement Modules
The core course is a regular training opportunity hosted by the FCV group for WBG staff as well as key external
participants. The FCV CCSA presents a number of modules, and has recently included a dedicated module on
forced displacement, developed by GPFD. This module provides participants with an overview of the
development challenges of forced displacement (at the sub-national, national and regional levels) and the
range of programming that has responded to the needs of the displaced and affected host communities. GPFD
presented the forced displacement modules at two core courses, one in March 2015 in Washington, DC, and a
second one in June 2015 in Istanbul, Turkey. The forced displacement module has been well received by
participants, as measured by high marks and positive participant responses in course evaluations.

GSURR Workshop on Urbanization
As part of a series of TTL workshops, GPFD hosted a session within the WBG GSURR Learning Forum
entitled “Forced Displacement and Urbanization”. This session provided a real-time exchange among TTLs on
design features of developed or ongoing operations in urban areas with significant forced displacement.
Projects in the following countries were discussed: Lebanon, Jordan, South Sudan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and
Afghanistan. Following a brief introduction of each program’s objectives, the TTLs exchanged views on
challenges, achievements, and opportunities. Two draft documents were presented and discussed at the event,
namely: (i) the urban TTL checklist; and (ii) the note on urban forced displacement.



Communications
GPFD Website
Responding to a call from bilateral
partners for an improved and easily
accessible GPFD website at the
annual meeting in February 2014,
the program has made significant
efforts to launch a new website
before the end of the reporting
period. This goal was achieved,
when the new website was launched
on June 9, 2015. The site is
integrated into the mainframe of the
WBG, linked to its location in the
CCSA on FCV, and is available at:
www.worldbank.org/forceddisplacem
ent. The purpose of the site is to be
the online focal point for the WBG's work on Forced Displacement, a global issue that is a priority for the
Fragility, Conflict, and Violence CCSA. In addition, the website will clearly and transparently present program
knowledge and information to partners engaged with the program, country client governments, donors, WBG
staff, and the general public. The website is organized according to the four work streams of the program,
namely: operational support, analytical work, partnerships, and knowledge. The website will also function as
the main avenue for dissemination of the program's analytical and operational work.




                                                       59
Community of Practice
Following discussions on how best to mainstream the forced displacement agenda in the WBG, GPFD is in the
process of establishing a CoP which will be consolidated and expanded in the coming fiscal year. This idea
grew from the forced displacement training, as well as TTLs and managers across the WBG, who are calling
for a mechanism to remain engaged with GPFD and share lessons learned. The ideas evolved during a
brainstorming session on topics, tools, and methods undertaken during the training for WBG staff. GPFD will
consider developing a regular newsletter as a priority for the CoP.



Dissemination
GPFD hosted several public events in the past year and a half to disseminate analytical and operational work.
The Urban Forced Displacement Note and TTL Checklist were disseminated internally through the GSURR
Forum mentioned above. GPFD also created audio recordings and packets of materials for a number of events
and disseminated those materials to participants and attendees, as well as wider staff. Important dissemination
events are below.

FCV Forum
The WBG FCV Forum is a yearly forum
that highlights the work of the FCV
CCSA and its partners. On February 11,
2015, GPFD hosted a two-session panel
called “Alternatives to Camps”, the
purpose of which was to: (i) profile the
new UNHCR policy on “Alternatives to
Camps”;      (ii) highlight  Uganda’s
experience and the work of GPFD in
establishing development responses to

outside the WBG.

In addition, GPFD supported a two-session panel in the FCV Forum, entitled: “Enhancing World Bank
Engagement in MENA in a Context of Regional Transformation, Conflict and Uncertainty”. In the first of the
MENA-focused sessions, panelists, including GPFD Manager, examined the Arab world’s shifting political
landscape, the region’s drivers of transition and conflict, its impacts and the challenges/opportunities for longer-
term stability and development. The second session focused on the rise of sectarian divisions and ethnic
conflicts, recognizing the impact of these trends on the transition process and on the region’s stability. This

supporting transitional governance and institutional and social resilience against external shocks and sectarian
violence.

Inclusive and Sustainable Cities Event
On March 2, 2015, GPFD manager Niels Harild presented a TED-style talk on “Forced Displacement and the Urban
Sector” at the Plenary Session of the three-day Inclusive and Sustainable Cities event, hosted by GSURR. The event
reflected the WBG’s newly defined multi-dimensional approach to promote inclusive cities. The new approach calls for
higher attention to inclusion in urban areas and it recognizes the need to move away from single-sector - ‘brick and
mortar’ interventions to a multi-dimensional strategy that encompasses spatial, social and economic aspects. The talk,
focused on the message that urban displacement is increasingly being recognized as a long-term development issue.
The presentation highlighted the issues of displacement in an urban context including exclusion and vulnerabilities
faced     by     displaced
population in urban areas.
He also discussed the key
challenges and approaches
to address these issues
were also discussed.

GPFD supported the FCV session titled “How Can We Turn Displacement into an Opportunity to Build
Resilience and Stability?” Held in the WBG, the session gathered practitioners from around the world. Led by
Betty Bigombe, Sr. Director of the FCV CCSA, Ferid Belhaj, Country Director for the Middle East region, and
Ede Jorge Ijjasz-Vasquez, Sr. Director of GSURR, the session highlighted the need for in-depth exchanges
between teams who are working on forced displacement in the same regions. Solutions Café sessions were
recorded and made available to participants after the event.

Great Lakes Report Dissemination and Collaboration with Brookings
On April 21, 2015 the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement and GPFD hosted a talk at Brookings
on assistance and protection conditions for refugees, IDPs, returnees, and host communities in the Great
Lakes. Speakers Stacey White, author of the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement report “Now
What? The International Response to Internal Displacement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” as well
as WBG staff and contributors to the GPFD report, “Forced Displacement in the Great Lakes Region, Joanna

de Berry and Cordelia Chesnutt, examined how to pursue a development response to forced displacement
within existing regional political frameworks, processes, and bodies such as the AU, and the UN Special Envoy
for the Great Lakes region. Attended by over 80 audience members, Elizabeth Ferris, senior fellow and co-
director of the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement, moderated the event and an interactive Q&A
after speakers’ comments. Audio and transcript of this session are available on the Brookings IDP-LSE Project
on Internal Displacement website. The GPFD report was subsequently translated and printed in French and
disseminated to local authorities in DRC, in both Goma and Kinshasa. This event was one among a series of
knowledge events in which GPFD and Brookings worked together to highlight the development dimensions of
forced displacement. Niels Harild participated in the event, “Internal Displacement: Lessons Learned after 20
years and challenges ahead”,27 which marked the culmination of Brookings’ work on this topic.

6. IMPACTS AND RESULTS
The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of GPFD’s impacts and results. The main objective of
GPFD’s work is to achieve positive changes for vulnerable displaced populations and their host communities,
which often requires a shift in government policy. GPFD acts as a catalyst, encouraging policy dialogue and
operational change with WBG project teams and client governments. The full impact of GPFD’s work will be
evident once large-scale impact evaluations are conducted of the development projects GPFD has influenced.
In the interim, the program’s results thus far are discussed below.

The results chain above (figure 10) shows the different levels of work GPFD’s work. GPFD focuses on four key
results areas: analytical work, operational support, partnerships, and knowledge, in order to influence CMUs,
TTLs, GPs and CCSAs. However, GPFD does not operate in a vacuum. The program continually engages with
partners within and outside the WBG. This affects its modus operandi by bringing shared experiences and
lessons learned and vice versa through regular interaction. Therefore, judging the impacts and results of
GPFD’s work is most accurately be done at the meta-level, by determining to what extent the program has
managed to influence the design of WBG projects or influence policy change with Governments. The 2013
MTR was the first step in assessing the program’s impact.



MTR Findings
It found GPFD to be on track in meeting its dual objectives of raising WBG awareness of the development impacts of
displacement and in improving the WBG's contribution to an enhanced development response. The MTR gave a
positive review of the Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) services and operational support provided to CMUs
and Sector teams working on countries impacted by forced displacement. The role of GPFD in contributing to the global
Solutions Alliance and debates on international policies on forced displacement and development was acknowledged.
The MTR was impressed by the positive achievements in relation to the WBG response to Syria crisis and the work




                                                         63
undertaken to support the AFR regional initiatives following the visits of the UN Secretary General and WBG President.
Given the growing international profile of forced displacement and the increased demand for GPFD services, the MTR
recommended a significant expansion of GPFD to assist the WBG to meet this demand.



Major Impacts of GPFD’s Activities
One of GPFD’s biggest achievements during the reporting period is the allocation of $250 million in regional IDA funds
to the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa for development operations to address forced displacement. GPFD has
successfully leveraged donor resources by: (i) supporting the drafting of the regional initiatives; (ii) leading
analytical work in partnership with UNHCR; (iii) mainstreaming recommendations from these studies to WBG
operations, and (iv) aiding the preparation of regional operations in the Great Lakes and the Horn.

GPFD has provided multifaceted support to the WBG’s analytical and operational work in MENA as a result of
the Syria crisis, and in the ECA region in relation to the Ukraine crisis. In MENA, this has influenced the
development of: (i) operations to address forced displacement in the region; (ii) the design of the new MENA
strategy, with a focus on forced displacement; and (iii) agreement between the Chief Economists’ offices in
both the MENA and AFR regions on a major flagship AAA on the economics and operational elements of
forced displacement.

Finally, GPFD has had significant impact at the policy level, as evidenced by the agreement by the WBG President and
UN High Commissioner for Refugees to have regular high-level consultations and to expand this partnership further.
Moving forward, GPFD will continue to promote forced displacement as a central issue in the WBG’s engagement in
global policy dialogues, such as the WHS and the post-2015 debates.



Geographical distribution
Globally, during the reporting period, GPFD has been active in 40 countries, shown in figure 11.

                                                          share of the program’s efforts (17.5%), while ECA also
                                                          figures prominently (10%), due to longstanding
                                                          activities in Azerbaijan and Georgia, coupled with
                                                          crises in Turkey and Ukraine. GPFD has added
                                                          activities in EAP, engaging with country teams in
                                                          Indonesia and Myanmar, in addition to existing
                                                          collaboration in the Philippines. Emerging analytical
                                                          work on Afghanistan will ensure that GPFD’s focus on
                                                          SAR will grow in the coming fiscal year, and the
                                                          program will remain committed to supporting colleagues
                                                          in LAC, mainly on the IDP situation in Colombia28.

Policies on Forced Displacement
In its first few years, GPFD focused on awareness raising and positioning forced displacement in the analysis
and operations of the WBG and its partners. Building on the program’s experience, and with increased support
from across the WBG, GPFD is now even better positioned to achieve its objective of influencing global,
regional and national development policies to better reflect the needs of displaced populations and their host
communities.

In MENA, GPFD is supporting the Center for Mediterranean Integration (CMI) in Marseille in the planning and
development of a conference of high-level policymakers to address the Syrian refugee crisis in September
2015. Another example of GPFD engagement at the policy level was the program’s contribution to a revised
ECOWAS strategy for security and development in the Sahel in 2013.

The regional operations in the Great Lakes and the Horn of Africa are platforms for a more substantive policy-
dialogue on forced displacement at both national and regional level. In Ethiopia, the engagement with the
Government through the WBG’s regional HOA initiative has inspired a different Government approach to the
refugee challenge in the country. The regional initiatives, and associated operations, are supporting a paradigm
shift amongst governments and regional institutions from seeing forced displacement as only a humanitarian
concern to an issue that has development, political, and security dimensions.

                                                  In Uganda, GPFD together with GSURR has worked closely with
                                                 the Government to showcase its progressive policies towards
                                                 hosting refugees. During the FCV Forum in February 2015, the
                                                 Ugandan Refugee Commissioner spoke at a panel organized by
                                                 GPFD to share experiences and lessons learned. In particular, the
                                                 protracted refugee presence in Uganda has led the Government
                                                 to move from a predominantly humanitarian response to
                                                 increasingly including forced displacement in national
                                                 development plans. This has allowed refugees to live in open
                                                 settlements and made it possible for refugees to take part in and
                                                 contribute to the local economy. The photo above demonstrates
                                                 the vision of the Office of the Prime Minister, Department of
                                                 Refugees, which seeks to empower refugees and host
                                                 communities with opportunities to live a better life.

                                                 GPFD has also supported the Government of Sudan in
                                                 dealing with the political challenge of forced displacement.
                                                 Here, displacement is a major focus of the Interim Poverty
                                                 Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and displacement is
                                                 among the Government’s four key development priorities
                                                 alongside growth and employment, governance and human
                                                 resources. This priority is mirrored by the WBG engagement

the transition to a new Sudan and; (ii) promoting inclusive growth and poverty reduction. A main theme
for the second pillar is “supporting reintegration through area-based development approaches targeting
livelihood promotion and employment creation for displaced populations and host communities”. GPFD
was closely involved with the drafting of these documents and helped ensure that forced displacement
was made a critical priority in the PRSP and ISN.



High Level WBG Attention

opportunity for GPFD and UNHCR to jointly produce analytical work with recommendations that have
influenced the design of operations within the WBG. And in October 2014, the leaders visited the HOA,
including spending time in a refugee camp, highlighting the development challenges of displacement. These
joint visits have demonstrated the sense of political commitment to forced displacement, underlining the critical
role of the UN in the humanitarian field, while allowing the WBG to take up more of a role on the development
side.

Another way in which senior WBG management have demonstrated their attention and commitment to the
issue was when the WBG President and UNHCR High Commissioner recently had a bilateral discussion of the
challenge of forced displacement. This discussion took place as a result of the joint efforts of GPFD and
UNHCR colleagues and reflected the recognition of both organizations that the issue requires a coordinated
humanitarian and development approach. It was agreed that moving forward, regular high level consultations
would be held to monitor progress on this important partnership. When the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, Antonio Guterres, visited Kenya and Somalia in May 2015, he expressed the need to ‘improve
socio-economic conditions for the benefit of returning refugees and internally displaced Somalis, as well as
local communities’.29 In May 2015, after her visit to the Great Lakes region, WBG Managing Director and Chief
Operating Officer Sri Mulyani Indrawati blogged about the WBG support of the Great Lakes Regional Initiative
and the development issues facing the forcibly displaced (see: “The Difference between Peace and Lasting
Peace is Regional Integration”, Annex 3).



Better dissemination and communication
A major achievement of the program during the reporting period has been the improved dissemination
and communication to partners of its analytical achievements. Following strong recommendations from its
partners at the annual GPFD meeting in Copenhagen in February 2014, GPFD has made a concerted effort in
this area, resulting most importantly in the launching of its website in June 2015. In addition, the program held a
series of high profile knowledge dissemination events within and outside of the WBG (see knowledge section).
Moving forward, GPFD will seek to further strengthen this area of its work to ensure the effective use of its
analytical and operational results.



Remaining Challenges
In spite of the explosive numbers of forcibly displaced persons worldwide and the increased high level attention
to the issue, challenges remain in achieving the paradigm shift from looking at forced displacement mainly as a
humanitarian concern to one that has both developmental, security, political and economic aspects. The
political sensitivity of forced displacement can still limit the willingness of policymakers to discuss the issue from
a development perspective, as this might signal an acceptance of long-term, protracted displacement.
Providing livelihood opportunities to refugees is particularly complex in countries faced with economic hardship.
GPFD uses the recommendations emanating from its analytical work, as well as global operational lessons
learned, as the basis for conversations with WBG country teams and external partners, to increase awareness
of both the negative and positive impacts of displacement.

7. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
During the first six years of GPFD’s existence, donor contributions totaled $7,981,775, coming from Denmark
($4,166,414), Norway ($2,270,386), Switzerland ($1,144,975) and UNHCR ($400,000). In addition, GPFD
secured $ 1,763,338 in support from bank sources (trust funds and regular budget), bringing the total income of
the program to $ 9,745,113. Expenditure for the first six years, ending June 2015, totaled $ 7,925,171. The
remaining balance of some $ 1.8 million is allocated or earmarked for specific activities for FY16. This amount
is insufficient to cover existing and projected demand for the coming 3 years.

GPFD’s plan and budget are appropriately simple and flexible to facilitate ongoing prioritization in response to
shifting needs. The demand from WBG teams and external partners for support from the GPFD has continued
to increase as awareness of the program expands and as the global level of forced displacement increases. Its
lean structure and simple procedures makes it cost-effective. Assumptions about demand can only be
indicative as developments in situations of conflict and fragility are inherently unpredictable, and the demand
could become much higher if new situations of conflict and sub national fragility emerge or if opportunities arise
to address protracted displacement. As most of the existing forced displacement is protracted with extensive
development needs, the demand is likely to increase.

The successes that GPFD has achieved so far is largely dependent on the financial and technical support of its
bilateral partners. While progress has been made in raising awareness of the issue and strengthening the WBG
contribution to an enhanced development response, there is still much more to do. A significant scale up of
financial and human resources is necessary for the GPFD to meet the growing demand by WBG country and
task teams for the provision of advice, and technical and analytical support in both protracted situations and in
newly emerging crises. The proposed scaled up GPFD work program for the next three years to meet the
increased demand from a growing number of countries globally affected by forced displacement and to deliver
on the program objectives and strategic priorities for FY16-18 is projected to be $12 million, requiring an
additional $10.5 million funding from internal and external sources. This would enable GPFD to maintain its
responsiveness, flexibility and reach and continue to provide high quality analytical and operational work.

8. MOVING FORWARD
Over the past six years, the WBG, through the GPFD, has been working to ensure that the development
dimensions of forced displacement are incorporated into WBG analysis, country and regional strategies, and
operations. It is clear that it will not be possible to achieve the WBG twin goals of ending extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity without the inclusion of displaced persons in the WBG core work particularly in
countries impacted by FCV. Moving forward, GPFD plans to significantly scale up its work program to meet
and address the growing demand for work on forced displacement across the WBG and internationally.

The original GPFD objectives of increasing WBG awareness of the development impact of forced
displacement; and improving the WBG’s contribution to an enhanced development response remain as
relevant as ever. Over the next three years, GPFD will focus on mainstreaming displacement considerations in
WBG policies, strategies and programs as a central aspect of the WBG’s CEM and continue to contribute to the
global debates on displacement policy in order to further strengthen the development response of the
international community.

Operational support
The strategic objective of GPFD’s operational support is to provide WBG regional and country teams with the
necessary advisory, analytical, and operational support to address forced displacement within programs and
projects and to document and share operational evidence and experience.

Moving forward, GPFD will continue to work on the regional initiatives in Africa, through: (i) continued policy
dialogue with government counterparts and development partners to identify policy, regulatory and operational
priorities to assist displaced populations and affected host and return communities; (ii) support for analytical
work to assess population displacement dynamics in a regional context including the prospects and options for
durable solutions, and (iii) the mainstreaming of displacement issues into existing and new development
operations at both national and regional level.

In MENA, GPFD will further strengthen its collaboration with country teams and governments to both
understand and mitigate the impact of the Syrian displacement crisis. This includes regular updates of context
analysis, technical advices to task teams, specific analytical work, and operationally focused training
workshops for staff and governments. GPFD’s collaboration with WBG economists undertaking assessments of
the social and economic impact of displacement in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey will remain a key priority.
As the Syrian and Iraq displacement crises continue to evolve, GPFD will work closely with the country teams
to build on existing work and to respond to new demands.

In terms of country-specific engagements, experience to date shows that early, direct and sustained work with
operational teams based on analysis (for example the recent work in Ukraine) is an effective way to incorporate
a displacement lens in the development of operations and to contribute to policy dialogue. GPFD will continue
to focus on responding, where appropriate, to the existing and emerging demands in the countries facing
displacement challenges and ensure that there is timely and sustained delivery of technical and financial
support to respond to emerging client demands in crisis situations as and when opportunities arise in situations
of protracted displacement. Initially this will include continued support for the following priority countries:
Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, CAR, Georgia, Nigeria, Philippines, and West Bank and Gaza.



Analytical work
GPFD will, with internal and external partners, continue to support and lead the development of high quality analytical
work on forced displacement with internal and external partners with the aim of supporting both national and
international policy dialogue on the development dimensions of forced displacement and to identify the most
appropriate development responses. This will include a major flagship report on forced displacement, bringing together
the knowledge and lessons from analytical and operational work to date on the economic, fiscal and social impacts.

The flagship report will be led by GPFD and undertaken in close collaboration with the offices of the Chief Economists of
the MENA and AFR region, building on the experience of the Syria crisis and displacement challenges in the Sahel,
Great Lakes and Horn regions of Africa. The report will aim to: (i) inform policy dialogue with governments and the
WBG’s future work on forced displacement; (ii) build on operational experiences and completed and ongoing
impact assessments; (iii) develop an economic analysis of the problem, and make specific recommendations on
possible interventions, policy reforms, and priorities; (iv) identify critical knowledge gaps where further research is
needed; (v) highlight forced displacement as a development issue (and not merely as a humanitarian issue); and (vi)
inform the WBG’s interventions on this issue at the WHS and preliminary discussion on the key issues for IDA 18.




                                                           70
GPFD will also develop a programmatic series on cross-Mediterranean migration and displacement, now a critical
concern to key European partners. The aim will be to better understand the drivers of migration in the countries of origin
and who has been impacted. GPFD will work closely with colleagues across the WBG to examine issues of financing
for refugees and displaced persons as a ‘global public good’ and explore the demand for and feasibility of new financing
instruments or approaches.

GPFD will work with country and regional teams on a series of impact assessments for specific policies or interventions
to inform policy dialogue and where relevant, identify a series of thematic and sector specific policy and guidance notes
to address key and emerging issues for example; urban displacement, gender and displacement, trauma and
displacement, sustainable refugee return, service delivery, governance and voice, resilience and forced displacement
and other thematic issues according to demand. GPFD will collaborate closely with relevant GPs, CCSAs, and CMUs to
complete ongoing analytical work and ensure a robust program of knowledge dissemination and use. Finally, GPFD will
complete analytical work on global policies and applications of refugees’ ability to work and move, as requested by the
Mashreq CMU.



Partnerships
GPFD will continue to actively engage in critical partnerships on displacement and in the Solutions Alliance to
establish a more harmonized approach to the development aspects of displacement. With colleagues in the
FCV Group, and subject to additional resources, GPFD will explore opportunities to work more closely with the
g7+, OECD International Dialogue, and those working on the post MDG 2015 process (including the Secretary
General’s working group on humanitarian financing) to ensure that forced displacement is well reflected in the
post-2015 agenda and the outcome document of the WHS and that there is sufficient global financing to meet
the challenges of displacement both in crisis and protracted situations. GPFD will organize a ‘knowledge forum’
on forced displacement with key partners to provide a formalized platform for academics, policy makers and
practitioners to exchange. Internally, GPFD will continue to raise awareness of the development aspects of
forced displacement within the WBG. GPFD will continue regular dialogue with Global Practices, CCSA’s,
regions and CMUs and will work with identified focal points across the WBG to ensure that lessons learned
from analytical and operational experience are fed into WBG policy.



Knowledge
In the next phase of the program, GPFD will seek to document analytical and operational evidence and to
ensure knowledge and awareness on forced displacement is widely available and that analytical work is
disseminated and used across the WBG. GPFD will draw on the growing body of evidence to strengthen
country level dialogue and action on policies and interventions, knowledge dissemination, and monitoring and
evaluation for greater results and impact. For example, following the expression of interest from clients in the
MENA region GPFD will work with the region to support the development of peer to peer workshops with
governments on forced displacement and development. GPFD will concentrate additional resources on the
development of core training for key staff on the issue of forced displacement through a series of specialist
workshops and hands on training for staff and TTLs. GPFD will also further strengthen its module on forced
displacement in the FCV Group Core Course. The team will draw up a schedule of targeted dissemination
events, further develop the website and publicize and disseminate key analytical work.

CONCLUSION
There is now growing recognition of the immense global development challenges and opportunities that conflict
induced forced displacement raises, and the issue is receiving prominence on the international agenda. Unless
it is addressed, it will pose a real threat to the achievement of the new SDGs and the WBG’s goal of reducing
extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity. There is strong commitment from the WBG to this agenda.
The WBG can use its convening power, analytical, technical and operational strengths to work closely with
affected governments to address the development needs of IDPs, refugees, returnees, and host communities
alongside other development, humanitarian, political and security actors. Building on the momentum over the
past 18 months, GPFD will seek additional resources to significantly scale up its activities, both within and
outside the WBG. GPFD is well positioned to play a catalytic and transformative role in enhancing the
development response to forced displacement challenges at the policy and operational level.

ANNEX 3: SRI MULYANI’S OP-ED ON
         REGIONAL INTEGRATION30
Conflict doesn’t respect borders. No one knows this better than the people in Africa’s Great Lakes region where
instability has been fueled in part by a lack of economic opportunity.

For the Great Lakes Region, where I will visit next week, the cost of conflict has been extraordinary. Among the
11.5 million people in the Eastern Congo, are 2 million children who don’t get an education because their
schools have been destroyed; over 3.5 million people have died since 1998 as a direct consequence of conflict.
The 2013 peace framework signed by 11 nations ushered in a new era for peace and reconstruction. But
pockets of violence persist.

The wider region remains host to over five million people who have fled their homes due to ongoing insecurity.

The Great Lakes countries share similar challenges such as communal violence, lack of access to land, limited
social cohesion and competition over resources. These challenges must be tackled by individual countries, but
more often than not, they require collective action. Regional approaches are critical to leverage national efforts.

Borders can be both a factor and a feature of conflict. I firmly believe that they can also be part of the solution.
They provide security and facilitate trade between countries. To borrow the words of Mexican-American poet
Gina Valdés: “For every border, there is also a bridge.”

In this region, as elsewhere, regional integration is the key to lasting peace and to a more prosperous future.
Peace accords are critical. They end conflict but they don’t always bring lasting peace. It takes livelihoods, jobs,
and trust in the future that can bring countries closer together and making it worthwhile to invest in peace. We
all know that there won’t be development without peace nor can there be peace without development.

The pay offs of cooperation and integration are significant. Take for example the East African Community.
Since 1993, it has been the second-fastest growing economic bloc in the world, after ASEAN, the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations. It has doubled its GDP to $79 billion, and intra-community trade is now more
important than trade with Europe or the rest of Africa.

In my previous capacity as Finance Minister of Indonesia, a country where the transition toward democracy and
a unified society took more than a decade —and a founding member of ASEAN—, I have experienced firsthand
the positive impact of regional integration on creating sound and predictable economic policies, resulting in high
economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction. ASEAN and East Asia are now the world’s most vibrant
region with low barriers to trade and investment, allowing goods and people to move relatively freely.

The WBG, one of the Great Lakes region’s most important development partners, has an important role to play
in supporting regional peace and stability through programs that improve livelihoods in border areas, facilitate
cross-border trade and strengthen economic interdependence through connective infrastructure.

For many communities, key markets are situated across the border and informal cross-border trade plays a
huge role in linking small producers to markets. Consider this: between 2012 and 2014, informal exports from
Rwanda to neighboring countries including Burundi, DRC, Tanzania and Uganda, totaled nearly $100 million.

Making trade more user-friendly and safe is essential. A study looking at cross-border trade between the DRC
and Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda showed that women, who represent the majority of small informal traders,
are often victims of harassment and physical violence and are forced to pay bribes. For the millions of women
and their families whose livelihoods depend on cross-border trade, regional integration shouldn’t be an abstract
concept, nor a dangerous undertaking. Women are the key to boosting trade and prosperity, and their ability to
do so safely is paramount.

The prospects for international trade to drive growth and fight poverty are enormous and go far beyond DRC
and its neighbors. In Eastern DRC rehabilitating the Goma Airport will create a vital transport hub to reconnect
the people of the region to the rest of the country, stimulate private sector development, and enable trade to
resume. Evidence also suggests that insecurity is decreasing in areas where roads have been rehabilitated.
This is why all countries should have a common interest in developing regional infrastructure.

The WBG launched the Great Lakes Initiative in 2013 together with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. We
are providing about $1.3 billion for regional initiatives that expand hydropower; transport and information
technology; trade; health services; and address sexual and gender-based violence and forced displacement.

We are also supporting investments in energy which will significantly increase access to electricity Rwanda,
DRC, and Burundi.

Through the Great Lakes initiative we have refocused our work around prevention and response not just in one
country, but among neighbors. We hope to deliver a major contribution to the lasting peace and development of
this region that has suffered so much from conflict and has so much to gain from peace.
