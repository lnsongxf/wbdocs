Flood Risk Assessment for the Ganges Basin in South Asia


Foreword
The Ganges basin is one of the largest river basins in the world. It lies in parts of India,    Country     Area occupied by Ganges Basin in km
                                                                                                                                                   2

Nepal, China, and Bangladesh and drains a total area of about 984,076 sq. km in the
four countries. The basin lies between latitudes 22.45° N and 31.47° N and longitudes          India                                     790,223
                                                                                               Nepal                                     147,706

                                                                                               China                                      39,133

                                                                                               Total                                     984,076
In view of the regular recurrence of losses due to floods in different parts of the basin, a
comprehensive study for the entire Ganges system was considered essential
to understand the geographical impacts of floods on various sectors (viz.
residential, commercial, industrial, essential facilities, infrastructure, and
agriculture) exposed in the area falling within the Ganges Basin. This would
enhance the knowledge base for better understanding the socio-economic
impacts of flooding in the basin and subsequently help the stake
holders/decision makers for better mitigation planning. Keeping this need in
mind, the World Bank initiated a River Basin Approach to develop a shared
knowledge base and analytical framework for flood risk assessment and
contracted RMSI as consultant to complete this assignment.
The Ganges Basin Risk Atlas is a compilation of all the key risk maps and
tables developed as part of this risk assessment study. It, therefore, provides
a valuable resource for all stakeholders involved in various aspects of
basin/water resource management, and risk mitigation planning and policy
formulation etc. to identify the priority areas and asset (exposure) types in the
basin and sub-basins, which are more vulnerable to losses due to floods.
The Risk Atlas is a part of the Final Report submitted to the World Bank under
the Risk Assessment Study for the Ganges Basin, and should be read and
interpreted in context of the Final Report only. The Atlas presents the risk
maps and accompanying tables at two levels. Section One provides basin-level risks for various exposure types and the considered return
period flood events (2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years). Section Two provides sub basin-level risks covering all the 18 sub-basins of the Ganges
Basin. The accompanying tables in section two also present the risk findings on administrative jurisdiction-levels for India, Nepal, and
Bangladesh.
