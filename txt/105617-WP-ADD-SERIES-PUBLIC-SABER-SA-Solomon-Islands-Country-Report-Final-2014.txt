   Key Policy Areas for Student Assessment                                                                 Status
   1. Classroom Assessment
      In the Solomon Islands, several official documents are used to inform and guide classroom
      assessment. For example, the “Solomon Islands Policy Statement and Guidelines for
      Learners’ Assessment in Schools” includes guidelines for classroom assessment and its use.
      In general, classroom assessment practices are viewed as being of moderate quality. At the
      same time, there are few resources available to teachers for conducting classroom
      assessment activities, and limited formal mechanisms, such as pre- and in-service teacher
      training options, to ensure that teachers develop competencies in classroom assessment.

   2. Examinations
      The Solomon Islands National Form Six Certificate examination is administered annually to
      Year 12 students in English, Mathematics, and optional subjects. There is regular funding
      for the examination, allocated at the discretion of the government and partners. Students
      are also required to pay a fee to take the examination. The National Examinations and
      Standards Unit (NESU) has been in charge of the examination since 2012. While NESU has
      up-to-date computers and top-level security, it does not have adequate storage facilities,
      computer servers, or communication tools. Some formal mechanisms are in place to
      ensure the quality of the examination, including a standardized manual that provides
      instructions for examination administration and data processing.

   3. National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA)
      The Solomon Islands Standardized Tests of Achievement (SISTA) was first introduced in
      2003, and has been implemented every three years since then to all students in Years 4
      and 6. Funding for SISTA comes from internal sources as well as donor agencies. SISTA is
      directly based on the national curriculum and well-aligned with official learning goals.
      While there is a common understanding that the assessment will take place every three
      years, there is no formal policy document that authorizes SISTA. In addition, the team
      working on the assessment is inadequately staffed.

   4. International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA)
      In 2012, the Solomon Islands took part for the first time in the Pacific Islands Literacy and
      Numeracy Assessment (PILNA). 14 countries in the Pacific region participated. There were
      minimal quality problems with the administration of PILNA in the Solomon Islands. The
      country complied with all required technical standards; therefore, it is expected that the
      country’s results will be presented in the main section of the final international report.

The key considerations when evaluating a student
assessment system are the individual and combined
quality of assessment activities in terms of the adequacy
of the information generated to support decision
making. There are three main drivers of information
quality in an assessment system: enabling context,
system alignment, and assessment quality.


Enabling context refers to the broader context in which
the assessment activity takes place and the extent to

Programme and SPBEA, and covered some core                     Islands. For example, organize workshops or
activities, including implementation of PILNA and              meetings on using PILNA databases, which are
processing and analyzing data collected from its               available to staff directly involved in implementing
administration. Funding also covered attendance at             PILNA, assessment specialists, university teachers,
international meetings.                                        students, and other educators.

In order to implement PILNA, a national coordinator was
appointed. A school coordinator was identified to
manage the administration at the school level for
selected schools, and test supervisors (teachers)
administered the assessment at the classroom level in
the selected schools. For each assessment area - literacy
and numeracy - a panel was responsible for marking the
assessment results. Although the 2012 PILNA
administration was the first time that the PILNA team
was in charge of an ILSA, there were no quality problems
identified with the carrying out of PILNA in the Solomon
Islands.

The NESU held presentations on PILNA for ILSA team
members and assessment specialists. Key personnel also
participated in workshops organized by SPBEA for all
PILNA-participating countries. In addition, SPBEA
provided in-country training to scorers.

the rubrics:


    x   Latent = 1 score point
    x   Emerging = 2 score points
    x   Established = 3 score points
    x   Advanced = 4 score points

3. The score for each quality driver is computed by
aggregating the scores for each of its constituent
dimensions. For example:


The quality driver, ‘Enabling Context,’ in the case of ILSA,
has 3 dimensions on which a hypothetical country
receives the following scores: Dimension A = 2 points;
Dimension B = 2 points; Dimension C = 3 points. The
hypothetical country’s overall score for this quality driver
would be: (2+2+3)/3 = 2.33


4. A preliminary level of development is assigned to each
quality driver.


5. The preliminary development level is validated using
expert judgment in cooperation with the country team
and The World Bank Task Team Leader.


For scores that allow a margin of discretion (i.e., to
choose between two levels of development), a final
decision has to be made based on expert judgment. For
example, the aforementioned hypothetical country has
an ‘Enabling Context’ score of 2.33, corresponding to a
preliminary level of development of ‘Emerging or
Established.’ Based on qualitative information not
captured in the rubric, along with expert judgment, the
country team chooses ‘Emerging’ as the most
appropriate level.

Classroom Assessment: Development-level rating justifications

1. In Solomon Islands, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development (MEHRD) is the authorizing body for all documents providing guidelines for
classroom assessment. There is not one specific document that provides comprehensive guidelines for classroom assessment. Rather, there are several
document used to inform and guide classroom assessment. The Solomon Islands Policy Statement and Guidelines for Learners’ Assessment in Schools (2010)
provides general functions and types of assessment which underscores the formative and diagnostic assessments in the classroom. However, this document is
not specific to classroom assessment, but rather covers all types of assessment.

The National Curriculum Statement, Solomon Islands (2011) complements the National Assessment & Reporting Policy (2010) and provides an overview of the
requirements of the national curriculum of Solomon Islands. The Policy document informs teachers, instructors and education providers of the standards of the
national curriculum. The Statement focuses on achievement and competency-based assessment approaches and effective recording, monitoring and reporting
system. The Statement also provides teachers with guidance and examples on: assessing student achievement; recording student achievement; making
judgment about student achievement; and reporting to parents and guardians.

All documents/policies noted above are available to key stakeholders, but not online. Hard copies are provided to Education Authorities (who manage and
operate schools), and to school leaders and teachers. A large percentage of schools do not have access to the Internet and as such online is not an effective
distribution method.

2. Documents which outline what students are expected to learn and to what level of performance in different subject areas at different grade levels are
available to teachers in Solomon Islands. For example, the National Curriculum Statement outlines the subjects to be taught at different levels and the expected
outcomes for each subject. More specifically, there is a syllabus for each subject for both primary and secondary levels. The national syllabus provides suggested
assessment exercises that correspond to the specific learning outcomes. Associated with each syllabus is a Teacher's Guide, which details the learning outcomes
and expectations. Each subject is also accompanied by Learner’s Book that contains classroom assessment activities for each chapter.

3. The National Curriculum Statement, the national syllabus and the Teacher’s Guide specify what students are expected to learn and the desired level of
performance for each subject area.

4. Solomon Islands National University (SINU) offers in-service teacher training courses in Teacher Education which addresses competencies in assessment. As
part of the pre-service training, all teachers take a “Curriculum and Assessment" course, however the course is not specific to classroom assessment, but rather
focuses on all types of assessment.

5. Classroom assessment practices are known to be of moderate quality. In practice, parents are usually well informed about students' grades. However, the
use of multiple-choice/selection-type questions is common and classroom assessment activities are mainly about recalling information.

6. Classroom assessment is a required component of a teacher's performance evaluation and of school inspection. As part of teacher evaluation, the school
inspection instrument includes a component which focuses on formative classroom assessment. In addition, at the secondary level, the Head of Subject
Department (HoD) coordinates an assessment program that includes an annual assessment cycle/schedule.

7. The National Curriculum Statement spells out the purpose and required uses of classroom assessment information. In Solomon Islands, classroom assessment
is required to be used in diagnosing student learning issues, providing feedback to students on their learning, informing parents about their child's learning,
planning next steps in instruction and reviewing of school programs of learning.

8. In Solomon Islands, all schools are required to report on individual student performance. The National Curriculum Statement (2011) states that teachers must
calculate a progressive achievement level for individual learners. School Inspection visits ensure that students have received their results/reports, the reports are
saved in the student's portfolios, and that parents have a copy.

9. Student performance in Mathematics, Language and in all other subject areas is required to be reported in school report cards and during teacher-parent
meetings.

Examinations: Development-level rating justifications

1. The Solomon Islands National Form Six Certificate (SINF6C) was first implemented as the Pacific Senior Secondary Certificate in 1989 and became a national
examination and known as the SINF6C in 2012. It is administered every year to Year 12 students in English and Mathematics and other optional subjects which
include: Accounting, Economics, Agriculture, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Computer studies, Design Technology, Development Studies, Geography, and History.
It is used for purposes such as student certification for grade completion and student selection for tertiary education.

2. There is no specific policy on SINF6C, however the Policy Guidelines for Learner's Assessment in Schools, authorized in 2010 by the Ministry of Education and
Human Resources Development outlines the SINF6C. This document is distributed to schools and is also available to the public and other stakeholders upon
request.

3. The examination is fully standardized. Assessment design, administration, scoring and reporting are the same for all students taking the examination. In
addition, there are a variety of procedures in place to ensure the standardization. For example, examination papers or tasks are the same or are equivalent for
all students, examination administrators are trained to ensure all students take the examinations under the same conditions, and the same scoring criteria are
used to correct the examination papers and tasks.

4. The MEHRD, which consists of a permanent body of stakeholders, provides leadership for the examination. The MEHRD has pushed for the development of
the examination and has influence and power in determining the examination agenda in the country.

5. Funding for the examination allocated at the discretion of the government and partners.

6. There is regular funding for the examination is provided through Ministry of Education budget. Students are also required to pay a fee to take the
examination.

7. Funding allocated for the examination covers examination design and administration, and data analysis and reporting.

8. The National Examination and Standard Unit (NESU) has been in charge of the SINF6C since 2012. However, it has carried out a number of key examination
responsibilities since 1978 related to marking, sample moderation, mark processing, and release of results to schools and Education authorities.

9. The NESU is directly accountable to The National Examination and Assessment Board.

10. The examination unit has up-to-date computers and top-level security for the building. However, it does not have adequate storage facilities, computer
servers or communication tools.

11. The NESU team has an inadequate number of staff to carry out the SINF6C. The Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) recently conducted an
"Institutional Capacity Analysis for National Education Assessment System” (Solomon Islands) and found that the NESU requires a higher number of staff to

                                                                                                                                                               26

manage the workload. Several quality problems have been identified with the performance of the NESU including errors in test design and examination
questions, and delays in administering the examination. .

12. The Solomon Islands National University (SINU) offers courses in Teacher Education and pre-service training includes a "Curriculum and Assessment" course.
The NESU also hosts annual workshops for teachers, examiners and moderators which focus on the examinations.

13. There are some opportunities for teachers to learn about the examinations. In recent years, NESU staff have conducted school visits to facilitate trainings and
conduct workshops for teachers about the examinations. Furthermore, teachers who are part of the grading panel have the opportunity to learn about marking
and grading the examination, and are required to review the marking rubrics and answer schemes prior to the examination. Teachers are involved in some
examination-related tasks, such as in administering and scoring the examination. They are not involved in selecting the questions, creating the scoring guides or
supervising examination procedures, in part due to concerns that teachers who know the exam questions will teach to these questions.

14. There is currently no national curriculum in the Solomon Islands for Year 12. Prior to 2012, Solomon Islands were part of the Pacific Senior Secondary
Certificate (PSSC), which has its own subject prescriptions that apply to all participating countries, and are not country-specific. The SINF6C, implemented for
the first time in 2012, still relies on the PSSC content as there is still no national curriculum for Year 12.

15. There is no national policy or set of requirements to make material on examinations available to students; however, all schools have electronic copies of past
years’ examination papers. Subject teachers are expected to provide students with copies of past years’ examination papers and students can request past
years’ examination papers from NESU. In addition, information on how to prepare for the examination, the framework document explaining what is measured
on the examination, and a report on past student performance on the examination are available to almost all students.

16. It is not possible to tell whether the SINF6C is fully consistent with the large-scale assessments in the country because the examination is administered at the
secondary level, which the large-scale assessments are administered at the primary level. At the same time, since classroom assessment practices are varied
across schools, it is unclear whether the examination is consistent with such practices.

17. There are some formal mechanisms in place to ensure the quality of the examination. For example, all proctors or administrators are trained according to
protocol. In addition, the SPBEA developed a standardized manual for examination administrators. All booklets are numbered, there is double data scoring and
scorers are trained to ensure high inter-rater reliability.

18. There is a comprehensive technical report which is circulated to all schools and Education Authorities and is available to parents and other stakeholders upon
request.

19. All students in Year 12 are eligible to sit SINF6C examination but results are withheld for students who did not pay examination fees.

20. Only the student and persons with a legitimate, professional interest in the test taker can know the results. There are some inappropriate behaviors that
diminish the credibility of the examination include copying, using unauthorized materials such as prepared answers and notes, and issuing of forged certificates
or altering results information.

21. Results are perceived as credible by most stakeholder groups and are internationally recognized.

22. While students who do not perform well on the examination may opt for less selective schools, universities, or tracks, they do not have the option of
retaking the examination or attend remedial education.

23. The National Examination and Assessment Board is in place to monitor the examination in terms of impact, acceptance and credibility. In addition, SPBEA
provides continuous technical support to NESU in dealing with capacity constraints. However, there are no expert review groups or funding for independent
review and audit of the examination.

National (of System-Level) Large Scale Assessment (NLSA): Development-level rating justifications

1. The Solomon Islands Standardized Tests of Achievement (SISTA) was first introduced in 2003 and is implemented every three years to all students in years 4
and 6. The assessment is administered to monitor education quality at the country level, support schools and teachers, and inform policy design, evaluation, or
decision making.

2. There is no formal policy document pertaining to the SISTA.

3. While there is no official statement for future administration of SISTA, there is a common understanding that the assessment will take place in the future.

4. The Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development (MEHRD) and particularly the National Examinations and Standards Unit (NESU), represent the
recognized leaders for SISTA.

5. There was funding for SISTA.

6. Funding for SISTA came primarily from the country's internal funding sources, including the MEHRD as well as donor agencies, including the New Zealand Aid
Programme and Australian Aid Programme.

7. Funding for SISTA covers assessment design, administration, data analysis, and data reporting.

8. The National Examinations and Standards Unit (NESU) within the MEHRD, which is nationally recognized as an authority in student assessment in Solomon
Islands, has been is in charge of the SISTA since 2003.

9. The NESU is directly accountable to The National Examination and Assessment Board.

10. The NLSA unit has up-to-date computers for all technical staff, top-level security for its facilities, and up-to-date computer servers. It does not have adequate
storage facilities or communication tools.

11. The NLSA team has an inadequate number of staff to carry out the SISTA. The Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) recently conducted an
"Institutional Capacity Analysis for National Education Assessment System” (Solomon Islands) and found that the NESU requires a higher number of staff to
manage the workload. However, there have been no quality problems identified related to the performance of the NESU in carrying out the SISTA, such as
errors or delays in the printing of the test booklets.

12. There are university courses offered by the Solomon Islands National University (SINU) on assessment. As part of the pre-service training, all students take
“Curriculum and Assessment “course. In addition, education authorities have organized workshops for teachers to which NESU staff are invited to present SISTA
results.

                                                                                                                                                                  36

13. There are no opportunities available for teachers to learn about the content and skills measured by the SISTA.

14. The SISTA is developed directly from Year 4 and Year 6 curriculum. It is aligned with the content and skill areas, and pedagogical approaches of the official
learning goals or curriculum. In addition, there is a regular internal review to ensure alignment between the SISTA and the curriculum.

15. Textbooks or other learning resources covered similar content and skills to those covered by the NLSA. In addition, teachers covered similar content and
skills in their classes to those covered by the NLSA, and students were exposed to more advanced content and skills than those covered by the NLSA.

16. The SISTA is consistent with ILSAs in Solomon Islands. However, it is unclear whether the SISTA is consistent with classroom assessment since classroom
assessment is diversely practiced across schools. The SISTA is consistent with the Solomon Islands Secondary (SISE) examination administered at Year 6.

17. Special plans were made to ensure that the NLSA was administered to students in hard-to-reach areas and the NLSA was offered in the language of
instruction for almost all student groups.

18. There are several formal mechanisms in place to ensure the quality of the NLSA, including training scorers to ensure high inter-rater reliability, carrying out a
pilot before the main data collection takes place, training all proctors according to a protocol, providing a standardized manual for SISTA administrators, double
scoring and processing of data, and introducing internal and external reviewers or observers. However, other mechanisms, such as numbering all booklets and
conducting an external certification or audit, are not in place.

19. There was a comprehensive technical report available on the SISTA, although access to the report is available on request by stakeholders.

20. SISTA results were released by the Solomon Star media outlet and were also communicated through a radio broadcast.

21. Results received limited media coverage.

22. Results were used to inform decision making at the country level, including tracking the impact of reforms on student achievement levels, and informing
curriculum improvement, teacher training programs, other assessment activities in the system, and resource allocation. SISTA results influenced the
establishment of the Literacy Project Management Unit (LPMU) which manages literacy projects in the Solomon Islands focused on the early grades and
vernacular.

23. There is a permanent oversight committee, the National Examination and Assessment Board, to monitor the SISTA.

24. Since the SISTA was updated in 2013 and baseline data was collected at that time, it is too early to assess the impact of the assessment on education quality
in the Solomon Islands.

International Large Scale Assessment (ILSA): Development-level rating justifications

1. Solomon Islands has participated in, but not completed, an ILSA in the past 10 years

2. Solomon Islands is currently participating in the Pacific Islands Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (PILNA) for 2012, in which 14 countries in the Pacific region
participate.

3. There was no country-level policy document in Solomon Islands that addressed participation in the ILSA; however, the Secretariat of the Pacific Board for
Educational Assessment (SPBEA), a regional body, received a regional mandate from the Pacific Forum Education Minsters Meetings (FEdMM) in 2006 to develop
the PILNA.

4. There was funding allocated by donors.

5. Funding was allocated by the Australian Aid Programme and Secretariat of the Pacific Board for Educational Assessment (SPBEA).

6. The ILSA funding covered some core items, including implementation of the assessment exercise in the country, and processing and analyzing data collected
from implementation. In addition, funding covered attendance at international meetings. ILSA funding did not cover reporting and disseminating the results in
the country, international participation fees, research and development, or staff salaries.

7. There was a national coordinator for the PILNA in Solomon Islands who is located in NESU, a school coordinator who managed the administration at the school
level for selected schools, and test supervisors who administer the assessment at the classroom level in select schools. In addition, for each assessment area,
literacy and numeracy, there was a panel responsible for marking the assessments. Although this was the first time that this team was in charge of the ILSA, there
were no quality problems identified with carrying out the PILNA in Solomon Islands.

8. The ILSA unit has up-to-date computers for all technical staff, sufficient computer servers, and top-level security for building. It does not have adequate storage
facilities or communication tools.

9. ILSA team members and teachers involved in the scoring of the assessment were able to benefit from some opportunities to learn about PILNA during
presentations conducted by NESU. Key personnel also participated in workshops organized by SPBEA for all PILNA participating countries. In addition, the SPBEA
provided in-country training on scoring, data collection methodology, and quality assurance protocol to panel leaders and panel members.

10. The PILNA was aligned with the content and skills areas of Solomon Island's official learning goals or curriculum. In addition, the PILNA was aligned with
pedagogical approaches or activities compatible with the Solomon Island's official learning goals or curriculum.

12. It is unclear whether the ILSA is consistent with classroom assessment since classroom assessments are conducted at the school level and can be diverse across
schools. The ILSA is consistent with examinations, particularly the Solomon Islands Secondary Entrance (SISE) examination administered at Year 6, at which level
the PILNA is also administered. The ILSA is also fully consistent with the national large-scale assessment (SISTA) in Solomon Islands.

13. Solomon Islands has complied with all technical standards, and it is expected that its results will be presented in the main section of the international report.

14. Since PILNA results have not yet been approved by the FEdMM, they have not been disseminated in the Solomon Islands.

         The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
         initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on education
         policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries
         systematically strengthen their education systems.          SABER
         evaluates the quality of education policies against evidence-based
         global standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy
         data. The SABER country reports give all parties with a stake in
         educational results—from administrators, teachers, and parents to
         policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
         snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
         system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth
         learn.

         This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of student
         assessment.
