THE LAKE CHAD
DEVELOPMENT AND
CLIMATE RESILIENCE
ACTION PLAN
SUMMARY
The Lake Chad Development and Climate Resilience Action
Plan (LCDAP), or Plan de développement et d’adaptation au
changement climatique du lac Tchad (PADLT), is an initiative
undertaken by the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) and
its six member countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic,
Chad, Libya, Niger, and Nigeria.

A Changing Lake in Response to Regional Rainfall Variability

Lake Chad is a tropical lake with related wetlands.                    water level is too low, the Great Barrier prevents
It has a northern and a southern basin of roughly                      water from flowing to the Northern Basin,
the same sizes, which are separated by a sand                          causing that segment of the Lake to dry up. The
barrier, referred to as the Great Barrier (see                         Lake is shared by Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and
