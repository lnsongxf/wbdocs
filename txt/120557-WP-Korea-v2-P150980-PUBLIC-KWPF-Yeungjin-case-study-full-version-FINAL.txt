Introduction


Context and Purpose of the Study

East Asian countries are among the fastest growing economies in the world over the last decade.
However, as growth continues, the countries in East Asia are faced with a skills shortage and
mismatching that has limited their economic growth. To tackle this issue, regional governments
are currently restructuring their respective TVET systems to guide schools towards demand-
driven education and training; and in order to do so, they have researched the best method of
restructuring their respective systems.

In this context, the East Asia Education team has embarked on an in-depth study of “Excellent
Institutions” by selecting particular outstanding cases in select countries of East Asia in order to
research (1) which factors contribute to a particular school’s successful outcomes; (2) how the
school developed its demand-driven system; and (3) how the school utilizes finite resources to
enhance school performance.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide policy makers with empirical evidence that will
be used to develop new policies that direct schools towards more market-responsive and
demand-driven approaches. Specifically, it aims to; (1) offer guidance for individual institutions
to develop innovative methods to improve the internal and external efficiency of their programs
and determine resource priorities; (2) provide the World Bank with empirical evidence to guide
the knowledge services it offers client countries in regards to TVET policies and practices; (3)
engender a productive dialogue on the improvement of TVET relevance among our client
countries.


Literature Review

Definition
The definition of excellent is measured by the school’s internal and external efficiency. Internal
efficiency refers to the relationship between the inputs and outputs and focuses on what occurs
within the educational and training processes. Then, what happens to the outputs of the training
process in relation to economic and social requirement is defined as external efficiency, which is
also referred to as relevance of the program (Johanson and Adams, 2004). Therefore, the
excellent TVET institutions produce the best training outcomes by retaining high internal
efficiency.

Premised Four Factors Contributing to School Outcomes
Based on the literature review, the study premises that a school becomes excellent when it (1)
conserves adequate resources; (2) delivers relevant programs; (3) develops an effective
management system; and (4) establishes linkages with enterprise in the three previously

discussed areas. Additionally, there are external factors impacting the success of schools, called
“ecosystem factors” (Altbach and Salmi, 2011).

Research Questions

By conducting an in-depth analysis, this study seeks to find (1) whether or not premise four
factors impact school outcomes; and if so, then, (2) which of these factors is the determining
factor that contributes most to the enhancement of school performance and in what context
(various settings and time periods within respective countries); and (3) how this factor can be
strengthened based on suggestions from teachers/instructors and school administrators.

Research Method

The Rationale
We will reversely examine the relationship between outcomes and premise factors by selecting a
high-performance school (purposely selecting the sampling procedure) and the impact of the
premise factors on graduate employment rates. The logic is that if this high-performing school
demonstrates a showing of all these factors, then we can conclude that these premise factors are
likely to raise employment rates.

Case Selection
The following shows three areas of consideration for the case selection process in our study.

                                                                                                   Page 4 of 52

                                                    Yeungjin College, Korea | Excellent TVET Case Study
                            	

	


First, as we are reversely testing the factors that are assumed to be contributing to a school’s
success, we will select excellent schools with exemplary outcomes. Second, we will select the
school at both the secondary and post-secondary levels within the same sector. In this way, we
can more easily compare how different levels of skilled graduates are absorbed into the labor
market within the same sector, thereby investigating whether “different levels of skills” is one of
the ecosystem factors positively impacting school excellence. Also, this analysis may provide
some suggestions on how to attract more students in vocational high school, especially to
countries where students’ vocational track preferences are low. Third, we will select schools that
provide skills training for sectors that may best represent the select country’s economy. In this
way, lessons learned from the case study can be tailored to meet the specific needs of a country
that may be considering introduction of TVET training for the same sector.

In Korea’s case, Yeungjin was selected, as it is best known for producing mid-level technicians
for the manufacturing sector.

Data Collection Process
The study will collect data from multiple sources to increase validity of the study. The sources
include (1) archived information and quantitative measures; (2) a survey; and (3) interviews.

The Survey
The survey was conducted with the students and professors of three majors directly related to the
manufacturing sector [School of Mechanical Engineering, School of Electronic and Info-
Communication, and School of Electronic Engineering] and the President of Yeungjin. For the
students, we excluded 1st grade students, as they are assumed to have a lack of learning
experiences with Yeungjin (Korea’s school year starts in the first week of March, and this survey
was conducted during the second week of April). Six hundred ninety-three students out of the
total number of 1,400 responded to the survey. For the faculty members, we excluded
administrative staff, because they are assumed to have no knowledge of the school’s program.
Twenty-three professors of the aforementioned majors responded to the survey.

With structured questions (category or ranking), the survey questionnaire is designed to directly
address whether or not the schools retain each factor (resources, teaching, management, and
linkage with industry) and these factors’ impact on school outcomes.

The sample of the survey questionnaire is attached in Annexes 1 and 2. The questionnaire will
be further developed with input from experts both inside and outside the World Bank and will
also be tested for its measurement validity.

The Interview
In order to conduct an in-depth analysis, interviews were conducted with 10 students, 10
professors, and the President. The interview question types were structured to investigate the
association between the premise factors and the factor most effective in enhancing school
outcomes and how this identified factor can be improved. A sample of the interview questions is
attached in Annex 3 and 4.


                                                                                                 Page 5 of 52

Employment Rate

According to the College Sustainability Index, since 2012, Yeungjin College has ranked high in
the area of graduate employment.

The College Sustainability Index is jointly developed by the Kyunghyang Newspaper Economic
Research Institute for Sustainable Society (ERISS), World with No Worries on Private
Education, Samjong KPMG, LLC, Hyundai Research and Young Entrepreneurs for Sustainable
Society. As for the method, the Index evaluates performance in five areas: education, research,
job placement, management, and convenience/fairness/communication among 132 Korean
colleges nationwide. Out of a total 1000 points, 300 points is allocated to education and job
placement, respectively; 200 points to management; 100 points to research; and 100 points to
convenience/fairness/communication. For example, Yeungjin received the highest score of 777.3
points among 132 colleges in the 2012 Index: first in job placement, second in the management,
and third in the education.

Especially for job placement, according to “Job Placement Statistics of Higher Education
Institution Graduates 2012”, published by the MoE, Yeungjin ranked in the top 79.3 percent in
job placement among colleges retaining more than two thousand graduates. This data is widely


                                                                                                            Page 7 of 52

utilized, because it shows the actual number of employees by calculating the number of
graduates who have been registered for employee insurance within the country, as well as the
number of graduates who have gained employment overseas. This is also a key index for the
MoE to fund various university projects, such as the Education Competence Enhancement
Project.

Figure 1: Job Placement Statistics of Higher Education Institution Graduates 2012

Quality of Employment

In addition to the rate, Yeungjin has placed emphasis on improving the quality of its graduates’
job placement by helping them gain employment with prospective companies. For the last five
years, the accumulated number of job placements in major domestic and overseas companies is
3,585 graduates. In regards to domestic companies, 841 graduates were employed at large
companies in 2012, such as Samsung and LG. Overseas placements included 325 graduates that
were employed at prospective companies of Japan, China, USA, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and
New Zealand. The details are described in Figure 2.


World Class College (WCC) Nomination

In 2011, Yeungjin was nominated as one of seven WCCs by the MoE, whose aim is to cultivate
Korea’s best technology masters in colleges. This is a meaningful award as WCC is a
comprehensive evaluation that assesses college infrastructure, educational performance, financial
integrity and the satisfaction rate of industries with education. Therefore, WCC refers to the
leading colleges that can respond quickly to changes in technology, sustainable growth and
international vocational education competencies. For the next five years, Yeungjin College plans
to cultivate 3,000 skilled workers and attract about 200 small-and-mid-sized enterprise research
institutes.



                                                                                                    Page 8 of 52

As the graduate employment rate is an outcome indicator in this study, Yeungjin is assumed to
be an excellent school. Next, we will reversely examine whether or not the school possesses all
these factors [(1) adequate resources; (2) relevant programs; (3) an effective management system;
and (4) school-industry linkages], then we can conclude whether or not these premise factors are
likely to impact employment rates, and in what direction.

Findings


Factor 1: Adequate Financial and Human Resources

Yeungjin retains various types of expensive high-tech equipment and machines, worth over USD
178 million. These machines include a super-high speed electron beam machining apparatus, a
high-speed rapid prototype, a 3-dimensional check, etc., which are not possessed by most
colleges and SMEs. The Bank conducted the survey and interview with the teachers and students
to find out whether or not Yeungjin has adequate financial and human resources to enhance
student employability.

The Teachers’ Perception
During the survey, three areas were assessed by the teachers: the school’s financial resources and
facilities; teachers’ recruitment standards and in-service training; and the support system for
employment. The results of the survey support the fact that the school retains both adequate
financial and human resources.

As for the school’s financial resources, 100% of the teachers responded that the school provides
adequate financial support to students, and 96% responded that providing financial support plays
a primary role in attracting talented students. Also, for the assessment of school facilities, 65%
of the teachers answered “excellent,” 57% answered “excellent” for equipment maintenance, and

Second, in the area of human resources, the teachers were asked about teacher recruitment and
in-service training. For teacher recruitment, we asked the teachers, which is the most important
criterion in recruitment of a competent teacher among (1) Minimum academic qualifications (2)
Minimum years of industry or work experience (3) Minimum years of teaching experience (4)
Other. 35% of the teachers responded that “Minimum years of industry or work experience” is
the most important criteria (Graph 3). Furthermore, 91% of the teachers responded that
Yeungjin College’s recruitment standards for teachers/instructors are adequate enough to
administer updated skills to students. Also, 100% of the teachers believe themselves to be
competent teachers and to possess the required skill set for teaching.

Third, the teachers were also asked to assess the school’s support system for student employment.
91% of the teachers answered that the school has a support system to assist students with their
career plans and provides various employment services, such as a job service center. In addition,
all teachers said that they have guided their students in developing their career plans.

Followed by the survey, an in-depth interview was conducted with ten teachers, and all
responded that the school has adequate financial and human resources to produce competitive
school outcomes.

In regard to facilities and equipment, the teachers pointed out the benefits from participating in
the government projects that support SMEs, such as Techno Park. The school has been
nominated as a learning and skill hub in the region for several government projects that support
SMEs for boosting the local economy. To meet the purpose of creating a SMEs consortium, the
government selected Yeungjin as a skill provider by utilizing its campus and human resources
(Yeungjin’s faculty members) in exchange for providing expensive machines and equipment to
be shared by SMEs. The teachers said that through this process, the school was able to secure
the best equipment in the region and upgrade the training facilities.

In regard to human resources, three themes emerged: recruiting teachers with industry
experience, appointing an advisor who works closely with his or her students, and maintaining a
good circle.

First, the teachers pointed out Yeungjin’s teacher recruitment standards. The school recruits
teachers from industry, particularly those who hold middle or high level positions at large
companies, via public contest. The recruitment standards also require at least a master’s degree,
but they do not require previous research work. In fact, the teachers can publish research papers
after joining Yeungjin. The main purpose of this recruitment standard is to secure faculty
members who are able to develop industrial demand-driven programs as well as strengthen
school-industry cooperation. For the former, these instructors are able to develop relevant
curriculum and training materials, as they know the types of skills and knowledge demanded in

                                                                                                    Page 13 of 52

the current labor market. At the same time, they respond to the changes in the labor market
quickly and flexibly by continually updating their training materials, and if necessary, they can
change the courses. For the latter, these instructors have advantages in developing a MoU with
companies as they have their own networks with companies. In fact, all teachers agreed that
hiring instructors from industry has a direct impact on increasing the employment rate. Based on
their experience with companies, these instructors are able to inform students of the types of
certificates and courses needed for their wishful companies. Also, the teachers are able to help
the students gain employment with their own network companies.

Second, in Yeungjin, there is an advisor for each class who is responsible for about 30 students.
The advisor’s duties and responsibilities are similar to those of a homeroom teacher of Busan
Meister High School. Via a one-on-one meeting, each advisor works closely with their
respective student on developing their career plans, providing company employment information
and job opportunities. They teach job ethics classes as well to help students prepare for their
future jobs. In addition to career counseling, they also support students in developing their
academic skills.

Third, the teachers pointed out that the school is in a virtuous circle, similar to that described by
the teachers of Busan Meister High School. Because the school retains adequate resources,
excellent facilities and faculty members, it produces high graduate employment rates,
particularly with high quality jobs. Then, based on good assessment results, the school receives
more financial support from the MoE and is able to participate in the government SMEs’ support
projects. This government support helps the school retain excellent facilities and strengthen
school-industry cooperation. Then, the school is able to secure competent students and teachers
and, again, produces the best outcomes.

The Students’ Perception
During the survey, the students were also asked their perception of the school’s resources. In
regard to financial support, 83% of the students said that they receive at least some level of
financial support to cover course fees, residential costs, academic materials, etc (Graph 7).

In addition to interviewing teachers and staff, we conducted an in-depth interview with ten
students.

In regard to facilities and equipment, the students agreed that enough machines and equipment
are available to them for their practical training; for example, an average of 1 - 1.5 students can
utilize the training materials and equipment for practice. According to them, they are in fact
impressed with Yeungjin’s training facilities, because some of the expensive machines are not
available in other universities. So, they never feel that they cannot take practical training due to
a shortage of machines or equipment. For example, the students from the CAD/Mechanical
Design Course of the School of Mechanical Engineering said that they are able to acquire the
latest skills, because the school provides the computer programs needed for obtaining those skills.
The students reported that even though companies currently use the latest CAD program, most
schools do not provide it due to its high costs.

All interviewed students agreed that their teachers are competent. Like the teachers, the students
also concurred that teachers should have industrial experience. According to the students, based
on their work experience with large companies, the teachers are able to design industrial
demand-driven, customized programs, teach the most relevant skills, and develop useful training
materials. Based on their experience, the teachers continually give the students tips for
employment preparation. The teachers guide the students in developing career plans and provide
company-specific information. The students said the teachers also assist directly in connecting
students with companies within their respective networks.

Second, the students said that the teachers update knowledge and skills in their fields continually
as they maintain relationships with companies. The teachers are able to develop their own
training materials for the classes and update them. One student mentioned that some graduates
who are currently in the industry said that they still use the school training materials for their

current job. In addition, the students said the teachers have excellent teaching skills by teaching
them from basic to advanced levels within a well-designed learning block.
Third, as the teachers mentioned, the students said their advisors assist more with school life,
especially with career plans. All stated that a one-on-one meeting with an advisor is very helpful
in solidifying their plans, e.g. deciding occupations, jobs, and future companies of employment.
The advisor also continually provides them with company specific information and the
certificates necessary for applying to a particular company.

Fourth, the students agreed that most teachers not only teach but also emphasize individual
student job placements. They continually provide tips for job preparation during classes and
directly help students obtain jobs by matching company requests with students’ skills to identify
ideal candidates. By utilizing their own network, the teachers find places for in-company
training and even jobs for the students.

Most importantly, the students said that their teachers care about and for individual students.
The teachers support any late learners by using personal time after class and on weekends. For
example, one student said that because he studied at an academic high school, he did not have
much understanding of engineering during the first semester of his 1st year; however, the
teachers helped him improve his understanding via one-on-one meetings. Other students who
studied at vocational high schools had similar experiences, receiving teacher support after class
in their physics and math classes. The students all agreed that their teachers are available
anytime to those who need further assistance. The teachers also provide special weekend
lectures and lectures during vacation.

The interview followed, and three themes emerged in terms of the program: the importance of
developing a demand-driven program, having a flexible curriculum, and balancing theory and
practical training.

First, the teachers agreed that Yeungjin’s programs meet industrial needs by pointing out its
demand-driven programs. According to them, both the teachers and representatives from the
companies of each sub-major design curricula together via an annually held Committee meeting.
Then, based on the companies’ needs, the curriculum is continually updated. More specifically,
the teachers mentioned their customized classes. Each department has several customized
classes that have been created based upon the request from a specific company: the School of
Mechanical Engineering has seven customized classes, the School of Electronic and Info-
Communication has 13 customized classes, and the School of Electron Engineering has 11
customized classes. For example, an LG Display Class was created based upon the demands
from an LG Display: upon the agreement between the school and the LG Display on
employment, the program is specifically designed to produce skilled workers for the company.
Therefore, the students obtain more specific skills than transferable skills (about 60% of the
company demanded skills), that enable them to work immediately for the company upon their
graduation.

Yeungjin first designed this customized program in Korea, and the teachers shared their
experiences in initiating this program in 1995. According to them, the creation of the
customized program was possible, because it served the companies’ interests in lowering costs
for retraining new employees. Yeungjin’s teachers knew that the companies were not satisfied
with the schools’ training as they had to retain new employees upon hiring. So, the teachers
approached the companies to learn their needed skills by conducting a series of surveys with
specialists of those companies and inviting them to the school for further interview. Then, the
school suggested the companies develop curricula together in the form of the customized
program in exchange for the schools supplying skilled workers to these specific companies. The
companies began to take interest, because they knew that new employees who have already
obtained company specific skills while in school would lessen retraining costs.

Second, another advantage of Yeungjin’s program lies in its flexibility. The teachers continually
review and update the programs to respond to rapid industry changes. Also, even for the
customized classes, the current ones can be closed if there is low demand, and a new customized
class can be created if there is a high industry demand. This opening and closing of the class is
all based on the assessment of the companies’ needs and requests. Also, the teachers pointed out
that feedback from alumni who are currently working at prospective companies is useful to
updating the program.

Third, the teachers pointed out the importance of balancing theory and practical training, as they
believe that a 2-year college is not a training institute that mainly focuses on practices. It is a
school that needs to provide theory and basic knowledge of each field as well as the humanity of
education. However, at the same time, the school also needs to provide adequate practical
training to help students prepare for future jobs. For example, one teacher shared his own work
experience upon his graduation from a top ranking university by saying “I had difficulty working


                                                                                                Page 23 of 52

                                                                       Yeungjin College, Korea | Excellent TVET Case Study
                                 	

	

at Samsung right after joining the company, because I mainly studied theory and did not have
much practice while studying at the school.” Therefore, he believes that the school should
provide adequate practical training to students, in addition to theory. However, in reality, two
years of training cannot provide all the skills and knowledge needed by a company; the school
needs to focus on basic and transferable skills in their field of advantage.

In general, the teachers agreed that the provision of relevant knowledge and skills directly
increases employment rates because the knowledge and skills obtained in school are also tested
during the hiring process. In Korea, the hiring process includes a Document Screening Process,
Aptitude Test, and Interview, and during the interview, companies test applicant knowledge in
their special field. The teachers also pointed out that the school should provide the most useful
skills. For example, Yeungjin’s students are likely to be employed because they can utilize the
CAD program that is currently used in the industry. Not many schools offer this course, because
they do not have this computer program.

The Students’ Perception
Through the survey, the students also assessed the program. First, only 9% of the surveyed
students pursue further education, while 91% want to be employed upon graduation. Among
those who are looking for a job, 60% expect to obtain a mid-level skilled position (Graph 14) and
71% expect to receive more than USD 20,000 annual income (Graph 15).

Following the survey, ten students were selected for an in-depth interview in which they were
asked to assess the program. First, they all agreed that the curriclum is designed well enough to
help them acqire a range of information from basic knowledge and theory to specialized
knowledge and skills. During the first year, all students study common subjects, then they are
dividied into sub-majors based on their interests and levels of competence. Then, within each of
their respective sub-majors, the students are divided into the customized classes according to
their competency level. The remaining students, who are unable to attend the customized classes,

employment opportunities. However, considering the importance of possessing a particular
certificate for a certain job application, aside from the regular courses, they feel it’s necessary to

Second, the students stated that they are obtaining the latest and most relevant skills by referring
to their instruction on the latest CAD computer program that is currently used in many major
companies within their respective fields. The students said that the possession of this specific
skill increases their self-confidence to the level of a highly demanded skilled worker in the
current market. Also, the students said that the training materials developed by the teachers are
very helpful. The materials are substitutes that easily explain the utilization of machines,
equipment, and computer programs. The materials also reflect the current skills that alumni use
in their work places.

survey for market value, and present their final product on graduation. The teachers support
them in finding necessary materials and share sound advice. According to them, during the

Factor 3: Management

Yeungjin College’s uniqueness in terms of school organization is its emphasis on the school-
industry linkage by instituting a separate “Industry-College Cooperation Corp” division. And
under this division, there are four departments: Industry-College HRD Center, Office of
Industry-College Convergence, Daegu Techno-Park Yeungjin Branch Office and the Business
Support Center. The chart is illustrated in Diagram 3.

In regard to the question of the relationship with the leaders as well as with other teachers, 48%
of the teachers said their relationship with the President of Yeungjin is excellent, and 39% said
their relationship with other teachers is excellent.

During the in-depth interview following the survey, the teachers pointed out the management’s
contribution to Yeungjin’s high graduate employment rate. According to them, under a strong
leadership, Yeungjin’s management system coordinates the efforts of all faculty members to
accomplish the school’s single objective of increasing the graduate employment rate by utilizing
financial and human resources efficiently and effectively.

First, the teachers all agree that leadership is key to not only the school’s outcomes but also the
school’s survival. According to them, 2-year colleges were founded based on the country’s
economic needs during the mid-1970s. Until the early 1970s, Korea did not have 2-year TVET
colleges, because the government placed an emphasis on expanding TVET high schools and 4 -
year universities to supply urgently needed skilled workers to fast growing industries; however,
as industry became more complicated, companies also began requiring mid-level skilled workers
to fill the gap between low and high skilled workers. Due to resource constraints, the government
encouraged the private sector to establish 2-year colleges to produce these mid-level technicians
by providing more relaxed regulations to school openings. Yeungjin was one such 2-year school
established during this period.

Since the mid-1980s however, 2-year colleges have faced the major issue of declining demand.
The factors contributing to low student demand for 2-year college include shifts in the economic
structure demanding more higher skilled workers, the change in the government’s higher
education policy allowing 4-year universities to accept more students, establishment of in-house
universities at large companies that provide specific skills, and increasing social demands for a
4-year diploma. As a result, the training market became more competitive, and 2-year colleges
lost their competitiveness against both 4-year universities and in-house universities. Like other 2-
year colleges, Yeungjin has faced the challenge of maintaining adequate numbers of students.

According to them, the main contributing factor to school survival during this time has been
strong leadership and management: the President supports teachers and has helped them feel a
sense of ownership and belonging to the school. Under this strong leadership, Yeungjin has
reformed its entire school system. First, it changed the management system to coordinate the
efforts of all faculty members to accomplish the school’s single objectives of maintaining
adequate student number by utilizing financial and human resources efficiently and effectively.
The reform process was as follows:

The teacher recruitment policy was changed in order to replace academic based teachers with
industry-experienced teachers. Via public contest, the school started recruiting new teachers
who held middle to high positions at large companies. Next, with this manpower, the school
reformed the curriculum from supply to demand-driven. In order to develop a demand-driven
curriculum, teachers conducted a series of surveys and interviews with specialists of companies
in each major and created competency-based programs based on their responses.

Management knew that providing a demand-driven program was key to success in the training
market as most schools then provided supply-driven courses and failed to meet industrial
demands. Next, the school strengthened school-industry cooperation by utilizing teachers’
networks and participating in government projects that support SMEs. For the latter, the
participation in government projects that support SMEs in the region will not only enable the
school to secure the best facilities but also strengthen school-industry cooperation to secure in-
company training places and employment for the students.

However, even after entering the normal stage, school leaders continually prepare for the next
challenge, decreasing school age students due to the fast aging process in Korea. So, Yeungjin
has invested in school advertisement since 1995; in fact, one faculty member said that even
though advertising had now become the norm, during the 1990s, most schools did not feel self-
advertisement was necessary. Yeungjin was the first college to advertise itself in 1995.

Second, the teachers agreed that strong teacher commitment is another key to success; in other
words, teachers share their visions and communicate with each other as well as with their leaders.
By doing so, teachers feel a strong sense of ownership and belonging. The teachers said that
during difficult times, strong leadership support enabled them to develop ideas to reform the
program, increase their sense of ownership, and make tremendous efforts towards mutually
achieving school goals. For example, they visited high schools to attract students, developed the
customized program and training materials, and created MoUs with companies.

Third, regarding resource management, the teachers agreed that the school utilizes its financial
and human resources efficiently. In terms of human resources, the teachers pointed out the
school’s performance-based payment and incentives. The teachers’ work on developing a
specific customized course, such as the LG Display Class, strengthening school-industry
cooperation by establishing MoUs, and conducting administrative work is reflected in the
teacher’s assessment that is linked with immediate rewards and incentives. In fact, the most
important element of the teacher assessment is their students’ employment. Incentives have also
played a role; according to teachers, the school changed its teacher wage policy from seniority to

performance-based payment. The teachers pointed out that these incentives encourage teachers
to produce better outcomes.

Regarding the use of financial resources, the school utilizes machines and equipment from the
Chilgok campus (2nd campus) for both the students and SMEs. The students of most customized
classes are staying at the dormitory on the Chilgok campus and access the best training facilities.
At the same time, as Yeungjin is the center of SMEs consortium, their machines and equipment
are shared by the SMEs. Therefore, the teachers said that the machines are utilized efficiently,
because they are used to train Yeungjin students and the SME employees as well as to provide
skills support to the SMEs.


Factor 4: School-Industry Linkages

Customized Education
Yeungjin has successfully built a customized education system via strengthening school-industry
cooperation. Customized education means that the school receives requests from select
companies to supply a certain number of skilled workers and then develops courses and curricula
to meet their requests. Then, the students are expected to be hired by these companies upon
graduation since they have acquired company-specific skills in addition to transferable, basic
technical skills. Currently, Yeungjin is requested by 285 companies - large and SMEs, domestic
and overseas - to supply 4,493 technicians.

Since Yeungjin’s success, the MoE has expanded the customized education system to other
colleges and universities. For example, between 1999 and 2008, the MoE funded $153,641,000
both 2 and 4-year colleges via the Financial Support Program in a Specialized Area, such as the
Education & Human Resources Policy Committee, President’s Consultative Body, which
recommended that 4-year universities implement Customized Education. In 2003, Yeungjin,
who initiated this system, was introduced at the Committee of Policy Coordination, chaired by
then-President Roh.

A Skill Hub in the Region
Yeungjin has strengthened industry cooperation by participating in several government projects.
The first example is the industry-college convergence zone development project, Quality of
Working Life (QWL), which is managed by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy. Both the
MKE and private sector fund the project with a total of USD 450 million. The purpose of QWL
is to produce skilled workers by strengthening school-industry cooperation that connects
education, R&D, and employment. The project required a college campus with adequate training
facilities, and Yeungjin met this criterion. The projected number of skilled workers that Yeungjin
will train for the next five years will be 3,000 and the school plans to bring in 200 SME-sized
enterprise research institutes. By participating in this project, Yeungjin expects to strengthen its
relationships with the SMEs, as well as contribute to local economic growth by supplying
adequately skilled workers to the SMEs.

Another example is the “Technopark Project” that has enabled the school to establish the “Total
Techno Solution System” (TTSS). Via this system, the school supports the SMEs from product
design/development and prototype production to marketing. The process of the system is
illustrated in Diagram 5.

Teachers’ Perception
The teachers’ survey reflected that 100% believe that a school should build a formal partnership
with companies and that their school has built a successful partnership with companies in order
to enhance school outcomes e.g. graduate employment rate.

During the in-depth interview, the teachers all agreed that Yeungjin has a well-established formal
school-industry linkage.

For resources, the companies provide scholarships, in-company training for students, instructors
and special lectures. Also, as a hub of the SMEs consortium in the region funded by the
government, the school has actively worked with the SMEs by sharing both facilities and human
resources. For example, the teachers provide technical assistance to the SMEs, and at the same
time, the teachers obtain information on employment, industrial demand, and company-specific
information from these companies.
For the program, the teachers of each major and representatives from ten relevant companies
hold a meeting twice a year to develop curriculum and training materials together. During that
meeting, the school receives the companies’ demanded skills in the relevant fields. Particularly,
for the customized classes that are created based upon the company’s request, the teachers and
the representatives from that specific company develop curricula together, and 60% of the
program is required by the company.

However, all teachers disagree with the idea of collaboration between the school and the
companies as a form of the Committee. According to one teacher, Yeungjin is a privately owned
school like most other 2-year colleges. Without private ownership, Yeungjin would not be able
to survive during difficult times. They believe that even a management committee will not work,
because its members lack a strong sense of ownership, and its policies will be inconsistent.


Conclusion

This paper reversely examined the relationship between outcomes and premise factors by
selecting a high-performance school (the high graduate employment rate) and the impact of the
premise factors on school outcomes. The logic is that if this high-performance school
demonstrates that it possess these factors and has close relationships with the outcomes, then we
can conclude that these premise factors are likely to raise employment rates.

The first research question is whether or not the school possesses these factors. The findings
strongly support that Yeungjin has adequate resources, relevant programs, excellent management,
and well-established school-industry linkages. The second question is whether or not the above
premise factors impact school outcomes. The findings suggest that these factors both directly
and indirectly influence the Yeungjin’s graduate employment rate. According to the survey and
interview conducted with both the teachers and students, these factors increase the students’
employability, which leads to a high chance of being employed, particularly with prospective
companies.

The third question is which of these factors is the determining factor that contributes most to the
enhancement of school performance, in what context, and how can this factor be strengthened.

In Korea’s case, industrialization, education, economic growth, and the labor market are closely
related. Economic policy continues to guide educational policy based on the assumption that
education, although not sufficient, is a necessary factor contributing to the country’s economic
growth by providing adequately skilled workers to industry. Table 5 summarizes periodic key
industry highlights and their corresponding educational policies (Zang, p. 87, 2009; Lee et al,
2012; Kim, 2000).

During the 1970s, because the country shifted from a lighter to heavier manufacturing industry, it
required different types of labor force, such as skilled technicians and experts. Accordingly, the
government expanded technical and vocational education to meet the demand for skilled workers
in the heavier manufacturing industry (Zang, 2009; Kim, 2000; Lee et al, 2012). For example,
the growth rate of vocational schools’ was 24.5% during this time. In regard to the number of
vocational high school students, the number increased from 42.3% in 1975 to 45% in 1980. Also,
students in technical schools increased from 25% in 1970 to 26.4% in 1980 (Lee et al, 2012).

Since the late 1970s, Korea’s strategic industry has shifted to more skill-intensive industries,
such as the electronic and car industries, and to meet this demand, higher education (both 2-year
college and 4-year university) was greatly expanded to train skilled workers for this new type of
industry (Zang, 2009; Kim, 2000).

The expansion of secondary and higher education is illustrated in Graph 27 (Lee, 2011; Lee,
1993; Kim, 2000). The Secondary Education GRE increased from 48.5% in 1975 to 88% in
1985 and to 92.4% in 2010. The GER for higher education was 7.1% in 1975, but the rate had
dramatically increased from 30.1% in 1985 to 70.1% in 2010 (Zang, 2009).

Then, between 1985 and 2007, there was the sudden rapid expansion of 4-year universities in
Korea. This is because as the industrial structure changed due to technological development,
demand for highly skilled workers (e.g. managers and experts) who had completed higher
education increased in the labor market (Lee, 1993).

In addition to the economic change, the expansion of 4-year universities was also influenced by a
strong demand for higher education from the new middle class who had accumulated their
wealth during industrialization (Lee, 2011). This is evidenced by a survey conducted by KEDI
in 1991 among parents and students to question why they want to attain higher education. It
showed that 41.7% of parents believe that people who do not attend university are not respected
in our society. 21% of parents believe that these people have limited options in choosing their
occupation. 12.5% believe that these people are paid less than higher education graduates (Kim,
2000). Another survey also showed that the most important factor contributing to making the
decision to attain further education is whether or not it brings advantage to future career (66.3%
of total respondents). Chun et al (1987), Bea et al (1987), and Lee et al (1981)’s survey all
showed that the reason for attaining 4-year university education is to get a prestigious job (Kim,
2000).

However, most teachers in Yeungjin agreed that regardless of these economic and social changes
throughout the time, the most important factor contributing to the school’s best outcome is well-
established management and leadership, because it directs all resources, including human
resources, towards achieving the goal of enhancing school performance. Some teachers pointed
out a leader who supports the teachers, while others pointed out the teachers’ ownership as being
the most important factor for success. But both indicate that well-established management is
based on both sides’ effort to work together and share the same vision. In Yeungjin’s case, when
the school faced outside challenges, the President and faculty members united to overcome them.
The leader strongly supported the teachers’ suggestions on transforming the program from
supply-driven to demand-driven, and the teachers made efforts to establish school-industry
connections, as they believe that this linkage is the pre-condition for developing a demand-driven
program.

Furthermore, under circumstances of rapid labor market shifts, the management system emerges
as the most important factor not only contributing to the best outcomes but also impacting its
survival in the training market. The flexible management system enables the school to reform its
system to react to changes, including reorganizing the structure, changing curriculum, changing
teacher recruitment and payment policies, and strengthening school-industry cooperation. For
example, Yeungjin changed their attitude in working with the companies from receiving general
advice to actively reflecting their demands in the curriculum. Also, an efficient management
system enables the school to utilize it’s resources at the maximum level as Yeungjin’s case
illustrated.

The teachers recommended that leadership is central to a well-established management system.
Under leadership that provides an overall direction, management utilizes all resources efficiently
to achieve the goals and support the faculty members to work at their maximum level with a
strong sense of ownership. Depending upon management, the school can increase its internal
and external efficiencies to produce the best outcomes.
