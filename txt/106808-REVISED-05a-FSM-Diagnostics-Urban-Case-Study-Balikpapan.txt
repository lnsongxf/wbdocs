This report is a city case study of a World Bank Economic and Sector Work on Fecal Sludge
Management: Diagnostics for Service Delivery in Urban Areas (P146128). The task team leaders
were Isabel Blackett and Peter Hawkins and task team members were Zael Sanz Uriarte,
Ravikumar Joseph, Chris Heymans and Guy Hutton.

This report is based on work conducted between January 2014 and February 2016 by Oxford
Policy Management (OPM) in partnership with the Water, Engineering and Development Centre
(WEDC) at Loughborough University. The core research team was Ian Ross (OPM), Rebecca
Scott (WEDC), Ana Mujica (OPM) and Mike Smith (WEDC). The broader team who contributed to
the study included Zach White, Rashid Zaman and Simon Brook from OPM, as well as Andy
Cotton and Sam Kayaga from WEDC. Andy Peal (independent consultant) also contributed to
certain aspects of the methodology.

The inputs of many other World Bank staff, consultants and data collection firms are acknowledged
with thanks from the task team. They have contributed to the research, findings, analysis and
reviews but are too numerous to mention.

Executive summary
Overview and key FSM service delivery challenge

Balikpapan city, located in the province of East Kalimantan, Indonesia has a reported population of
approximately 640,000 people and annual population growth of about 4.5% (approximately 1.5%
due to natural growth and 3% due to immigration). According to the latest health census, 99.5% of
households in Balikpapan own their own home, while only 0.5% rent their property.

A key challenge facing the development of Balikpapan’s sanitation and FSM services is the lack of
clarity around institutional roles and responsibilities, particularly in relation to the provision and
regulation of emptying and transportation services. The DKPP (Agency of Cleanliness, Housing
and Parks – the institution currently undertaking the role of managing any FSM activity in
Balikpapan) manage the septage treatment plant, but play no direct role in the emptying and
transportation elements of FSM services. DKPP focuses on solid waste management, constructing
roads and drainage. It is unclear who, if anyone supervises and issues permits for the construction
of on-site containment (tanks and pits), exacerbated by a lack of standards, guidelines and norms.

Study findings

The fecal waste flow diagram for Balikpapan shows that, while almost 90% of households have
access to non-networked sanitation facilities (predominantly pour-flush latrines emptying into
tanks), service arrangements for managing fecal sludge beyond these tanks are limited. Almost
60% of on-site facilities are reported to have never been emptied, limiting demand for the emptying
services, provided by private providers. Where households do have fecal waste removed, it is often
indiscriminately dumped, resulting in little of the fecal sludge generated being taken to the septage
treatment plant.

Analysis of demand and supply for FSM services highlights that, while private providers of
emptying services are available, the demand for these services is restricted. Results of a
willingness to pay survey identified that the majority of households are prepared to pay for a
monthly desludging service, at a price commensurate with the fees currently charged for emptying
– if this is assumed to occur approximately every 5 years. The current low demand for emptying is
however exacerbated by a combination of the poor quality of onsite infrastructure and the lack of
regulation to enforce regular emptying. Households predominantly rely on non-compliant standards
of containment facilities, where pour-flush latrines discharge to a single or double compartment
“cubluk” (rather than a well-constructed septic tank). As its is only partially lined, the cubluk
operates as a soak-pit. Other containment facilities have overflows that allow fecal sludge to
discharge into drains or open water bodies. Both conditions significantly impact on the required
demand and frequency of emptying.

The City Service Delivery Assessment of Balikpapan highlights priority areas for action to establish
and implement city-wide plans to improve FSM services, together with associated budgets. It is
important that private sector providers of emptying services are incentivized to both stimulate and
meet demand for affordable FSM services, as well as to correctly use the disposal site in a way
that is economical. This must be accompanied by attention given to improving technical standards
and arrangements of on-site facilities, with consideration for a range of emptying services that can
reach into poor areas and provide affordable services. Without this, demand for emptying services
will continue to be constrained.

Next steps for the city

Presentation of the Fecal Waste Flow diagram to city officials in Balikpapan resulted in an
immediate acceptance of the problems facing FSM services. This lead to a constructive discussion
on “How do we solve this?” and “Who should be responsible for doing what? ”. A Sanitation
Working Group has been established and a City Sanitation Strategy (CSS) developed that lays out
targets and identifies required sanitation development activities. This in turn has enabled the Head
of Bappeda (the City Planning Agency) and the city Mayor to identify and propose new institutional
arrangements to enhance FSM services and effective treatment of septage from on-site sanitation
systems at the treatment facilities. Policy, regulatory and legislative arrangements to support these
changes will need to be developed. Budget allocations, poorly coordinated in the past, will need to
be oriented in line with the new institutional arrangements as they are translated into law and
responsibilities for asset ownership transferred.

The local House of Representatives has been formulating a sanitation law, with regulation focusing
on issues of tariffs and off-site sewerage services. It has been identified that the development of a
new city sanitation master plan should include regulation around non-networked services and
private sector emptying, to ensure these issues are included in future legislation. While new
institutional arrangements and plans for FSM services, as part of the sanitation master plan, are
starting to be addressed, consideration will need to be given to the costings (investment and
recovery) for a range of service levels and intervention options, to support implementation.
Bappeda have indicated plans to invest in more private sector-operated desludging trucks and
construction of a new septage treatment plant. Use of emptying services by households is currently
constrained by cost, location and access (to the property and into the tank itself), especially for the
urban poor. Those who use desludging services report being satisfied with them, but the sanitation
master plan must also identify how these services will expand to meet future demand, to ensure
safe transfer of fecal sludge to effectively managed treatment facilities.

1          Introduction and Research Framework

1.1        About this report
This report summarises the main findings of a study on fecal sludge management in Balikpapan,
Indonesia. It forms one of the city case studies within the project entitled ‘Fecal Sludge
Management: Diagnostics for Service Delivery in Poor Urban Areas’, here inafter “the FSM
research project”. This work is funded by the World Bank’s Water Global Practice (formerly the
Water and Sanitation Programme). There are five city case studies as part of this project
(Balikpapan in Indonesia, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Hawassa in Ethiopia, Lima in Peru and Santa
Cruz in Bolivia).

This project is led by Oxford Policy Management (OPM) in partnership with the Water, Engineering
and Development Centre (WEDC) at Loughborough University. The full TOR for the global FSM
research project can be provided on request. The overall objective of the global research is: “to
work with the WSP urban sanitation team to develop the methodology, design, develop survey
instruments and undertake analysis of data collected from field case studies (linked to World Bank
operations projects), refine the diagnostic tools and develop decision-making tools and guidelines
for the development of improved FSM services.” The scope includes the need for city -wide fecal
sludge (or septage) management services with a focus on poor urban communities.

This document is one of several that are part of the FSM research project, and is not intended as a
stand-alone report. It is based on extracted data from several studies as part of technical
assistance in Balikpapan by the World Bank, as indicated in Table 2. As such, this report does not
contain much background information on Balikpapan as the assumed audiences are the World
Bank project team together with others familiar with or interested in Balikpapan and its context,
including the relevant municipal, regional and federal authorities. The full FSM research project
Inception report, available on request, contains more background information on the global
research project and the methodology, including the Research Framework.

The report’s structure is detailed below. It begins with a brief introduction to the research and the
city of Balikpapan, followed by sections analysing the overall urban sanitation context which are
not specific to FSM. Thereafter, the report’s focus is on the FSM services and market in particular.


1.2        Study rationale
It is common for poor people living in the urban areas of most low-income countries to use on-site
sanitation facilities, or to defecate in the open. Even when improved on-site options are used to
contain excreta, in many cities there exist limited services for the collection, transport and disposal
or treatment of the resulting fecal sludge. Few opportunities for resource recovery through end-use
of fecal sludge exist. The service delivery gaps within and between the stages of the sanitation
service chain become more apparent as urban sanitation access increases. Failure to ensure
strong links throughout the fecal sludge management (FSM) service chain results in untreated
fecal sludge (FS) contaminating the environment, with serious implications for human health.

Despite this, there are few tools and guidelines to help city planners navigate complex FSM
situations, despite increasing demand. This study builds on existing frameworks and diagnostic
tools, in particular the use of the City Service Delivery Assessment scorecard and Fecal Waste
Flow Diagram (SFD), as indicated in Figure 1. The diagnostic and decision-support tools are
themselves based on tried-and-tested strategic planning approaches and frameworks, with a focus
on practicality, while the overall global research aimed to update and develop a wider range of


                                                                                                      7

tools and guidelines based on the results of five case study cities. In most of the study cities, this
has been supported by interaction with city stakeholders involved in ongoing World Bank lending.
Acknowledging the difficulty of reforming FSM services in cities, the political economy dimensions
of FSM are explicitly included as part of the overall analysis.

How the full set of diagnostic and decision-support tools and program design guidelines fit together
is represented in Figure 1 that follows. It is more fully explained in accompanying study documents,
available on request.

The specific objectives of the Balikpapan city case study are:

        To provide quantitative and qualitative data on the sanitation situation in Balikpapan, from a
         socio-economic perspective, specifically as they relate to FSM;

        To provide initial recommendations to guide discussions around future interventions in the
         sanitation sector in Balikpapan, by contributing credible data and analysis; and

        To inform the development and use of the analytical tools and guidelines where applied to
         both current and supplementary studies, using a mix of results as sources of primary and
         secondary data.

The Balikpapan case study was primarily socio-economic rather than technical, although it did
include a limited level of technical inspection of sub-surface infrastructure (tanks and pits) for the
benefit of other World Bank operations.

During the inception stage, the OPM/WEDC team developed a Research Framework (RF), based
on the overarching research questions implicit in the TOR and draft research protocol. From these
questions, a logical set of project components were developed, and data collection instruments
devised that would help in the collection of data for the indicators making up each component. The
approach taken in the research is to place all components – as well as ensuing results – of the
study, within the context of the FSM service chain, to optimise its relevance and effectiveness. This
is clear from the full version of the RF in the study Inception report, with all components and
questions arranged along the service chain.

The initial structure of components from the Inception report is reflected in Table 1 below.

The study methodology used for the Balikpapan city study is described in the next section. It
should be noted that the study methodology used for Balikpapan is different to that proposed in the
Research Framework for the full FSM research project. Field studies were ongoing in Balikpapan,
from which data sets were to be utilised for this research alongside commissioned consultancy-
based research to identify data for aspects of this FSM study. This commissioned work was carried
out prior to final agreement of all data collection instruments for the other city studies.

Primary data was partially collected in Balikpapan as part of this research (in relation to the
demand/ supply assessment, FS characteristics and observation of service providers). As such,
not all of the tools have been used to their full capacity. This report also draws on data collected by
the World Bank for internal uses and synthesises the findings from several studies.

2                  Methodology

2.1                Overall design
The study in Balikpapan varied from the overall Research Framework identified in Section 1.3, as
significant amounts of data had been collected prior to the global FSM study. The instruments used
for this purpose are summarised in Table 2 below. The OPM/WEDC team did not oversee the
collection of any additional primary data. In addition to the data collection outlined, the local Health
Department and City Planning Agency (Bappeda) recently conducted a health ‘census’ which
included survey questions relating to sanitation.

                                          survey


Unlike other city studies, where the OPM/WEDC team led on methodology and analysis, for
Balikpapan certain components of the study were integrated with an ongoing World Bank- WSP
technical assistance project. Data collection was managed through an in-house Willingness-to-Pay
and Customer Satisfaction survey (WTP/CS) plus a separate study using a contracted consultant.
An intern supported the primary data collection using instruments 3, 4 and 5 in the table above.

This section briefly summarises each instrument and the following section describes the sampling
approach.



                                                                                                                   11

Social and Technical surveys

The Willingness To Pay (WTP) survey collected data on the household’s socio-economic status,
attitudes to sanitation, previous experiences of pit/tank emptying, reasons for selecting service
providers and willingness to pay for emptying services. The survey did not collect data on the
containment facility itself.

The Customer Satisfaction (CS) survey also collected data on the household’s socio-economic
status, previous experiences of pit/tank emptying, reasons for selecting service providers and
willingness to pay for emptying services. In addition, data was collected on the satisfaction with the
emptying service.

For the technical survey, data was also collected about the household’s containment facility,
including design elements relevant to FSM service delivery (emptying fecal sludge from tanks/pits).
                                                                            1

Observation of service provider practices

An observation protocol involved making visual inspections about fecal sludge (FS) management
from pits or tanks to final disposal, in particular watching service providers (SPs) go about their
business. It required identification of hazards, hazardous events, and an assessment of possible
risks at each stage (containment, emptying, conveyance, treatment and end-use or disposal) of the
fecal sludge management chain.

Testing fecal sludge characteristics

The characteristics of fecal sludge will vary, depending on factors such as the length of time for
which it has been stored, the season, and the storage conditions e.g. whether the sludge was in a
lined or unlined pit. Assessment of the characteristics was required at three stages: (i) during
removal, as this will influence the removal methods that could be used, (ii) prior to treatment, as
this will influence how the fecal sludge can be transported and treated, and possible resource
recovery options pre-treatment, and (iii) after treatment, as this will determine the resource value of
the end product derived from the treated fecal sludge.

Key informant interviews (KIIs)

Key informant interviews (KIIs) are the way in which primary information was sought to address
key questions about how both the ‘enabling environment’ and the operating environment affects
FSM services (past, current and future). KIIs were held with stakeholders having responsibility or

  Due to the multiple levels of purposive sampling and the various conditions applied in selection of the households, it is
not possible to say that the results are representative of Balikpapan city, or any of the sub-city locations. The Social
survey report does not identify that the data is representative of Balikpapan, but rather refers to results as being in
relation to the percentage of respondents.

                                                                                                                          12

interest in FSM services at city-level, allowing the enabling and operating environments to be
better understood in relation to their influence within the city. Informants interviewed included
Chairmen of city neighbourhoods, staff of local government departments (including Urban Planning
and Settlement, Public Works), the Municipal Water Company and other agencies such as the
Department of Revenue (in charge of land and building tax) and the State Electricity Company.

Focus Group Discussion (FGDs)

FGD participants were recruited by the research team, along with the head of the neighbourhood,
based on certain characteristics. These included; having their own toilet, being from low- or middle-
income socio-economic status and willing to participate. In FGDs with three groups of women,
transect walks were added, in which the FGD participants were invited to see the condition of
water and sanitation in the settlement community by observing and asking about issues related to
sanitation.


2.2        Sampling

2.2.1      Sub-samples and sampling units

All three surveys (WTP and CS for the Social Surveys and the Technical Survey) draw from the
same sample frame. Areas for the surveys were purposively selected in collaboration with local
government: the City Planning Bureau (Bappeda), the Department of Hygiene, the Agency of
Cleanliness, Housing and Parks (DKPP) and the Civil Order, Politics and National Unity Services.
Three sub-districts were selected as the focus of the study: Tengah, Kota and Selatan.

Within each sub-district four Kelurahan (Administrative Villages) were then also purposively
selected. This selection was based on: wealth status (low and middle-income); population density
(high); location (coastal and inland); and areas without any sanitation programmes. Within each
Kelurahan a list of households who were beneficiaries of the subsidised rice scheme (Raskin) was
provided by the head of the neighbourhood. From this list households were randomly selected for
interview for the WTP survey. For the CS survey, neighbourhood heads identified suitable
households, i.e. those that had emptied their pits in the last three years. Households that had been
interviewed for any sanitation-related survey in the last 6 months were excluded.

From the households selected for interview in the WTP and CS surveys, a sub-set were also
selected to be included in the Technical survey. An additional 11 households who receive Raskin
were also selected randomly from other sub-districts.

Because of the multiple selection criteria used, the surveys cannot be said to be random
household surveys, or representative of Balikpapan as a whole. Where possible in the report, data
from the WTP and CS surveys are presented alongside data from a recent city-wide Health
Census, to allow for a comparison.

2.2.2      Sampling in the other instruments

Testing FS characteristics

Grab samples of FS were taken from a range of sample locations across the city and across the
sanitation chain. All samples were collected between 12pm and 5pm on the same day. The
samples were then flown to a laboratory in Jakarta and as such were tested the following day.



                                                                                                   13
Report of a FSM study in Balikpapan, Indonesia


Samples of initial FS were taken from three sites in Balikpapan: one sample from a factory septic
tank and two samples from households. Samples were also taken from stages of the fecal sludge
treatment plant (IPLT), two manure fertiliser sites and from an emptying company dumping site.
Details of the samples are shown in Table 4.

Key informant interviews (KIIs) and Focus Group Discussion (FGDs)

The total number of interviews required, as well as the range and extent of questioning, was
influenced by the availability of current and reliable data from other sources, as well as constraints
on time and resources. Selection of interviewees was purposive, based on advice received from
stakeholders and existing knowledge of the World Bank consultant.

Six FGDs were conducted either with a group of men and women, from poor households and
middle economic status. FGD participants involved members of the community who are in the
Willingness To Pay survey area for regular desludging services, but different households to survey
respondents were recruited, to gain a different insight.

3          Background to Balikpapan city

3.1        Balikpapan overview
Balikpapan city is located in the province of East Kalimantan. The city is the gateway to East
Kalimantan and has ports for activities related to petroleum. The latest population data (2012)
reports 637,448 people living in Balikpapan (Population and Civil Registration District Municipality).
Balikpapan is the second largest city in East Kalimantan after Samarinda. Population growth is
4.5%; 1.5% due to natural growth and 3% from immigration. Table 5 shows the population levels of
the 6 sub-cities.

Data based on projection by the Civil and Population Dinas Office (Disduk) of Balikpapan City
Planning Department (BAPPEDA)

The city is roughly 50,000 hectares (~500 Km2), with the majority of areas below 100 metres above
sea level. The topography of the city is reported to be 85% hilly and 15% flat. Geologically, the soil
is mainly yellow-red podsols and silica sand, which is extremely prone to erosion and landslides.
Weathered rock material, usually hard and eroded, can be found in the area.

The average year-round temperature is about 27°C and annual rainfall approximately 2,800 mm
which occurs steadily throughout the year.

According to the Department of Health’s Balikpapan Health Census, or Survei Jaga Kelurahan,
2014, 99.5% of households in Balikpapan own their own home, while only 0.5% rent.


3.2        Balikpapan’s sanitation context
The local government has established an active Sanitation Working Group and developed a City
Sanitation Strategy which lays out the targets and required sanitation development activities in an
action plan for 2011-2016.

Within Balikpapan, there are a range of organisations involved in santiation. These are shown in
the following Figure 2.




                                                                                                      15

Figure 2           Institutional arrangement for sewerage and septage management, Balikpapan




The IPLT (septage treatment plant) falls under the DKPP (Agency of Cleanliness, Housing and
Park) with the UPTD (Unit Pelaksana Teknis Daerah), acting as the technical implementing unit.
UPTD does not manage the septage treatment plant well, focussing more of their capacity on solid
waste management activities. There is also little interaction between those responsible for septage
management (the DKPP and/or UPTD) and the Water Utility (PDAM) who is responsible for
managing the wastewater treatment plant (IPAL).

The ocal government City Planning Agency (Bappeda) has identified that a new Technical Unit will
be created to manage fecal waste only, taking the responsibility away from the current responsible
agencies into one combined unit. Reasons for the development of this new Technical Unit have
been noted as:

     to improve efficiency in the management of the whole fecal sludge sector, through one unit;
     to make it easier to manage the planning, budgeting and implementation of projects related to
      fecal sludge; and
     to allow for cross-subsidy of service provision between rich and poor households.


For the purposes of this study, the focus is primarily the management of fecal sludge from
household latrines (the containment stage) through to its end-use/disposal. The study does not
focus on the structural conditions of the latrine itself, so much as the extent to which it contains /
does not contain fecal sludge and what happens to the fecal sludge from this stage onwards. For
this reason, later sections of this report refer to different categories for household sanitation
facilities and assesses fecal sludge management in relation to the service chain indicated in Figure
3 below.

4             Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams

4.1           Introduction
Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams (also known as SFDs) in their current form arise from WSP’s 12-city
study of FSM (Peal et al., 2013). In short, an SFD is a visualisation of how FS flows along the
sanitation service chain. At each stage of the chain, the proportion is indicated which is or is not
effectively managed to the next stage of the chain. At the end of the chain, the proportion of FS
which is effectively managed is indicated as “safe”, with the remaining proportion deemed “unsafe”,
and the primary destination of that FS indicated (e.g. groundwater, local environment, drains etc.)2

Thus far, SFDs in different cities have been undertaken using different methodologies, as is often
necessary in the context of poor data availability. Furthermore, most SFDs so far (including those
in the 12-city study) were undertaken using secondary data and expert estimates. This study is the
first to use primary household survey data and field-based observations to construct SFDs. A
group of urban sanitation experts is currently discussing the ‘roll-out’ of the use of SFDs, for which
other methodologies will be developed.3


4.2           Methodology
For this analysis, several key indicators from the Technical survey can be used for assessing the
containment facility used and household blackwater disposal. Particular data from the survey
questions can be used to identify information relating to:4

         i)    Toilet type: response options are Pour flush / Cistern flush / Other

         ii) Where black water is discharged to: response options are Underground tank, Storm
               water drain, Stream/canal/river, Pond, City sewerage/communal system, Unknown

         iii) If there is an underground tank, where the tank discharges to: response options are
              Pipe to soil/ soak pit/leach field, Pipe to city sewerage/ communal system, To drain/
              stream/river, No outlet pipe, Other, Unknown

         iv) How often the tank has been emptied in the last 5 years

         v) When the tank was last emptied

         vi) Why the tank was emptied

         vii) Who emptied the tank

The Health Census also collected comparable data, on all but item iii).

Of these, question ii) is the most crucial for the construction of the SFD. It should be noted that the
household’s response is taken as given in the case of the health census. In the case of the
Technical survey, observations were made on the above ground infrastructure and measurements
taken of below ground infrastructure (dimensions and depth) from the surface.


2
  It is acknowledged that FS may pass from drains into other water bodies, e.g. rivers, but the diagram focuses on the
primary destination.

Report of a FSM study in Balikpapan, Indonesia


To analyse this data, an SFD matrix is created, as shown in ¡Error! No se encuentra el origen de
la referencia. below. It shows which data sources are used and how they are analysed into levels
of effective / ineffective management of fecal waste through the stages of the service chain – with
results in the next section.

First, the Technical survey data on types of infrastructure is used to allocate households to five
categories shown in the column marked (1) in Table 9 that follows below:

    A.        “Sewered - centralised system” – toilets connected to sewers (not on-site sanitation)
    B.        “De-centralised communal system” – Networked sewerage not connected to the
              main network (i.e. not on-site sanitation or centralised sewerage).
    C.        “On-site storage – contained and emptied” – on-site toilets (either pits or tanks)
              which can be emptied
    D.        “On-site storage – not emptied” – on-site toilets where pits or tanks are sealed and/or
              abandoned once they have filled up
    E.        “Open defecation and direct discharge” – self-explanatory

The data from questions (A) to (E) are allocated in column (2) below (a key shows the meaning of
the colour-coding of cells by data source). Next, the proportions for each of the stages of the chain
are allocated. As can be seen from the ‘collected’ column, a certain proportion of the population’s
FS which makes it to that stage is emptied by a service provider, and the rest is not emptied (e.g.
overflows to drains). This is estimated by dividing the number of households which reported having
had their pit emptied (question (iv) and (v) above), by the number of households using emptiable
technologies as self-reported.

Since data comes from a range of surveys, proportions in the matrix are proportions of households,
not proportions of people or of FS volumes. In Balikpapan, the mean household size was 4.8.5

4.2.1      Sewered households

Details for this section were established from the water utilities records of customer connection,
Euroconsult report and from key informant interviews held at the Wastewater Treatment Plant at
Margasari.

The in-depth analysis done by Euroconsult (2014) on the sewerage system at Margasari did not
define the type of containment facilities that are used by households with access to the sewerage
system. However, it can be assumed from observations made throughout Balikpapan that pour
flush toilets would be used in the majority of households. 99% of respondents stated they had their
own private toilets.

The existing sewerage network and wastewater treatment plant (known locally as Instalasi
Pengolahan Air Limbah, IPAL) was built in the year 2000. The wastewater treatment plant currently
serves two of Balkipapan’s 34 villages (Kelurahan Margasari and Kelurahan Baru).

Records held at the IPAL at Margasari indicate that 1,308 households are connected to the
treatment facility by a conventional sewerage system. Based on 5 people per household, it is
estimated that 6,780 people are served by the sewerage system – or only 1% of the total
population of Balikpapan. As the majority of the population in Balikpapan use pour flush toilets

5
  The SFD involves assumptions that (i) each person produces the same amount of FS and (ii) pit accumulation rates are
constant across the city. This is an approximation but the most pragmatic approach in the context of uncertainty around
FS volumes. FS volume only really becomes an issue when considering the extent of change in service levels needed to
deal with the amounts. This study is primarily about identifying the broader picture of where the management of FS is or
isn’t effective, not what volumes are being managed or mismanaged.

                                                                                                                     19
Report of a FSM study in Balikpapan, Indonesia


(WSP technical survey indicated 97.6% of respondents use a pour flush toilet), an assumed value
of 60 l/capita/day is used on which to make an assumption about the flows entering the sewerage
system in Balikpapan.

Once the sewage reaches the IPAL the effluent from the sedimentation tanks pass through a
series of chamber for dewatering. The sludge produced from the IPAL is then dried and is utilised
for internal gardening and for landscaping at some PDAM offices (There is approximately 4-5m3 of
sludge removed per month which is mixed with rice husk (using 25 bags of 50kg at Rp4000/bag
per month). This is dried onsite for about 2 weeks. The liquid effluent is used for gardening,
cleaning and collected for the fire department.

4.2.2      On-site, non-networked facilities

Data in this section was gathered from interviews with the private emptying companies which
currently provide tank emptying in Balikpapan, interviews with informants from the DKPP who are
currently operating the IPLT, the Technical survey and from results of the Euroconsult household
survey.

Containment
The Technical survey results show that the majority of fecal sludge is discharged to an
underground tank. 98% of adults report using their own toilet, while 2% use a facility shared with
neighbours. For children the results indicated that 65% of children use their own toilet, 5% use a
shared toilet, 3% openly defecate and 27% of respondents dispose of their children’s fecal waste
into a plastic bag which goes into the trash.

The Technical survey undertaken in Balikpapan showed that the location of the tank varies; 36%
being located under the floor in the house, 2.6% under the floor but visible, 41% located at the
back of the house, 9% at the front of the house, 10.3% at the side of the house and 13% did not
know. Overall, 16.7% of tanks had good access available to them, 32.1% had no access but the
tank was visible and 48.7% had no access and were under tiles. The survey results showed that
27.9% of household’s surveyed were over 70m from an access road. Also , the majority of tanks
were shown to be over 10 years old (57.7%).

The Technical survey found that most on-site sanitation systems are emptied infrequently. It is
difficult to indicate the frequency of emptying because the number of respondents who had actually
emptied (n=4) was so low. However, it does raise the question of whether the tanks used are
actually containing the fecal sludge in a sealed tank. The Technical survey results, for which 49%
of respondents are using an onsite facility which has an unsealed base, may provide an indication
as to why the tanks do not need emptying as fecal sludge is then percolating through the bottom of
the tank. Another reason why tanks do not require emptying may be their size, as the Technical
survey showed the average volume of the tanks measured was over 4m3. Further analysis of
filling rates (depending on the local context) would be required to confirm whether these are valid
reasons why the demand for desludging is so low in Balikpapan.

A similar figure was found by the Euroconsult survey which indicated only 9% of respondents (88
people) with underground tanks had ever undertaken tank emptying. The frequency of emptying
was shown to vary, but the mode was every 10 years and the average approximately every 6.4
years. A recent study focusing on the assessment of sludge accumulation and pit filling rates in
Indonesia (Mills, et al, 2014) indicated the contributing factors for the low frequency of
accumulation in Indonesia are;

   High year-round ambient temperatures,

                                                                                                 20
Report of a FSM study in Balikpapan, Indonesia


   No solid waste content in tanks,
   Type of tank used (bottomless) and the contents of the tank being low strength (high water
    content) causes the majority of contents to easily infiltrate into the ground,
   Tanks containing outlet pipes which discharge contents out of the tank and reduce
    accumulation rates,
   Low numbers of users,
   Limited understanding of household for the need to regularly desludge.



Emptying/ transport
There are currently three private tank emptying companies working in Balikpapan. Previously, the
local government ran their own vacuum tanker but this broke down 2 years ago and has not been
replaced. Only vacuum tankers are used for the emptying and transportation of fecal sludge in
Balikpapan and no manual emptying or other methods were observed. Most of the trucks are
Mitsubishi trucks and consist of a steel tank, vacuum pump, hose (70-80m length) and bucket.

During interviews with the owners of the emptying companies in Balikpapan information was
collected on the standard operating procedures. The standard operating procedures for tank
emptying is observed to be non-written, verbal and ad-hoc. Only one of the three emptying
companies (Bunga Lemo) was shown to keep records of their customer base and operations.

Treatment
Only two of the private sector tank emptying companies transport the septage collected to the
designated IPLT at Manggar. The largest private sector emptying company, Bangu Lemo,
transports and dumps the septage indiscriminately on their own land located close to the site of the
IPLT. A recent technical review of the IPLT showed there to be a number of fundamental problems
with the design and functionality of the IPLT and indicated the facility is impossible to operate
efficiently so therefore recommends that a new facility should be built (ensuring properly
considered design).

End-use/disposal
Currently none of the solid effluent from the IPLT is reused. Disposal of dried septage sludge
occurs adjacent to the IPLT bed structure. The sludge is removed periodically (every 6 months, but
there are no records of this operation and the growth of vegetation on the drying beds suggests
that it is done infrequently. The liquid effluent from the tanks outflows to the IPAL downstream of
the landfill.


4.3        Results

4.3.1      Survey results as an input to the SFD

Due to the structure of the survey questions it is not possible to map the survey responses to JMP
questionnaires. However, the surveys do tell us the sanitation situation in Balikpapan is relatively
uniform. As per the Technical survey, 99% of respondents have their own private latrine; 92% are
squat toilets (99% in the health census); 98% are flush latrines; 92% of these empty to a septic
tank or pit (97.7% in the health census).




                                                                                                  21
Report of a FSM study in Balikpapan, Indonesia


Arguably the most important question in our survey is where the contents of toilets go after flushing
or similar. The standard question in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) incorporate this
into the overall sanitation question (see WHO/UNICEF core questions), but it needs to be asked
separately in order to get better quality data.6 We rely on household-reported data for this indicator,
while noting that households may not always know the full detail.

The Technical survey identified that 97.6% of the 85 latrines examined were pour-flush latrines
discharging to a septic tank, pit or to an open water body. 1.2%, or 1 household system, was found
to discharge to a sewer. The Health Census report similarly identified that 97.7% of households
use septic tanks for onsite containment, 1.9% of households are connected to the sewer network
and the remaining 0.4% use other means of disposal. Table 7 presents the two sets of survey data.

60% of households in the Technical survey reported constructing their containment facility outside
of the house itself, with 38% reporting constructing the facility within the household. The Health
Census data reported that 99.5% of respondents have the tank located ‘in the yard’, which may
equate to both categories of response in the Technical survey.

The Technical survey identified that 88.5% of respondents reported making use of a single tank as
their containment facility, with 70% reporting the tank as having two or more compartments.
Similarly, the Health Census reported over 67% of tanks having two or more compartments.

The Health Census also reported just over 2% of housholds having their containment facility
located in a flood-prone region. In the Technical survey just under 6% of respondents reported that
they were flooded at least once per year (the remaining 94% reported never being flooded).

 As stated above, the question asked in the Technical Survey sought to answer the questions “Where is blackwater
discharged to?” and “Where is the discharge from the underground tank?”.

Taking the Health Census results, approximately 41% of households have emptied their
containment facility. The Technical survey puts this figure at a much lower value of 22.2%. Both
results highlight that FSM emptying services have not been engaged by the majority of the
surveyed population.

The following table show details of the values used to generate a fecal waste flow matrix for
Balikpapan based primarly on the Technical survey results. Further consultation between staff of
the World Bank and consultants knowledgeable about the city, values were refined and adjusted to
better suit the realities and experiences known to the staff. This also includes assumptions made
about the safety of discharges of FS and effluent into the various geographical domains –
particularly in relation to the groundwater.

4.4          Presentation of SFD
Using all these results, we are able to construct a fecal waste flow diagram (SFD) for Balikpapan
city. This is presented as Figure 4 below. SFDs work on the same principle as the matrix shown
above. Household’s toilet technology and associated containment method is shown on the left, with
intermediate steps and primary destination of the FS shown along the sanitation service chain.
What is clear from this SFD is that the proportion of waste entering the environment due to poor
containment is far less than that entering the environment through other parts of the chain.

4.5        Implications of the SFD for FSM in Balikpapan
As visualised in the SFD, roughly 19% of the fecal waste that is not safely managed is due to poor,
or a lack of, onsite containment. The remaining 47% of the fecal waste that is unsafely managed is
due to what happens after containment.

While almost 90% of households have access to non-networked sanitation facilities (predominantly
pour-flush latrines emptying to tanks), service arrangements for managing fecal sludge beyond
these tanks are limited. Almost 60% of on-site facilities are reported to have never been emptied,
limiting demand for the emptying services, provided by private providers. Where households do
have fecal waste removed, it is often indiscriminately dumped, resulting in very little of the fecal
sludge generated actually being taken to the septage treatment plant.

On a more positive note, the SFD clearly shows that the FSM services in the city are functional to
some extent through all stages of the service chain, in the sense that over 10% of fecal waste
reaches treatment centres via FSM services and that some of that waste of safely managed.
Similarly some of the fecal waste entering the conventional sewer system and the decentralised
networks are safely treated.

5          FSM service potential demand and supply assessment

5.1        Introduction
This chapter provides a brief assessment of demand and supply for FSM services in Balikpapan.
At this stage, it is important to note the difference between potential (or notional) demand and
effective demand. We consider the potential demand for FSM services to be the type and quantity
of services which would be demanded in the absence of any market failures or distortions. This is
different from effective demand, which is the type and quantity of services actually purchased in
the context of current supply and current prices. As only approximately 2% of the respondents in
the Health Census and Technical Survey have a sewer connection and there is very little open
defecation, the potential demand for FSM services would appear to be signficiant. This is partially
reflected in the already functioning FSM services in the city.

On the supply side, we consider what types of FSM services the market is currently providing to
households.7 Dimensions of supply include the number of service providers of different types
(manual, mechanical etc.), the geographical areas they serve and the prices they charge.


5.2        Household demand for FSM services
The research framework (Section 1.3) set out to answer the following question: “What is the
existing customer demand and preferences for FSM services?”, i.e. the current effective demand.

Results are presented below in relation to four key area affecting demand: tenancy status,
accessibility of facilities for emptying equipment, age of the containment facility and willingness to
pay for emptying services. The full report (Kennedy-Walker, 2014) contains further results taken
from the Technical survey and results from a Euroconsult Study.

5.2.1      Tenancy status

The incentives that drive demand for improved FSM services are influenced by who is responsible
for the ongoing maintenance to keep toilets functioning. Overwhelmingly the respondents of both
surveys report that they either own their home or it is owned by a family member; 86% in the
Technical survey and 99.5% in the Health Census. This makes the households themselves as an
extremely important stakeholder, being responsible for the emptying of their own facility. This is
more so than in other cities where landlords or the government themselves own or manage a much
larger proportion of properties.

  FSM services are obviously also demanded by the government, businesses etc. but households are the focus of this
study.

5.2.2      Accessibility of the containment facility

Focusing on the containment facility itself, Table 11 below shows the accessibility of the main
pit/tank structure based on findings from the Technical survey. This reports that nearly 50% of
respondents do not have a tank with an access point and that the tank is under the floor;
presenting considerable difficulty with regards to emptying. A further 32% of respondents report
that there is no access point but that the tank itself is visible. Only 16.7% of respondents observed
have a tank access suitable for easy emptying.

The enumerators of the Technical survey were required to make a judgement on whether an
emptying point could be created. For over 82% of the sample the enumerators judged that an entry
point to the tanks could not be created. In the Willingness to Pay and Customer satisfaction
surveys the respondents who had emptied there pit (n=78) were asked about access; 46%
reported that access had to be made by breaking through the floor or concrete. This suggests that
in addition to any amount paid for emptying services there are additional costs associated with
repairing parts of the house and pit/tank. Despite this 96.9% of respondents were satisfied with the
access to their tank (see Table 14 below)

The Health Census and the Technical survey do not have comparable results for this aspects, as
the Health Census asked a simple yes/no question on access via manhole – resulting in 80.4% of
respondents reporting that their tank had manhole access. Though the Health Census has a
considerably larger sample size, the degree to which the observed Technical survey data disagree
with the self-reported Health Census data is beyond that observed around other questions. In this
case more credence should be given to the Technical survey data as the observational data was
collected by trained enumerators and is considered as more reliable. Due to the Technical
Survey’s purposive sampling methodology however, the results cannot be said to be
representative of Balikpapan as a whole.

5.2.2.1 Fill rate

Data on the type of containment was already shown in Table 7¡Error! No se encuentra el origen

tanks to fill. However, in both surveys a large majority stated that they had never emptied their
tank; 77.8% in the Technical Survey and 59.3% in the Health Census. Table 12 below shows the
ages of the tanks as reported in the Technical Survey. 42.3% of tanks are less than 10 years old.
Of the respondents of the Willingness to Pay Survey and the Customer Satisfaction survey 62.8%
of respondents that report having emptied their tank in the last 5 years have a tank aged over 10

years. 58.3% of the respondents who reported never to have emptied their tank have a septic tank
aged 10 years or less. This suggests then that current demand for FSM services is a poor guide to
what future demand may, be even if household access to sanitation and the containment facilities
used for blackwater does not change.

The Willingness to Pay survey asked respondents directly the amount they would consider paying
for a monthly emptying service. The results are presented Table 13 below, the figures are
presented as an annual cost of subscription as opposed to a monthly cost. The exchange rate
taken is the 2014 period average as the original survey was conducted in early 2014.

81% of respondents expressed an interest in having a regular desludging service. 37.7% of
respondents were willing to pay up to 5.1 USD annually for this and a further 44.4% of respondents
were willing to pay between 5.2 – 11.1 USD for the service, with the remaining 18.1% willing to pay
over that amount.

Four (4) respondents in the Technical Survey reported paying an average of 287,500 Rs (24 USD)
(range: 150,000–450,000 Rs) for emptying services. For current service levels and assuming tanks

would have to be emptied every 5 years, respondents are expressing a willingness to pay at a rate
suited to the current service level. However, given the relatively small number of respondents to
this question, it is not possible to draw any conclusions for Balikpapan as a whole.

During the FGDs with the communities, the majority of participants queried the monthly payment
method for regular desludging. It was also highlighted that those who had had their tank emptied
before felt that regular emptying every 4 years was acceptable, however those who hadn’t felt that
this time period was too short, as the tank would not be full in that time. The following issues were
raised:

   If people do not pay all their instalments (over 4 years) how will they be punished?
   Is it possible for the service providers to implement the program where they live? (e.g.
    respondents in narrow streets)
   Who is responsible for the programme? If there is a problem with the programme who do they
    contact? It should be clear.
   For those renting- if they are involved in the scheme and pay on a monthly basis but they then
    move before the emptying how does that work?
   Female participants from the middle income community raised concerns about if the
    programme didn't sustain and they have paid monthly instalments.
   If instalments were utilised then there were three alternative payment mechanism preferred;
    PDAM billing, PLN and head of RT. However, each payment must be transparent and evidence
    of payment must be provided.


Respondents from the middle-income community were shown to be less interested in the monthly
payment scheme, as they perceived that they could afford to pay for the service in one lump sum
rather than in monthly instalments. These respondents also highlighted that each tank should be
assessed for its feasibility for regular desludging. Those tanks that are not up to standard should
then be repaired prior to regular desludging being conducted. These findings highlight issues which
may affect peoples’ willingness to accept/pay for regular emptying services.

Community leaders indicated that they thought regular emptying was an interesting idea which
could bring benefits to health and the environment in the community. It was highlighted that before
such a scheme could be implemented socialisation within the community about the idea would be
needed. This would be needed to highlight to the community why regular emptying was needed,
the benefit of the service and how it would be managed. The community leaders highlighted that
there would need to be agreement from the community as it involves monthly payments from them.

5.2.3      Household satisfaction with current services

Households were asked to express their satisfaction with current services – both the sanitation
facility itself and the emptying services used – across a range of factors, as shown in the tables
following. Overall, as shown in Table 14, the respondents of the WTP and CS surveys who have
had their tanks emptied showed a high degree of satisfaction with the services provided.

5.3        Supply of FSM services
The majority of containment facilities in Balikpapan are constructed by locally trained masons that
function in an informal way. It can be assumed that they receive no formal training (unlike
‘builders’) and their capacity to construct a range of domestic and public facilities is unclear.Iit
would appear from the range and types of facilities observed during the Technical study that there
is limited knowledge of standards of the facilities built (i.e. many are non-compliant with national
regulations).

In terms of emptying and transport services, Table 15 highlights certain elements of current
institutional capacity of these private operators.

Table 15           Institutional capacity of current FSM emptying and transportation services
 Indicators of capacity                Response
                                       3 private emptying services functioning: Bayu, Bunga Lemo and Suyanto

 Number of providers                   UPTD previously ran one 3m³ sludge tanker but this has not been
                                       operational for the last two years. In 2013 the local government won a 4m3
                                       tanker but currently this is not being used.
                                       On appearance, Bunga Lemo and Bayu, seem to run as a formal business
                                       with advertisement, business cards etc. On closer inspection the ad-hoc
 Formal/Informal nature
                                       nature of business (on call), the lack of record keeping, lack of permits in
                                       place mean they actually runs in quite an informal manner.
                                       Based on 2 trips/tanker achieved per day:
                                       - Bayu: Empty 4 households per day
 Current capacity
                                       - Bunga Lemo: Empty 10 households per day
                                       - Suyanto: Empty 2 households per day
 Business and cost data                Very limited record keeping done. Costing data (see section above) was
 records                               collected through interviews with owners.
                                       Bayu indicated that they follow oral rules which highlight they should dump

                                       there were any local regulations they must follow.
 Household satisfaction                Majority of respondents are happy with the current service provided by the
 levels with service provided          private sector.
                                       Two stated there is increased capacity and potential to expand services
 Potential for expanding               with the trucks they currently have (assume 2 households/day)
 services                              Also Bunga Lemo indicated potential to expand into smaller truck sizes to
                                       target a new sector of the market.
 Training plans                        No training plans in place.


The estimated physical capacity of these service providers is highlighted in Table 16 below. A
number of assumptions have been made to create this table. Firstly, it is assumed that the process

                                                                                                                  29
Report of a FSM study in Balikpapan, Indonesia


of emptying and transportation takes 2 hours per household (in the case where one load is
equivalent to emptying one households tank) and 3 hours where one tanker has emptied from 2
households. Secondly, it is assumed that the tankers could be active for 6 hours a day and that the
tankers would work 250 days a year (or 21 days/month equivalent).

The annual physical capacity of the trucks is then 18,375m 3 based on serving 3,500 households.
The current volume of sludge collected annually from domestic sources is reported as 3,110m3
(serving 1,404 households).

Private sector emptying companies demonstrate a willingness to invest in FS emptying and
transportation services as they all own at least one of their emptying trucks.

The emptying and transportation stages of the service delivery have been shown to be the most
functioning aspects of FSM services. Support for private sector activity is currently however non-
existent in terms of institutional support, permits to work, support for business expansion and so
on. Very little interaction was observed between private sector providers and local government /
managing institutions – which would be required as components to improve and provide incentives
to scale-up these operations.

6.1        Fecal sludge characteristics
Two sets of fecal sludge samples were collected and tested from a range of locations in
Balikpapan, to investigate the chemical composition and physical characteristics of the sludge. The
first round of samples (March 2014) were undertaken as a test run for the laboratories and the
process of taking the samples, with a second round of samples taken in May 2014. The sampling
methodology for the fecal sludge characteristics are outlined in Section 2.2.2.

Samples of primary fecal sludge were taken from three sites in Balikpapan: one sample from a
factory septic tank and two samples from households. Samples were also taken from two manure
fertiliser sites and from two emptying company dumping sites, see Table 4 above for details.

Samples taken at the IPLT drying beds were from the discharge chamber, and drying beds (tanks)
3 and 4:

    Samples taken within the discharge chamber consisted of fecal sludge that had accumulated
     over time within the chamber (the inlet to the works). The sample was wet-dry in consistency
     and was brown/black in colour with some smell.
    Samples taken from the start of the two drying beds in use (3 and 4) consisted of fresh sludge
     received by the drying beds directly after discharge by the tankers. The sample was wet in
     consistency and black in colour with some smell.
    Samples taken from the end of the two drying beds in use (3 and 4) consisted of fecal sludge
     that had been left to dry for approximately 6 weeks. The sample was wet-dry in consistency,
     black in colour and with some smell (but not as strong as from the start of the drying beds).


Samples were also taken of dried fecal sludge that had been removed from the drying beds and
dumped on adjacent land, about 2 months previously. This sludge was observed as being of dry
consistency, black in colour with very little smell.

Details of the chemical and physical characteristics of the fecal sludge are contained in the full
report by Kennedy-Walker, 2014 and in particular Appendix D of that report. The results show that,
for the samples taken from the households, all samples were of a very liquid consistency that
flowed easily and contained no solid waste.

Calorific value tests were performed on samples taken from the end of the two drying beds, by the
company Sucofindo. The analysed sample was a well-mixed composition from two tanks at the
fecal sludge treatment plant (total sample volume of 1 litre). The sample was taken during the first
round of sampling for testing. The tests were performed using a bomb calorimeter and the results
are indicated in Table 17 below.

The favoured units of Calorific Value for this study is MJ/kg so therefore converted from Kcal/kg the
result achieved is 10.68MJ/kg (conversion used 1 kcal = 0.0041868 MJ).

Additional tests were conducted to analyse FS samples for helminth eggs. Table 18 below
provides the results received from the department of parasitology at the University of Indonesia for
samples taken at two households and the FS drying beds. The techniques used were; direct
examination, sucrose flotation from 5 gram of sludge sample and quantitative analysis of
egg/larvae recovered.

The results highlight that samples are contaminated with some form of helminth egg and therefore
pose a possible risk to humans that may come into contact with sludge directly or soil it has been
applied to through the skin or oral digestion. The laboratory highlighted during analysis that for the
case of A. lumbricoides eggs, there were more fertilised than non-fertilised eggs observed, with
samples from HH#1 and IPLT Tank 4 having fertilised eggs. The lab also found only S. stercoralis
and hookworm in larvae form with no eggs, suggesting the eggs had already hatched.

Chemical characteristics of samples were also analysed using the Environmental Engineering
department at the University of Indonesia. The full report (Kennedy-Walker, 2014) contains details
of the test results.


6.2        Current treatment and end-use
There is currently one fecal sludge treatment facility serving Balikpapan, consisting of a discharge
chamber and four drying beds. The volume of each drying bed is approximately 207m 3 (measured
tank size 23*6*1.5m). Therefore the total volume of the IPLT is 828m 3. If the physical capacity of
the existing private emptying equipment was achieved (73.5m 3 /day) the IPLT would reach its
volumetric capacity in approximately 11 days.

Two drying beds were not functioning at the time of observation and with no operating procedures
or design manuals available, the actual operating capacity is unclear.

Records at the IPLT show 159 loads of FS to the treatment facility in 2013 (no indication of volume
of truck used). The recorded number of loads at the IPLT is much less than those expected (564
loads per year) when calculating from information received from emptying companies (based on 42
trip/month for companies that empty into IPLT). The contrasting information is either down to poor
record keeping at IPLT, incorrect information supplied by emptiers or some of the sludge not being
dumped at the IPLT.

Currently testing of treatment efficiency occurs annually on the liquid influent and effluent to the
IPLT and adjacent IPAL. The sample results observed from interviews held at the IPLT show that
the results do not meet the required effluent standard. Independent samples taken also show that
the effluent does not meet the standards. Interviewees indicated that if the sample results do not

                                                                                                       32

comply with environmental standards nothing is done to change procedure or operation of the
IPLT.

Currently none of the solid effluent from the IPLT is reused, with dried septage sludge disposed of
adjacent to the IPLT bed structure. Operational staff state that the sludge is removed periodically
(every 6 months), but there are no records of this operation and the growth of vegetation on the
drying beds suggests that it is done infrequently. The liquid effluent from the tanks outflows to the
IPAL downstream of the landfill.

Future options for end-use?
Results of recent studies carried out by Sandec/Eawag to analyse the calorific value of fecal
sludge taken from various sources highlight that on average the calorific value of untreated sludge
is 17.3MJ/kg dry solids (Gold, 2013), which compares well with other biomas fuels. Average values
for fecal sludge from on-site sanitation systems in the Sandec study (based in 3 cities in Africa)
were significantly higher than results obtained in Balikpapan. The lower calorific value is possibly
influenced by local diet as well as the practice of using water for anal cleansing. Also given the
humid climate, the level of pre-drying required to achieve a sufficiently low moisture content for the
fecal sludge to act as a viable fuel-source would be technically challenging and unlikely to be cost-
effective.

Together with the chemical and physical characteristics of the fecal sludge, the calorific value
results point to the fact that the fecal waste is very liquid, very dilute and very weak. Collectively
these characteristics suggest that the fecal sludge is likely to be too weak or dilute to be of much
value for any type of beneficial, market-based end-use. Effluent re-use in nearby agricultural areas
may be the most viable option available, if deemed acceptable and the process can be safely
managed.

In relation to potential expansion of the site and services, a new government-owned 4m³ tanker
could provide more loading to IPLT if commissioned. A new IPLT is due to be built in the future-
details of the design and when are unknown. Expansions of service may come about if the running
of the IPLT moves to a new technical unit. Mining companies have indicated they may be
interested in using large qualities of treated sludge for mandatory land reclamation.

7          City Service Delivery Assesssment

7.1        Introduction
The FSM City Service Delivery Assesssment (CSDA) is a crucial part of the analysis of FSM
services. It answers an overarching question around the quality of the FSM enabling environment,
the level of FSM service development and the level of commitment to FSM service sustainability.
The aim of the CSDA is to allow an objective assessment of FSM service performance through all
stages of the service chain, so as to identify priorities for reform. The political economy analysis (in
the next section) then attempts to explain why some the CSDA looks like it does.

Like the Fecal Waste Flow Diagram (see section 4), the CSDA format builds on an approach
developed under the 12-city study (Peal et al. 2013). In turn, the 12-city method was based on
similar exercises in water and sanitation (e.g. Country Status Overviews produced by WSP).

The CSDA is arranged around three broad areas: enabling services, developing services, and
sustaining services. This is illustrated in Table 19 below, alongside the key question associated
with each area, and the indicators used.

7.2        Methodology
The CSDA aims is to be fully objective and transparent, so the analysis is clear and stakeholders
can engage with it and update it over time as the situation improves. It is primarily a qualitative
analysis, based on a review of key documents and interviews with stakeholders at the city level. As
set out in section 2.1, WSP’s overall study design was that the OPM/WEDC team designed the
methodology, but did not do primary data collection. For analyses such as the CSDA and PEA, it is
very hard to separate data collection from analysis.

The collection and preliminary analysis was conducted by a short-term consultant contracted by
WSP, Ruth Kennedy-Walker. Further analysis and additional data were provided by members of
the WB-WSP staff team in Balikpapan in December 2014, with support from Isabel Blackett – to
ensure full scoring of the CSDA.

There are several questions beneath each of the nine overall indicators in Table 19 above, with 21
questions in total. For each question, there are objective criteria to enable a score to be given for
the city, with 0 (poor), 0.5 (developing) or 1 (good) on that question. Each question is scored along


                                                                                                        34

Once all 21 questions are scored, the next step is to aggregate those scores into a city scorecard,
by summing together the scores for each indicator (policy, planning etc.). Because there are
different numbers of questions for each indicator, a final step is required, which is to normalise the
scores to a total out of 3 for each indicator. This is achieved by dividing the city score for that
indicator by the maximum possible city score, multiplying by 3, and finally rounding to the nearest
0.5. This process delivers the overall CSDA scorecard. The output for Balikpapan is shown in
Figure 5 below.

7.3        Findings
The overall CSDA scorecard for Balikpapan is shown above as Figure 5. An explanation for each
score allocated to the full set of 21 questions is shown in Annex A, while the following summaries
the implications of those results.

7.3.1      Enabling

While the policy environment for FSM in Balikpapan remains relatively weak, it is rapidly
developing. The work of the Sanitation Task Force has enabled the new Head of Bappeda and the
city Mayor to identify and propose new institutional arrangements to enhance FSM services and
effective treatment of septage from on-site sanitation systems at the treatment facilities. Policy,
regulatory and legislative arrangements to support these changes will need to be developed.

Budget allocations have been poorly coordinated in the past – and will need to be oriented in line
with the new institutional arrangements, as they are translated into law and responsibilities for
asset ownership transferred.

7.3.2      Developing

There has been a notable lack of government financial support to FSM services, with provision
only for attempting to maintain operation of the septage treatment facility. Bappeda have indicated
plans to invest in more desludging trucks, to be operated by the private sector. Currently emptying
services are mainly provided by private sector providers. Use of emptying services by households
are constrained by cost, location and access (to the property and into the soak pit/ septic tank
itself), especially for the urban poor. Those who use desludging services report being satisfied with
them, but the city sanitation plan does not identify how services will expand to meet future demand
and ensure safety in the transfer of FS through the whole of the service chain.

While FS may be safely collected from containment systems, it is not all transferred to a safe
treatment or disposal location. The treatment facility is not well managed and does not provide
effective treatment at the current loading rates.

7.3.3      Sustaining

The new Sanitation Master Plan – being developed under the leadership of Bappeda – is to include
FSM as a component. The Health Agency census data is also beginning to account for sanitation
and FSM services at household level. These are encouraging signs that the city is moving towards
addressing FSM as a significant component of future investment options.

While private operators of desludging trucks appear to break even financially, other stages of the
service chain – notably operation of the septage treatment facility – do not currently achieve cost-
recovery. There are no current plans reported to strengthen the role of private emptying service
providers, although this may be affected by a new Mayoral decree affecting new institutional
arrangements for septage management, as noted in February 2015.

Regarding compliance with national standards for FS services, these only exist in relation to the
construction of on-site containment systems, not to further stages of the service chain. Even then,
households are predominantly using non-compliant standards of containment facilities, with pour-
flush latrines discharging to a single or double compartment “cubluk” (rather than a septic tank).
Not fully lined, the cubluk acts as a soak-pit, with implications for both the frequency of emptying
requirements and the extent of contamination of the groundwater in the meantime. In spite of this,

                                                                                                   36
Report of a FSM study in Balikpapan, Indonesia


households are not that reliant on groundwater for direct consumption, but rather for showering,
toilet use, laundry and personal washing. Health risks associated with FSM services are
considered to be low – backed-up by a reported incidence of diarrhoea at less than 2% of children
of families questioned during a Willingness to Pay study.

However, in the long-term, without attention given to improving technical arrangements of on-site
facilities and consideration for a range of emptying services that can reach into poor areas and
provide affordable services, demand for safe and effective emptying services will continue to be
constrained.

7.3.4      Implications of the CSDA scorecard

The resulting CSDA scorecard and city typology of the FSM City Service Delivery Assesssment in
Figure 5 reveals that the city is beginning to make progress in areas of supporting improvements to
FSM services – with these mainly being demonstrated through the emptying and transportation
stages of the service chain. As the service outcomes are generally good from the household
perspective (containment and emptying of fecal sludge), attention needs to be paid to the safe
transfer of fecal sludge to effective treatment facilities.

While new institutional arrangements and plans for FSM as part of the Sanitation Master Plan are
starting to be addressed (see next section), consideration will need to be given to the costings
(investment and recovery) for a range of service and intervention options, to support
implementation.

8          Next steps for Balikpapan city
The World Bank - WSP technical assistance in Balikpapan ran in parallel, and often slightly ahead
of the global FSM research study. Findings from an assessment of the city’s FSM services were
reached at an early stage and presented to all key stakeholders during a workshop held in August
2014.

At that meeting, significant buy-in to the results of the study was generated – leading to
discussions of proposed actions. In particular, the Head of the City Planning Department was
noted to take a strong lead on actions to follow. In particular, the findings related to customer
preferences and willingness to pay for regular desludging, was greeted with a response of “ well
let’s do it – how do we start?”.

The SFD was a significant mechanisms to draw people’s attention to discussing next steps. These
discussions were structured around the sanitation chain, in relation where the flow of fecal waste
“drops out” of the service chain.

Key issues identified related to:

     poor households having poorer quality latrines that act more like open defecation, overhung or
      overflowing. They are often in narrow lanes and far from main roads, making emptying difficult.
      This would need to be considered.
     the need for a more regulated private sector, contracted to do regular desludging and having
      an improved ‘on call’ system. This would need to be supported by communications with the
      public and how this be bets done.
     resolving institutional responsibilities, leading to institutions knowing who should do what


Bappeda, PDAM and other key stakeholders have since identified steps to improve FSM services
in the city. This led to a series of proposed or achieved actions in December 2015:

    Area for action                              Action / responsibility

                                                 The Mayor has appointed the PDAM (the Water Utility) to
    Lead agency for FSM services                 manage FSM services and clarified this in regulation.

    Task Force to address FSM                    PDAM is to establish the services team including technical,
    service issues                               planning, MIS, marketing and financial staff

    Private sector partnership

                                                 PDAM will provide both an on-demand and regular
                                                 desludging services. A tariff to cover regular desludging and
                                                 financial aspects is to be established, starting with a pilot

                                                 and MIS, necessary for managing the regular desludging
                                                 program, will be developed.

                                                                                                                38

A Sanitation Working Group has been established and a City Sanitation Strategy (CSS) developed
that lays out targets and identifies required sanitation development activities. This in turn has
enabled the new Head of Bappeda (the City Planning Agency) and the city Mayor to identify and
propose new institutional arrangements to enhance FSM services and effective treatment of
septage from on-site sanitation systems at the treatment facilities. Policy, regulatory and legislative
arrangements to support these changes will need to be developed. Budget allocations, poorly
coordinated in the past, will need to be oriented in line with the new institutional arrangements as
they are translated into law and responsibilities for asset ownership transferred.

The local House of Representatives has been formulating a sanitation law, with regulation focusing
on issues of tariffs and off-site sewerage services. It has been identified that the development of a
new city sanitation master plan should include regulation around non-networked services and
private sector emptying, to ensure these issues are included in future legislation. While new
institutional arrangements and plans for FSM services, as part of the sanitation master plan, are
starting to be addressed, consideration will need to be given to the costings (investment and
recovery) for a range of service levels and intervention options, to support implementation.
Bappeda have indicated plans to invest in more private sector-operated desludging trucks and
construction of a new septage treatment plant. Use of emptying services by households is currently
constrained by cost, location and access (to the property and into the tank itself), especially for the
urban poor. Those who use desludging services report being satisfied with them, but the sanitation
master plan must also identify how these services will expand to meet future demand, to ensure
safe transfer of fecal sludge to effectively managed treatment facilities.
