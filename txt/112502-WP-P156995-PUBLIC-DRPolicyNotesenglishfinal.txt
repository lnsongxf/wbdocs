                                                 Foreword


The Dominican Republic has enjoyed one of the strongest growth rates in Latin America and the Caribbean over the past
25 years, averaging over six percent in the 1990s and over 5 percent since 2000. Growth has accelerated again since 2014,
to 7 percent per annum, raising the country’s income per capita to 92 percent of the regional average, versus 57 percent
in 1992. Yet, in spite of this remarkable economic performance, economic growth in the Dominican Republic has not
been as inclusive as in the rest of the region; one in three Dominicans remains below the poverty line.

We believe that the key challenge that the Dominican economy faces at this time is to understand this conundrum of
rapid growth with limited poverty reduction and to address it through policies that both sustain economic growth while
making it more inclusive. These Policy Notes are designed to support this process. They point to a unique combination
                                                                                                                                 13
of factors in the Dominican Republic, notably the country’s labor market dynamics, the structure of its economy, the
distributive impact of its fiscal policies, and its vulnerability to external shocks, that help to explain why poverty has not
fallen faster in spite of rapid growth.

The start of a new Administration is invariably a time at which plans with respect to development are reviewed for the
medium term. Thus these Policy Notes have been prepared at this time with a view to supporting the new Administration
for 2016-20 by analyzing areas in which policies and programs can potentially have a greater and better impact in
achieving inclusive and sustained growth. We believe that there are four areas of particular interest moving forward.

First, we argue that the inclusiveness of growth can be enhanced by cross-cutting policies aimed at increasing
competitiveness and productivity, with a focus on the sectors that generate most of the jobs and employ workers from
poorer households. There is a spectrum of cross-cutting policy options for enhancing shared prosperity that relate to
creating and promoting economic linkages between special economic zones and the rest of the economy, equipping
the labor force with the skills needed in the labor market, expanding financial access for small and micro enterprises,
improving the prospects for exports, increasing cohesion and territorial planning to reduce the persistent regional
differences, and reducing gender gaps in the labor market.
                                                   Building a Better Future Together




     Second, we believe it will be important to continue strengthening the quality and efficiency of social services. For
     example, in education there are a range of policy options related to expanding early childhood services, increasing
     student retention, upgrading pedagogical instruction and sharpening the focus on learning outcomes. Priorities in the
     area of health relate to institutional strengthening for sector management as well as increasing public resources for health
     to achieve universal coverage while also enhancing the results orientation and efficiency of public spending on health.
     In the area of social protection there are various policy options that can serve to reinforce inter-sectoral coordination, for
     a more efficient and integrated social service delivery, enhance targeting and ensure full coverage of the extreme poor.

     The third key area is improving the quality and availability of basic infrastructure services, notably water supply and
     sanitation as well as electricity services and, in a modern economy also information, communication and technology
     services. These are all essential to ensure inclusive and sustained growth. There are important policy options that relate
     to strengthening sector institutions and governance, as well as ensuring affordable, high-quality coverage in all three
     areas, while reducing subsidies and improving financial performance.

     Finally, the fourth key area relates to policy choices to ensure that development is sustainable, whether in relation to
     macro-fiscal sustainability, competitiveness in a global economy, or to environmental sustainability in a context of
14   climate change and vulnerability to natural disasters.

     The Dominican Republic is well placed to build on its successes and advance on an inclusive growth agenda. A number
     of interventions are highlighted in the Policy Notes that are already proving successful. In other cases, relatively small
     but persistent adjustments in policy can mean the difference between achieving impact and remaining in the status quo.
     With these Policy Notes, the World Bank hopes to inform the national policy dialogue on how to advance on the most
     pressing challenge that the Dominican Republic faces at this time, namely to sustain its exemplary growth while ensuring
     that this growth is inclusive and brings greater prosperity to all its citizens. It is our sincere hope that the analysis and
     policy options presented in these Policy Notes can contribute to breaking the cycles of poverty and achieving a more
     prosperous future for all the people of the Dominican Republic.

     Factors that May Affect the Sustainability
     of Growth and Shared Prosperity

     The Dominican Republic remains vulnerable to the
     so-called “middle-income trap”. Despite significant
     structural changes in the Dominican economy, growth has
     not been inclusive over the last two decades or so. Many
     countries in the world with a similar trajectory of that of
     the DR have fallen victim of the so-called “middle-income
     trap”—a situation in which a country fails to achieve a
     high-income status due the lack of structural reforms
     that end up stifling growth. To be sure, of 101 economies
     that were middle income in 1960 only 13 escaped this
     middle-income trap and became high-income economies
     in 2008—Equatorial Guinea; Greece; Hong Kong, China;
     Ireland; Israel; Japan; Mauritius; Portugal; Puerto Rico;
     Republic of Korea; Singapore; Spain; and Taiwan, China.

     A faster improvement in equity and shared prosperity
     will require sustaining high growth through structural
     reforms in four critical areas. The Policy Note on
     Sustainability argues that there are four inter-related
     areas that could have self-reinforcing effects on long-
24   term inclusive growth in the DR: (a) macro and fiscal
     management; (b) the competitiveness of the economy
     (including several factors, such as, for example the quality
     of infrastructure, the business environment, the soundness
     of the financial sector, among others); (c) factors that affect
     social sustainability (including the quality of public service
     delivery in core sectors such as education, health, water
     and sanitation, and electricity); and (d) environmental
     sustainability and resilience to climate change. In the case
     of ICT, the DR authorities are advised to focus on a three-
     pillar approach. First, it would be necessary to improve
     the institutional framework and sector governance,
     which would pave the way to improve competition in
     the sector. Second, efforts to improve institutions and
     sector regulation, coverage and affordability would need
     to improve. Third, it would be necessary to invest in skills
     and to address demand-side factors. While there has been
     progress in all of these four areas over the last few years,
     there are a number of reforms that could boost growth
     and make it more equitable and inclusive. The main
     policy directions suggested in each of the policy notes are
     summarized in Table 1.1.
                                            Building a Better Future Together




Table 1.1: Summary of Policy Directions
                            Cross-cutting policy options for enhanced shared prosperity
Increase the supply and quality of skills and human capital
•	 Continue building on the recent improvements in the quality of education by increasing student learning and
   retention in the school system, and continue expanding access to early childhood development services.
•	 Increase access to job training and internships to facilitate the transition from school to labor force and improve job
   matching.
•	 Strengthen the connection between employers and the school system so that relevant skills are included in the
   curriculum and students have better information about labor demand.
Incentivize job creation
•	 Invest in productivity-enhancing technologies and financial access for small and micro enterprises, where the
   majority of the jobs are created.
•	 Simplify regulatory procedures and strengthen legal institutions to improve the business environment.
•	 Explore opportunities to promote exports in under-trading sectors that already employ workers from poorer
   households.
Support policies to enhance skills adapted to the structural change in sectoral specialization in SEZs
•	 Introduce social assistance programs designed to accelerate worker employment transitions to lower labor-intensity
   industries, including vocational training in new skills demanded by SEZ firms, job search assistance, and transitional
   income support.
Increase cohesion and territorial planning to reduce the persistent regional differences
•	 Consolidate the efforts to build capacity of local governments to formulate development plans and investment
   projects that reflect local needs expressed through participatory processes.
•	 Consider adding needs-based criteria to the formula to transfer resources to municipal governments.
Reduce gender gaps
•	 Elaboration of labor policies that give women sufficient flexibility to find a balance between work and family
   demands.
•	 Continue expanding access to affordable childcare and pre-school.                                                         25
•	 In order to reduce teenage pregnancy, find innovative ways of outreach and of providing relevant audience-friendly
   information on issues such as reproductive health and rights, using behavioral change methods and engaging
   schools and community level organizations.

                               Improving the quality and efficiency of social services
Education
Continue efforts to expand early childhood development services and develop solid strategies to increase student
retention
•	 Expedite INAIPI’s institutional strengthening to enable it to more effectively and rapidly increase service provision.
•	 Regarding secondary school, it is recommended that MINERD develop systems and strategies to more directly tackle
   low enrollment in what would soon be secondary education.
•	 Adopt early warning systems that are gender-informed to prevent dropouts and teacher trainings that cater to
   different learning levels within each grade and that address gender-specific issues.
•	 Consolidate the curriculum for upper secondary on technical-vocational education to provide the skills for
   employment and give more alternatives for youth–in particular for young men who drop out of school without
   employment-relevant skills.
Prioritize initiatives that matter the most for pedagogical instruction, and that have direct classroom impact
•	 Strengthen teacher evaluations, and make use of available data in the system to feed into the design and
   implementation of teacher training programs, improving the teacher entry exam, the accreditation of teacher
   training programs (capitalizing on new regulations), and teacher accreditation, among others.
•	 Continue improving components related to teachers’ careers, including salaries, evaluations, and incentives.
•	 Strengthen M&E systems, implement student assessments and teacher evaluations, strengthen supervision and data
   at the school level, and increase the use of data for decision-making at all levels of the system.
•	 Empower and support schools, and school principals, to improve their management in order to improve learning
   conditions and outcomes, as has been done in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.


Deepen the implementation of reforms, sharpen the focus on learning outcomes, and improve coordination of
programs and initiatives as agreed in the NEP.
•	 Improve coordination–both internally within MINERD and its institutes, externally with other ministries (MESCYT
   and Ministry of the Presidency), and also with partners–to avoid duplication, exploit synergies of joint work, and
   improve service delivery in a faster way.

     Table 1.1: Continue
                                    Improving the quality and efficiency of social services
     Health
     Continue to improve the quality of public spending on health and overall sector management and allocate more
     resources to health to address gaps in service delivery and insurance coverage.
     •	 At 2.9% of GDP in 2014, the DR’s health public expenditures’ share of GDP is below the country’s Ten Year Health
        Plan target of 4%.  More funds are needed to (a) invest in health personnel, equipment and other inputs to improve
        quality of care and address service gaps in rural areas and for the poor and (b) expand financial protection coverage,
        to reach the poorest who remain unregistered in SIUBEN; to expand access to non-formal workers, as well as to
        eventually integrate health insurance packages and provide a single health benefits package for all citizens.
     •	 In terms of improving cost effectiveness of spending, more resources would also need to be allocated to prevention
        and promotion and public/collective health.  
     •	 Actions can also be taken to improve spending by building on lessons learnt from the results-based financing (RBF)
        primary care pilots, and expanding RBF to hospitals.
     •	 The Government could also consider applying RBF to improve health care worker performance (competencies,
        absenteeism) and provide incentives for health workers especially doctors to serve in rural areas.
     •	 Use a combination of incentives and sanctions to promote the functioning of the referral-counter-referral system and
        to encourage adherence to the policy designating primary care as the gatekeeper for people to accessing the health
        services network.
     •	 Expanding the use of RBF would require further improvements in health information systems and training staff in
        information management system and monitoring and evaluation.
     •	 Undertake additional analysis and allocate more resources to cover the target population of the Contributory
        Subsidized Regime (CSR).
     Continue to strengthen the MOH’s capacity to coordinate and regulate the sector and ensure the timely provision of
     essential public health services while also enhancing the institutional capacity of the National Health Services (NHS)
     and National Health Insurance (NHI).
     •	 Adopt a structured and costed action plan to strengthen both the MOH and the NHS, and move forward with the
26      identified capacity strengthening actions for the NHI.  These institutions would also need to coordinate regularly to
        avoid duplication of efforts and maximize synergies.
     Assess which functions would be best decentralized and which ones would be best remain centralized, and build
     capacity at all administrative levels.
     •	 Strengthen RHS capacity to function more independently under the coordination of the NHS with the Minister of
        Healty exercising its stewardship and regulatory functions.


     Social Protection
     Enhance the quality of health and education services with PROSOLI interventions.
     •	 PROSOLI could reduce the gap between affiliates and eligible population, and reinforce incentives to reduce dropouts
        at the basic level of education.
     •	 Ensure that the training plans of the Education and Health sectors include building capacities of personnel located in
        prioritized territories according to PROSOLI, ensuring that a percentage of the trainees come from poor and extreme
        poor areas.
     Ensure access to social protection services to all extreme poor in the country.
     •	 Enhance access to identity schemes, by implementing incentive mechanisms for the supply side, reducing
        administrative barriers for timely registrations (Declaraciones Oportunas), expediting procedures for late
        registrations (Declaraciones Tardias) and improving processes for registering Dominicans at birth, including those
        who have only one parent with Dominican nationality.
     •	 Continue to update the information of all poor households in the country through SIUBEN and, in turn, to expand
        PROSOLI’s coverage to all extremely poor households.
     Expand SIUBEN’s role to become the entry door of the social protection system.
     •	 Reinforce the institutional foundation of SIUBEN, strengthening its legal and regulatory framework.
     •	 Ensure that the targeting system is increasingly exploited, designing incentive mechanisms to encourage its use by
        different programs, local governments and beneficiaries (to request to be incorporated or recertified).
     •	 Assess strategies to secure enough funding and human resources to respond to clients’ requests

                               Improving the quality and efficiency of social services
Social Protection
Develop policies to link the contributory and non-contributory pillars, as well as interventions in the labor market.
•	 Develop strategies in the medium-term with a view to adopt non-contributory pensions, and in the long-term with
   a view to expand the management system of subsidies to the co-pillar, ensure the exchange of information between
   the two pillars, and prioritize vulnerable sectors with limited ability to contribute to respond with targeted policy
   interventions.
•	 Ensure that exit strategies from social assistance programs to labor market policies are consistent with the continuity
   of protection toward securing access to employment.
•	 Make sure that social assistance interventions delivered through the GCPS are consistent with those territorially
   prioritized by the strategy Quisqueya Sin Miseria.
Reinforce inter-sectoral coordination.
•	 Further improve intersectoral coordination and prevent leakages and duplication of roles, by establishing databases
   that are interoperable to allow more effective management of the sector.
•	 Strengthen the institutional capacities and links with the Ministry of Economy (MEPyD).
Document and carry out assessments of interventions that have a major impact on poverty reduction.
•	 Carry out assessments or evaluations on the impacts of both (vertical and horizontal approaches), including an
   analysis of available resources.

           Policy Options for Improving the Quality and Availability of Basic Infrastructure Services
Water and Sanitation
Continue efforts to establish and consolidate the sector’s institutional framework.
•	 This requires the passing of the WSS Law and continued efforts with the associated decrees, as well as other
   activities related to its implementation, once the Law is approved.
                                                                                                                              27
Take incremental steps to improve service provision in a more efficient and targeted manner, in order to put the sector
on a more sustainable path.
•	 Establish a sector investment strategy with a long-term vision and a short-term program informed by the sanitation
   strategy under preparation, and adding priority water supply investments, strategically designed to maximize
   improvements in service quality and efficiency.
Prepare a Sector Financing Policy covering government financing for both investment and operational expenses.
•	 Establish sector-specific review and monitoring mechanisms for national public investments (including external
   sources).
•	 Explore linking operational subsidies to performance agreements with service providers.

Electricity Sector
Improve the institutional framework and electricity sector governance.
•	 Institutions and Governance. Clearly define the different roles of the sector actors to achieve a more efficient sector.
   This would mean that the MEM should absorb the functions of the CNE and those of CDEEE. Until this change
   is effectively made, sector governance needs to improve, and it will be important to have effective coordination
   between the CDEEE and the EDEs to achieve an efficient administration. It is also important that the government
   grant SIE the authority and autonomy established in the law with regard to setting tariffs, ensuring healthy
   competition among the sector agents, and monitoring and supervising compliance with laws and regulations,
   including service quality.
•	 Transparency and Accountability. In the short to medium-term improving the MEM, SIE, Hacienda, and CDEEE’s
   ability to monitor the operations of the EDEs is vital to enhance accountability and eliminate the operational deficit.
   Afterwards it will be important that the CDEEE begins operating within its legal boundaries. The EDEs in particular
   should carry out annual audits of their financial statements, by independent and reputable audit firms based on
   international financial reporting standards and practices no later than six months after the close of the fiscal year.
•	 Electricity Pact. It is important to maintain an open dialogue and to broadly disclose all information related to
   the sector in order to infuse the needed trust and empowerment of all stakeholders. The solution to sector issues
   should be systematic and will require commitment from all sector actors to achieve an efficient, competitive, and
   sustainable electric service.

     Table 1.1: Continue
                Policy Options for Improving the Quality and Availability of Basic Infrastructure Services
     Electricity Sector
     Enhance the quality of service provision.
     •	 Improved service quality. All final end-users should be able to have continuous, high-quality, reliable, transparent
        and affordable electricity service. The programmed electricity blackouts should be reduced to diminish the need
        for investments in alternative energy sources and help promote economic growth and shared prosperity. Over the
        medium-term the sector should strive to ensure that all clients pay their bills on time and are provided constant
        electricity service, with appropriate voltage levels and no fluctuations. A solid social outreach program will be
        needed to complement the technical improvements to enhance awareness and willingness to pay for service and to
        regularize customers to achieve this goal.
     Restore the efficiency and financial sustainability of the electricity sector.
     •	 Generation. It is essential to have clear rules of the game and greater transparency in the generation sector, both for
        conventional and renewable energy. It is also important that the state better defines its participation in the sector. It
        is also vital that the EDEs carry out a call for tenders to power producers to cover their power capacity and energy
        needs given that the existing contracts will be closing at the end of August 2016. The country could also benefit from
        the low prices of natural gas to help bring down generation costs. Various barriers related to expanding access to
        natural gas supply and securing finance would need to be addressed to exploit this potential.
     •	 Transmission. It is important to ensure the operational and financial autonomy of ETED and allow it to collect
        transmission fees to provide sufficient resources for it to fulfill its functions under the law. This would require
        effectively passing these costs onto customers in bills and then having the EDEs pay ETED for these services from
        payment collections. ETED will also have to ensure that transmission fees are collected from the electricity market
        participants that use the transmission network to exchange power.
     •	 Distribution. To eliminate the operational deficit of the EDEs, it will be important to implement an integrated loss
        reduction program to reach the goal of 15% total losses. The loss reduction program should incorporate a social
        management strategy aimed at restoring trust between end-users and EDEs, raising payment levels, and educating
        customers on the use of electricity in a more efficient and safe way. Making this happen will also require improved
28      sector governance, transparency, and oversight.
     •	 Electricity tariff. SIE should publish the procedures and formulas used for the automatic adjustment of electricity
        tariffs based on costs as required by the law. SIE could take advantage of the currently low international oil prices
        and apply the technical tariff in the short run so that the transition will be more viable since it would not require
        major adjustments. To protect the poorest consumers, subsidies could be targeted and provided to those low-income
        users that qualify for the targeted cash transfer program Bonoluz. This would imply that Bonoluz coverage should
        be expanded so that it covers all low-income electricity users that are eligible for the Government’s Sistema Único de
        Beneficiarios (SIUBEN) programs.
     •	 Climate Change. Good planning and design and investments to strengthen and reinforce electricity infrastructure so
        that it can withstand future climate events would help improve its resiliency. The preparation of a solid emergency
        preparedness and response plan for how to respond to and recover from these types of events is also essential for
        reducing the vulnerability of the Dominican electricity system and ensuring continuity of the service even after these
        types of events occur.

     Information and Communications Technology
     Improve the institutional framework and sector governance. This requires strengthening regulations to promote
     competition that will ensure equitable access to the international gateway and cable landing stations and open
     access to incumbents’ networks, ensuring all major infrastructure (e.g. roads, pipelines, transmission lines) have
     provisions for an optical fiber link, promoting intermodal competition (e.g. between cable and telecommunications
     providers), mandating incumbents to make local access lines available to competitors at wholesale prices (local loop
     unbundling), and focusing INDOTEL on enhanced sector regulation.
     Enhance coverage and affordability. This will require investments to increase the national coverage of the broadband
     backbone.  To complement the existing coverage in wealthier urban centers and future private investments to expand
     the network, government can undertake public investments that ensure inter-nodal connections between existing
     unconnected private (e.g. cable) providers and expand the backbone to poor, remote municipalities to ensure full
     coverage, and thereby reach the National Development Strategy goal of 80% internet coverage by 2030.
     Address demand-side and related factors. This demand investing in skills and policies for the future. It will be
     necessary to create an Open Innovation Hub to improve digital literacy; connect knowledge with investors, and
     keeping up with the state of the art via policy analysis and reform.

Table 1.1: Continue
                               Policy Choices for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth
Macro-fiscal Sustainability
Reforming tax policy should be a priority. Widen the tax base by reforming the VAT and other current tax exemptions
that are found to be highly regressive. The impact of the removal of VAT exemptions on electricity for the poorest
could be mitigated through transfer programs (such as Bonoluz). Undertaking a thorough cost-benefit analysis of the
incentives on corporate income taxations would also be advisable.
Improve the efficiency of the tax administration system. Undertake a full-fledged diagnostic to identify strengths and
weakness of the DR’s revenue administration system.
Continue to pro-actively seeking opportunities to reduce debt. Avoid future primary deficits in order to prevent
additional pressure on the debt path. Putting the debt on a downward trajectory would require a fiscal effort
equivalent to -2.5% of GDP over the next 3 years.
Adopt a medium-term fiscal framework with a clear counter-cyclical orientation. Establish binding fiscal targets and
budgetary performance indicators to complement the current medium-term expenditure framework. Adopt a rules-
based fiscal framework with a more clearly defined counter-cyclical orientation.
Develop a comprehensive framework for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and auditing. The MEPyD, the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of Public Administration should develop a comprehensive framework for M&E and auditing.
This framework could be piloted on a small number of key public programs before being extended across the public
sector.

                                       Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth
Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth
Prioritize policies aimed at forging domestic linkages between SEZs and the domestic economy.
•	 Continue to remove ineffective policies such as harmful local content requirements and protectionist non-tariff         29
   measures that restrict the ability of domestic firms to import and transform key inputs.
•	 Connect domestic suppliers by designing targeted programs for local suppliers, developing a supplier database,
   creating matchmaking services, and introducing incentives to encourage local sourcing from SEZ firms.
•	 Attract competitive international suppliers and support the upgrading of domestic suppliers through non-equity
   modes of investment (e.g. franchising).
•	 Delineate an overarching national policy for export promotion and FDI attraction that leverage SEZs as an engine of
   an inclusive economic growth.
•	 Foster the competitiveness of national industries which do not have easy access to up-to-date information on
   existing opportunities by revamping the role of the Export Promotion Agency (EPA).
Continue working on the implementation of legal reforms on competition and business regulations, particularly:
•	 Launch the enforcement of the existing competition law in order to prevent and punish anticompetitive behavior;
   appoint Executive Director for Competition Authority, Procompetencia
•	 Develop a strategy to review and remove regulatory restrictions in key product markets, especially those that risk to
   enable anticompetitive behavior of market players;
•	 Finalize the implementation of the new insolvency law by developing accompanying rules and regulations;
•	 Finalize the draft law on secured transactions for parliamentary approval;  
•	 Remove barriers to open new business from the Commercial Code (such as minimum capital requirements);
Improve regulations and encourage greater transparency related to financing of MSMEs while also creating
additional instruments.
•	 Increase volumes and sources of private sector finance beyond banks, such as angel investors, venture capital funds,
   and leasing;
•	 Increase the use of financial services to support productive activities while reducing transaction costs;
•	 Increase the scope and depth of non-financial services to address key constraints to credit;
•	 Further develop private capital markets to help alleviate market concentration.

Industry-specific reforms
Integrate new segments of market by fostering the development of non-all-inclusive tourism niches.
In order to ensure that more firms are able to comply with international standards, it is important to strengthen
national systems for quality inspection and verification.

     Industry-specific reforms
     Increase the relatively low marginal productivity and limited access to information and markets of smallholder
     farms.
     Integrate Producers into Domestic and Global Value Chains. The competitiveness of producer groups could be
     fostered through strategic alliances between the public and private sectors and would require:
     •	 Technological innovation to raise productivity;
     •	 Targeted market intelligence to enhance market access;
     •	 Financial capital to boost access to productive assets; and
     •	 Capacity-building and technical assistance to be able to meet the market demands.

                              Environmental Sustainability and Resilience to Climate Change
     Integrate disaster risk management tools in core administrative processes.
     •	 Integrate disaster risk management into public investment and territorial planning processes by introducing
        screening mechanisms and disaster-risk considerations.
     •	 Develop hazard and risk information tools (e.g. safe school or safe hospital index).
     •	 Create a dedicated risk-analysis unit to update DRM disaster plans, develop DRR tools for public institutions, identify
        and analyze high-risk areas, and develop and disseminate risk maps and information in coordination with relevant
        authorities and local communities.
     •	 Include risks resulting from climate change into fiscal risk management strategies.
     Strengthen the Growth Potential of the Agri-food Sector
     •	 Make producers more productive and resilient, while lowering their carbon footprint, through climate smart
        agriculture;
     •	 Integrate producers into domestic and global value chains;
     •	 Strengthen institutions and the provision of public goods;
30   •	 Promote the sustainable use and management of natural resources at the watershed level;
     •	 Encourage good agricultural practices on pastures, land grazing and rain-fed agriculture in the upper and middle
        sections of the watershed
     •	 Adopt modern and efficient irrigated agriculture in the middle and lower sections of the watershed.
     Promote the Conservation of Natural Resources Assets
     •	 Continue to implement the strategy for Integrated Water Resources Management at Watershed level
     •	 Implement the Payment and Compensation for Ecosystem Services strategy
     •	 Ensure continued commitment in the REDD+ program.

     Increase financial access for MSMEs and extend
     insurance availability. Non-financial services can remove
     critical barriers, such as access to markets and networks
     that prevent MSMEs from accessing credit. These can
     include more effective use of electronic networks,
     e-money and electronic ID systems. Development of
     collective investment schemes could also help to indirectly
     channel financing to MSMEs. While there is reluctance by
     banks to directly finance what they see as high-risk small
     enterprises with scant documentation, development of
     an investor market willing to invest in pooled assets (or
     liabilities) of MSMEs could help diversify some risk and
     bring in additional funding as well as prudent risk takers
     including guarantee facilities to reduce a portion of
     portfolio downside risk. Such schemes would need to be
     developed as a partnership between financial authorities
     and the local and foreign investor community. With the
     DR’s expected joining of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
     Insurance Facility (CCRIF), this will provide an opportunity
     not only to obtain sovereign risk protection but also
     to extend insurance to the enterprise and household
     sectors of the economy. The authorities should consider
     leveraging their intent to use sovereign/budget insurance
46   as a potential mechanism to fund catastrophe coverage
     schemes for the underserved segments, particularly
     poorer households and small and micro enterprises.

Strengthen the institutional capacities and links with
the Ministry of Economy (MEPyD). Better communication
channels could be fostered between the Social Protection

social indicators with a national scope, clearly defined, and
properly supported and funded. It would be important to
promote and maintain coordination between both sectors,
providing appropriate instruments and mechanisms to
periodically review progress achieved. It is recommended
that the SP sector consider institutionalizing good practices
since 2012, set policy goals for the sectoral reform, and
increase transparency and accountability. In the coming
years it would be important to keep allocating resources
to the sector within a context of fiscal constraint, ensuring
the adoption of tools that strengthen management and
enhance efficiency.

     ANNEX I: Education and “Ninis” in the DR

     In 2013, the percentage of the population between 15 and 24 years of age who neither worked nor studied in the
     Dominican Republic was 21.4%, slightly higher than the regional average. Despite the fact that the percentage of ninis
     has remained virtually constant since the late 1990s, the total number of ninis shows an increasing trend going from
     356,000 in 1995 to 434,000 in 2013, an increase of 22%. The increase in ninis is almost entirely explained by the increase
     in men who were excluded from the educational system and who did not work which went from 88,000 in 1995 up to
     164,000 in 2013. In 2013, the Northwest and Northeast regions showed the highest incidence of ninis in the Dominican
     Republic. Regions that display both a high prevalence and a general increase of male ninis are particularly concerning,
     since according to De Hoyos, Gutiérrez and Vargas (2015), a higher incidence of male ninis, in a weak institutional context,
     is related to an increase in criminality.

     Three out of five ninis in the DR are women, a percentage lower than that of the rest of the region. For Latin American
     women, the most important factors behind the probability of being nini are marriage and pregnancy during adolescence.
     According to a World Bank report, between 2010 and 2013 the fertility rate amongst Dominican teenagers fell from 103
     to 98 per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 19. Although there is a downward trend, the fertility rate among
     teenagers in the Dominican Republic remains substantially higher than the regional average of 72 per 1,000 adolescent
     females.

     In Latin America, the incidence of ninis varies significantly by income decile, being higher among poor households,
     systematically decreasing as income increases. This is not the case in the DR. The highest rate of male ninis is found in
     households in the 3rd decile of the income distribution with 26%, where the percentage of female ninis is very close with
     29%. This suggests that the ninis phenomenon in the Dominican Republic is not necessarily determined by the lack of
64   income and could be linked to restrictions in the educational provision, such as low quality of school services or little
     relevance to meet the needs of the labor market.

     One of the highlights with regards to youths between 15 and 25 years of age, is that at the age of 15 the vast majority of
     the youths are within the educational system. The ninis problem arises between the ages of 15 and 19, when about 40%
     of youths leave the educational system and only a fraction of them find opportunities in the labor market. This suggests
     that to address the problem of ninis in the Dominican Republic, it is necessary to implement interventions to reduce the
     school drop out in upper secondary education or EMS (grades 10, 11 and 12).

     There is relevant evidence to design educational policies capable of reducing school drop-outs and interventions to
     reduce youth unemployment. Given the characteristics behind the problem of ninis in the Dominican Republic, we
     suggest three interventions:

     •	 Scholarships: scholarship programs with transfers only at the end of each year can reduce school drop out in EMS.
        The effect can be enhanced if there are information systems that can detect, youth at risk during the basic cycle.
     •	 Program to reduce teen pregnancy: awareness campaigns coupled with free access to contraceptives can reduce
        teenage pregnancy.
     •	 Skills training for work: programs such as “Youth and Employment” that provide technical-vocational skills or social-
        emotional skills help generate the necessary human capital to increase ninis’ labor productivity and increase their
        employability.

ANNEX II: Education and Gender

In the Dominican Republic (DR), there are gender disparities in enrollment and graduation rates, with the gap growing
the higher the level of education, and with boys being at disadvantage. This gender gap is significantly larger in the DR
as compared to the LAC regional averages: in secondary school the ratio of female to male enrolled students is 1.12 in the
DR, compared to 1.06 for LAC; and in tertiary education the ratio is 1.62 and 1.28, respectively.104 In addition, urban areas
have a gender parity index of 1.00,while rural areas have an index of 0.88.105 This trend continues into graduation ratios,
with boys and young men falling behind girls and young women. Overall, total expected years of schooling is slightly
lower for both men (12.7) and women (13.7) in the DR than LAC region on average (13.3 and 14.1, respectively).106

In 2014, 62% of students enrolled in tertiary education were female. The high enrollment and graduation rates of women
in secondary and teriary education translates into a female labor force in which 65% has secondary or tertiary education;
compared to 50% of the male labor force.107 Women are over-represented as graduates in social and humanities careers,
while men outnumber women in technical fields careers. The field of study at university impacts occupational segregation
where women generally are concentrated in lower productivity and lower pay occupations.

Women and men have different driving factors behind decisions related to education; many of these are based on ideas
of how men and women should behave., Young pregnant women and young mothers feel judged and young men feel
“controlled” in schools.108 Existing stereotypes and prejudice influence youth decision-making with regard to schooling,
affecting their future educational l and economic outcomes.109

To be effective, education policies and programs should consider social and gender norms that constrain choices and
influence behaviors within the education system for administrators, teachers and students alike. Research shows that
school-based programs provide an opportunity to shape gender norms before they become deeply engrained within                                 65
children and adolescents.110 Specific policy may consider:

•	 Analyzing dropout patterns and designing school dropout prevention strategies with a gender perspective.
   Strategies could incorporate mentoring; after-school programs and opportunities; support pregnant teens and teen
   mothers remain in school; improve learning environments; and adjust teacher training and curriculum to include
   gender-sensitive aspects (next bullet provides more details).
•	 As part of teacher training, ensuring better understanding of gender socialization and response to issues related to
   stereotypes regarding gender roles and behaviors, bullying, and sexual and reproductive health.
•	 Implementing classroom activities and content that incorporate socio-emotional skills training and critical reflection
   about gender norms. Consider additional modules within the curricula.
•	 Implementing campaigns against teenage pregnancy, with specific focus on poorer and rural areas. Including socio-
   emotional skills training, as these skills are likely to improve school attendence and completion.

     Other countries

     Other countries have taken different approaches to cover persons not employed in the formal sector.

     •	 The Philippines and Vietnam allow them to contribute to the formal sector scheme
     •	 Colombia requires those with sufficient means to contribute to the formal-sector scheme but in practice, this has
        been difficult to implement and informal sector workers have been incorporated in the SR
     •	 China and Mexico have a separate voluntary contributory scheme.
     •	 Another possible option is to progressively move toward a common health insurance plan for the entire population
        that would be financed by taxes similar to what is being done in Brazil

ANNEX V: Targeted water metering programs to become more efficient and increase
revenues

As part of its institutional strengthening component, the World Bank-financed “Water and Sanitation in Tourist Areas
Project” (Proyecto de Agua y Saneamiento en Centros Turísticos, PASCT) supported the implementation of metering pilots
with three CORAAs, namely CORAAPPLATA, CORAAMOCA and COAAROM, to help address efficiency challenges these
regional companies were facing. Between 2012 and 2014, the PASCT financed the development of business plans for
these CORAAs, with particular emphasis on improving commercial and financial management, and, as a result of the
diagnosis and recommendations produced, the installation of 11,500 micro-meters was initiated in January of 2015.

The results presented in Table A2.1 indicate that for the cost of increasing the number of metered clients by approximately
10%, monthly revenues can be increased by 16 to 28%. Besides these results, the metering pilot generated other positive
outcomes, as presented below.

CORAAPPLATA. Institutional strengthening activities financed by the PASCT, as well as the positive outcomes resulting
from the implementation of the metering pilot, contributed to CORAAPPLATA’s decision to enter into a delegation
contract with the private sector for commercial management-related aspects such as client cadaster, installation of
meters, customer relations and billing. Under this contract, it is estimated that an additional 21,000 macro- and micro-
meters will be installed, with the potential to further contribute to increased revenues and efficiency gains.

CORAAMOCA. In addition to the increased revenues, CORAAMOCA reported improvements in both non-revenue water
(from 82 to 76%) and payment collection efficiency (from 83.5 to 87.5%), as a result of the metering pilot. Payment
collection efficiency was even found to increase to 91% for the metered customers, as opposed to 86% for non-metered
customers. To achieve these positive results, CORAAMOCA also engaged very closely with the neighborhood groups                89
(juntas de vecinos) in areas where the meters would be installed and designed a communication strategy which was
implemented with their collaboration. The strategy included information about the pilot, but also awareness with
regards to the importance of reducing intra-domiciliary water losses, as well as benefits of water conservation, a
particularly critical theme given the fact the country is facing its worst drought of the last two decades. According to
CORAAMOCA officials, the pilot allowed the company to create tighter links with the community, a valuable asset for
future interventions.

COAAROM. In La Romana, the pilot was put in place in four of COAAROM’s sectors, one of which already had had meters
installed in the past, but these now required to be replaced. COAAROM reported that in this sector, a 23% increase in
revenues was recorded after the installation, whereas in the other sectors where households had never before been
metered, revenues increased by 47%.

     Box 1: The ‘Cuba Effect’ on Tourism


     While the DR’s tourism sector has competed with Cuba’s for many years in European and global source
     markets, the prospective normalization of US-Cuba relations is expected to divert a substantial number of
     US tourists toward Cuba. The size and duration of this impact is hard to estimate, and it would likely take
     time to materialize, as Cuba has a limited capacity to absorb new tourists. However, the resumption of US-
     Cuba tourism could create new opportunities for the DR by intensifying incentives to access high-income
     consumers or exploit niche markets. Moreover, the strengthening US dollar will likely bolster overall US
     tourism demand, at least partially offsetting the diversionary effect.

      management of natural resources at the watershed level.

      •	 Encourage Climate Smart-Agriculture: This could
         be achieved through a comprehensive landscape
         approach that encompassed: (i) promotion of good
         agricultural practices on pastures, land grazing and
         rain-fed agriculture in the upper and middle sections
         of the watershed and; (ii) promotion of modern and
         efficient irrigated agriculture in the middle and lower
         sections of the watershed. The promotion of CSA can
         also support the GoDR to fulfill its commitments to
         the COP21 on the mitigation agenda and reach its
         goal of adaptation to CC. In its Intended Nationally
         Determined Contribution (INDC), the proposal of
         the Government for mitigation is to reduce the GHG
         emission by 25% in 2030, in relation to the 2010
         baseline (3.6t of CO2 equivalent) and the agricultural
         sector can play an important role in achieving this
         objective.
