However, short of a positive shock such as the

strategic structural reforms are implemented at a
quicker pace. The Economic Policy Council’s newly

 The potential output gap is often considered a good proxy of an economy’s wellbeing. By measuring how far
 off the economy is from its potential output (output generated at full capacity), the potential output gap is funda-
 mental to the conduct of sound macroeconomic policy.
 Two basic methods are applied for estimating potential output gap: statistical filtering and structural estima-
 tions. Statistical filtering includes the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, a de-trending statistical method, which is em-
 ployed in this analysis using three standard smoothing parameters (1600, 1000, 500). The application of different
 smoothing parameters serves as a robustness check of the estimation process. Further, the statistical filtering is ap-
 plied on annual data (sample period 1975-2019) and quarterly data (1992Q1-2017Q4).* Annual data post 2016 and
 quarterly data post 2016Q4 are obtained from World Bank staff projections. As for the second estimation method,
 structural estimations are based on a Production Function Model which incorporates economic theory that relates
 output to total factor productivity and production inputs. The structural estimations are only applied on annual data
 post 1990.
 After nine years of operating above potential, Jordan suffered from a negative output gap in 2015. Throughout
 2006-2014, Jordan witnessed high growth rates that led to positive deviations from its potential and thus report
 positive output gaps. During that period, the output gap averaged +2.3 of potential output. However, in 2015,
 Jordan’s output dropped below its potential with the output gap turning negative to reach -0.44 percent of potential
 GDP (on average across the four estimation techniques employed). The gap widened further to -1.12 percent of
 potential output in 2016 as growth continued to be subdued (Figure 5).
 At the quarterly level, the three HP filters yield similar results further asserting the expectations of a widening
 output gap in 2016. In 2016, the output gap is estimated to be negative in each of the quarters with all parameters
 employed. The output gap is estimated at -0.36, -0.12, -0.03 and -0.06 percent of potential output (on average
 across the three HP filters) in 2016Q1, 2016Q2, 2016Q3 and 2016Q4, respectively (Figure 6).
 The various estimation techniques employed, at the annual and quarterly levels, consistently conclude
 that the Jordanian economy has been deviating away from its potential in the negative direction. This is not
 surprising given that the country’s economy has been plagued by a turbulent regional setting that slowed down

                                         BOX 2. Jordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2022).


 In effort of reigniting growth, the Jordanian government and the Economic Policy Council (EPC) collabo-
 rated on producing the second set of economic reforms* which took the form of a five-year Jordan Economic
 Growth Plan (JEGP). The JEGP aims at doubling economic growth over 2018-2022, reducing debt burden, creating
 jobs and increasing income levels notwithstanding the challenging regional situation. A series of international and
 regional, economic and political, setbacks (such as: the 2009 global financial crisis, the wave of Arab uprisings, the
 closure of trade routes with major trade partners and the recent surge in food and oil prices) have caused Jordan
 to fall off track to reaching the growth targets previously set in Jordan’s 2025 Vision. Therefore, the JEGP aims at
 jumpstarting growth in the next few years such that growth forecasts for 2021-2025 would be in line again with the
 Jordan 2025 Vision.
 According to EPC, a doubling of economic growth would require at least a 5 percent growth rate annually,
 equivalent to US$ 1.8 billion annually. However, almost 50 percent of the economy is strained and cannot grow
 further. For instance, government services growth is limited as the government is bounded to a rationalized fiscal
 policy over the medium term. This in turn leaves it up to productive sectors to generate the additional US$ 1.8
 billion required. Analysis carried by EPC suggests the following increases in value added of the productive sectors,
 and the corresponding growth rate of each sector needed to bring forward its suggested increase in value added:

 The JEGP adopts a holistic approach to identifying the reforms needed for 19 sectors. In total, the JEGP clas-
 sifies 95 policy actions (total value of US$ 894 million), 85 government projects (total value of US$ 8.8 billion)
 and 27 private sector investment opportunities (total value of US$ 13.3 billion), which are meant to help stimulate
 growth and revive the Jordanian economy.

  Jordan has faced a steep increase in water demand in recent years as a result of rapid population growth (the
  Syrian refugee influx led to an increase in demand by 21 percent throughout the country and a 40 percent
  increase in demand in the northern governorates), income growth, and urbanization. Future climate projec-
  tions are likely to show an increase in mean annual temperature of about 2oC by 2050 with the country becoming
  warmer and drier with frequent heat waves and fewer days of frost. Water availability in this scenario is likely to
  continue to decrease and the demand for energy to treat and transport water likely to increase.

                                           BOX 4. Snapshot Jordan’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).


 The Government of Jordan has submitted a comprehensive Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to-
 wards climate change mitigation and adaptation to the Paris Agreement. The energy sector is a priority for Jor-
 dan, from economic, social and environmental perspectives; accounting for the largest share of Jordan’s emissions.
 This is reflected in the large share of energy related projects, which collectively add more than 1500MW renewable
 energy; reach more than 100,000 households, improve industrial processes in cement, chemical, food and steel,
 among others and increase share of public transport and efficient vehicles. Water is a major climate mitigation
 and adaptation concern from multiple perspectives including: access; utilization, such as climate smart agriculture
 practices; energy consumption for water pumping; conservation in all sectors, and waste water treatment. Forestry
 sector projects include both plantations in urban and northern areas and rangeland protection. As transportation
 is also a major emitter, public transport is important for the urban centers to reduce congestion from fast-growing
 vehicle population and projects include a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project and promotion of hybrid public vehicles.
 The expected cost of achieving Jordan’s NDC target of reducing GHG emissions by 14 percent over the
 baseline scenario by 2030 is USD 5.7 billion. The NDC target includes an unconditional target of 1.5 percent
 compared to business as usual scenario levels which the government commits to achieving with its own resources,
 and a conditional target of 12.5 percent contingent upon external support including access to financing, technology
 and capacity building. This 14 percent target is based on expected implementation of around 70 sectoral projects
 and relevant policy measures. The Government of Jordan has secured USD 542.75 million through its own means
 to meet the unconditional target. Accordingly, Jordan now requires at least USD 5.157 billion to achieve its con-
 ditional target. The cost of achieving the mitigation target is based on estimates articulated in the 2014 National
 Communication report to the UNFCCC and projects identified subsequently and will benefit from development of a
 fully costed and comprehensive strategy to align with broader development goals in Jordan.

                    BOX 5. Potential Positive Economic Spillover Effects from Climate Smart Investments.


 Climate Smart Investment has the potential to support growth and sustainable development in Jordan. Some
 positive spillovers, additional to environmental impacts, include effects on:
    i.    Debt management: The diversification of the energy matrix renders Jordan less dependent on foreign oil/gas
          imports thus creating its own market and making it less exposed to the volatility of energy prices. This brings
          stability and reliability to the Government’s fiscal balance and much less subject to “last minute” calls to the
          Ministry of Finance in order to issue funds for the utilities.
    ii.   Labor market: Climate smart investments could result in a shift towards “green jobs” to the country. The
          shift needs to be managed to support net job creation.
    iii. Private sector development: Climate smart investments would reinforce and help the development of an
         incipient private sector in the area of sustainable energy and the development of their own technologies
         customized for Jordan needs.
    iv. International political positioning and additional funding: Positions Jordan as a serious actor in attracting

57.      Sustainable solutions to addressing
Jordan’ fiscal, economic (growth) and climate
vulnerabilities can pave the way towards achieving
low-carbon and green societal transformation.
Jordan has begun its journey towards a low-carbon,
green economy despite the challenges facing the
region and the country and is also committed to
achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs).
Climate change is being mainstreamed into the
policies and strategies of key sectors and the National
Green Growth Plan has identified a pathway to
transform the economy in line with the Jordan Vision
2025. Scaling up climate action can support Jordan’s
fiscal and macroeconomic objectives, proactively
support the creation of green decent jobs and,
strengthen resilience of the society and economy.
This will require further analysis and consultation
with stakeholders including civil society and the
private sector, assessment of the short run costs of
the transition, and identification of mechanisms for
collaboration across the government and the private
sectors. The role of the Ministry of Finance, in
collaboration with the Ministries of Environment and
Planning and International Cooperation, is crucial
in realizing Jordan’s Green Growth and sustainable
development aspirations.

                                      BOX 6. Jordan’s New Electricity Tariff Adjustment Mechanism.


 Many countries around the world allow utilities to pass through fuel cost to consumers on a regular basis using
 a ‘fuel clause’ in the tariff. These fuel clauses come under different names, including “fuel surcharge”; “fuel and
 power purchase cost adjustment”; “fuel cost adjustment”, “fuel adjustment charges”, “fuel adjustment clause” or
 “power cost adjustment”. Examples of countries with such adjustment mechanisms include the United States, the
 UAE, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Pakistan and many more. The different names notwithstanding, all the mecha-
 nisms share the same functionality: to pass through hard-to-control changes in power generation or purchasing
 cost— by adding one or more adjustable components to consumer electricity bills—in order to mitigate financial
 risks for the utilities and to encourage price-responses in consumption. Notably, the fuel cost adjustment is done in a
 process that is separate from the normal tariff review (which often happens annually or quarterly), and the base tariff
 remains the same during the tariff period.
 Since 2010, Jordan’s electricity tariff includes such a fuel clause that allows EMRC to adjust wholesale and
 end-consumer electricity tariffs on a regular basis to pass through variations in fuel cost. However, EMRC has
 so far kept the fuel clause at zero despite significant variations in fuel cost. On October 5, 2016, EMRC adopted a
 tariff adjustment mechanism (TAM) to activate the fuel clause. The objective of the TAM is to sustain NEPCO’s abil-
 ity to recover its cost through electricity sales. Under the new TAM, effective from January 1, 2017 onwards, EMRC
 will adjust the fuel clause on a monthly basis in case the total cost of electricity service is higher than the average
 selling price of electricity. The EMRC will determine the cost of the electricity system every month based on data
 submissions by NEPCO and the distribution companies. The required adjustment for each sector and category would
 then be calculated by EMRC’s tariff department and recommended for adoption to the Council of Commissioners of
 EMRC. Upon adoption, EMRC will communicate the fuel clause schedule to the distribution companies so that these
 would include the fuel clause in their billing. Due to lagged data availability, the revision for a specific month would
 be based on data from two months before (e.g., adjustment of the month of October would be based on actuals from
 August). EMRC will undertake a true up adjustment at the end of the year to ensure that these delays do not cause
 any net losses for NEPCO.
