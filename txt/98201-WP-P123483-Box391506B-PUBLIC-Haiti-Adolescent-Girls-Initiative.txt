SUMMARY
Funded by the World Bank Gender Action Plan (GAP and subsequently the UFGE) and the Nike
Foundation, the Haiti AGI is part of the Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI), an international initiative,
to pilot context-specific interventions in low income countries – half of them fragile countries - for a
better understanding of the skills that could increase employability for vulnerable young women.

Women and particularly young women are underrepresented in Haitian labor markets. They have
significantly worse labor indicators than their male counterparts, particularly in labor income, in spite
of limited differences in education. For instance, they are 20% more likely to be unemployed than
men and, if working, make wages 32% lower. With labor income a key determinant of poverty
reduction in Haiti, improving the capacity of young women to access, benefit from, and contribute
to the labor market is critical. To that end, the Haiti AGI worked with vulnerable Haitian young
women aged 17-21 years in the Port-au-Prince area. The intent was to increase the young women’s
agency and capacity to improve their socio-economic situations, particularly through formal labor
markets. The overall objective was to improve the employability of the women taking part in this
pilot project, i.e. for them to be better positioned to participate productively in the labor market.

Between 2012 and 2014, the Haiti AGI provided technical and soft-skills training to over 1,000
young women. The technical skills were in sectors not traditionally associated with female
employment but presenting interesting hiring opportunities in a reconstruction/post-reconstruction
context: electricity, mechanics, refrigeration, heavy machine operation, telecommunications, and
others. Soft-skills sessions were organized in parallel by community organizations working with the
beneficiaries in their respective quartiers of residence to boost socio-emotional and non-technical
factors such as self-confidence, autonomy, aspirations, and empowerment.

The Haiti AGI gathered lessons through qualitative evaluations of the pilot as well as a randomized
impact evaluation. Feedback on the quality of the design and implementation from all actors
involved was largely positive. A main indicator that the design and implementation were good is that
drop-out from the program was extremely low. Of all AGI beneficiaries, only 6% abandoned the
program. Typically, technical training programs see drop-out rates in the order of 50% to 60%. The
low rate could also be indicative that beneficiaries were satisfied with the project, a finding
corroborated by feedback received from the qualitative evaluations conducted in June-July 2013 and
December 2014- January 2015.

The Haiti AGI has improved the overall agency of beneficiaries, i.e. their capacity to make choices
and to pursue desired actions. An assessment three months after program completion found that
beneficiaries had higher socio-emotional “assets” compared to women who did not take part in the
program. Their autonomy in decision making, their autonomy in personal mobility, and their
standing in relations with family and others all rose. Stress declined and mindset became more
positive. Beneficiaries’ aspirations about work and income grew more ambitious. The young women
were more assertive and talked more to others about job opportunities. Concurring evidence shows
increased non-acceptance of violent behavior from personal partners. The integrated design of the
                                                                                                       5
project and the importance given to soft-skill training appear to have been key determinants of those
outcomes.

In terms of labor markets, impacts measured three months after program completion show that
beneficiaries were changing the type of work they do, while the share who were participating in
income-generating activities, as well as their earnings, had not increased. These short-term impacts
show that beneficiaries were transitioning towards higher-skilled jobs related to the technical training
they received. Underlying the lower participation in income generation was an enhanced aspiration
to pursue further education, necessitating a delay in entering the labor market. Young women who
took part in the project displayed higher expectations towards school enrollment and subsequent
engagement in the labor force. Encouragingly, these aspirations are materializing in reality with
beneficiaries increasing their enrollment for further education.

These short-term results show that the Haiti AGI enhanced the employability of young women,
improving both technical and socio-emotional skills, all markers of better labor market performance.
Right after training, it is not atypical for job-finding rates to be lower for participants than non-
participants, as other studies have found. Moreover, the most recent qualitative evaluation that
focused on the job search experience of the beneficiaries provided additional keys to understanding
the challenges faced by youth and particularly young females in a constrained labor market such as
Haiti’s. These include the limited number of job openings, the lack of information regarding those
openings, and the common abuse of power (in the form of sexual advances) by men who are in
situations of authority in the job application process.

The Haiti AGI was a project with an intensive treatment aimed at gaining a more in-depth and
contextualized understanding of the constraints and challenges faced by vulnerable youth to
participate in the labor market. The Haiti AGI does not aim to be scaled up in its exact current form
in the depressed labor market context of Haiti, but could be an option for less constrained
environments. Still, elements of the project can be used to inform agency-building and active labor
market policies and programs in Haiti and other fragile countries. In light of this, several takeaways
are offered for employability-oriented programs and active labor markets programs:

   1. Having an integrated project design that builds on local community partnerships
      and public-private partnerships (PPP) matters for skill-building programs aimed at
      vulnerable groups. The Haiti AGI confirms the importance of comprehensive intervention
      programs when dealing with vulnerable groups to address the diversity of challenges they
      face, beyond gaps in technical skills. Moreover, given the gender equity focus of the project,
      a takeaway for program designers to consider is that to address gender-specific challenges –
      including gender-based violence- a network of design elements is advisable, such as limiting
      commuting time, having alert and monitoring systems, timing activities during daylight.
   2. Providing technical training in non-traditional trades is an option for consideration
      for women’s training programs. Providing training for women in male-dominated fields is
      not an easy decision for program designers. The takeaway to offer from the Haiti pilot is that
      participants in non-traditional tracks were as committed to follow-through, remain engaged,

                                                                                                      6
   and complete the courses and internships as participants who did the traditional tracks in the
   pilot. While bottlenecks remain to make technical training viable in terms of direct
   translation into employment, gender does not appear to be one provided the right
   orientation, consideration to labor market needs and employers’ engagement.
3. Complementing technical training with socio-emotional and soft-skills development
   can be a cost-effective program components to enhance results. Soft-skills are
   increasingly recognized for the key role they play in job performance, and as a result are
   given high importance by recruiting employers. For a fraction of the cost of the technical
   component, evidence from the project implementation and qualitative evaluations attest to
   the potential returns of investing in socio-emotional and soft-skills development. More
   research is needed to further measure those returns.
4. Accounting for aspirations in program design can help channel this dimension
   towards better outcomes. Aspirations are an important lever for motivation and
   perseverance. Finding the balance between vulnerable youth aspiration, expectation, and
   reality directly influences outcomes in terms of program drop-out rates and post-training
   trajectories. While the Haiti AGI saw an increase in aspirations, the findings also indicate a
   need for further research on how to best integrate this dimension in future programs.
5. Improving how to provide information and prepare graduates to enter constrained
   labor markets particularly matters in fragile settings. Educating the trainees about the
   reality of labor markets both in terms of opportunities and challenges is necessary, but how
   to do it to maintain motivation and perseverance remains to be further refined. Improving
   information sharing and transparency so as to increase, and render more inclusive, the
   matching of labor supply and demand is an important area for further study.

     I.        Introduction
The Haiti AGI is part of the worldwide Adolescent Girl Initiative. The AGI was launched on
October 10, 2008 as part of the World Bank Group’s Gender Action Plan (GAP), which helps to
increase women’s economic opportunities by improving their access to labor market, agricultural
land, technology, credit, and infrastructure services. With the financial participation of the Nike
Foundation, the AGI piloted context-specific interventions in low income countries – half of fragile
countries- for a better understanding of the skills that could increase employability for vulnerable
young women. The initiative has been implemented in eight countries: Haiti, Afghanistan, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Jordan, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, and South Sudan. While some on
the pilots were eventually scaled up (Liberia, Nepal), the main objective of the AGI has been to
inform policies, programs and projects aimed at developing the agency and employability of
vulnerable young women.

Launched in 2011, the Haiti AGI worked with vulnerable Haitian young women (aged 17-21
years) in the Port-au-Prince area to increase their agency as well as their capacity to improve
their socio-economic situations, particularly but not exclusively through formal labor
markets. Over the course of the project, more than 1,000 young women were trained, in two
cohorts of about 500. Women—particularly young women—are under-represented in Haiti labor
markets and have significantly worse labor indicators than their male counterparts (Annex X.3).1
With labor income a key determinant of poverty reduction in Haiti (see 2014 Haiti Poverty
Assessment), improving the capacity of young women to access, benefit from, and contribute to
labor markets is critical.

The objective of the Haiti AGI has been to increase the employability and the capacity of
young women to adapt to Haiti’s complex socio-economic environment. In a constrained
setting such as Haiti, any intervention that aims to create full employment would miss the country’s
reality, and indeed, many projects that have promised this outcome have failed to meet these
expectations.2 Instead, the Haiti AGI takes a longer perspective. It provides the building blocks for
vulnerable young women to not only improve their socio-economic situations in the short term but,
more importantly, to develop their capacity to adapt and to find opportunities in a context that is
likely to remain highly constrained.

  Women are significantly disadvantaged in the labor market. Holding constant several social and demographic characteristics, one
finds that women are 20 percentage points more likely than men to be unemployed and, if working, 6 percentage points more likely to
be in the informal sector. Wages among women are also 32 percent lower than wages among men. Over two-thirds of this difference
is unexplained by observable characteristics, suggesting that discrimination could play a role. (World Bank, 2014a).
2 This is the case of the IDEJEN program, a pilot project largely funded by USAID (USAID, 2010). The project has trained a large

number of youth (about 11,000) since 2004. It has not been formally evaluated, but employment results have contrasted with
anecdotal evidence of overcrowding in some of the trades for which youth were trained in hopes that they would become micro-
entrepreneurs. In 2012, IDEJEN became a Haitian NGO. In November 2010, with the support of the IDB, the MasterCard
Foundation, the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund, USAID and others donors, IDEJEN and the NGO YouthBuild International launched the
JÈNKA program (the name is a Creole acronym for “Young People Building Haiti”). It has a five-year goal of engaging 9,000 Haitian
young people to help rebuild the country after the earthquake. JÈNKA students helped to construct and rehabilitate 12 IDEJEN
vocational training centers which host the JÈNKA program and are located in rural and urban places. To date, the total investment in
JÈNKA is more than $11 million. The project has not been evaluated.

                                                                                                                                  8
The Haiti AGI is a pilot project whose primary goal has been to identify lessons to improve
vulnerable young women’s employability and agency so as to inform larger programs and
policies. Its scope reflects this pilot nature and learning focus, to enable intensive support later on
to integrate the identified challenges in a multi-component intervention. The Haiti AGI does not
aim to be scaled up in its exact current form in the depressed labor market context of Haiti, but
could be an option for less constrained environments. Still, elements of the project can be used to
inform agency-building and active labor market policies and programs in Haiti.


   II.     Framework of Analysis: Expanded Assets Approach to Supporting
           Employability
The Haiti AGI pilot was designed with the goal of supporting employability. The
International Labor Organization (ILO) defines employability skills as the skills, knowledge and
competencies that enhance a worker’s ability to secure and retain a job, progress at work, cope with
change, secure another job if he/she so wishes or has been laid off, and enter more easily into the
labor market at different periods of the life cycle. The AGI focuses on two types of skills to make
beneficiaries more employable: technical “hard” skills to improve the competitive profile of
candidates in specific areas; and non-cognitive/socio-emotional “soft” skills to strengthen the
foundational core aspects of a person’s agency, i.e. self-esteem, self-confidence, aspirations,
autonomy. The latter set of skills was identified as particularly relevant for programs working in
employability in fragile settings but also reflects the increasing recognition of how cognitive and
socio-emotional skills build on each other, starting in early childhood (Helmers and Patnam, 2011).
(See also Annex X.4 for a discussion of the concept employability in an expanded framework)

The Haiti AGI uses an expanded version of the asset-based framework that links
endowment of assets, use (and intensity of use) of assets, and returns to assets, and
considers the role of subjective factors such as socio-emotional/soft skills. The assets-based
approach can prove useful to study employability, by offering a wider perspective on the drivers and
outcomes. Based on the asset-based framework, a person’s income generation capacity depends on
Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2014) and Lopez-Calva and Rodriguez-Castelan (2014):
            The endowments of assets;
            The use (and the intensity of use) of assets;
            The return of assets.
Assets are typically understood to include physical and financial assets (private such as tools and
bank deposits and public such as roads and welfare support); natural assets (such as land); human
capital (education and health); and social capital. In an augmented framework, one can include types
of skills that have been increasingly recognized to matter to individuals’ outcomes, namely socio-
emotional/soft skills (Duckworth et al., 2007; Heckman et al., 2012; and Cuevas and Favara, 2015).
Those skills include key traits and behaviors such as self-confidence, self-efficacy, autonomy of




                                                                                                     9
decisions, perseverance, aspirations, and expectations. This socio-emotional capital3 is also a key
aspect of agency, i.e. the capacity to make choices and turn decisions into action, a crucial dimension
in the process of achieving development outcomes (Sen 1981, 1999).4 The capacity to use and
convert assets into well-being and desired outcomes differs among individuals and depends on initial
endowments and their interaction with the context (markets, institutions, social norms). This
interaction defines people’s ability to convert means (e.g. technical and socio-emotional skills) into
valuable opportunities (or capabilities, “being able to work”) and outcome (or functioning, “have a
job”).5 Life-skills further complement and enhance those intangible assets, particularly in the case of
vulnerable groups.

3 Socio-emotional aspects are also called psycho-social and soft-skills. The terms are used interchangeably in the report with a
preference given to soft-skills. See Annex X.X on soft-skills.
4 Beyond this socio-emotional capital, other authors have also proposed approaches to better account for the subjective dimensions of

employability, notably how it relates to not only the way individuals come to perceive and understand the labor market they are
entering, but also the types of dispositions, attitudes, and identities they develop around their future work and employability
(Tomlinson, 2007).
For instance, looking at higher-education graduates, Holmes (2001) develops an “identity approach” to employability, seeing
employability as relational, emergent, and influenced largely by one’s “lived experience” of the labor market. Individuals’ experiences
of work are subjective, and this is likely to influence their actual labor market outcomes and further shape their propensity for
employment. Employability in this sense may be seen to be value- and identity-driven, relating to graduates’ own pre-dispositions and
biographies.
5 The framework helps explain why individuals endowed with the same assets are not equally successful in the process of making

choices, converting those choices into actions and finally achieving the desired outcome of converting those assets into livelihood
(Sen, 1981 and 1999). In so doing, the proposed framework also enables the consideration of dimensions highlighted in the 2014
World Development Report (Mind, Society and Behavior) that recognized the role of social expectation in sharing individuals ’
preferences. These preferences are themselves dependent on the context in which they are elicited and on the social institutions that
have formed the interpretative frameworks through which individuals see the world (Basu, 2010; Fehr and Hoff, 2011; World Bank
2014a).

                                                                                                                                   10
The assets-based conceptual framework has been supported by academic research and has also been
extensively used in other studies that have analyzed the determinants of progress of poverty
reduction and shared prosperity around the world (for these issues, see, for instance, Attanasio and
Székely, 1999 and Carter and Barrett, 2006). This model is particularly useful to present a
characterization of intra- and inter-generational economic mobility, chronic and transient poverty,
and between-group inequities (poor and non-poor, bottom 40 and top 60, minorities, etc.) that
potentially thwart certain vulnerable populations from fully participating in and benefiting from the
development process.

Furthermore, it is useful to consider agency and its multiple dimensions at two levels: the
individual in relation to others, and the individual in relation to self. Agency is the capacity to
make choices and translate them into desired actions and outcomes. Because agency is a complex
and encompassing construct, it is useful to break down its analysis by distinguishing aspects of the
individual in relation to others and the individual in relation to self. For the former, this report
focuses on autonomy of decision making, autonomy of mobility, and quality of relationships. For
the latter, the report analyzes includes self-esteem, confidence, capacity to aspire, mindset, and
stress. Figure 2 summarizes these elements.

In particular, aspirations (and capacity to aspire) is growingly acknowledged as an
important element for development outcomes. The role of aspirations in development has
gained increased recognition in the economic literature over the past decade (see Box 1). Leading
researchers such as Barnejee and Dufflo (2012), Dercon and Singh (2013), and Ray (2006, 2010)
have helped give more visibility to the role of aspirations, notably in the perpetuation of “poverty
traps” in which people are trapped in a self-reinforcing cycle of poverty, low aspirations, and sense


                                                                                                      11
of helplessness.6 The World Bank has come to recognize aspirations’ importance in the reduction of
poverty and the expansion of prosperity, notably through the promotion of empowerment and
agency (Alsop et al., 2006; World Bank, 2012; and World Bank 2014b). The concept of aspiration
has direct application to employability through “aspirations traps.” Alsop et al. (2006) documents
how sense of inferiority helps cause underinvestment and subsequent under-accumulation of human
capital by women and minority groups:

          “[Such] groups frequently underinvest in their human capital because they have been
          brought up to believe that they cannot do certain things that other people can do. [They]
          internalize their second class status in ways that cause them to make choices that perpetuate
          their disempowered status.”


Box 1 : The role of aspiration in the reduction of poverty and the expansion of shared prosperity

The role of aspiration in development has gained wider recognition over the past decade, although its origins
can be traced to older literature. In his seminal book La Distinction (1979), Pierre Bourdieu describes how a
person’s social environment generally determines his or her interests, tastes, and ideas about life. During the
process of socialization, children learn what “children like them” typically believe and enjoy doing (Bourdieu
called this habitus). The children then incorporate these social norms into their own lives. In this way, the
subconscious incorporation of norms, aspirations, and goals influences careers and other life choices. People
usually consider pursuing only the options with which they are familiar. For example, if going to college is
not usually an option for “a person like you,” you will not consider it. This approach emphasizes how
aspiration levels and living standards are transmitted from one generation to the next.

More recent literature has demonstrated the relevance of those findings and their implication for
development. For instance, Dercon and Singh (2013) demonstrate these transmissions with data from
Ethiopia and India. In these cases, parents tend to have higher aspirations for boys than for girls. Over time,
as the children became older, they too assimilate the respective aspirations of their parents. The study found
that, eventually, the educational levels of boys and girls reflect these aspirations, with boys attaining higher
levels of education.

Bourdieu’s work also suggests an important link between aspirations and identity. When people construct an
opinion about what is possible for “people like them,” they consider the experiences and aspirations of peers
(Ray, 2006). As a result, role models can have an important impact on people’s aspirations in both a positive
and negative way. For instance, Beaman et al. (2009) showed that the presence of women in leadership
positions in India lessened the gender bias in parents’ aspirations. In Madagascar, Nguyen (2008) investigated
the effect of role models on aspiration levels. The author carried out an experiment in which people with
successful educations shared their experiences with skeptical parents in order to improve how much value
the parents would place on education. The study found that parents tended to be influenced only if the “role
model” came from a similar socioeconomic background—in this case, from a poor background.




6On the other hand, more privileged individuals tend to be more optimistic and even upwardly biased about their capacities. As noted
by Wilkinson and Pickett (2010), “the further up the social ladder you are, the more help the world seems to give you in keep ing the
self-doubts at bay.” Stutzer (2004) confirms that income aspirations grow with higher income levels.

                                                                                                                                 12

Making use of an augmented assets approach, the study proceeds to analyze whether a training
program that increases the endowments of human capital and socio-emotional assets of its
beneficiaries is able to improve their employability.


     III.      The Haiti AGI project
Informed by extensive consultations, the integrated design of the Haiti AGI placed the
beneficiaries at the heart of a network including community NGOs, training centers, and
employers. Building on the identified issues and challenges to the agency and employability of
young females, the Haiti AGI team and partners set out to develop a project comprehensively
integrating different components aimed at addressing the facets of the vulnerability experienced by
these young women.

                                    Figure 3: The Haiti AGI integrated project design




The Haiti AGI prioritized working with recognized community-based organizations to
ensure proximity to and familiarity with the communities where the beneficiaries reside and
to build the capacity of Haitian NGOs. The five community NGOs selected for the project are
located in five quartiers (neighborhoods) of Port-au-Prince. Following a public expression of interest
(EOI) and consultations with the Gender Ministry (MCFDF) and other partners (international
organizations and NGOs), the community NGOs were selected. They were picked on the basis of
their experience working with vulnerable young women in the five quartiers and their management
capacity to provide accompaniment services and deliver soft-skill training to an average of 100
young women in each of two cohorts for two periods of six months.7 Five NGOs were eventually


7 Community NGOs with a lesser capacity, for instance due to a smaller building capacity to host the soft-skills sessions, were asked
to follow a smaller number of young women (no less than 75), while those with more capacity hosted a larger cohort of up to 150.

                                                                                                                                 13
identified.8 Close monitoring and capacity-building training were provided to ensure the effective
management of the project.
Box 2. Selection process of the Haiti AGI beneficiaries

Targeting. The target population of the project is out-of-school vulnerable young women aged 17-21 in five
poor neighborhoods (quartiers) of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The neighborhoods—Delmas 30, Delmas 32,
Carrefour-Feuilles, Martissant, and Pétionville—were selected based on the poorer socio-economic profiles
of their inhabitants (see map of Port-au-Prince and the locations of the quartiers in Annex X.1.) The
selection of the training centers and community NGOs also factored in the home locations of the
beneficiaries to limit the commute, ensure the proximity of the accompaniment of the beneficiaries in their
community, and limit safety risks. The project was funded to provide training to a total of 1,000 young
women.

Selection criteria: Consultations with NGOs (local and international), training centers, social and education
specialists as well as employers were used to refine the criteria used to select the project’s participants. A
review of comparable programs and projects (including other AGI pilots) helped confirm those criteria and
their relevance for the development objective of the project. Five main criteria were defined:

    -    Female gender (given the AGI focus on young women)
    -    Age: 17-21 years
    -    Out of school for over a year
    -    Basic literacy and numeracy ability (as demonstrated by passing an academic test)
    -    Living in one of the five selected neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince.

In the consultations, enforcement of a household or per capita income threshold was not deemed feasible.
Instead, the selection relied on the quartier of residence of the young women and the knowledge of the
community NGOs of the background of the candidates.

Recruitment. The community NGOs ran campaigns and mobilization efforts to recruit young women for the
project. Many self-identified, which demonstrated a pre-existing level of motivation and interest, and is
considered to be important for the objective of the program. The young women were required to take an
academic test to ensure basic levels of literacy and numeracy. The World Bank worked closely with the firm
hired to collect data for the impact evaluation to make sure that all young women selected were of the right
age and level of academic ability.

Academic testing. Imaginescence, a Haitian company that specializes in educational testing, was hired to
prepare and administer the exam. This testing of numeracy and literacy skills (reading, writing, and math
skills) was necessary to ensure that the candidates had a sufficient academic level to enable them to follow
the proposed technical training. In spite of guarantees provided by the firm, the test proved to be too
difficult for and not well adapted to the academic level of the young women.9 The test scores were very low.
Still, the test provided a baseline and a metric for qualification. Subsequent “entry testing” by the training
firms confirmed that the young women had the required levels of numeracy and literacy.


8  The community NGOs are: APROSIFA (Carrefour-Feuille), ANAPFEH (Delmas 32), YWCA (Pétionville), COFEHAPS
(Martissant), and JP/HRO (Delmas 30). While JP/HRO qualifies as an international organizatio n, the organization’s mandate is
focused on Haiti and the organization has been well-established in community work since the earthquake.
9 The academic format of the test appears to have intimidated a number of the candidates.


                                                                                                                          14
Cohort assignment. Due to the design of the project and its impact evaluation, the beneficiaries were divided
into two cohorts through a lottery-based randomization process conducted in each of the quartiers in
October 2012 under the supervision of the project field coordinator.



“Non-traditional” technical training was selected for the project based on extensive
consultation with stakeholders to seize on existing employment opportunities. Informed by
in-depth consultations with employers and other stakeholders, the project focus was set on non-
traditional technical training (i.e. training not typically associated with female employability
interventions) so as to seize upon opportunities linked to post-earthquake reconstruction both in the
formal and informal sector. The employer assessment conducted in 2011 also identified interest by
employers to hire more women, who were considered to display higher work ethics than men.
Converging evidence on the evolution of social norms regarding acceptable sector and jobs for
women also presented an opportunity for the AGI pilot to better understand the types of skills and
support needed to overcome gender-specific barriers to employability. The technical training was
provided by public and private centers selected notably for the recognized quality of their
training and their labor-market orientation. Extensive consultations, notably with employers,
and an assessment by the American Institutes of Research were conducted in the design phase of
the project regarding the availability of technical training in Haiti.10 This served to evaluate proposals
received through the EOI in early 2012.11 In a sector dominated by private providers, the bids
varied greatly in quality, relevance, and price. Eventually four private training providers were selected
to complement the public offer by INFP.12 While a mixed approach of public and private provision
of technical skills was envisioned from the start, this PPP approach was further mandated by the
limited training capacity of the INFP following the 2010 earthquake, which had destroyed all of its
centers.13 One of the training centers (Centre Polyvalent de Formation Professionnelle de Carrefour—
CPFPC) was under reconstruction at the time of the first cohort’s training but was integrated as a
training provider for the second cohort. Still, the INFP’s involvement in the project was critical to
ensuring that the lessons learnt through the project would be welcomed and possibly adopted by the
relevant ministerial counterparts. The selection of private providers certified by the INFP also


10 In 2011, American Institutes for Research (AIR)—a not-for profit organization specializing in behavioral, social research, and
evaluation—was contracted to undertake an assessment of the available supply of vocational training centers in Haiti., with emphasis
on management and operation and links to labor markets. The final report (“Promoting the Economic Empowerment of Adolescent
Girls in Haiti: Definitions, Design Options and Project Profiles”) was submitted to the World Bank in December 2012.
11The selection criteria for the training providers included: A solid reputation among employers in Port-au-Prince; at least five years of

experience successfully implementing vocational training programs, with those targeted to young women considered a plus; solid
technical training materials that have been successfully tested and meet criteria for INFP’s certification; evidence-supported
connections to the private sector; a job placement office or staff allocated for this purpose ; demonstrated success placing graduates in
jobs; experienced and well-respected teachers; and neighborhood location of the training center which must also be a space where
participants feel safe and comfortable.
12 The four training centers selected were: APEX, Haiti Tec, INFOP, and Transversal.
13 Effectiveness of private-sector providers of technical trainings has been better documented in developed countries, where non-

experimental literature has found evidence that the impacts of training is higher when provided by private providers (Jespersen et al.,
2008). Provided that the selection of training providers is adequate, possible reasons are that private providers are more responsive to
private-sector employer demand and/or they potentially face more competition and thus must increase quality in response. A recent
experimental evaluation of active labor market programs in Turkey shows that contracting with private providers can substantially
improve results (Hirshleifer et al., 2014).

                                                                                                                                      15
helped reinforce the links between private and public training providers, further deepened through
the regular project monitoring meetings organized at the World Bank office with representatives of
the respective training providers.

Training to develop entrepreneurship and self-employment skills was considered, but
ultimately it was decided to focus on technical training. 14 While entrepreneurship can be an
important option for vulnerable youth programs, such programs have wide variation in
effectiveness, and do not necessarily translate into faster business setup and expansion or increased
income (Cho and Honorati, 2013). It is challenging to identify beneficiaries that are predisposed to
become successful entrepreneurs in the context of Haiti. This is why the project design rather
focused on building the human capital of the young women through training and on-the-job
experience in trades also potentially offering self-employment opportunities.



Box 3: Building partnerships with ministries

While the Haiti AGI was implemented by the World Bank, as a result of the 2010 earthquake, it strived to
develop a strong client approach from the start. The Ministry of Education and Technical Training (Ministère
de l’Education et de la Formation Professionnelle- MENFP)-, and the Ministry of Gender Affairs (Ministère de la
Condition Féminine et aux Droits des Femmes - MCFDF) were consulted early on to develop the design
and the gender focus of the AGI. During implementation, a partnership was developed with the Technical
Training Secretariat (INFP, within the Ministry of Education), which is ideally positioned to further
incorporate lessons into ongoing and future programs.

Issues such as soft-skills and M&E were identified to the counterparts as being of particular interest and
were therefore received priority in discussions and technical workshops. In a context of high ministerial
turnover and political instability, the project team was able to build trust and support for the project as a
platform for cooperation. Moving forward, this strong client focus in a context of highly constrained client
capacity, combined with the solid civil society partnerships and labor market orientation of the project, also
provided the Bank with unique direct experience and made it a recognized voice on the issues related to
skills/technical training, youth and jobs. These were all identified priorities of the government’s three-year
investment plan (Plan Triennal d’Investissement, 2014-2016), as well as the recently completed Haiti Systematic
Country Diagnostic (World Bank, 2015).


Employers have been involved at all stages of the Haiti AGI. Maintaining connection with the
private sector and providing technical training reflecting short- to medium-term opportunities in
Haiti’s labor market have been key priorities of the Haiti AGI. While informality dominates Haiti’s
labor markets, the Haiti AGI opted to provide quality technical training that would allow for
graduates to move into jobs in the formal sectors. All the while it recognized the reality that informal
sectors and self-employment would likely be the receiving segments of Haiti’s labor markets for the
AGI trainees.15 Employers from the sectors for which the AGI beneficiaries were being trained were

14 A partnership with IFC to provide the “Business edge training” to 100 young women displaying the most potential in terms of
entrepreneurship qualities (to be identified by the training centers) was envisioned but could not be implemented for funding reasons.
15 Results from the 2012 ECVMAS show that outside of the primary sector, self-employment and informality are the rule: 44% of the

workforce is employed at the informal private sector. That means that close to 90% of workers in Haiti are outside the modern formal

                                                                                                                                  16
directly connected to the project through regular consultations, and by the project team and training
centers’ preparation for internships.16 These one-month internships provided the young graduates
with direct experience in their sectors.17 Internships are an important employment placement
instrument, but they remain unusual in Haiti.

The Haiti AGI placed a premium on providing soft-skills training. Building on best practices
worldwide, the Haiti AGI developed a high-quality soft-skill and life-skills curriculum of eight
modules: Self-esteem; civic engagement and leadership; reproductive health; gender-based violence
and responses to it; preparing for the workplace and work ethics; disaster preparedness; financial
literacy; and living with a disability.18 The mix of soft-skills and life-skills was informed by the focus
of the project on vulnerable young women and the specific context of Haiti.19 Existing curriculum
proved to be ill-adapted to the Haitian context, being mere translation of curriculum developed for
other countries, notably in Africa. Based on consultations with partners, the Haiti AGI worked with
Haitian education specialists and illustrators to develop a curriculum adapted to the context of Haiti.
The soft-skills training was administered through face-to-face student-centered sessions taking place
on week-ends on a morning/afternoon rotating basis, at the office of the respective community
NGOs and in parallel with the technical training. Based on consultations with the community
NGOs to define a standardized method to teach this curriculum, the training prioritized interactivity
and role-playing.

Stipends to cover the costs of attending training were provided to the AGI beneficiaries,
using cell-phone based technology (mobile money) to reduce risks and increase control over
the funds. The Haiti AGI provided stipends to enable the young women to cover minor costs
associated with their participation in training. The stipend aimed to cover the cost of transportation
to and from the training centers and other related expenses for attendance. The stipends amounted
to about US$40 per month, a level defined based on consultation with community NGOs and on
training centers’ experience working with other international partners that had provided stipends to
trainees. The overall financial capacity of the project was also a consideration.20 The delivery of the

sector, be it private, public or in NGOs. Among workers in the informal sector, almost 60% work as self-employed or unpaid workers
in family firms. Wage employment is much more prevalent at the Metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince (32%) and other urban areas
(27%) than in the countryside (16%). The vast majority of workers in the informal sector, furthermore, are employed in low-
productivity sectors—six out of ten work in the traditionally low-productivity retail and wholesale sector. Another 15% are employed
in other services and 8% in construction.
16 The project team had envisioned hosting monthly or bi-monthly breakfast workshops with selected employers to discuss their

management and human resource experience, but this did not turn out to be feasible, for reasons of cost as well as limited capacity to
dedicate to organizing those events. In addition, feedback suggested that attendance would be limited.
17 The one-month internships were unpaid but the young women received their stipends during them.
18 This eighth module was developed and financed through a grant provided by the Y2Y fund. The recipient of the grant, Francesca

de Antoni, worked with the Haiti AGI team and other partners of the AGI to develop the corresponding module.
19
    The terminology of soft-skills has been used to characterize skills that have also been defined as socio-emotional in recent and still evolving
literature on the issue. The authors recognize the typology of skills emerging from initiative such as the World Bank Skill Measurement Program
(STEP) and its corresponding surveys, but elected the concept of ‘soft -skills’ as the AGI intervention did not target all the skills associated with
the terminology defined by the STEP survey.
20The amount was considered to be on the lower end of typical stipends provided at the time in comparable projects in Haiti (more in
the range of US$80-$100), with some concern that the beneficiaries might consider the amount too low. But they did not express such
misgivings and no drop-out was linked to the stipend level. In fact, in a private center that simultaneously hosted the AGI trainees and
a group of youth sponsored by another international organization, center officials noted the higher participation rate and motivation

of handing over cash to the women and to help enforce the financial management lessons provided
during training.21

The Haiti AGI stressed gender-informed safety and security throughout the project cycle
and design. As a project focused on vulnerable young women, the Haiti AGI placed a premium on
the physical safety of its participants. Port-au-Prince is well known for its volatility and protracted
insecurity, a concern heightened in the quartiers of the AGI project (notably Carrefour-Feuille and
Martissant). While this reality applies to all inhabitants of Port-au-Prince, the poor and vulnerable
are more directly exposed to it because their neighborhoods are often the focus of gang-led violence,
and they have fewer options they have to protect themselves. One of the greatest risks facing the
Haiti AGI beneficiaries was physical assault, particularly sexual violence. Such violence can be
experienced in the private as in the public sphere, so the project implemented different approaches
to address it:

          Limiting commuting time: The project design recognized the importance of limiting the
           commuting of the AGI trainees to reduce their exposure to assault when traveling to or
           from their courses. Beneficiaries were matched to training centers located within the most
           reasonable commuting time feasible, on average 30 minutes. Technical training offering
           employment opportunities in specific locations of Port-au-Prince (for example, the
           SONAPI industrial park) were flagged as such to the trainees. Those residing in more
           distant quartiers were asked to consider the time and money costs resulting from the needed
           commute before finalizing their technical training choice. This approach was also applied to
           the internship component of the project: the trainees were matched to internships within
           reasonable distance from their quartier of residence.
          Training schedule: The training schedules proposed half-day classes taking place in the
           morning, allowing the young women to travel to and from during daylight.
          Gender-sensitive training: Gender-sensitive training led by the field project coordinators
           was organized in the different technical training centers to sensitize trainers to working with
           vulnerable young women. The training aimed at preventing abuse and inappropriate
           situations, as well as identifying behaviors (e.g. restlessness, acting-up, depression, and
           absence) by the women that might indicate a situation of abuse or assault.
          Mentors as sentinels: Due to their proximity to the beneficiaries, the mentors played a key
           role in sensitizing about sexual violence, providing information regarding prevention and
           recourse in case of sexual violence, and accompanying young women to request services or
           assistance related to violence.22


21The first installments were paid through the training center partners due to delays in the setting up of the Tcho-Tcho system of the
cellphone operator Digicel.


22The AGI team facilitated the emergency housing of several AGI beneficiaries facing situations of domestic violence, in partnership
with the community NGOs.

                                                                                                                                  18
            Using cell phones for communication and stipend payment: The beneficiaries were
             provided with cell phones and some minimal air time on the Digicel network to enable
             them to give the alert and request assistance in case of dangerous situations.23 The cell
             phones were also used to distribute the stipends to the beneficiaries so as to limit their risk
             of being robbed and to provide them with a greater control over the use of those funds.

In a country where gender-based violence is “committed with near complete impunity” (OHCHR,
2012), a network of measures and interventions is needed to prevent and address it. Mechanisms to
prevent and respond to violence against women remain limited and the justice system ill-equipped to
deal with this pressing issue (MINUSTAH, 2013).24 In light of this bleak reality, the Haiti AGI opted
to place a strong focus on prevention of this violence and accompaniment of young women facing
it, notably through the network of NGOs providing support that is more targeted to this type of
violence and care.

Monitoring and evaluation has been central to the Haiti AGI. As a pilot, the Haiti AGI had
evaluation as a key dimension. On the monitoring side, an online platform was developed to
facilitate the tracking of information regarding the beneficiaries’ technical and soft-skill training
(courses followed, grades, and attendance). During the first cohort, local partners received extensive
capacity building in how to monitor the program through the online platform. However, in spite of
this training and the support of the M&E field coordinator, the platform turned out to be too
difficult for some partners to use. Given the importance of providing timely information on the
trainees to enable partners to act—for instance, with respect to absence or dropping grades—a more
user-friendly Excel-based system was used for the second cohort. This system, based on weekly
submission of grades and attendance by the training centers and community organizations, required
the M&E coordinator to manually aggregate the results and send back a summary report to the
partners for action. This approach was rendered possible by the capacity-building investment during
the first cohort and the familiarity of the partners with the reporting process. This system was
instrumental to monitor and manage program drop-out. (See. Table 1)

mentors numbers and project field coordinator number).
24 Concerning rape, while the Haiti penal code has recognized rape since 2005, it does not define the acts constituting such an offense.

Discussions in 2012 related to a wide revision of the Haitian Penal Code included a definition of rape, but so far no changes have
resulted. Furthermore, many challenges, including the victim’s need to produce a medical certificate, the push by judges for cases to
be resolved through “mediation and reparation,” and the overall lack of rigor and neglect in the registering of cases add to the overall
complexity of seeing victims heard and perpetrators brought to justice. (MINUSTAH, 2013).

To monitor labor market transitions of the graduates, particularly movement in and out of the labor
force, the team tested gathering information using the cell phones that beneficiaries of both cohorts
had received for the distribution of the stipends. This SMS-based survey, undertaken six months
after the training of the second cohort and over a year after the end of the training of the first,
yielded limited results, notably because many cell phones were found to be disconnected. Still, the
experience indicated the potential of this complementary instrument for future programs (see Box
4).



Box 4. Collecting labor market status updates through cell phones

Collecting regular information on the status of the beneficiaries has been a key priority of the Haiti AGI
project. The use of cell phones to complement the data collection was envisioned early in the process.
Delays in reaching a contract with the firm in charge of implementing the mobile money complicated the
expansion of the use of cell phones for other components of the project.

However, following the end of the training and internship phases of the project for both cohorts, cell
phones were used to collect data on the job status of the beneficiaries. Using the cell phone numbers
provided by the project to all beneficiaries, the SMS-based survey was initiated in December 2014.

Following three messages of introduction explaining the survey’s goals that participation was free of charge,
and that answering would result in a HTG $50 airtime credit, the five survey questions were sent to the full
group of beneficiaries (see Annex X.7 for a list of the questions and their Creole translations). The results of
this survey were limited. For one, there is high turn-over in cell-phone numbers in Haiti and few young
women of the first cohort responded. Results were better for the second cohort, although not as high as
expected. This situation of turn-over may change with the recent introduction of permanent and cheap SIM
card that do not need to be recharged with air time every month. While questions on labor status did not
yield data sufficient to complement the results from the impact and qualitative evaluations, cell phones
remain a powerful instrument for data collection. Future projects with an employability focus should
consider including cell phones and air time/small financial incentives as tools in the collection of data on
labor market and job search status.




A randomized impact evaluation, the first of its kind for a project related to labor and skills
issues in Haiti, and two qualitative surveys completed the Haiti AGI strategy to provide
evidence-based lessons. The impact evaluation of the AGI project was designed as a randomized
control trial in which individuals eligible for the program were randomly assigned to take part in one
of the two cohorts of the technical and soft-skills training. Selection of the cohorts was done
                                                                                                                 20
through a public lottery supervised by the project field coordinator in each NGO. The number of
cohort slots available for each NGO varied from 75 to 150, depending on the
management/accompaniment capacity of the NGO. The evaluation’s treatment group consisted of
the young women of the first cohort, while the control group consisted of all the rest of the women.
The two rounds of surveys included two questionnaires: one individual and one for the household.
The baseline survey was conducted in August-October 2012, before the young women knew their
cohort assignment. The follow-up survey, envisioned as a mid-line, was conducted three months
after the completion of the first round of training of the treatment group and before the start of the
training of the second cohort, the control group. The quantitative results of this report are thus
based on a panel dataset that comprises data from the baseline and follow-up surveys as well as
administrative and monitoring data from the program implementation. The quantitative evaluation
was complemented and enhanced by two rounds of data collected after each round of training (May
2013 and December 2014-January 2015). The qualitative evaluations were especially effective at
capturing emotions, feelings, aspirations, quotes, and opinions that are not easily quantified in an
impact evaluation. Through these evaluations, deeper contextual information was gathered on the
effectiveness of program design, implementation, short-term impacts, and the expectations,
feedback, and realities facing all stakeholders. Annex X.11 presents the methodological details of the
impact evaluation.
Box 5. Operational Lessons for Project and Evaluation Leaders

The Haiti AGI was implemented in particularly complex setting combining post-disaster and
political instability. As Bank-executed project the task team faced a number of procurement
challenges related to the limited number of eligible firms, organizations or consultants able respond
to expression of interest (EOI). Having put a premium of working with local partners the team had
to overcome the difficulties of shepherding selected partners through the contracting process
combining lack of experience working with an international organization in general (and the World
Bank in particular) with language-specific challenges.25 The main lesson from this experience refers
to planning sufficient time for such contracting as part of the project preparation/ design phase and
working closely with the procurement team (formerly GSD) and ideally the same person to avoid
repetition, close communication with partners (including for the confirmation of payments in later
stages of the project).
The issue of security and the volatility of the political situation require the planning of contingency
plans, particularly for the starting dates of project activities which postponing can affect the quality
or efficiency of the overall project. Open communication with the country management unit is key
to manage expectation. With respect to the impact evaluation, which design heavily depended on
the timing of the data collection, the planning of contingency plan is at least as important if not
more. While the team had envisioned a number of scenarios, particularly in terms of safety/
security, delay in selection process, contracting etc. the occurrence of a major hurricane during the
data collection of the baseline (hurricane Sandy) and the disconnection of cell phones resulting
from the merging between the two main cell-phones companies (Voilà and Digicel) added further
complication and caused delays that reduced the timeframe between the two rounds of data
collection. Finally, consideration for the surveying of longer-term impacts of projects such as the
AGI should be given early in the project design, with the possibility of data collection extending

                                                                                                      21
beyond the project implementation phase. At the moment, the institutional set-up is not adequate
for the data collection of closed project/activities not directly followed by a new project integrating
such data collection/evaluation in its design. This is an important challenge to overcome for the
proper evaluation of this type of intervention – and the assessment of their true impact and cost-
effectiveness that is truncated by evaluation design only able to capture short to medium term
impact by necessity.



     IV.      Who are the AGI trainees?

Between May 2012, date of the launch of the project and start of the identification of the
beneficiaries, and August 2014, the end of training and internships of the second cohort, the Haiti
AGI worked with over 1,000 vulnerable Haitian young women between the ages of 17 and 21. The
goal was to increase their employability in both its objective dimension of labor market transition
outcomes and its subjective dimension, such as soft-skills and agency.
This section presents a summary of the main characteristics of the Haiti beneficiaries.

The typical Haiti AGI beneficiary is a young woman who is, on average, 20 years old, single
and has never married. This average age is in line with the target of the project to focus on young
women aged 17 to 21 years, in view of the employability objective. Almost 90% of the young
women are single, and never married, but 50% are in a relationship, 14% already have at least one
child, and only 2% were pregnant at the time of the baseline survey.

On average, AGI beneficiaries live in a household of five people, including the household
head, who in most cases is a woman with a primary or higher level of education. Only 26%
of the AGI beneficiaries live with their father and mother, but around 98% live with the household
head and her/his spouse, where in 72% of the cases the household head is female.26 Household
heads are on average 45 years old and more than 60% of them are literate in French, Creole and
math. Around 37% of household heads have a level of education lower than primary, 18% have
primary complete but secondary incomplete, and 37% report having a certificate of secondary
education or higher. The average household size of AGI beneficiaries is about five members, of
which three or four are women.

While more than half of the beneficiaries’ households had to move to a new dwelling due to
the 2010 earthquake, nowadays more than 60% live in buildings with access to drinking
water and pit latrines or flush toilets. About 54% of the households of beneficiaries had to
change dwelling because of the earthquake of 2010. The majority lives now in low houses (52%) or
ajoupas (20%) and 44% own their houses. The most common source of drinking water is “bottled
mineral water” (37%) followed by “private connection to pipeline” (15%) and public tap (14%). Due

26The interpretation of the high number of female-headed households should be done with caution. It may reflect the prevalence of
women among the survey respondents rather than social dynamics identifying the household head as female even when her
husband/companion lives with the household.

                                                                                                                             22
to the urban nature of the households, the most common system of human waste disposal is “own
improved pit latrine” (44%) followed by “own flush toilet” (27%) and “public flush toilet” (9%).

Consistent with the Haiti AGI selection criteria, all beneficiaries had basic knowledge of
math, and could read and write in French and Creole. More than 90% of the women had
primary or higher education and the average beneficiary had 11 years of education. Specifically,
about 15% had a primary education certificate by the time of the baseline survey, 50% had a Brevet27
certificate, and 23% had a certificate of Brevet Superior, Baccalaureate I or II. Although the pre-
requisites to enter the program meant that the group of beneficiaries was not entirely comparable to
all young women in Port-au-Prince, these results broadly reflect the educational characteristics of
young women ages 17 to 21 in Port-au-Prince, as established by the ECVMAS 2012.28 About a
quarter of the program participants had already received some sort of vocational training, but only
half finished it and received a certificate. On average, beneficiaries who had received vocational
training before considered it useful.

Labor market participation was low among beneficiaries, and most who were engaged in
income-generating activities had a subsistence type of job, which was reflected in their labor
earnings. About 17% of the beneficiaries were engaged in an income-generating activity (IGA) at
the time of the baseline survey, of whom 22% were hair-dressers, 19% were street vendors, and 10%
worked at home production for sales. About 66% of the working beneficiaries reported working for
themselves, while 13% said they worked for a family business. In terms of income, the average
monthly earnings of the beneficiaries were HTG$2,038 (including zero incomes), which are
equivalent to about US$105 PPP. In a typical day, 40% of the AGI beneficiaries reported earning
HTG$50 or less, which corresponds to around US$2.50 PPP. That means that the bottom 40 of the
beneficiaries who had a job were earning below the international poverty line of US$2.50 per day.

The labor market characteristics of the AGI beneficiaries are a close but not perfect
representation of those of young women between 17 and 21 years of age in Port-au-Prince.
Though the AGI beneficiaries are not entirely comparable to all young women in Port-au-Prince,
due particularly to the pre-requisites of selection, some labor market characteristics of the AGI
beneficiaries are quite similar to the average. The age group’s employment rate, for instance, is lower
in Port-au-Prince by only 3 percentage points, with the majority of young women working in the
informal sector (71 percent in the metropolitan area versus 66 percent for the beneficiaries). Young
women in the city reported an average monthly labor income of HTG$3,564, which is only slightly
higher than the average reported by AGI beneficiaries of HTG$3,015.

27 Following the French system of education, the primary education certificate in Haiti is awarded after completing the first six years
of education, which consist of two years of Préparatoire, two years of Elémentaire and two years of Moyen classes. The Brevet (equivalent
to junior high) certificate is awarded after completing the following four years of education (Sixième, Cinquième, Quatrième, and
Troisième); and the Brevet Superior, Baccalaureate I and II (equivalent to high school) certificates are delivered after completing the
following three years of education: Seconde, Première and Terminale.
28 According to the information in the survey ECVMAS 2012, which is representative of the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince, of

all women between 17 and 21 years of age in Port-au-Prince, 98% are literate, 21% have a degree of primary education, 51% have
completed secondary education and 12% have some certificate of tertiary education.

     V.        Impacts on overall agency and empowerment

The first set of impacts of the project shows that agency and socio-emotional assets of
beneficiaries rose. The impact evaluation of the intervention, comparing those who received the
soft-skills support and technical training and those who did not, indicates that socio-emotional
aspects and overall agency and empowerment improved. This was measured across various
dimensions, as presented in more detail in this section, and manifested in aspects in relation to
others and in relation to self. Interpreted in the context of the asset framework, the intervention
enhanced endowments of socio-emotional capital to improve the use and returns of assets.

Enhanced agency is manifested through empowering aspects in relation to others

The AGI trainees increased their autonomy in decision making on some key socio-
economic dimensions: Co-responsibility in income earning and autonomy in personal
spending. In a society with strong gender norms and roles, the treatment group experienced an
increase of seven percentage points in the belief that income generation is shared responsibility
between men and women. This matters for economic empowerment as a contributing factor in the
decision to engage in non-traditional technical sectors and activities. In the context of the
augmented asset framework, autonomy as an element of agency helps determine the use and
intensity of use of assets, and therefore economic wellbeing. Better autonomy improves young
women’s capacity to overcome contextual constraints in norms and roles and pursue objectives
using their human capital in the labor market. Similarly, there was an impact on the AGI trainees’
autonomy in personal spending and decisions related to work, education, and relationships, and to
making life plans for the future (Figure 4, see Annex X.11 for details).

But in other areas, the persistence of norms and roles was confirmed in the impact
evaluation—the expectation was still that women would handle child care, cooking, and

There was a positive impact on autonomy in the personal mobility of the AGI trainees.
Figure 5 shows that, compared to their control counterparts, AGI program participants were 15
percentage points more likely to go to school or training centers, 6 points more likely to go to
NGOs, and 8 points more likely to go to health centers. These results were reflected in a positive
and significant mobility index that sums up all recorded places of mobility. This is an encouraging
result as it shows that the AGI program increased young women’s interaction and involvement with
their community. This result is particularly interesting when considering the difficult security
environment prevailing in Port-au-Prince, and in the neighborhoods of residence of the trainees.
The young women’s increased capacity to move around the city is an important dimension to free
up constraints in the use of their assets, and their returns.

The project had a positive impact on expanding the support networks of the beneficiaries to
help them cope with difficult decisions and situations. Figure 6 shows that AGI participants
were more likely to talk to their partners about problems related to money, health, and children. The
qualitative evaluations supported this finding and credited the soft-skills training with playing a
critical role in this dimension. Another important result is that the program has increased parental
support of wage employment, and beneficiaries have more support for pursuing use of their assets
and job opportunities. Complementing the quantitative impact evaluation, the qualitative evaluations
attest to the change in mentality that occurred over the project cycle. Parents who were doubtful
about their daughters working outside of the home and all the more so about getting technical
training proved to be supportive upon seeing the young women graduate and find internships.
Given the rather short duration of the program, this is encouraging in terms of influencing
longstanding beliefs and norms. It potentially reduces important social and psychological barriers to
young women taking part in the labor market,30 notably in sectors that have provided the most jobs
since the earthquake (EVCMAS, 2012). Moreover, employers have signaled willingness to hire more
young women in non-traditional sectors and jobs.




30In terms of networks, the AGI had no effect on the likelihood of treatment individuals’ participation in professional associa tions or
business advice groups, but it reduced the likelihood of participants to be in groups of girls, possibly due to the reliance on the
network support provided by the Haiti AGI through the mentors.

The AGI beneficiaries demonstrated increased self-assertion in the intimate circle. The AGI
trainees displayed increased self-confidence, an important component to both agency and improved
labor market transition. Concurring evidence points to an increased self-control, capacity for anger
management related to intimate relationships, and non-acceptance of violent behavior from a
personal partner. Figure 7 shows that young women from the treatment group are less likely to
accept that a husband or boyfriend can hit his wife or girlfriend if she “questions him about
cheating,” “cheats with another man,” or “refuses to have sex with him,” The women’s reaction to
violence under other circumstances, such as arguing with or insulting her husband or boyfriend,
remain unchanged between treatment and control groups. However, the violence score decreased
around 0.18 standard deviations due to the AGI program, which reflects a general fall in acceptance
of violent behavior.31

the higher the total score, the higher tendency toward violence the respondent has. PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis, the

A noteworthy contribution of the project to poverty eradication is the improvement of
mindset and reduction of stress. Recent developments in the literature show that the ability of the
poor to make decisions and select choices that are in their best interest is affected by the stress they
are under (Mullainathan et al., 2013). A just-released regional study on chronic poverty (“Left
Behind”, World Bank, 2015) shows that mindset (including stressful states of mind) is a determinant
of as well as an area of policy to break the cycle of chronicity. The AGI impact evaluation shows
that the intervention significantly reduced mental stress and discomfort. Beneficiaries reported
feeling less overwhelmed, more in control, and managing their life better. As a result of the program,
they were more inclined to believe that their situations were the result of their actions and work
rather than fate or luck. An overall index of mental health considering issues of stress, anxiety, and
depression shows that beneficiaries’ mental status was significantly improved.

Increase of self-esteem and self-confidence is behind this overall improvement. Qualitative
evaluations conducted in May 2013 and December/January 2014 confirmed an overall improvement
in self-esteem and self-confidence among the Haiti AGI beneficiaries. The qualitative evaluations
attest to an improvement of the young women’s self-esteem and self-confidence.32 A key word
analysis of the qualitative work is telling in describing the overall enhanced agency and
empowerment of the participants. Improvements in their interaction with the context (respect from
others, better relationships), and their standing (independence, prepared for challenges) is supported
by enhancements in “the self,” i.e. confidence and esteem (Figure 9).




32The self-esteem scale included in the quantitative survey did not yield consistent variation. Regression analysis of the impact
evaluation does not pick up any systematic variability across treatment and control groups.

     VI.      Employment-related impacts in the short term and expected medium
              term

The AGI impact evaluation found that beneficiaries were changing the type of work they do,
while the share of people participating in income-generating activities decreased in the
short term, and their earnings did not change. Measurement of employment and labor income
three months after the completion of the program shows that beneficiaries were less likely to be
working, and, conditional on working, their earnings had not changed significantly. Before the AGI
project, few of the young women (11.4%) in both the treatment and control groups were engaged in
at least one income-generating activity (IGA). In contrast, beneficiaries were transitioning towards
higher-skilled jobs related to the technical training they received. The AGI program had a positive
and significant effect on leaning toward labor activities such as skilled labor and factory work.33

training. So analysis captures changes 3 months after program completion.

Impact evaluation shows that the program increased beneficiaries’ aspirations for more
education, and enhanced expectations for better employment in the future. Underlying the
beneficiaries’ lower participation in income generation found 3 months after program completion
was an enhanced drive to pursue further education, accumulate more skills, and delay labor market
participation. Young women who participated in the AGI project displayed higher expectations
towards school enrollment and future engagement in IGAs than their control group counterparts.
Figure 11 shows that compared to the control group, participants were 14 percentage points more
likely to expect to enroll in school and 12.7 points more likely to expect to be engaged in an IGA in
two years. Taken jointly with the results that beneficiaries are working less than non-beneficiaries
three months after program completion, the findings indicate that the AGI is enhancing agency,
aspirations and autonomy to develop life plans and pursue them, and that involves decision to
improve their own endowments (human capital) for better labor market insertion in the medium
term.

Complementarily, the AGI might have sensitized the trainees to the realities of labor markets in
Port-au-Prince, because they became more aware of the difficulties of finding and keeping jobs not
only for themselves but also for their family members. This was mirrored in the set of questions of
expectations, for which treated young women reported that they were more worried that they would
not get or keep a good job, or that their family would become more financially constrained.34 Those
results could indicate a negative corollary of the increased in empowerment, i.e. as the personal and
professional horizons of the trainees expanded, so did their awareness of the barriers and challenges.




34 These effects on expectations are reflected in the expectation index and PCA score, which are both positive and significant under all
specifications. The score of each individual question has a range of 1 to 5 which corresponds to the following values: 1 for "Much
better," 2 for "Better," 3 for "Same," 4 for "Worse," and 5 for "Much worse." The expectation sum score corresponds to the sum of
the scores of the four variables above, each one with a score 1 to 5. This means that the higher the score, the lower the overall
expectations of a respondent. PCA stands for principal component analysis, which is the method to consider the score of all
statements and formulate them in a standardized index.

The impacts on aspirations and expectations towards work life plans and outlook are
corroborated by the results of the qualitative evaluation. Two qualitative evaluations conducted
in May 2013 and December-January 2015 attest to an improvement in the trainees’ perceptions and
expectations vis-à-vis their economic outlook. Trainees reported that both the technical and soft-
skills training helped make them feel more in control of choices with respect to their professional
lives. The Haiti AGI project placed a premium on individual responsibility. It emphasized, both in
technical and soft-skills training, the opportunity presented by participation, the support system put
in place (through the technical training centers, community NGOs, and mentors) and also the
ultimate importance of personal motivation and commitment in a particularly complex and
constrained labor market. In a country that has seen a multiplication of programs and projects in the
years following the 2010 earthquake, it was crucial to emphasize the importance of seizing this
training opportunity and not expecting others to follow. This message was integrated into the soft-
skills discussion, directly relating to the matching motivation, expectations, and reality (see Section
VII for further discussion on this issue).

In addition to the trainees’ decision to prioritize further education over income generation
in the short term, results on employment may be explained by the limited time frame of the
evaluation. The randomized control trial phased-in design of the impact evaluation (see Annex
X.11) required a second round of data collection to take place before the second cohort started
training. Implementation delays compounded by security concerns shortened the period between the
end of the training of the first cohort and the starting date of the second cohort. It was relatively
expected to observe limited results on employment variables due to the short interval between
surveys.

Difficulties of transitioning in a highly depressed labor market should also be factored in.
While the interval between program completion and evaluation may have been too short to capture
the effective transition into labor of the AGI trainees, there is no denying that the reality of labor

                                                                                                                           32
markets in Haiti is an extremely harsh one, even by the standards of low-income and fragile
countries. While employment opportunities exist in the sectors where the Haiti AGI graduates
received their training, finding a permanent placement remains a complicated and lengthy task—
from awareness of an opening to access to the person entrusted with the hiring decision (as opposed
to lower-level staff acting as a de facto blocker or gate-keeper of applications) to the willingness of
employers to take a chance on candidates without strong ties to their social networks, and to move
from a temporary contracting basis (internship) to permanent contracting. Feedback received
through the qualitative evaluations confirms and qualifies those difficulties, as further detailed in the
next section. Balancing out efforts invested in job search with the reality of limited opportunities
ultimately hinges on individuals’ agency and capacity to self-motivate and persist.


    VII.    Considerations for future programs

Integrated design of the project
The integrated design innovated in relying on community NGOs for the accompaniment
and soft-skills training and on public-private partnerships (PPP) for the provision of
technical skills. The integrated approach of the Haiti AGI was translated into a project design
building on the engagement of all partners (community organizations, training centers, employers,
MCFDF, and the project team). The project team engaged community organizations and training
centers early on and regularly in the refining of the project design and its implementation, through
meetings and regular updates of the project proceedings. This approach helped the team develop a
strong trust relationship and buy-in from all partners that was critical to overcoming the challenges
encountered during implementation. The partners recognized the effort made by the World Bank to
work with local partners instead of contracting with an international NGO to implement the project,
as is typical for international organizations working in Haiti. In spite of the contracting and
procurement hurdles of working with local French-speaking organizations, the project team
persisted. This was based on a strong belief in the value of working with organizations with
established local experience. It aimed at continuing to work in Haiti and the program’s communities
even if international support is substantially reduced.

The integrated design adopted by the project reflects the objective of increasing the
employability potential of the AGI beneficiaries. Recognizing employability as a broader-based
objective (see section II) and reflecting the specificities of the context and of the needs of the target
group, the Haiti AGI was designed to support the beneficiaries in the personal, community, and
public spheres, with a premium put on proximity and accompaniment. The design was articulated
around the beneficiary, providing her with support in her quartier through the soft-skill training and
mentorship provided by the community NGO. It also gave support by providing quality technical
training oriented towards employability and close monitoring of attendance and performance.

The integrated approach received strong support from trainees, community NGOs, and
training centers partners as well as from employers. Feedback from the qualitative evaluation
credited the comprehensive design of the project for its participative approach, which is considered
                                                                                                      33
a best practice by the partners directly involved (NGOs, training centers, and internship-providing
employers). Building on a strong network of community organizations, the project provided a
support network close to the beneficiaries, offering them regular meeting, support, and a safe space
to meet. The selection of employer-recognized training partners (public and private) accredited by
the national institute for technical training (INFP) ensured name recognition of the training and
hiring potential. Overall, the close communication between the community NGOs, training centers,
and the project team provided the foundation for implementation of a comprehensive project
tackling intricate issues related to employment, agency, vulnerability, and gender in a fragile country.

The integrated design of the project contributed the results achieved and notably to the low
drop-out rate over the course of the project. While the impact evaluation does not capture this
dimension of the project, feedback from the qualitative evaluations corroborates that its integrated
approach and engagement of local partners had many positive spill-overs. If the very low drop-out
rate isn’t solely the reflection of this design, it captures the effort of all partners to assist the young
women in their training orientation and ensure that they could complete their training, addressing all
issues arising through the cycle thanks to communication between all partners based on solid
monitoring.

Complementing technical training with socio-emotional and soft-skills development can be
a cost-effective program component to enhance results
Building on the increasing evidence of the role of soft-skills in boosting employability, the
Haiti AGI placed a premium on this component of the training. There is a growing recognition
of the importance of socio-emotional/behavioral/non-cognitive/soft-skills in both educational and
labor market outcomes and overall endowments. Those skills are also crucial to developing and
exercising agency, i.e. the capacity to make choices and translate them into desired actions and
outcomes (WDR, 2012). However, this terminology mixes and matches a wide range of skills in a
way that makes interventions aimed at developing the skills hard to compare. In fact, the diversity
within and across disciplines poses problems both for measurement and investment (Borghans et al.,
2008). Still, existing literature indicates that in developing countries, upper-cognitive and social-
behavioral skills are equally or more valued than technical skills. This is in part due to the higher
need for adaptability in those contexts, especially in informal labor markets and vulnerable groups.

A context-appropriate curriculum was developed for the Haiti AGI.35 The Haiti AGI had to
develop a soft-skill curriculum in the absence of existing context and audience- adapted materials.
An assessment of available soft-skill materials and teaching experiences in Haiti demonstrated that
soft-skill material developed for other countries (notably in francophone Africa) was ill-suited to the
Haitian context and teaching experiences vastly differed in their relevance and quality. A unified
soft-skill curriculum developed by Haitian experts, combined with training of the community center
personnel to teach this component of the project, yielded positive results and feedback.

35In a 2011 study based on a survey of employers of engineers in India, socio-emotional skills were ranked at or above technical
qualifications and credentials in terms of their significance for the employability of recent graduates (Bloom and Saeki, 2011). See also
Arias et al. (2014) and Pierre et al. (2014).

                                                                                                                                     34
Soft-skills contributed to enhancing agency and the prospects of employability of the
graduates. Administered on week-ends in parallel with the technical training, the soft-skill training
was confirmed to be highly valued by the AGI graduates as well as by the training centers and
community organization partners. This training was notably credited for substantially contributing to
the gains in empowerment and agency captured by the impact evaluation. The qualitative evaluations
conducted in 2013 and late 2014 also confirmed the key role played by the soft-skills training in
preparing the young women to face the challenges ahead. Taking the example of unwanted sexual
advances during a job search or work, the young women indicated that the soft-skills gave them
confidence to push back those advances and to recognize an inappropriate situation and defuse it, or
remove themselves from it. While soft-skills alone are insufficient to overcome the gender-specific
challenges, they are an important part of the approach needed to tackle those demeaning behaviors.

The modalities of administration of the soft-skills training are also to be factored in this
impact. The importance of soft-skills has been gaining increasing recognition, extending beyond the
early childhood development (ECD) literature in which their importance has been long
acknowledged (Duckworth et al., 2007 and Heckman et al., 2012). Less attention has been given to
the modalities of administration of those skills. The diversity in these modalities constitutes another
difficulty to comparing different interventions that integrate such training. Even within a given
project, ensuring that the training is imparted with equal quality requires specific attention. In the
case of the Haiti AGI, the project could build on the experience of the community NGOs that all
had some experience administering this type of training. On the other hand, to ensure quality and
the teaching of the defined curriculum, a “training of trainers” was dispensed by a specialist, under
the supervision of the field project coordinator, and the courses were monitored. This close
monitoring and the feedback received through the qualitative evaluations confirmed the value of
student-centered teaching methods, regularity in the courses, and the availability of teacher-mentors
outside of the courses.

The Haiti AGI served as a platform to start a dialogue on soft-skills in technical training in
Haiti at large. As a partner of the Haiti AGI, the National Institute for Professional Training
(Institut National pour la Formation Professionnelle—INFP) had a direct role in implementing the project.
As part of this engagement, discussion of soft-skills was particularly dynamic. While the INFP faces
many challenges,36 notably in funding and the upgrading of its technical training staff and
curriculum, the importance of soft-skills to facilitate graduates’ transition into labor markets was
ranked high among the priorities. This recognition of soft-skills reflects growing concerns that
graduates of public technical training courses are not adequately prepared to face a complex labor
market; high rates of drop-out further burden these programs in Haiti. While no substitute for
quality technical skills, soft-skills are now recognized as a valuable complement, on par with
technical skills in promoting employability. Less expensive than technical skills training, soft-skills

training could well be a cost-effective intervention to decrease drop-out rates and increase
employability in public technical training.37

Aspirations and post-training trajectories
Impact on the beneficiaries’ aspiration was a key result of the Haiti AGI. As seen in Section
IV, beneficiaries’ aspirations about work and income have been strengthened. The young women are
more assertive and talk more to others about job opportunities. Concurring evidence is the increased
non-acceptance of violent behavior from personal partners. Furthermore, beneficiaries have
expanded their aspirations to study and get more training and skills, delaying their attempts to enter
the labor market.

Aspirations are activated through personal motivation and sustained by a matching with
expectations. Bandura (1977, 1997) proposes to look at two dimensions, “self-efficacy” and “locus
of control,” to explain how aspirations levels get determined. Self-efficacy refers to the beliefs a
person has about his or her capacity to achieve a given goal while locus of control refers to whether
or not (and how much) people believe they have control over the events in their lives. For aspiration
to translate into actions, individuals must perceive themselves as both capable and in control of their
lives. In a context such as Haiti, disbelief regarding one’s control can come from multiple sources,
compounded by the fact of living in a country with a strong socially segregated structure. In the case
of vulnerable young women such as the beneficiaries, this disbelief can be further reinforced by their
socio-economic background, out-of-school status, and gender. Additional dimensions determining
the translation of aspirations into actions are personal motivation and expectations that are shaped
by reality, both perceived and real (Figure 12).

While all trainees met the program criteria and displayed motivation for the project,
different aspiration profiles emerged during and after the training cycle. Identified during the
monitoring of the project and further explored through qualitative evaluation, the typology of the

37 In the short term, some soft-skills could be taught with traditional methods, building on the experience of the Haiti AGI. Soft-skills
such as team spirit, analytical thinking, and creativity could—to a certain extent—be taught using traditional methods. Modules for
teaching a subset of soft-skills could be developed and adapted to the needs of each sector, since some soft-skills requirements (such
as creativity) change as much with the sector as do technical skill requirements. The teaching of soft-skills remains an under-
investigated field, however, in particular in low-income settings, so significant investments in piloting, monitoring, and evaluating such
interventions should be made before envisaging large-scale expansions.

                                                                                                                                      36
AGI trainees’ aspirations and trajectory profiles presented two vastly distinct tracks that were
undiscernible in the initial selection and did not impact the project drop-out rate. As shown in
Figure 6, the first group (in orange) consisted of young women choosing technical training as a
choice that they “own,” that is to say, one they wish to embrace either through continued education
(1.1) or through labor-market transition (1.2) into their field of training. This group, and particularly
its second sub-component (1.2), constituted the audience typically assumed of a technical vocational
educational and training program such as the AGI. Yet, a second group (in green) with diverging
trajectories emerged, encompassing a sizeable number of the trainees. These women may have
professed their interest in a full-time technical training track but harbored the personal wish to
pursue a higher/classical education track and would make their decisions based on this.

For this second group, three main options could be identified:
    The first one (2.1) included graduates who were neither in school or working, the typical ‘ni-
        ni.’ This group may have been looking for a technical job, but has given up looking in the
        early stages of the process;
    The second profile (2.2) included AGI graduates who decided to return to a general training
        track, using the AGI training to exit their “out-of-school” status and try to complete their
        secondary education with the aspiration of continuing onto university.
    A last profile (2.3) was composed of AGI trainees in search of a technical job or currently
        holding a part-time technical job in order to be able to pursue a general education in parallel.
        This group comprised trainees who had done well in the technical training provided by the
        AGI project but elected to be employed sub-optimally to pursue their wish for a
        secondary/university track that may or may not yield professional options comparable to
        what they could get through their newly acquired technical skills.

The “aspiration for further education” was a less expected but overall positive outcome of
the project with implications for the targeting of employability-oriented projects. It reflects
the potential of “second chance” education programs and the need for an increased articulation
between general and technical education, combined with the revalorization of technical training.
Those “aspirations for further education” reflect the setting in motion of a positive dynamic, with
increased agency, skills, and empowerment opening new possibilities—particularly when combined
with realistic expectations. Those aspirations also reflect, in part, self-selection biases against
technical training. As in many countries, technical training is rarely a preferred track chosen by
Haitian students—whether male or female.38 As attested by the qualitative focus groups and
interviews, the weight of this premium on higher education (and particularly university) can lead
young people (both male and female) to forfeit alternative training and career options in the hope of
pursuing higher general education. Incidentally, another implication of this finding relates to helping
technical training programs better take into consideration those different aspiration-based
trajectories. Even when eligibility criteria are fulfilled and motivation for a technical track is stated,

38In part due to the high quality differences of the training provided by both public and private training programs, as well as by a high
social premium placed on higher education.

non-revealed aspirations can substantially factor in the final outcomes of programs and projects that
are directly aimed at transition into labor market.

Orientation, mentorship, and role models are important to translate those aspirations into
productive expectations. In designing a project aimed at increasing agency, the AGI recognized
the role of aspiration in influencing choices and enabling individuals to act upon them. At the same
time, striking the right balance between managing expectations in a constrained environment and
recognizing the role of high expectations in personal drive was a central concern of the project.
Whether high aspirations are needed—both psychologically and in socio-economic terms—to
transcend a bleak reality and achieve outcomes not possible through a “reasonable expectation” path
remains an important if unanswered context-specific question for further research.39 The Haiti AGI

39 In some scenarios in which individuals perceive that their social surroundings do not allow them to make use of their capabilities,
frustration and grievances can develop. Bandura (1977) argues that social unrest can occur when individuals consider themselves
highly capable (high self-efficacy) but perceive that they have little control over the social or political processes in their country, a
situation typically more prevalent in countries experiencing high levels of youth unemployment.

                                                                                                                                     38
used career orientation throughout the training process to help the trainees define their expectations.
This included the presentation of the different career/technical training tracks and their specificities,
opportunities, and offerings, with the support of former female trainees now employed in the
respective sectors. Discussions during soft-skills training also aimed at helping the trainees define the
next steps to implement their expectations.

Job search experience
The job search experience of the AGI graduates echoes that of depressed labor markets. As
expected, the AGI graduates faced numerous challenges in their job searches. While the training
prioritized sectors with higher hiring potential, the reality of Haiti’s labor markets remained a dire
one. One of the key challenges faced by the graduates was finding out about relevant job openings.40
Indeed, job openings are rarely advertised in Haiti, and when they are, it is not uncommon that the
opening has already been filled, the employers using job advertisements to promote the “dynamism”
of their firms.41 Real job opportunities continue to be publicized primarily through word-to-mouth
and social networks, placing new entrants at a disadvantage. Still, the AGI graduates canvassed all
possible sources of information regarding job openings (see Annex X.9 on end-line qualitative
evaluation). The qualitative evaluation confirmed the important role in labor market entry played by
internships, development of contacts, and continued acquisition of hands-on experience. However,
the internships lasted only two weeks to a month, reducing the opportunities for developing an
extensive professional network. This limited duration was due to the fact that internships are not
common practice in Haiti.42

Those challenges put a premium on persistence in job search—notably in the critical six-
month period following graduation. In the depressed labor market context of Haiti, looking for a
job (and persisting in it) can be a disheartening challenge for young women. To counter this reality
and strengthen job search persistence, the Haiti AGI set out to develop a new component to
maintain a “top-of-mind” connection between the graduates and the project for six months after the
end of the training. This SMS-based system (see Box 6) had the objective of encouraging the young
women of the second cohort to stick with their job search efforts by sending them agency-
enhancing messages. This small pilot will be evaluated in FY15. While its small scale may not yield a
full picture of the potency of such intervention, it sets a precedent for pursuing an under-researched
topic of youth employment programs.



40 The project team had designed a SMS-based job platform to inform the AGI trainees of job opportunities relevant to their technical
sector. It was to take advantage of the widely available cell-phone technology in Haiti, building on previous experiences (Souktel) but
expanding the design to loop back information and work with large employers as well as job search providers such as jobpaw and
job509. However, funding could not be secured to implement this component.
41 As the same time, consultations with employers repeatedly underlined the difficulty of finding qualified candidates for their labor

needs, which would suggest some mismatch between labor supply and demand. Beyond technical skills, employers identified soft-
skills as the main consideration in candidate selection, stating their difficulty in finding people displaying soft-skill traits such as work
ethics, initiative, perseverance, leadership, team work, and self-discipline.
42 In addition, it was not possible to secure remuneration for all internships. This raised the risk of the perception of that the AGI

project was supporting “free labor.” On the other hand, interns require supervision and on-the-job training, making it difficult to
require employers who accept interns to pay them as well.

                                                                                                                                         39
Box6: Using SMS-based encouragement to foster agency in labor market transition

The policy question addressed by the SMS job search motivation module was how to improve labor market
transition for recent technical training graduates. It looked at ways to foster increased agency in labor market
transition using SMS-based technology and the cell phones provided for the mobile money component of
the project.

Based on the experience of the first cohort and feedback received through the qualitative evaluation, a new
component to the Haiti AGI was developed. It targeted the phase immediately following the end of the
technical training to keep the beneficiaries motivated and mobilized in their job searches in a very difficult
labor market. Using a top-of-mind approach, the SMS job search motivation module was developed around
a four-step framework (establishment phase, planning phase, goal-setting phase, and reflection phase). For
each step, SMS messages were developed. Focus groups to discuss this module (timing of transmission,
regularity, etc.) and the types of messages most likely to resonate with the AGI beneficiaries were organized
in June 2015 in Port-au-Prince. The results of those focus groups helped the team compose over eight
messages in Creole (120 characters maximum). Between August and December 2014, 77 messages were sent
to the young women of the second cohort (nine to introduce the module; three per week over five months
plus four to announce each “phase,” plus four “reminder” messages). See Annex X.6 for the full list of
messages.

While this component was only piloted for the second cohort, it presented much potential to inform at a key
juncture in labor market transition. Evaluation of this component was supposed to occur in the third round
of the impact evaluation, which was postponed to an undetermined later date so as to capture longer-term
effects. As a result, the team used the second qualitative evaluation (December 2014-January 2015) to collect
feedback. It was largely positive with confirmation of the psychological dimension of “staying connected
with the project.”

Literature related to job search experience and strategies attests to the important role played by motivation
(Van Hooft et al., 2012; Van Hoye, 2013; and Van Hoye et al., 2014). In technical training programs such as
the AGI, the period immediately following the completion of training is when expectation and motivation
will likely be the strongest. Yet, as with Haiti AGI, it may not translate right away into securing a job, thus
requiring this motivation to be sustained over a sustained window of opportunity. To the team’s knowledge,
labor market literature contains no detailed examination of targeting motivation and job search behaviors
after technical training. Given the implications, including for the cost-effectiveness of ALMP programs if the
effect of such low-cost interventions is demonstrated, this is a research/evaluation gap that requires
attention. (See Annex X.11 on research gaps identified in the context of the Haiti AGI.) While the Haiti AGI
SMS module may not yet demonstrate effect, this experience contributed to discussing and framing the
issues as well as testing a possible approach.



AGI graduates also faced gender-specific challenges in their job search. Graduates were
repeatedly the targets of sexual advances during their job searches, with sexual favors held to be the
price of an application being considered or referred to the relevant person. This indicates a deep
problem not only for women seeking employment but for those who have managed to get a job.
While sexual advances were not encountered during the internships due to the oversight of the
training centers, AGI mentors, and coordinators, the young women ranked sexual harassment as the
                                                                                                              40
primary reason for demoralization in the job search. In focus groups, they indicated feeling degraded
and depressed by those propositions, the value of their skills and candidacies diminished by those
trying to exploit their situation of (small) power to gain sexual favors. In a country known for its
high incidence of sexual violence, advances during a job search are likely to act as an added deterrent
to employment, especially considering the limited recourses to report such behaviors and the direct
implication for physical safety.

Cost-effectiveness
Assessing cost-effectiveness of pilot programs is always difficult. Such programs tend to be small
and thus missing the potential economies of scale that would come from program expansion. Still,
such question matters in the prioritization of limited resources.

As a pilot project focused on marketable technical skills, the cost of the Haiti AGI is
comparable to other similar programs and projects. With a cost per beneficiary at US$1,444
(including technical and soft skills training as well as stipends), the Haiti AGI project is on par with
comparable AGI pilots and other technical training programs in LAC (See Table 3). Technical
training programs are known to be expensive – all the more so in fragile settings where public
providers are all the more constrained and quality private providers limited. In non-fragile countries
of the Latin America region, the Jovenes projects’ costs ranged from US$600-$2000 per participant
(Bandiera et al., 2014).43 With a focus on certified technical training, the Haiti AGI adopted a focus
comparable to the Jovenes projects –different from other AGI projects– but in a fragile setting.

Technical training accounts for the majority (65%) of the cost per beneficiary. Of the three
services delivered, technical, soft skills and stipends, the majority of the project costs went to the
provision of technical training (Figure 10 and 11). Of the USD 1,444 unit cost per beneficiary, about
USD 940 were allocated to technical training. This reflects the choice of working with certified
technical training, the availability and capacity of training providers in Haiti, and the goal of working
in non-traditional sectors for female employment.44

   In Haiti, following the 2010 earthquake, the facilities of the INFP were destroyed. At the beginning of the Haiti AGI, none of the
centers was operational, mandating the exclusive use of private providers for the first cohort. For the second cohort, the recent
completion of the reconstruction of the CPFPC center (INFP) allowed for the inclusion of this public provider to the training.

In the context of cost-effectiveness of technical training programs in fragile settings, three
elements are worthy to keep in mind.

First, the Haiti AGI was a project with an intensive treatment not envisioned to be scaled up
in its pilot design. It aimed at gaining a more in-depth and contextualized understanding of the
constraints and challenges faced by vulnerable youth, particularly young women, to access labor
markets and increase their agency. Given the depressed labor market context prevailing, scaling-up
the project in its pilot design would not be recommended. Still, lessons from this pilot can help
inform policies and programs aimed at building youth’s human capital in fragile countries.

Second, in relative terms, it seems cost-effective to consider investing in a soft skill
component to complement technical training programs. The different quantitative and
qualitative pieces of evidence available from the Haiti AGI pilot indicate that the soft skills
component has been instrumental for beneficiaries to enhance their agency, and with an improved
socio-emotional capital be better positioned to operate in labor markets of fragile settings. Cost-
wise, for every dollar spent in technical training, 30 cents are spent in soft skills development,
making this latter component worthy of consideration for these programs.

Third, while creating more and better jobs in Haiti is often said to be a prerequisite heavily
reliant on the country’s capacity to boost its growth inclusively, it can’t be a precondition to
investing in the human of youth and particularly vulnerable youths. As the Haiti AGI
demonstrated, the benefits of such projects extend beyond the economic realm. While ALMP
programs aimed at vulnerable youths may be less cost-effective than education policy and earlier
interventions in the education system, they can nonetheless serve an important remedial and human
capital enhancing role. In a fragile setting such as Haiti, such programs also serve a wider purpose of

groups, notably youth and women.

Conclusion
Reducing youth unemployment and increasing the agency of vulnerable youth are key policy
challenges worldwide – and all the more so in fragile countries. The specific challenges faced by
young women are increasingly being recognized as needing specific approaches and —in some
cases—specific interventions. Since 2008, an international program, the Adolescent Girl Initiative
(AGI) has piloted context-specific interventions in low income countries – half of fragile countries-
for a better understanding of the skills that could increase employability for vulnerable young
women. In that context, the Haiti AGI pilot contributed to the expansion of evidence-based
knowledge and lessons particularly relevant for Active Labor Market Programs and Policies (ALMP)
and poverty reduction strategies in fragile countries.

Using an augmented assets approach to articulate the results of the project’s impact and qualitative
evaluations, the present report showed that the beneficiaries of the Haiti AGI saw their agency and
socio-emotional assets enhanced. The high retention rate throughout the project implementation is
also testament to how much the beneficiaries valued the training. The AGI impact evaluation—the
first of its kind for AMLP or agency-building projects in Haiti—also found that beneficiaries were
changing the type of work they did. At the same time, the share of people participating in income-
generating activities did not increase in the short term, nor did their earnings. These results are
consistent with existing literature (Card, Kluve and Weber 2009).

Beyond the results seen for the direct beneficiaries, the Haiti AGI also fulfilled its mission of gaining
a more in-depth and contextualized understanding of the constraints and challenges faced by
vulnerable youth, particularly young women, to access labor markets and increase their agency.
Furthermore, the project piloted a number of comprehensive approaches to improve the safety of
the beneficiaries as well as innovative modules, notably use of ICT (i.e. mobile money, SMS-based
job-search motivation, and SMS-based job search survey), to improve employability outcomes, all of
which have high potential for replication.

Those lessons, challenges, and identified research gaps (Annex X.11) form a basis for the definition
of adequate active labor market policies/programs to reduce poverty and increase social inclusion in
Haiti. Based on the experience and results of this pilot project, the report highlights five areas for
consideration in employability-oriented policies, programs and projects for vulnerable groups in low-
income countries, particularly in fragile settings.

                                               INCREASED EMPLOYABILITY




The Haiti AGI was a project with an intensive treatment aimed at gaining a more in-depth and
contextualized understanding of the constraints and challenges faced by vulnerable youth to
participate in the labor market. Lessons from the pilot can help inform policies and programs aimed
at building youth’s human capital and agency in fragile countries. In light of this, several takeaways
are offered for future employability-oriented programs and active labor markets programs,
particularly in fragile countries:

   1. Having an integrated project design that builds on local community partnerships
      and public-private partnerships (PPP) matters for skill-building programs aimed at
      vulnerable groups. The Haiti AGI confirms the importance of comprehensive intervention
      programs when dealing with vulnerable groups to address the diversity of challenges they
      face, beyond gaps in technical skills. Moreover, given the gender equity focus of the project,
      a takeaway for program designers to consider is that to address gender-specific challenges –
      including gender-based violence- a network of design elements is advisable, such as limiting
      commuting time, having alert and monitoring systems, timing activities during daylight.
   2. Providing technical training in non-traditional trades is an option for consideration
      for women’s training programs. Providing training for women in male-dominated fields is
      not an easy decision for program designers. The takeaway to offer from the Haiti pilot is that
      participants in non-traditional tracks were as committed to follow-through, remain engaged,
      and complete the courses and internships as participants who did the traditional tracks in the
      pilot. While bottlenecks remain to make technical training viable in terms of direct
      translation into employment, gender does not appear to be one provided the right
      orientation, consideration to labor market needs and employers’ engagement.
   3. Complementing technical training with socio-emotional and soft-skills development
      can be a cost-effective program components to enhance results. Soft-skills are

                                                                                                               45
   increasingly recognized for the key role they play in job performance, and as a result are
   given high importance by recruiting employers. For a fraction of the cost of the technical
   component, evidence from the project implementation and qualitative evaluations attest to
   the potential returns of investing in socio-emotional and soft-skills development. More
   research is needed to further measure those returns.
4. Accounting for aspirations in program design can help channel this dimension
   towards better outcomes. Aspirations are an important lever for motivation and
   perseverance. Finding the balance between vulnerable youth aspiration, expectation, and
   reality directly influences outcomes in terms of program drop-out rates and post-training
   trajectories. While the Haiti AGI saw an increase in aspirations, the findings also indicate a
   need for further research on how to best integrate this dimension in future programs.
5. Improving how to provide information and prepare graduates to enter constrained
   labor markets particularly matters in fragile settings. Educating the trainees about the
   reality of labor markets both in terms of opportunities and challenges is necessary, but how
   to do it to maintain motivation and perseverance remains to be further refined. Improving
   information sharing and transparency so as to increase, and render more inclusive, the
   matching of labor supply and demand is an important area for further study.

Annex X.1: Summary of main components of the Haiti AGI

Community NGOs. The community NGOs selected for the project are located in five quartiers
(neighborhoods) of Port-au-Prince. The NGOs identified the young women during the preparation phase of
the project and were charged with their accompaniment during its implementation. They also administered
the soft-skills modules of the curriculum.

Soft-skill curriculum. Building on best practices worldwide, the Haiti AGI developed a high-quality soft-
skill curriculum composed of eight modules (self-esteem, civic engagement and leadership, reproductive
health, gender-based violence and its responses, preparing for the workplace and work ethics, disaster
preparedness, and financial literacy). Existing curriculum proved to be ill-adapted to the Haitian context,
being mere translation of curriculum developed for other countries, notably in Africa. The new curriculum
has been adapted and illustrated to the context of Haiti.

Non-traditional technical training. The young women received training in technical skills that are not
traditional for their gender: mechanics, refrigeration, electricity, construction, computer science, IT essentials
(PC hardware and software/Cisco networking academy). The training lasted six months, with the exception
of at INFOP, where it was four months). Instruction was carried out in three private and two public centers
of Port-au-Prince chosen based on consultations with employers to confirm the quality and relevance of the
training offered, and the orientation of those centers towards employability. Prior to training beginning, the
young women were presented with the different training offered and the corresponding career and

                                                                                                               51
employments options, so as to place them in a position of making an informed decision on which track to
elect and to match it to their academic levels and personal capacities.

Internship and employers: At the end of their training, the young women were offered internships to help
them transition into labor markets. The one-month internships were unpaid but the women received stipends
during this period.

Stipend and cell phones: The Haiti AGI provided grants and stipends to enable the young women to take
part in training courses and in unpaid internships. The stipends amounted to about US$40 per month and
were paid using mobile money. The stipends aimed to cover the cost of transportation to and from the
training centers and other related expenses of attendance. The delivery of the stipend via a mobile phone
payment system was selected in order to reduce the safety and financial risks in handing over cash to the
women and to help enforce the financial management lessons they would receive during training. The first
installments were paid in cash through the training center partners due to delays in the setting up of the
Tcho-Tcho System operated by Digicel.

Impact evaluation: The AGI project was designed as a randomized control trial, in which women eligible
for the program were randomly assigned to take part in one of two cohorts going through the technical and
soft-skills training. The treatment group included the young women who were offered slots in the first
cohort, while the control group included all the rest of the applicants not placed in the first cohort. The
second cohort was then selected from the control group. Cohort selection was conducted through a public
lottery supervised by the project field coordinator in each NGO. The number of cohort slots available for
each NGO varied from 75 to 150, depending on the management and accompaniment capacity of the
respective NGO. The two rounds of surveys included two questionnaires: one individual and one for the
household. The baseline survey was conducted in August-October 2012, before the training started. The
lottery to allocate the young women to the two cohorts was conducted after this, meaning that they did not
know about their cohort allocation at the time of the baseline survey. The follow-up survey (envisioned as a
mid-line) was conducted three month after the completion of the first round of training of the first cohort
(the treatment group) and before the start of the training of the second cohort (the control group). The
quantitative results of this report are thus based on a panel data set that comprises data from the baseline and
follow-up surveys as well as administrative and monitoring data from the program implementation.

Monitoring and evaluation: The M&E system was composed of an online platform where information
from training centers and community NGOs was centralized and validated by the M&E coordinator. During
the first cohort, a monthly training session with NGO and training center partners was conducted as part of
the activities on capacity strengthening on M&E. For the second cohort, the platform was substituted for a
more user-friendly Excel-based reporting system centralized by the AGI team to ensure timely reporting of
information from all partners. The system used for the second cohort was possible due to the investment
made in M&E capacity during the first cohort, which translate into a strong commitment from all partners to
abide by the agreed requirements of the project monitoring criteria.

Annex X.4 Reframing Employability for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

International definitions of employability provide a basis upon which to grasp the spectrum
of issues related to employability but they remain restrictive. The International Labor
Organization (ILO) defines employability skills as the skills, knowledge, and competencies that
enhance a worker’s ability to secure and retain a job, progress at work, cope with change, secure
another job if he/she so wishes or has been laid off, and enter more easily into the labor market at
different periods of the life cycle. While the ILO also recognizes the role played by broad-based
education and training, basic and portable high-level skills (including teamwork, problem solving,
and information and communications technology) and communication and language skills, the
definition remains narrowly focused on labor outcomes.45 Interestingly, while employability is stated
as the main objective of many development projects, particularly those focusing on training and
entrepreneurship, it is rarely defined. See Arias et al., 2014; Wang, 2012; Ajwad et al., 2014; and
employability projects in El Salvador (P117440) and the Republic of Congo (P128628). This lack of
definition signals an assumption that employability is a clear concept, strictly referring to one’s
capacity to procure a job. However, this restrictive definition also results in limiting the scope of
analysis of the variables and determinants factoring in socio-economic and labor outcomes.

A wide range of academic disciplines has offered valuable insights into employability. Since
the 1950s, the concept of employability has progressively gained ground. However, it is only since
the late 1990s that employability has been empirically studied. Several historical overviews shed
some light on the development of its conceptualization and definitions (Thijssen and Van der
Heijden, 2003) and an interesting shift in the perception of responsibility from government (notably
in the 1970s) to the individual. Clarke (2008) shows that the employability discourse now reflects the
increasing onus on individual employees to continually build up their repositories of knowledge and
skills in an era when career progression is less anchored around single organizations and specific job
types. In effect, individuals can no longer rely on their existing educational and labor market profiles
to define their longer-term career progression. This evolution highlights an increasing reality for
individuals in developed countries. But in fragile ones such as Haiti, it’s long been this way, because
people have always had to rely on their own capacity to be and remain employable in the absence of
institutions able to provide support. Extensive literature from other academic field offers valuable
contributions to better grasp the concept and its different dimensions beyond the restricted meaning
assumed by economists. Indeed, employability is studied from different angles and distinct levels
(individual, organizational, and industrial) across a wide range of academic disciplines, such as
business and management studies, human resource management, human resource development,
psychology, educational science, and career theory. However, only a few studies have tried to
integrate these different perspectives (Thijssen and Van der Heijden, 2003). One them, Van der
Heidje and Van der Heidjen (2006), takes a competence base approach to employability, defining it

45   HRD Recommendation 195, 2004; further reinforced in the Resolution on Youth Employment 2005.

                                                                                                     57
as “continuous fulfilling, acquiring or creating of work through optimal use of competencies.”46 This
integrated approach can be further expanded to include more “subjective” dimensions of
employability. Studies on job search behaviors (Van Hooft et al., 2012, Van Hoye, 2013, and Van
Hoye et al., 2014) or on employability of higher-education graduates (Tomlinson, 2012), underline
the more subjective and internal factors playing in individuals’ employability.

An expanded concept of employability is particularly valuable when dealing with vulnerable
groups and in a heavily constrained labor market context. Building on existing literature, the
Haiti AGI approached employability from a broader perspective inclusive of the traditional
definition that treats the labor outcome as a key objective but also expanding it to include more
subjective dimensions. While the expanded approach resonates with academic research and policy
dialogue in both developed and developing countries, it is particularly potent in a fragile setting such
as Haiti and when working with vulnerable groups facing additional challenges and bottlenecks. As
previously noted, in a complex environment, the responsibility and accountability in developing and
maintaining one’s lifetime employability rests solely on the individual. Thus any skill-building and
employability-enhancing project owes it to the participants to take into account this longer-term
perspective and to develop all dimensions enabling individuals to increase their employability.

The Haiti AGI uses an expanded version of the asset-based framework that links
endowment of assets, use (and intensity of use) of assets, and returns to assets, and
considers the role of subjective factors such as socio-emotional/soft skills. The assets-based
approach can prove useful to study employability, by offering a wider perspective on the drivers and
outcomes. Based on the asset-based framework, a person’s income generation capacity depends on
Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2014) and Lopez-Calva and Rodriguez-Castelan (2014):
            The endowments of assets;
            The use (and the intensity of use) of assets;
            The return of assets.
Assets are typically understood to include physical and financial assets (private such as tools and
bank deposits and public such as roads and welfare support); natural assets (such as land); human
capital (education and health); and social capital. In an augmented framework, one can include types
of skills that have been increasingly recognized to matter to individuals’ outcomes, namely socio -
emotional/soft skills (Duckworth et al., 2007; Heckman et al., 2012; and Cuevas and Favara, 2015).
Those skills include key traits and behaviors such as self-confidence, self-efficacy, autonomy of
decisions, perseverance, aspirations, and expectations. This socio-emotional capital47 is also a key

46 To that end, they develop an employability instrument that combines domain-specific expertise with more generic competences.
The instrument consists of four generic competences as important dimensions of employability, alongside occupational expertise: 1.
Anticipation and optimization: i.e. preparing for and adapting to future changes in personal and creative manner, and striving for the
best possible results; 2. Personal flexibility : i.e. the capacity to easily adapt to all kinds of changes in the internal and external labor
market that do not pertain to one’s immediate job domain; 3. Corporate sense: i.e. participation and performance in different g roups,
including organizations, teams, occupational communities, and other networks, which involve sharing responsibilities, knowledge,
experience, credits, failures, and goals; and 4. Balance : i.e. compromising between employers as well as one’s own work, career , and
private interests as an employee. See Van der Heidje and Van der Heidjen, 2006.
47 Socio-emotional aspects are also called psycho-social and soft-skills. The terms are used interchangeably in the report with a

preference given to soft-skills. See Annex X.4 on soft-skills.

                                                                                                                                         58
aspect of agency, i.e. the capacity to make choices and turn decisions into action, a crucial dimension
in the process of achieving development outcomes (Sen 1981, 1999).48 The capacity to use and
convert assets into well-being and desired outcomes differs among individuals and depends on initial
endowments and their interaction with the context (markets, institutions, social norms). This
interaction defines people’s ability to convert means (e.g. technical and socio-emotional skills) into
valuable opportunities (or capabilities, “being able to work”) and outcome (or functioning, “have a
job”).49

The assets-based conceptual framework has been supported by academic research and has also been
extensively used in other studies that have analyzed the determinants of progress of poverty
reduction and shared prosperity around the world (for these issues, see, for instance, Attanasio and
Székely, 1999 and Carter and Barrett, 2006). This model is particularly useful to present a
characterization of intra- and inter-generational economic mobility, chronic and transient poverty,
and between-group inequities (poor and non-poor, bottom 40 and top 60, minorities, etc.) that
potentially thwart certain vulnerable populations from fully participating in and benefiting from the
development process.

Making use of an augmented assets approach, the study proceeds to analyze whether a training
program that increases the endowments of human capital and socio-emotional assets of its
beneficiaries is able to improve their employability.




48 Beyond this socio-emotional capital, other authors have also proposed approaches to better account for the subjective dimensions of
employability, notably how it relates to not only the way individuals come to perceive and understand the labor market they are
entering, but also the types of dispositions, attitudes, and identities they develop around their future work and employability
(Tomlinson, 2007).
For instance, looking at higher-education graduates, Holmes (2001) develops an “identity approach” to employability , seeing
employability as relational, emergent, and influenced largely by one’s “lived experience” of the labor market. Individuals’ experiences
of work are subjective, and this is likely to influence their actual labor market outcomes and further shape their propensity for
employment. Employability in this sense may be seen to be value- and identity-driven, relating to graduates’ own pre-dispositions and
biographies.
49 The framework helps explain why individuals endowed with the same assets are not equally successful in the process of making

choices, converting those choices into actions and finally achieving the desired outcome of converting those assets into livelihood
(Sen, 1981 and 1999). In so doing, the proposed framework also enables the consideration of dimensions highlighted in the 2014
World Development Report (Mind, Society and Behavior) that recognized the role of social expectation in sharing individuals ’
preferences. These preferences are themselves dependent on the context in which they are elicited and on the social institutions that
have formed the interpretative frameworks through which individuals see the world (Basu, 2010; Fehr and Hoff, 2011; World Bank
2014a).

The fact that there are not many women in your area of expertise it does necessarily mean that one day there
won´t be many. Be the first one to initiate this change. Women´s empowerment can start with the change
carried out by one single woman.
Pa gen anpil fanm k ap travay nan domèn ou an se vre men sa pa vle di sa p ap chanje, Di tèt ou, ou ka

Sometimes accepting a job, even if it is not exactly what you were expecting, could contribute to improve
your professional career.
Gen travay ki ka pa nan gou w, men pran li kanmenm, ou pa janm konnen, se ka pòt k ap bay sou yon bèl
karyè travay.

If you have not made an internship yet, try to do your best when you make it. If you have made it already,
keep in touch with your colleagues as well as with the employer for future professional opportunities in that
company.
Si w poko fè estaj, le w al nan estaj, montre tout sa w ka fè. Si w fè estap deja, pa bliye rete an kontak ak kòlèg
ou oswa patwon an, ou pa janm konnen ka gen opòtinite travay pi devan.

If you have already found a job, show all the skills you acquired throughout the AGI program, not only the
professional ones, but also the life skills ones such as the organization and leadership skills!
Le w resi jwenn yon travay, pa bliye montre tout konpetans ou genyen, konpetans pou travay men sitou

Job search is like a piñata...if you hit it strongly, you will be rewarded.
Chèche travay se tankou yon balon, si w frape fò, w ap jwenn rekonpans lan.


Inform people about the training you received. Each person that is aware of your skills could help you to find
a job in the future.
Pale ak tout moun ou kwaze sou fòmasyon ou te pran an. Plis moun konnen konpetans ou, se plis ou gen
chans jwenn yon travay pi vit.

If your job search strategy does not work, take a step back and try to do something different.
Si plan w ap itilize kounye pou jwenn yon travay, p ap byen fonksyone, rete kè kal, pran yon pòz epi eseye
yon lòt fason pou jwenn travay.

The job search process is difficult. You are not alone. If you already found a job, give a hand to your AGI
colleagues and give advice to them.

Annex X.7. Press release of the Graduation of the First Cohort of the Haiti
AGI (June 2013)
Haiti: Jobs for adolescent girls are stepping stones to a new future

June 24, 2013




World Bank
HIGHLIGHTS


      421 young women graduated in masonry, electricity, and other non-traditional
        jobs.
      The innovative training promotes soft skills (personal habits, effective
        interactions, etc.).
      NGOs, training providers and employers are partnering to achieve these goals.




“I feel proud to be a graduate in a job I love," says Daniela. After completing a six-month heavy equipment
training program, she is one of the 421 young girls trained in non-traditional jobs to graduate in front of a
thousand people, on 11 June at the Historic “ Parc de la Canne a sucre”.

In colorful gowns, surrounded by their friends, families and teachers, the young girls are radiant and proud,
confident in the promise of a new beginning.

Serious, they listen carefully to the recommendations and encouragement from Mr. Alexandre Abrantes,
Special Envoy of the World Bank, Ms. Rose-Anne Auguste, Minister Delegate in Charge of Human Rights and
the Fight against Extreme Poverty representative from the Secretariat for Professional Training (Institut
National pour la Formation Professionnelle – INFP) .

An innovative training



                                                                                                                68
This group of girls is the first cohort to graduate from the Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI), a World Bank
program. The project will impact 1,000 young women. So far, only 10% of those who enrolled have dropped-
out.

In partnership with community-based NGOs, training centers (public and private) and employers, the Haiti AGI
provides technical training and soft skills development to vulnerable Haitian young women (17-21 years old)
who are largely under-represented in formal labor markets.

   I feel proud to be a graduate in a job I love.

Daniela
AGI initiative participant

The objective is to facilitate a school-to-work transition and improve their employment and earnings potential.
Girls are trained in masonry, electricity, heavy machinery, carpentry and hotels.

By also focusing on behavior change, training allows girls to increase their self-confidence and be more aware
of inter-personal skills.

“Before it was give me, give me. Now they say ‘help me look, how I can do better?’”— says a representative of
one the partner NGOs, to illustrate the change in aspirations and empowerment brought about by the project.
These will be critical to their transition to the labor market.

Women, engine of development

The education of women is essential to development of a country. Between 2000 and 2010, throughout Latin
America, working women have played a key role in reducing inequality in the region, being responsible for 28
percent of such reduction.

Minister Auguste emphasized the crucial role played by women in Haitian society throughout history, regretting
that they remain largely under-represented in the labor market.

She highlighted how each of the graduates has a mission to be role models to other young women in their
communities, and to contribute to Haiti’s development, as well as its economic, social, environmental and
cultural success.

Abrantes expressed his satisfaction to see the young women graduate in less than a year: " Through this
project, you are also breaking down gender stereotypes and showing the world that women can do anything
that men can do. You are brave women who are turning a lot of heads and converting many skeptics!"

Ensuring the relevance of the skills with existing and emerging needs of employers in Haiti has been a key
focus of the project. The idea is also to apply the lessons learned from this project to the larger broader job
creation agenda of the Gender and the Poverty Reduction Ministries.

The team will work with the National Institute for Vocational Training on the role of the development of life skills
to increase the effectiveness of technical training as well as developing mechanisms to increase the link
between demand (employers) and labor supply (trainees and providers of technical training).




                                                                                                                  69
Annex X.8: Mid-line Qualitative Evaluation (May 2013)

Motivation for qualitative evaluation

A mid-line qualitative evaluation was organized between implementation of the two cohorts in order to
complement and enhance the on-going impact evaluation and M&E efforts. Qualitative evaluations are
especially effective at capturing elements that are not easily quantified in an impact evaluation such as
emotions, feelings, aspirations, quotes and opinions. It can also go past the quantitative data and help answer
‘why’ and provide rich contextual information. This is especially true for agency-related information. It also
helps lay out cultural norms, constraints, and challenges such as gender norms, stereotypes, etc. Through this
evaluation, deeper contextual information was gathered on the effectiveness of program design,
implementation, short-term impacts, and the expectations, feedback, and realities facing all stakeholders. The
results of this evaluation can also provide major policy lessons for scaling up and cost effectiveness which will
be addressed later in this report.

Evaluation sample and methodology

The evaluation was implemented from May 20-25, 2013 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti in a series of focus groups
including different stakeholder groups involved in the project. This included staff from the training centers
and NGOs, AGI beneficiaries, mentors, and family (parents, spouses, and siblings). This qualitative
evaluation was led by Rebecca Schutte (ETC- GP Poverty) with the support from Sandra Jean-Gilles (AGI -
field coordinator). The focus groups were recorded in Creole and retranscripted into English by Elodie
Manuel (STC). The results were drafted in a background note and presented in internal seminars (July 2013;
February 2014).

The interview schedule and breakdown of focus group participation is outlined in the following table:

          Focus group participants          Date        Where              How many people attended?
   Staff from all training centers          May 20     Haiti Tec    8 staff = 8
   Staff from all NGOs                      May 21    World Bank    6 staff = 6
   Mentors from all NGOs                    May 21     JP/HRO       11 mentors = 11
   Beneficiaries @ Haiti Tec                May 22     Haiti Tec    8 participants = 8
   Beneficiaries @ APEX                     May 22       APEX       8 participants = 8
   Beneficiaries @ Transversal              May 23    Transversal   8 participants = 8
   Beneficiaries @ INFOP                    May 23      INFOP       29 participants = 29
   Parents & family in Delmas 32            May 24     JP/HRO       1 spouse, 2 brothers, 4 moms, 1 sister = 8
   Parents & family in Delmas 30            May 24    ANAPFEH       3 dads, 1 mom = 4
   Parents & family in Petion-ville         May 24      YWCA        4 moms, 7 beneficiaries = 11
   Parents & family in Carrefour-Feuilles   May 25    APROSIFA      3 moms, 2 beneficiaries, 1 dad = 6
              = 11 focus groups               =6      = 9 places          = 107 stakeholders interviewed
                                             days

A series of questionnaires were designed and tailored to each specific stakeholder group in order to get
comprehensive feedback on the project’s components, impacts (economic, social, and agency), the perceived
counterfactual, and other relevant information (see Annex for sample questionnaires). This evaluation report
also includes information from reports and emails from project implementation partners to provide further
evidence.


                                                                                                                 70
The focus group sessions lasted anywhere from 40 minutes (one session was cut short due to inclement
weather) up to 1 hour 40 minutes. The interviews were conducted in French or Haitian Creole as required by
the Field Coordinator of the Haiti AGI team and another team member was present for all interviews. The
focus group sessions were recorded (after getting verbal permission from all participants) to capture all
important information for later analysis as needed. Focus group participants were not compensated for their
participation in any way.

Bias

This qualitative evaluation was designed to be as unbiased, in depth, and as credible as possible. Therefore,
many different groups were interviewed at various places and times to include a range of perspective and
feedback from all stakeholder groups. Despite not being able to talk to everyone, many key messages came
out across these different groups. For the most part, the enumerator stuck to the questionnaires, only
modifying due to time issues or to go deeper into certain insights that were revealed. The Haiti AGI
implementing partners were responsible for providing the focus group participants. The participants were not
necessarily randomly selected for each group, but attended due to their availability and proximity to the
interview location. Having an enumerator that the beneficiaries and partners knew well could have introduced
some bias, but the respondents gave both positive and negative feedback and shared many challenges and
criticisms. They seemed comfortable being open and honest during interviews and some beneficiaries shared
some important information they were not comfortable sharing with training center and NGO staff.

  “There is demand for jobs these young women are being          Jobs opportunities and support to non-traditional technical
 trained for. Look at how many nurses are being trained in       training
    the country vs. electricians. It [electricity] is a better
                    investment to make.”
               -- Family member @ JP/HRO

 “Plumber, mechanic… honestly, they are all good jobs for        Jobs opportunities and support to non-traditional technical
women. Before, Haiti didn’t have these options. Before, you      training
could become a nurse, doctor, receptionist, or teacher– that
  was about it. Now you see women in foreign countries
working in big positions & that has influenced how people
 function. This is better because whenever you have more
            young people working, it is good.”

thoughts & opinions. Before it was ‘give me, give me.’ Now
   they say ‘help me look for a job, how can I do more?’”

           e. Companies hosting AGI interns to access external perceptions of motivation, agency,
                technical skill level, etc. along with performance and skill level (?)
   (2) Conduct interviews in Creole and French as required – Sandra
   (3) Ideally the interview would be a conversation where questions can be skipped, modified or
       expounded upon as appropriate given the group’s reactions and responses.
   (4) Estimated time = 1-2 hours

Structure of interview 

   (1) Welcome - intro - explain purpose of interview and encourage them to be honest and forthright
   (2) Focus on project composition/implementation:
          a. How many girls did you work with?
          b. What was your relationship with them? The training center? The NGO? The employer (for
              internships)?
          c. Where did you meet with your mentees and how frequently?
          d. What did you talk about?
          e. Did you receive any complaints from the participants that you worked with? This can
              include any aspect of the program from vocational training to skills training, stipends,
              internship, or problems with their assigned NGO or training center. If there were
              concerns/complaints, please share with us (names can remain anonymous).
          f. What vocational skills training did the young women you worked with get? Do you feel this
              was a good skill to offer given the current job market in Haiti? Is there another skill (offered
              in AGI training or not) that you feel would be more useful for them to learn?
          g. Do you feel the girls had an easy or hard time with the lessons?




                                                                                                            79
        h. Do you feel that the subject material covered in the life skills training was appropriate and
            well received? Was there a topic that was not covered that you think the young women
            should be exposed to?
        i. How do you feel the girls currently in internships are performing? Do you think they are
            prepared skills-wise? Are they facing limitations? If yes, what types of limitations/challenges?
(3) Focus on the future:
        a. You understand the realities facing these young women very well. Can you please enlighten
            us on their situation?
        b. Is there a sense that this is ‘just another aid program’ or that it is different and has the
            potential to have a big impact?
        c. How did the young women seem during the training? Were they motivated and enthusiastic
            or discouraged and despondent?
        d. What about empowerment? Do you feel the girls are now more empowered by this training
            and/or have more control over their lives? Why or why not?
        e. Do you think the program helped the participants create a strong professional and personal
            network that will help them in the future? If so, how?
        f. How employable do you think the young women are? Do you think they are well skilled and
            prepared?
        g. Knowing the Haitian context so well, what do you think their job prospects are? Annual
            salary, daily wages, sporadic hourly wages, etc?
(4) What is the counterfactual?
        a. What do you think the young women would be doing now if they had not participated in the
            project?
        b. Do you think their experience and training will change/impact their life in any way – positive
            or negative?
        c. What about external impressions of the participants – family, friends, community, etc? How
            do they view the women?
(5) Stories
        a. Do you have any stories or antidotes to share with us on particular successes (or failures) or
            particular students (whose names can remain anonymous).

Annex X. 9: End-line Qualitative Evaluation (Dec. 2014 –January 2015)

The main objective of the second qualitative evaluation was to allow a better understanding of the
context and job search experience of the Haiti AGI beneficiaries, about six months after the end of
the training.

Due to political unrest limiting the possibility to access some quartiers, the evaluation took place
over several weeks in December 2014 and January 2015. The evaluation was conducted by three
short-term consultants (Caillimée Methelus, Lynda Delva and Jane-Loye Saint-Phard), under the
supervision of Aude-Sophie Rodella. While two consultants animated the focus groups, a third was
charged with taking notes of the meetings.

The results of those focus groups were then written up in French by the consultants to capture the
responses and relevant quotes. Those materials have not yet been translated.

Focus groups of around 15-20 AGI beneficiaries were organized in four quartiers (Pétionville,
Carrefour-Feuille, Delmas 32 and Delmas 30) at the office of the partner community NGOs
(YWCA, APROSIFA, ANAPFEH and JP/HRO) working in those locations.

Each focus group lasted about 2-3 hours and was organized around ten blocks of questions.

 Aspirations for the future (personal and professional)

 Motivation in job search

 Working experience since the end of the program

 Usefulness of the soft-skills

 Strategies and instruments used in job search

 Confidence in perspective to find a job

 Difficulties encountered in job search

 Difficulties encountered in obtaining a job

 Social network activation in job search

 Feedback on experience as part of the Haiti AGI




                                                                                                 81
Examples of questions used to animate the focus groups, by category:

   1) Life and professional aspirations for the future:
      - What are your life aspirations for the future? And your professional aspirations? Who is the
          person who inspires you the most professionally?
      - (Aspiration v. reality.): When is it reasonable to give up the opportunity to continue the academic
          studies (high school and university) to move towards the technical training path or to accept a
          job? According to you, what are the criteria that a person should consider?
      - Is it better to accept a job with a decent salary but in an area where the person is less motivated
          or to stay attached to the professional dreams of oneself? What piece (s) of advice would you
          give to a friend if he/she asks you this question?

   2) Job search motivation
      - How can people stay motivated during the job search process in Haiti? How do you do it?
      -
   3) Work experience after the program
      - If you found a job after the AGI training, what has been your experience in general?
      - For how long have you been trying to find this job?
      - How long did the job last?
      - In your opinion, how much time per month a person has to work to be considered as an
          employee?

   4) Use of life skills learned
      - Do you think that the life skills learned during the AGI training have contributed/can contribute
         to find a job?
      - What was more useful for you?

   5) Strategies and tools for the job search process
      - How do you get a job in Haiti? How did you proceed from your side to look for a job?
      - How do you know the employment opportunities that are currently available? (i.e. What are the
          most reliable sources of information for the job search process in Haiti? For you?)
      - What are the tools that are available for you or that you would need to make the job search
          process more effective?
      - From your perspective, how much time is needed - on average - to find a job when a person
          starts looking?
      - How many interviews have you had since the end of your training?
      - Do you know any young women who already found a job? If so, do you know how did they
          proceed to find them?

   6) Confidence in finding a job: 1. In the target sector; 2. According to expectations
      - Are you familiar with the job opportunities that exist in the area where you want to work? Do
         they match your expectations?

   7) Challenges encountered in the job search process

                                                                                                        82
    -   What are the biggest obstacles that you encounter to find a job in your training sector / jobs that
        interest you / suit you well?
    -   What kind of support is needed to help young people to find a job in Haiti? And to help a young
        woman in your situation?

8) Challenges encountered to get a job
   - What are the biggest challenges that you encountered in order to get a job?
   - Do you know how to overcome them?

9) Active social, family and professional networks during the job search process
   - With whom have you talked or who have helped you / might help you during the job search
       process?
   - What are the networks that you used the most in this context?

10) Training – AGI Project –We would like to hear your comments!
    - How do you consider the AGI project has helped you to prepare yourself to enter into the labor
       market?
    - Do you think that there are aspects in the AGI project that could be improved in the future to
       facilitate the entry of young women into the labor market in Haiti?




                                                                                                        83
Annex X.10: Identified research gaps based on the Haiti AGI experience

As a pilot project, the Haiti AGI aimed at gaining a more in-depth and contextualized understanding
of the constraints and challenges faced by vulnerable youth, particularly young women, to access
labor markets and increase their agency. The project fulfilled it goals and in the process also
identified knowledge and research gaps. Six of those gaps are further discussed below.

First, with respect to soft-skills, a research gap exists on the modalities of administration of such
training. Indeed, while increased recognition has been given to the key role played by such skills and
their enhancing effect on cognitive skills, much less attention has been given on how to best impart
those skills, all the more so outside of the traditional field of early childhood education. More
research is needed on the modalities (duration, intensity, teaching methods, combination of skills
taught, settings etc.) to impart those skills to youth, and particularly vulnerable youth and women.
Such research will also help narrow down how soft-skill training can improve the cost-effectiveness
of job and skills oriented programs and project.

Second, research related to the expected timing and duration of the effects on dimensions of
agency is warranted. Knowing the phasing and timing of expected effects on key dimensions
matters to both program/ project teams as they do to evaluators. For instance, following the
intervention, when should effects first start to manifest themselves? Should results on decision
making be expected to precede those seen of self-esteem or self-confidence? How do these
dimensions of agency interact? Does the training have short, medium or long term impacts on
agency - and on which dimensions of agency?

Third, what is the optimal duration of technical training programs aimed at vulnerable youth?
Technical trainings greatly vary in their duration across programs and projects, rendering the
comparison of impacts all the more complicated. More research is needed to narrow down the best
duration based on program/project objectives, technical training taught and teaching methods, and
the profile of the beneficiaries (gender, age, educational background, aspirations etc.)

Fourth, with respect to technical training and transition into labor markets, research gaps exist
in relation to defining more clearly the window of opportunity for labor market transition post
technical training program (i.e. do the technical skills receive devalue beyond this window of
opportunity?). In the case of youth programs, there appears to be a tension in the literature between
short term and long term effects (Kluve, 2014). Determining if/ when such window exists and what
determines it would help tailor interventions beyond the training phase – and conceivably improve
employability outcomes.

Fifth, more research is needed to grasp the role of motivation in job search, and particularly in the
persistence of job search in labor constrained contexts. Even when programs are successful in
providing adequate skills and beneficiaries are well positioned to enter labor markets, the outcome

                                                                                                   84
rests first and foremost on the individual’s sustained efforts in his/her labor search. This is
particularly true in depressed labor markets – whether those faced by Haitian youth or by European
youth in countries with high unemployment. The Haiti AGI tried to tackle this question through the
SMS-based job search persistence component but opportunities exist to test interventions to foster
this motivation, particularly in the immediate phase following training – with direct implications for
program cost-effectiveness in employability is indeed increased.

Sixth, research on the role of academic and technical aspirations is warranted. Key to this
research is better understanding the tension between those two aspirations among beneficiaries and
potential beneficiaries of technical/vocational training programs. This question is important in
relation to understand how much does this factor in the outcomes (drop-out and job outcomes
notably) of technical/vocational training programs and can help better design and improve the cost-
effectiveness of those programs in reorienting individuals aspiring to revert to an academic track.

Annex X.11: Impact evaluation methodology and results
Methodology
Research design
The AGI project impact evaluation was designed as a randomized control trial in which women eligible for
the program were randomly assigned to start the program in the first cohort of beneficiaries. The treatment
group included the young women who were offered slots in the first cohort, while the control group included
all the rest of the applicants not placed in the first cohort. Cohort selection was conducted through a public
lottery supervised by the project field coordinator. The number of cohort slots available for each NGO varied
from 75 to 150, depending on the management and accompaniment capacity of the respective NGO.

The data used for the quantitative evaluation of the AGI was collected in baseline and follow-up surveys. The
two rounds of surveys included two questionnaires: one individual and one for the household. The individual
questionnaire was answered by young women in treatment and control and collected information about
educational background, use of time, participation in income generating activities (IGAs) and training, agency
and psycho-social outcomes, family background and social networks, as well as about personal and sexual
behavior. The household questionnaire was answered by the head of the young women’s household and
included information on the head’s main characteristics (such as age, gender, and marital status), education
and labor status of all household members, the household head’s opinion about marriage and gender
responsibilities, the household’s assets, expenditures, and transfers, and the characteristics of the dwelling.
The baseline survey was conducted in August-October 2012, before the training started. The lottery to
allocate the young women to the two cohorts was conducted later on, meaning that the young women did not
know their cohort allocation at the time of the baseline survey. The follow-up survey was conducted three
months after the completion of the training of the first cohort (the treatment group) and before the start of
the training of the second cohort. The quantitative results of this report were thus based on a panel data set
that comprised data from the baseline and follow-up surveys as well as administrative and monitoring data
from the program implementation team.

The quantitative evaluation was complemented and enhanced by two rounds of qualitative data collected after
each round of training. Qualitative evaluations were especially effective at capturing emotions, feelings,
aspirations, quotes, and opinions that were not easily quantified in an impact evaluation. Through this
evaluation, deeper contextual information was gathered on the effectiveness of program design,
implementation, short-term impacts, and the expectations, feedback, and realities facing all stakeholders.50
Figure A2 presents the timeline of the impact evaluation.

Sample and attrition
After the recruitment campaign carried out by each NGO, 1,479 young women passed the literacy, numeracy
and analytical ability test51 and were immediately eligible to receive the AGI training. Only considering the
young women that answered the baseline survey, 471 slots were placed for the first round of training52, which
left 1008 young women as part of the control group. Out of the 1008 young women in the control group, 500
were randomly selected, again by a public lottery, to take part of the second round of training.

Unfortunately not all young women that answered the baseline survey also answered the follow-up survey.
Table A1 shows that the overall attrition rate was 20%. If the attrition is not at random, the estimated impact
of the program might be biased. Table At. 1 shows that the total sample does not differ with the sample with
attrition in most characteristics. The only variable that presents significant differences is the years of
education, but the difference is only 0.1 years and is significant only at the 10% level. This gives confidence in
the estimations of the effects of the AGI, which consider only the sample that answered the baseline and the
follow-up survey (1174 observations).

52 The initial lottery assigned 500 slots to the first cohort. However, between the lottery and the beginning of training certain became
unavailable to start the program. Given the oversubscription to the program, these slots were filled by other candidates, but these new
young women were not considered in the IE analysis due to the fact that they did not take part in the lottery.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            87

The team placed priority in minimizing attrition and to that end implemented several strategies in the field.
The first strategy to reduce attrition was to use the answer of the follow-up survey as a condition to
participation in the lottery to select the second cohort of training. A second strategy was to contact, through
the NGOs, all the young women that had not answered the follow-up survey. We team resorted to a menu of
sources of contact information, including phone number and household address/directions at the M&E
records and administrative data in order to reach the young women, information from baseline, information
from friends and relatives. The NGOs played an important role not only by contacting the young women
personally but also by gathering groups of young women and informing them about the possibility of their
participation in the second cohort of the AGI training. Additionally, the NGOs informed the community and
persuaded friends of the young women missing to tell them about the importance of their participation in the
follow-up survey. The search and re-contact efforts extended over two months, and yielded as a result a
significant reduction of attrition from the baseline sample.53

Identification
Due to the randomized nature of the selection into treatment, the identification strategy of this impact
evaluation follows a difference-in-differences approach. The results presented refer mainly to the intention-
to-treat (ITT) effect, which considers the treatment group as all young women assigned to take part of the
first round of the AGI training independently of whether or not they actually participated in or completed the
training program. The average treatment on the treated (ATT) effect, which includes in the treatment group
only those who completed the training program, is shown only for the main outcomes, but the resulting
estimates are similar to those of the ITT effects54.

Equation (1) specifies the OLS regression model used in this report:

                                                                                                                                  (1)

Where       is the outcome of interest for individual at time ; is a dummy variable that identifies treated
individuals with 1 and control individuals with 0;        is a time dummy that identifies with one information
collected in baseline and with 0 that collected in the follow-up survey; and      is a set of control variables that
includes individual characteristics, such as age, level of education, marital status, number of living children,
and household characteristics, such as the household size and the number of female members. The
coefficient of interest is , which defines the impact of the AGI program on the treated. The model also
includes variables that identify the NGO and corresponding neighborhood of each young woman. The
results of this specification are presented with and without control variables.




53
   One of the main issues when trying to contact the young women at the moment of the follow-up survey was that most of them
would change their phone numbers very often because every time they needed to use their phone, instead of buying credit and keep
their phone numbers, they would buy a new SIM card, and therefore change their phone number. This happened because buying a
new SIM card was cheaper than buying credit. Another issue was that this population is very mobile and would change their address
but not inform the NGOs or the training centers.
54 This implies that not including in the analysis the 40 young women who did not complete the training does not bias the results. The

ATT estimate results are available upon request.

                                                                                                                                  88
Another specification of the model included individual fixed-effects, which control for an individual’s
unobserved and time-invariant characteristics that may influence the outcome variable. Additional to the OLS
model, the results for the effect of the AGI program on binary outcome variables were run using probit
models as well, and the results are very similar to those found with OLS models. Similarly, additional
specifications (not shown here but available under request) were used for categorical variables, for which a
probit was used (ordered probit in the case of ordered categorical variables), as well as for left-censored
continuous variables, for which a tobit model was used. In all cases the results hold.

Baseline characteristics and balance between treatment and control groups at baseline
The main methodological advantage of random assignment to treatment and control is to create groups that
are comparable, for the control group to be a credible counterfactual of what would have happened to the
treatment group had they not participated in the program. This section compares both groups in observable
characteristics of interest.

Table Y1 presents the characteristics of the AGI participants at baseline, as well as the balance in these
characteristics between treatment and control groups. In terms of demographics, Panel 1 of Table Y1 shows
that the average age of the population under study is 20 years, in both treatment and control groups. Only
around 1% of the sample were married at baseline and almost 90% were single and never married, with no
statistical differences between treatment and control in these characteristics.

Consistent with the AGI program’s target group, all individuals had basic knowledge of math and could read
and write in French and Creole. All young women were meant to have a certificate of primary education or
higher in order to participate in the program, a condition which was indeed fulfilled for more than 90% of the
sample. According to Panel 2 of Table Y1, around 6% of the control group and 8% of the treatment group
had no education at all or had not received the certificate of primary education. This difference between
treatment and control groups was statistically significant at the 10% level. The majority of young women had
a higher degree of education: for the control and treatment groups, 12% and 15% respectively have a
primary education certificate; 47% and 50% have a Brevet55 certificate; and 30% and 23% have a certificate of
Brevet Superior, Baccalaureate I or II (with differences statistically significant at the 1% level for this last
category).56 Overall, the average years of education was 10 for both treatment and control groups and the
share of time spent in school or training at the moment of the baseline survey was 7% for the control group
and 4% for the treatment group (where the difference is statistically significant at the 1% level in the last
case).

With respect to participation in vocational training, Panel 2 of Table Y1 shows that between 21% and 24% of
the sample had taken part in at least one training course during the five years previous to the baseline survey,
or about 250 women. There were not statistically significant differences between treatment and control
groups with respect to participation, attendance, completion, graduation, perception, and payment concerning
the vocational training. In general, young women who had previously participated in a vocational training
reported that they attended “almost always,” whereas around 50% completed the training and received a

55 Following the French system of education, the primary education certificate in Haiti is awarded after completion of the first six
years of education, which consist of two years of Préparatoire, two years of Elémentaire and two years of “Moyen” classes. The Brevet
(equivalent to Junior High) certificate is conferred after completing the following four years of education (Sixième, Cinquième, Quatrième,
and Troisième); and the Brevet Superior, Baccalaureate I and II (equivalent to high school) certificates after completing the following
three years of education (Seconde, Première and Terminale).
56 Given the statistical difference between treatment and control groups with respect to the share of women in each group of

education, the regressions presented in the section of results include dummies for each group of education at baseline as part of the
control variables.

                                                                                                                                       89
certificate. More than 50% of the young women paid for the training and their average perception was that
the training was “helpful.”

Panel 3 of Table Y1 presents evidence that the share of women engaged in an income-generating activity
(IGA) for the treatment group was significantly higher than in the control group. This share was 8.8% for the
control group and 16.7% for the treatment group, with a difference of 7.9 percentage points, statistically
significant at the 1% level. Out of those engaged in an IGA, around 70% worked as self-employed, 3% for an
NGO, 4% for a private employer, close to 1% for the government and 9% for others, with no significant
differences between treatment and control groups. The only occupation for which there was a statistically
significant difference is the share of women working in family business, 5% in the control group and 13% in
the treatment group. In terms of labor income, women in both treatment and control groups received around
HTG$1,700 monthly and HTG$60 hourly (equivalent to approximately US$43 and US$1.50 respectively).
Only about 5% of the sample owned a business. The percentage of women that saved money in the two
weeks previous to the baseline survey was about 8 percentage points higher for the treatment group,57 with a
baseline level of 26%.

The ownership of assets seemed to be balanced between treatment and control groups, with the exception of
livestock, bicycles, and motorbikes, which were owned by less than 10% of the sample. The differences
between treatment and control for these assets were 3 percentage points for livestock, 2 for bicycles and 2.5
for motorbikes. As shown in Panel 4 of Table Y1, more than 80% of the young women in the program
owned cellphones. The average quantity of assets in the household was close to five for both treatment and
control groups.

Panel 5 of Table Y1 shows the baseline characteristics and the balance between treatment and control for the
variables related to agency and women empowerment. In general, there was balance between treatment and
control groups for these variables, with the exception of the total scores for self-esteem and mental health.58
Although treatment and control groups both scored an average close to 10 out of 20 points of the total self-
esteem score, the treatment group reported a statistically higher self-esteem score than the control group in
baseline, with a difference in the standardized PCA index59 of 0.14 standard deviation points. In contrast, the
treatment group appeared to have a lower mental health score than the control group, with a difference of
0.17 standard deviation points. The total score values of the decision-making, mobility, self-regulation, self-
esteem, and self-confidence are pretty close to the mid-point between the lowest and the highest possible
values. But the average total scores of satisfaction and especially mental health are above the mid-point,
which suggest general low levels of satisfaction and mental health in the population under study.

Around 98% of the individuals under study lived with the household head and her/his spouse and in 70% of
the cases the household head was a female, with no significant differences between treatment and control, as
shown in Panel 6 of Table Y1. Household heads were on average 45 years old for both groups and more than


57 Given the statistical difference between treatment and control groups with respect to the share of women engaged in an income
generating activity and saving money, the regressions presented in the section of results include a dummy for each group at baseline
levels as part of the control variables.
58 The sum of points of the self-esteem variable is the total score of all the self- esteem statements combined, where the points given

to each statement positively related to self-esteem were 1 for "Strongly agree," 2 for "Agree," 3 for "Disagree," and 4 for "Strongly
disagree." This means that the higher the total score, the lower self-regulation the young woman has. This is also the case for self-
regulation, self-confidence, satisfaction, and mental health. The maximum value of each score depends on the number of statements
of each topic. Self-regulation has 16 statements, self-esteem has 5, self-confidence 8, satisfaction 9 and mental health 9.
59 PCA stands for principal component analysis, the method to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in a

standardized index.

                                                                                                                                   90
60% of them were literate in French, Creole, and math. Around 37% of the household heads had a level of
education lower than primary, 18% had primary complete but incomplete secondary, and 37% reported
having a certificate of secondary education or higher, again with no significant differences between treatment
and control. There was a slight, but statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups in
terms of household size of 0.4 (with averages of 5.3 and 4.9 respectively) and the number of female members
of 0.2 (with averages of 3.6 and 3.4 respectively). The former difference comes particularly from imbalance in
the number of household members between 0 and 5 years of age as well as the number of household
members 51 years old and older—in both cases the control group presents lower averages.60 On the other
hand, the percentages of participants who had living children (13%), were pregnant (2%), or expected to
become pregnant in the short-term (3%) were low and balanced between treatment and control groups.

Panel 7 of Table Y1 presents the balance between treatment and control groups for variables of the young
women’s behavior. Behavior related to condom use, with about 50% of the respondents reporting to always
engage in it, was balanced between treatment and control groups. The same happened for cigarettes, drugs,
and alcohol consumption, which was indeed pretty low (less than 5%) among respondents. Not necessarily
related to behavior, the share of women that had been involved in a sexual activity against their will was
almost 10% for the control group and 14% for the treatment group, a difference that was statistically
significant at the 5% level. Both for treatment and control groups, less than 7% of the participants were
involved in an unwilling sexual activity during the year previous to the baseline survey.

The percentage of households that had to move because of the earthquake of 2010 was higher for the
treatment group (54%) than for the control group (47%), as shown in Panel 8 of Table Y1. The majority of
households lived in low houses with a statistically significant difference of 10 percentage points between
treatment (52%) and control (62%). The second-most common type of house was ajoupas, with between 16%
and 20% of the households living in this type of house and no significant differences between treatment and
control groups. About 40% of the households in both groups owned their houses. The most common source
of drinking water was “bottled mineral water” (37%), followed by “private connection to pipeline” (16%),
and public tap (15%), with no significant differences in the percentage of households obtaining water from
these sources between treatment and control groups. Finally, due to the urban setting of the households, the
most common system of human waste disposal was “own improved pit latrine” (around 40%), followed by
“own flush toilet” (28%) and “public flush toilet” (about 10%). There were no statistically significant
differences in these numbers between treatment and control groups.

Overall, treatment and control groups are relatively balanced, with a few expected differences given more
than a 100 variables are being compared. Among the differences, the most important is related to engagement
in income generation. A follow-up matching exercise is planned to achieve balance in this dimension and re-
run results for comparison.

The sum of points of the Self-Regulation variable is the total score of all the self-regulation statements combined. where the points given
to each statement positively related to self-regulation were 1 for "Strongly Agree", 2 for "Agree", 3 for "Disagree" and 4 for "Strongly
disagree". This means that the higher the total score is, the lower self-regulation the young woman has. This is also the case for self-esteem,
self-confidence, satisfaction and mental health. The maximum value of each score depends on the number of statements of each topic.
Self-regulation has 16 statements, self-esteem has 5, self-confidence 8, satisfaction 9 and mental health 9.
PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis, which is the method to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in an
standardized index

p<0.01. The sum of points of the "Violence towards partner" variable is the total score of all the "Violence towards partner" statements
combined, where the points given to each statement is positively related to "Violence towards partner" and the original values of the
variable were recoded to 1 for "Never", 2 for "Sometimes", 3 for "Usually" and 4 for "Always". This means that the higher the total score
is, the higher the young woman reacts violently towards her partner under several circumstances. The maximum value of the "Violence
towards partner" score is 28, which corresponds to 7 statements of maximum 4 points each.
PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis, which is the method to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in an
standardized index.

1 The sum of points of the self-regulation variable is the total score of all the self-regulation statements combined, where the points given to each

statement positively related to self-regulation were 1 for "Strongly Agree," 2 for "Agree," 3 for "Disagree," and 4 for "Strongly disagree." This
means that the higher the total score, the lower self-regulation the young woman has. This is also the case for self-esteem, self-confidence,
satisfaction, and mental health. The maximum value of each score depends on the number of statements of each topic. Self-regulation has 16
statements, self-esteem has 5, self-confidence 8, satisfaction 9, and mental health 9.
2 PCA stands for principal component analysis, the method to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in a standardized index.

Notes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. Level of Significance: * p<0.1; ** p<0.05; *** p<0.01. The sum of points of the "Violence
towards partner" variable is the total score of all the "Violence towards partner" statements combined, where the points given to each
statement is positively related to "Violence towards partner" and the original values of the variable were recoded to 1 for "Never," 2 for
"Sometimes," 3 for "Usually," and 4 for "Always." This means that the higher the total score, the more likely that the young woman reacts
violently towards her partner under several circumstances. The maximum value of the "Violence towards partner" score is 28, which
corresponds to 7 statements of maximum 4 points each.

PCA stands for principal component analysis, the method to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in a standardized
index.

1 This score corresponds to the following values: 1 for "Never," 2 for "Once or twice in the past month," 3 for "About once a week," 4 for "Several
times a week," and 5 for "Every day."
2   This score corresponds to the following values: 1 for "Much better," 2 for "Better," 3 for "Same," 4 for "Worse," and 5 for "Much worse."
3The expectation sum score corresponds to the sum of the scores of the four variables above, each one with a score 1 to 5. This means that the
higher the score, the lower the overall expectations of the respondent.
4   PCA stands for principal component analysis, the method to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in a standardized index.

The sum of points of the self-regulation variable is the total score of all the self-regulation statements combined, where the points given to each
statement are negatively related to self-regulation: 1 for "Strongly Agree," 2 for "Agree," 3 for "Disagree," and 4 for "Strongly disagree." This means
that the higher the total score, the lower self-regulation the respondent has.
PCA stands for principal component analysis, the method used to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in a standardized index.

statement are negatively related to self-confidence: 1 for "Strongly Agree," 2 for "Agree," 3 for "Disagree," and 4 for "Strongly disagree."
This means that the higher the total score, the lower self-confidence the respondent has.

PCA stands for principal component analysis, the method used to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in a standardized index.

For all tables: Standard deviation is in brackets. Robust standard error is in parentheses. Level of Significance: * p<0.1; ** p<0.05; *** p<0.01.
Notes: The variables used as controls in the regressions are engagement in income-generating activities, dummies for groups of age and education of
respondents, household size and the number of female members in the household, school assistance, an indicator of whether the individual has
children and marital status of the respondent. All controls are from baseline data.

The sum of points of the satisfaction variable is the total score of all the satisfaction statements combined, where the points given to each statement
are negatively related to satisfaction: 1 for "Strongly Agree," 2 for "Agree," 3 for "Disagree," and 4 for "Strongly disagree." This means that the
higher the total score, the lower satisfaction the respondent has.

For all tables: Standard deviation is in brackets. Robust standard error is in parentheses. Level of Significance: * p<0.1; ** p<0.05; *** p<0.01.
Notes: The variables used as controls in the regressions are engagement in income-generating activities, dummies for groups of age and
education of respondents, household size and the number of female members in the household, school assistance, an indicator of whether the
individual has children and marital status of the respondent. All controls are from baseline data.

The sum of points of the mental health variable is the total score of all the satisfaction statements combined, where the points given to each
statement are negatively related to mental health: 1 for "Not at all," 2 for "1-5 days," 3 for "6-9 days," and 4 for "Almost every day." This
means that the higher the total score, the lower mental health the respondent has.

PCA stands for principal component analysis, the method used to consider the score of all statements and formulate them in a standardized
index.
