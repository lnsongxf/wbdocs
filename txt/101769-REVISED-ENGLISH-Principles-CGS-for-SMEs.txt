     Foreword

     Access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has moved up the global reform
     agenda and has become a topic of great interest for policy makers, regulators, researchers, market
     practitioners, and other stakeholders. For the World Bank Group, facilitating access to finance for
     SMEs is a high priority, given its potential to help achieve the twin goals of eliminating extreme
     poverty and promoting shared prosperity. It is widely recognized that access to finance for SMEs is
     associated with innovation, job creation, and economic growth.

     The recent global financial crisis has dented confidence that market solutions can be counted on as
     the primary source of access to finance for SMEs. That change has triggered renewed examination
     of public initiatives designed to protect or relaunch the flow of credit. A review conducted by the
     World Bank Group for the Group of Twenty in 20101 clearly indicated that credit guarantee schemes
     (CGSs) have gained prominence as a common form of government intervention in SME credit
     markets, especially (though not exclusively) in emerging markets and developing economies.

     CGSs can contribute to the expansion of SME finance. They may also generate positive
     externalities by encouraging banks and nonbank financial institutions to get into the SME
     market, thus improving the institutions’ lending technologies and risk management systems.
     However, CGSs may add limited value and may prove costly when they are not designed and
     implemented well. There have been efforts in recent years to identify good practices for CGSs,
     but the international community still lacks a common set of principles or standards that can help
     governments establish, operate, and evaluate CGSs for SMEs.

     Recognizing this knowledge gap, in January 2015 the World Bank Group and the FIRST (Financial
     Sector Reform and Strengthening) Initiative, in coordination with the SME Finance Forum,
     convened a global task force to identify and draft principles for the design, implementation,
     and evaluation of public CGSs to improve access to finance for SMEs. The task force included
     delegates from the Arab Monetary Fund, the Asian Credit Supplementation Institution
     Confederation, the Association of African Development Finance Institutions, the European
     Association of Mutual Guarantee Societies, the Ibero-American Guarantee Network, and the
     Institute of International Finance.

2 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
The task force developed the CGS principles through consensus and extensive consultations that
built on both the literature of good practices for CGSs (including results from global and regional
surveys conducted by the World Bank Group) and sound practices successfully implemented in
a number of CGSs around the world. The task force’s efforts also benefited from a broad public
consultation during July and August 2015 with several stakeholders—including CGSs; central
banks; and international organizations, such as the African Development Bank, the European
Investment Bank Group, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The task force principles represent an important component of a large number of initiatives aimed
at enhancing the stability and inclusiveness of the global financial system. We hope the principles
will prove useful to a wide range of stakeholders whose main focus is to provide and facilitate
access to finance for SMEs, including governments and CGSs, along with international financial
institutions, nongovernmental organizations, think tanks, academics, private sector participants,
donors, and members of the wider development community.

                                                               Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs | 5
     PART 1: Principles for the Design,
     Implementation and Evaluation of Public
     Credit Guarantee Schemes for Small and
     Medium Enterprises

     I. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PRINCIPLES
     Financial inclusion, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), is widely recognized
     as a key driver of economic growth and job creation in all economies. SME credit markets are
     notoriously characterized by market failures and imperfections, including information asymmetries,
     inadequacy or lack of recognized collateral, high transaction costs for small-scale lending, and
     perceptions of high risk, all of which lead to suboptimal allocation of credit. For example, in
     emerging markets, between 55 percent and 68 percent of formal SMEs are either unserved or
     underserved by financial institutions, with a total credit gap estimated in the range of US$0.9
     trillion to US$1.1 trillion.3 To address such market failures and imperfections, many governments
     intervene in SME credit markets in various ways.

     A common form of government intervention is credit guarantee schemes (CGSs). A CGS provides
     third-party credit risk mitigation to lenders with the objective of increasing access to credit for
     SMEs. This risk mitigation happens through the absorption of a portion of the lender’s losses on
     the loans made to SMEs in case of default, typically in return for a fee. The popularity of CGSs
     is partly due to the fact that they commonly combine a subsidy element with market-based
     arrangements for credit allocation, thereby leaving less room for distortions in credit markets than
     through more direct forms of intervention, such as state-owned banks.

     CGSs can play an even more important role, especially in countries with weak institutional
     environments, by (a) improving the information available on SME borrowers in coordination with
     credit registries and (b) building the credit origination and risk management capacity of lenders
     (for example, through technical assistance for the setup of SME units). Moreover, CGSs can be
     leveraged to provide countercyclical financing to SMEs during a downward economic cycle when
     risk aversion may be heightened and a credit crunch is likely to follow.

     More than half of all countries in the world have a CGS in place, and that number is growing.
     Governments have shown renewed interest in CGSs as a result of the global financial crisis, as well
     as a result of the international community’s increasing emphasis on SMEs as engines for growth
     and employment. A CGS can be a critical policy instrument for easing financing constraints for
     SMEs, thus contributing to sustainable economic development and job creation.

6 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
For that purpose, it is essential that CGSs be properly designed and operated to achieve both
outreach and additionality in a way that is financially sustainable. “Outreach” refers to the scale of
the CGS, as measured by the number of guarantees issued to eligible SMEs and by the amount of
outstanding guarantees. In principle, the greater the outreach, the stronger the effect of the CGS
on the SME segment. However, the effect of the CGS on the supply of credit to the SME segment
also depends on whether guarantees are solely (or mainly) extended to SMEs that are credit
constrained—either by access or by unfavorable conditions, such as cost and maturity (financial
additionality). Ultimately, an improvement in the overall economy occurs as a result of increased
access and availability of capital for SMEs (economic additionality). Finally, reaching SMEs that are
credit constrained involves risk taking and financial losses. Public CGSs are neither designed nor
expected to make a profit. However, they should still be financially sustainable in the long term;
that is, CGSs should be able to contain losses and ensure an adequate equity base relative to its
expected liabilities, as well as through sufficient funding, effective risk management, and sound
operational rules.

Against this background, the World Bank Group and the FIRST Initiative convened and provided
secretariat support to a task force, which represented international associations of both CGSs and
lenders, to develop a set of principles for the design, implementation, and evaluation of public
CGSs for SMEs.

Objective
The objective of the principles is to provide a generally accepted set of good practices, which can
serve as a global reference for the design, execution, and evaluation of public CGSs. The principles
propose appropriate governance and risk management arrangements, as well as operational
conduct rules for CGSs, which can lead to improved outreach and additionality along with financial
sustainability. The principles are built on extant literature on good practices for CGSs, including
results from global and regional surveys, and draw from sound practices of existing CGSs as
they have been implemented in a number of jurisdictions. Distilling these practices into a set of
internationally accepted principles is expected to improve CGSs’ performance, while advancing
knowledge and awareness of CGSs and their role in the economy. The principles are also expected
to guide CGSs, including newly established ones, to develop, review, and strengthen their
organizations, operations, and risk management practices.

To ensure a sound application of the principles, a constructive and collaborative response from the
recipient countries—especially their financial sectors—is essential. The task force is of the view
that the principles, if properly implemented, will help financial sector development and ultimately
improve access to credit for SMEs.

     Scope of Application
     The principles were developed for their application to public CGSs for SMEs. Public CGSs for SMEs
     are institutions created by governments, which retain de jure or de facto control as it is defined by
     relevant home-country laws, to provide credit guarantees to lenders in order to ease access to credit
     for SMEs operating in the governments’ respective jurisdictions. Target SMEs may operate in any
     sector, including agriculture. Public CGSs can be national, regional, or local. The principles are also
     intended to apply to (a) two-tier CGSs, in which a system of CGSs operates locally that reinsures part
     of their risk to a central counter-CGS, and (b) public CGSs managed by third parties. In addition, the
     principles include a number of good practices that can be applied to other types of CGSs, including
     international CGSs, cross-border CGSs, donor-funded CGSs, and privately owned CGSs.

     Nature
     The principles are a set of good practices that public CGSs either are implementing or intend to
     implement voluntarily. Given the intended “general” nature of the principles, they are envisioned
     to be applicable in all jurisdictions, regardless of their relative level of economic and financial sector
     development.

     The principles are expected to guide country authorities in the design, implementation, and
     evaluation of existing and new CGSs and to help inform any related policy, legal, and institutional
     reform. At any rate, the principles are subject and subsidiary to existing home-country laws and
     regulations. The principles complement rather than replace other relevant international standards
     and codes applicable to CGSs.

     Preconditions for Effective Design, Implementation,
     and Evaluation of CGSs
     CGSs are established to address market failures, which prevent or constrain SMEs from accessing
     credit. Hence, CGSs are not an end themselves but rather are a means to solve a problem.
     Therefore, market failures must be comprehensively analyzed to identify and define the problems
     to be addressed through a CGS and to determine if government intervention through a CGS is
     justified. Governments are nonetheless encouraged to pursue all necessary legal, regulatory, and
     institutional reforms to create environments that facilitate access to credit for SMEs.

     Even if the analysis of market failures suggests that intervention through a CGS is justified in
     principle, an effective CGS requires a number of external elements or preconditions that may
     directly affect the achievement of its policy objectives. These preconditions include the following:
     (a) a system of business laws, including corporate, bankruptcy, contract, collateral, consumer
     protection, and private property laws, which provides an acceptable degree of enforcement and a
     mechanism for the fair resolution of disputes; (b) a sufficiently independent and efficient judiciary;
     (c) a comprehensive and well-defined set of accounting standards and rules and reasonably well-
     regulated legal, accounting, and auditing professions; and (d) a sound and liquid financial system
     able to originate and manage credit effectively.



8 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
These preconditions are normally outside the control or influence of CGSs. However, if a CGS is
concerned that certain preconditions may actually (or even potentially) diminish its effectiveness,
the CGS should make government and relevant stakeholders aware. The CGS should also, as part
of its normal business operations, adopt measures to address the influence of such concerns on
the effectiveness of its activities.

Outline
The task force has identified four key areas for the success of public CGSs. Accordingly, the
principles cover the following key dimensions:
•	 Legal and regulatory framework
•	 Corporate governance and risk management
•	 Operational framework
•	 Monitoring and evaluation

Good practices in the first area are intended to provide the foundations for a CGS—that is, its
legal basis as well as its regulatory and supervisory framework. Sound corporate governance
and sound risk management, as set out in the second area, are critical building blocks for an
effectively designed and independently executed strategy aligned with the CGS’s mandate and
policy objectives. Corporate governance and risk management also ensure proper monitoring of
both financial and nonfinancial risks. A clear operational framework, the subject of the third area
covered by the principles, provides CGSs with a course of action comprising essential working
parameters. Finally, good practices identified in the fourth area reveal how CGSs must report on
their performance and, more importantly, evaluate the achievement of their policy objectives.

Implementation and Review
The task force acknowledges that implementation of the principles may be challenging for
some countries. These countries—especially those with newly established CGSs—may require
an appropriate transitional period. Accordingly, the principles are formulated broadly enough to
accommodate different legal, regulatory, and institutional settings in various jurisdictions.

The task force also acknowledges that several aspects of the principles could benefit from further study
and work. The evolving nature of the financial system, of which CGSs are an important component in
many jurisdictions, as well as further experiences of public CGSs, is likely to necessitate the periodic
reexamination of some aspects of the principles. Continuing coordination and consultation at the
international level are also desirable for other issues of common interest to CGSs.

To facilitate this process, the task force has agreed to consider its evolution into a permanent
standing group of CGSs, with terms of reference to be decided on and developed by its members.
This standing group would be able to periodically review the principles (as appropriate) as well
as provide member organizations with a continuing forum for exchanging ideas and sharing
knowledge. The standing group could also examine ways through which aggregated information on
CGSs around the world could be periodically collected and disseminated to the public.

     II. THE PRINCIPLES
     Principle 1
     The CGS should be established as an independent legal entity on the basis of a sound and clearly
     defined legal and regulatory framework to support the effective implementation of the CGS’s
     operations and the achievement of its policy objectives.

     Principle 2
     The CGS should have adequate funding to achieve its policy objectives, and the sources of
     funding, including any reliance on explicit and implicit subsidies, should be transparent and publicly
     disclosed.

     Principle 3
     The legal and regulatory framework should promote mixed ownership of the CGS, ensuring
     equitable treatment of minority shareholders.

     Principle 4
     The CGS should be independently and effectively supervised on the basis of risk-proportionate
     regulation scaled by the products and services offered.

     Principle 5
     The CGS should have a clearly defined mandate supported by strategies and operational goals
     consistent with policy objectives.

     Principle 6
     The CGS should have a sound corporate governance structure with an independent and competent
     board of directors appointed according to clearly defined criteria.

     Principle 7
     The CGS should have a sound internal control framework to safeguard the integrity and efficiency
     of its governance and operations.

     Principle 8
     The CGS should have an effective and comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that
     identifies, assesses, and manages the risks related to CGS operations.

     Principle 9
     The CGS should adopt clearly defined and transparent eligibility and qualification criteria for SMEs,
     lenders, and credit instruments.

     Principle 10
     The CGS’s guarantee delivery approach should appropriately reflect a trade-off between
     outreach, additionality, and financial sustainability, taking into account the level of financial sector
     development of the country.



10 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
Principle 11
The guarantees issued by the CGS should be partial, thus providing the right incentives for SME
borrowers and lenders, and should be designed to ensure compliance with the relevant prudential
requirements for lenders, in particular with capital requirements for credit risk.

Principle 12
The CGS should adopt a transparent and consistent risk-based pricing policy to ensure that the
guarantee program is financially sustainable and attractive for both SMEs and lenders.

Principle 13
The claim management process should be efficient, clearly documented, and transparent,
providing incentives for loan loss recovery, and should align with the home country’s legal and
regulatory framework.

Principle 14
The CGS should be subject to rigorous financial reporting requirements and should have its
financial statements audited externally.

Principle 15
The CGS should periodically and publicly disclose nonfinancial information related to its operations.

Principle 16
The performance of the CGS—in particular its outreach, additionality, and financial sustainability—
should be systematically and periodically evaluated, and the findings from the evaluation publicly
disclosed.

     III. DISCUSSION OF THE PRINCIPLES
     Public CGSs either have implemented or intend to implement the following principles voluntarily.
     The principles are subject to home-country laws, regulations, requirements, and obligations. This
     paragraph is an integral part of the principles and should be read in conjunction with the related
     explanatory notes.

     Legal and Regulatory Framework
     Principle 1: The CGS should be established as an independent legal entity on the
     basis of a sound and clearly defined legal and regulatory framework to support the
     effective implementation of the CGS’s operations and the achievement of its policy
     objectives.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     The CGS should be established as an independent legal entity, thereby allowing the government
     to retain ownership and control and the CGS to operate efficiently and sustainably. A clearly
     defined legal and regulatory framework for the CGS should have its basis in appropriate and
     specific legislation. A domestic law or decree should authorize establishment of the CGS, either
     under corporate or banking legislation or under institution-specific legislation. A sound legal and
     regulatory framework provides the institutional foundations of the CGS, enhancing its credibility
     and reputation.

     The CGS’s legal and regulatory framework should clarify the ownership policy of the government,
     as well as any general terms and conditions that apply to its investment. The framework should
     also specify how the government will exercise its ownership, identifying who represents the
     government and which government body is charged with supervising the CGS. In addition, the
     legal and regulatory framework should set clear boundaries and should define the relationship
     between the government-as-shareholder and the CGS’s board and management. Such boundaries
     separate legitimate government control and oversight from day-to-day operations; this in turn
     ensures the CGS’s managerial autonomy and accountability, both of which are necessary
     for decision making. A sound legal and regulatory framework facilitates the formulation and
     implementation of an appropriate strategy to achieve the CGS’s policy objectives. The framework
     should also specify the CGS’s funding sources.

     The task force recognizes that governments may choose to operate CGSs through development
     finance institutions. In these cases, CGSs should be financially and operationally independent
     and should apply the principles related to the operational framework (Principles 9 through 13).
     Moreover, the legal entity operating the CGS should ensure the sustainable functioning of the
     CGS in accordance with its objectives. Pay-as-you-go CGSs that are based on annual budgetary
     subventions and run as programs by government agencies should be discouraged.

Principle 2: The CGS should have adequate funding to achieve its policy objectives,
and the sources of funding, including any reliance on explicit and implicit subsidies,
should be transparent and publicly disclosed.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
The CGS should have adequate capital and government financial support to ensure effective
implementation of its operations and to achieve meaningful outreach and additionality with
financial sustainability. Setting up a CGS with inadequate financial resources can result in a
limited developmental effect and a lack of financial sustainability, thereby seriously undermining
the confidence of lenders and endangering the achievement of the CGS’s policy objectives. The
adequacy of funding should be determined by (a) the policy objectives that the CGS intends
to achieve and (b) the volume of business it must generate to remain current on its financial
obligations while ensuring long-term financial sustainability.

Clear and publicly disclosed rules, procedures, or arrangements should clarify the responsibilities of
the government or ownership entity to provide the CGS’s initial capital, as well as the government or
ownership entity’s commitment to provide additional capital or subsidies during the course of CGS
operations. Sources of funding should be clearly identified. The CGS should be primarily funded out
of equity endowments, which can be complemented by long-term concessionary loans either from
government sources or from multilateral and bilateral institutions. To prudently manage its capital
structure, the CGS should not borrow from public or private debt markets. The legal and regulatory
framework establishing the CGS should set minimum capital adequacy standards for the CGS.

To mitigate fiscal risk for the government, the appropriate legislation should put limits on budget
appropriations, subsidies, and guarantees. Such limits should accommodate the CGS’s policy goals
and should be fully consistent with the fiscal resources provided in the government accounts.
Funding use and existing limits should be periodically reviewed and revised as appropriate under
a fully transparent process and should be audited by a supreme audit institution or any other
mandated institution, according to home-country laws.

Principle 3: The legal and regulatory framework should promote mixed ownership
of the CGS, ensuring equitable treatment of minority shareholders.
Explanatory notes

Mixed ownership results when a government or ownership entity either (a) chooses a strategic
private sector partner to invest in a CGS to access commercial and industry experience or (b)
establishes a new CGS in partnership with the private sector. Voluntary minority participation
of lenders or SMEs provides a source of finance for the CGS. Such participation may play
an important role in advancing knowledge of target markets, as well as in introducing good
governance practices for efficient CGS management. Mixed ownership has the further advantage
of reducing moral hazard on the part of the CGS, lenders, and SME borrowers by introducing peer
pressure, shared responsibility, and transparency in the decision-making process. The legal and
regulatory framework establishing the CGS should encourage but should not force private sector
participation in the ownership structure of the CGS.



                                                  Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs | 13
     Mixed ownership, however, poses specific governance challenges. Because the state typically retains
     a large ownership share, the government or ownership entity can choose all CGS board members
     and can make major decisions unilaterally. Even when its direct ownership share is smaller, the state
     may retain a high degree of control through government-linked investors, shares held through other
     state-owned enterprises, or special legal rights known as “golden shares.   ” If the government or
     ownership entity exploits its control rights and pursues its interests to the disadvantage of other CGS
     shareholders, the potential benefits of bringing in other shareholders will be undermined. Equitable
     treatment of shareholders is thus crucial to achieving the benefits that mixed ownership can bring.
     The legal and regulatory framework should assign clear responsibility for protecting the basic rights
     of minority shareholders and for promoting active shareholder participation in the CGS’s governance
     and decision-making processes.

     Principle 4: The CGS should be independently and effectively supervised on the basis
     of risk-proportionate regulation scaled by the products and services offered.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     CGS supervisory accountabilities should be defined in the relevant legal and regulatory framework
     and should be clearly separated from CGS ownership and management. An effective system of
     supervision should assign clear responsibilities and objectives for the agency charged with the
     supervision of the CGS. The supervisor should ensure that the CGS is run as efficiently as possible
     while also minimizing the risk to taxpayers of any unexpected or unbudgeted losses that may occur
     in the course of normal business operations. In addition, the supervisor should have the power to
     evaluate and restrict policy-related activities to those explicitly listed in chartering legislation and
     fiscal budgets. In this regard, CGS supervision should be extended beyond safety and soundness
     to the evaluation of suitability and scale of policy operations. The supervisor should be empowered
     with the legal means to enforce prudential standards and to use corrective measures when
     necessary. The supervisor should be required to formally raise objections and seek administrative
     injunctions of inadmissible activities, should such activities be identified. These objections should
     be made public by the supervisor in annual reports or in a special interim report as appropriate. The
     legal powers of the supervisor should be reinforced with public disclosure responsibilities.

     To benefit from economies of scale and to reduce the overall costs of independent supervision,
     supervisory powers should be vested in one entity. Normally, the country authorities would choose
     to empower the financial sector supervisor with responsibility for the supervision of the CGS. If
     this approach is adopted, the supervisor must have adequate funding and the culture of prudential
     supervision must be consistent with the supervisory culture of commercial financial institutions.

     Supervision should be calibrated according to the nature and risks of the products and services
     provided by the CGS. The supervisor should have, at minimum, the responsibility to monitor (a)
     the CGS’s activities on the basis of its mission statement and (b) the specific lines of business
     its chartering legislation empowers the CGS to conduct through a sound corporate governance
     framework and adequate risk management systems. Moreover, the supervisor should ensure that




14 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
the CGS continuously satisfies minimum prudential capital (or maximum leverage) standards—that
is, the ratio of equity to outstanding guarantees, as set either in the CGS’s chartering legislation or
by supervisor-issued regulation. The prudential capital standards should be established to provide
an adequate buffer to protect against unscheduled needs for fiscal support. Minimum prudential
capital standards should be designed to reflect the policy objectives of the CGS and the riskiness
of the business environment in which the CGS operates. Finally, the supervisor should ensure
that the CGS has adequate policies and processes for the early identification and management of
problem assets and for the maintenance of adequate provisions and reserves.

Corporate Governance and Risk Management
Principle 5: The CGS should have a clearly defined mandate supported by strategies
and operational goals consistent with policy objectives.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Clearly stating and communicating the mandate of the CGS is necessary for defining
accountability, determining the scope of CGS activities, and forming the basis for identifying more
specific targets for CGS operations. The mandate should be set in the legislation that establishes
the CGS and include, at minimum, the target SMEs and the main line(s) of business of the CGS. In
addition to the provision of credit guarantees, the mandate may encompass ancillary services, such
as technical assistance, provision of information, training, and counseling. The mandate should also
specify a desired level of efficiency for the CGS, which defines goals and constraints for financial
sustainability. The mandate should be broad enough to ensure take-up and to accommodate
cyclical developments in the target SME sectors. However, a CGS that is set up for development
purposes should in principle not engage in a countercyclical role with its own resources. The latter
would be better achieved through extraordinary measures, such as a counter-CGS or additional
funding provided by the government, which may be implemented through the CGS on the basis of
specific contractual arrangements. The mandate should be subject to periodic reviews through an
explicit and transparent mechanism to assess the mandate’s continuing validity.

In accordance with its mandate, the CGS should develop coherent strategies and specific
programs for different target sectors and groups. Acknowledging that different SME target
sectors and groups may require different operational support, the CGS should develop tailored
strategies, including one for effective communications. Management, the board of directors, and
the government or ownership entity should all be involved in the development of the strategy.
Management should be responsible for developing and executing the strategy, while the
board should be responsible for approving the strategy and monitoring its implementation. The
government or ownership entity should be responsible for monitoring the CGS’s performance and
its adherence to the strategy and other commitments in line with the general objectives that the
government has defined. The strategies should include specific operational goals to ensure the
CGS’s performance and financial sustainability and to meet its policy objectives. Operational goals
should be clear and realistic and be measured against key performance indicators and targets.

     Principle 6: The CGS should have a sound corporate governance structure with
     an independent and competent board of directors appointed according to clearly
     defined criteria.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     The CGS’s corporate governance framework should ensure that operational management is
     conducted independently. Thus business decisions are made on the basis of economic and financial
     considerations that align with the CGS’s mandate and policy objectives and are free of political
     influence and interference. This framework should be set out in the CGS’s legal framework, charter,
     or other constitutive document. The framework should ensure appropriate division of roles and
     responsibilities, especially among the government or ownership entity, the supervisor, the board, and
     the management of the CGS.

     Political influence and interference, which typically result from the lack of independence of the
     board of directors and senior management of the CGS, are major impediments to an effectively
     functioning CGS. Political intervention can be limited by ensuring a clear process for appointing
     CGS board members. The government or ownership entity should adopt a structured and
     transparent appointment process that adheres to explicit policies and procedures and that seeks
     to ensure the board’s ability to exercise its responsibilities in an independent manner. Transparency
     in the nomination process is necessary to ensure technical expertise consistent with the business
     operations of the CGS. A clear policy setting minimum standards of competency for board
     members should be adopted. The process by which people are appointed to the board should be
     made explicit in the relevant legal and regulatory framework of the CGS.

     Board members should serve a fixed term and should act in the best interest of the CGS—without
     any conflicts of interest. Board members should act with integrity and be held accountable for
     their actions while being indemnified to minimize potential personal liabilities incurred during the
     course of normal business operations. More generally, the board should include an independent
     and unaffiliated member(s) from the private sector. Where a mixed ownership model is adopted,
     minority shareholders should be adequately empowered either through participation in the
     nomination process or through the appointment of a representative(s) on the board.

     Principle 7: The CGS should have a sound internal control framework to safeguard
     the integrity and efficiency of its governance and operations.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     The CGS should have a strong system of internal controls proportionate to its size and complexity.
     Effective internal controls allow CGS management to know what is happening in the organization
     and whether instructions are being followed. The CGS’s management should design internal control
     procedures with several purposes in mind: (a) to safeguard assets against unauthorized use or
     disposition, (b) to maintain proper accounting records, and (c) to ensure the reliability of financial
     and nonfinancial information. Control procedures should ensure that business processes and other
     activities are conducted properly, should mitigate the potential for misconduct, and should detect
     any misconduct that does occur. The board, either directly or through a relevant committee, should
     assume responsibility for periodically reviewing the internal controls established by the management.


16 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
The CGS should have an internal audit and compliance function. To ensure objectivity, the
internal audit and compliance function should report either directly to the board or to the audit or
compliance committee. The internal audit and compliance function should place particular emphasis
on monitoring the CGS’s control systems and should evaluate risk exposures related to the CGS’s
governance, operations, and information systems. In addition, the internal audit and compliance
function should be able to carry out ad hoc investigations at the request either of the board or of
the audit or compliance committee. The internal audit and compliance function should also have the
power necessary to ensure that issues raised in investigations will be addressed, and the board or
the audit or compliance committee should ensure that the internal audit and compliance function
has adequate resources to carry out its tasks.

Principle 8: The CGS should have an effective and comprehensive enterprise risk
management framework that identifies, assesses, and manages the risks related to
CGS operations.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
The ability of a CGS to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks it faces—as well as to
determine that it holds adequate capital against those risks—is a critical component of the overall
corporate governance framework. Adherence to high standards of risk management through sound
operational controls and systems is an essential determinant of the CGS’s performance and of the
CGS’s ability to execute its mandate. The CGS should adopt a sound enterprise risk management
framework as part of the internal control environment. This risk framework should include reliable
and accurate information, including that provided by lenders, SME borrowers, and third parties. It
should also include timely reporting systems that allow for adequate monitoring and management
of relevant risks within acceptable board-adopted parameters. The enterprise risk management
framework should be approved by the board and subject to periodic reviews to assess its
continuing relevance. At minimum, the enterprise risk management framework should identify,
assess, and manage credit risk, liquidity and market risk, and operational risk.

Credit risk is the main risk a CGS faces. Although credit risk management practices may differ
depending on the specific nature of the CGS and on its delivery method, all CGSs should
nonetheless develop a comprehensive credit risk management that clearly defines responsibilities
and accountabilities. The measurement and management of credit risk should rely on appropriate
quantitative and qualitative techniques. An effective credit risk management should establish and
enforce a set of relevant exposure limits (for example, by subsector, geographical area, and so
forth) as well as use any appropriate technique or instrument available, such as counter-guarantees
or co-guarantees, to mitigate concentration risk. The framework should also encompass sound
guarantee evaluation policies and practices. Finally, the framework should include a system to
identify environmental, social, and corporate governance risks associated with the CGS’s guarantee
business to encourage sustainable and socially responsible business development by both SMEs
and lenders.

A second type of risk a CGS confronts is liquidity and market risk. The CGS must develop an effective
liquidity and market risk management framework to ensure that it meets claims and hedges against
adverse movements in market prices. Reliable governance arrangements, management information


                                                 Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs | 17
     systems, analysis of liquidity requirements, and contingency planning (for example, a concessional
     standby line of credit from the government) are crucial elements for strong liquidity and market
     risk management. The CGS should also have a transparent investment policy that establishes
     an investment framework consistent with the mandate and strategic objectives of the CGS, the
     approved risk profile, and monitoring procedures. Appropriate portfolio management criteria aimed at
     minimizing risks should guide the investment policy, which should define permissible asset classes
     and provide guidance on concentration risk through individual exposures, the liquidity profile, and
     sectoral and geographical concentration.

     A third type of risk a CGS faces is operational risk. This refers to the risk of a loss either
     from failures in the CGS’s systems and procedures or from events outside the control of the
     organization. Most operational risks arise from incompetence and fraud, business continuity risk,
     process risk, technology risk, reputational risk, and legal risk. To assess and control operational
     risks, the CGS should establish and document a framework that identifies lines of responsibility,
     segregation of duties, and reliable control mechanisms. Codes of conduct and recruitment policies
     are important to ensure the professional and ethical behavior of staff members involved in the
     CGS’s operations. To ensure that the CGS can operate in the event of a technology breakdown or
     natural disaster, business resumption planning should be an important part of the operational risk
     framework.

     Operational Framework
     Principle 9: The CGS should adopt clearly defined and transparent eligibility and
     qualification criteria for SMEs, lenders, and credit instruments.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     The CGS should adopt clear eligibility and qualification criteria to guide operations in line with the
     CGS’s mandate. These criteria should be publicly communicated and periodically reviewed. First, the
     SME target sectors and groups should be clearly defined in the policies or other relevant operational
     documents of the CGS. Typical eligibility criteria include firm size, subsector, and age, although in
     general these criteria are combined. Size is typically defined by maximum number of employees,
     value of assets, and sales. Many CGSs also have a number of different windows or separately
     designed programs dedicated to such subclasses of firms as start-ups, exporters, and high-tech
     firms. Other CGSs either directly or indirectly target specific ethnic groups, women, or youth, the
     policy aim being to encourage entrepreneurship in these specific segments of the population.
     A CGS may create a “negative” list of ineligible SMEs (on the basis of their credit profile and
     repayment reputation, for example) and may even explicitly exclude some subsectors from its scope
     of operations. Last, the CGS should define qualification criteria for lenders based, for example, on
     their interest and capacity in serving SMEs, their level of nonperforming SME loans, and their risk
     management capabilities.

     In addition to determining which SMEs are to benefit from guarantees and which lenders qualify
     to use the guarantees, the CGS should clarify the type of credit instrument targeted. Credit
     instruments covered by a CGS typically include working capital and investment finance. The CGS
     should provide guarantees for both purposes. Whereas working capital finance may be important


18 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
for sustaining jobs in SMEs that are vulnerable to insolvency because of insufficient short-term
credit, investment finance is essential for job creation and long-term economic growth. The CGS
should cover the principal loan amount of the underlying credit instrument and, to a limited extent,
the unpaid interest. On the one hand, the CGS should not give priority to the refinancing of
existing guaranteed loans unless exceptional circumstances spelled out in the CGS’s operational
documents justify such an intervention. On the other hand, the provision of guarantees for
rescheduled or restructured loans may be acceptable if additional funds are being offered on the
basis of the SME borrower’s prospects, with lenders retaining their share of credit risk.

Principle 10: The CGS’s guarantee delivery approach should appropriately reflect a
trade-off between outreach, additionality, and financial sustainability, taking into
account the level of financial sector development of the country.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
The modalities of extension of guarantees, which determine the relationship between the CGS and
the SME borrower, should be driven by the ultimate objectives of the CGS. Two main methods of
delivery are generally observed: the individual approach and the portfolio approach.

In the individual approach, guarantees are provided on a loan by loan basis. In most CGSs, the
SME borrower approaches a lender, who reviews the project and makes the loan conditional
upon a guarantee. Less frequently, the CGS issues an advance guarantee approval to the SME
borrower, who can then use that approval to negotiate the loan with the lender. In either case, a
direct relationship between the CGS and the SME borrower exists, as the former investigates all
loan applications and selects those to guarantee. This relationship should reduce the probability
of moral hazard on the part of the lender during the appraisal and should ensure that guaranteed
SME borrowers indeed belong to target sectors and groups. However, the individual approach may
involve lower outreach and higher operating costs, which may negatively affect the CGS’s overall
efficiency and financial sustainability.

In the portfolio approach, lenders are entitled to attach guarantees to loans without previous
consultation with the CGS—but within eligible categories that have been clearly specified in
contractual agreements between the CGS and the lender. In the portfolio approach there is,
therefore, no direct relationship between the CGS and the SME borrower. This approach may
allow the CGS to reach a larger number of SME borrowers, thereby possibly establishing a good
repayment reputation for future lending relationships. Moreover, economies of scale resulting
from increased business volumes make more cost-effective operations for the CGS possible.
However, financial additionality may be lower than in the individual approach if a large proportion of
guarantees are awarded by lenders to SME borrowers who could have qualified for nonguaranteed
loans. Finally, default rates may be higher because of the risk of moral hazard on the part of the
lender during the appraisal.




                                                  Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs | 19
     The choice of the CGS delivery approach should involve an analysis of the trade-offs among outreach,
     additionality, and financial sustainability. Whereas the individual approach may imply high costs and
     low outreach, the portfolio approach may make it harder to ensure that all guaranteed SME borrowers
     belong to target groups and sectors. Ideally, the CGS should combine both approaches, taking into
     account the degree of development and sophistication of the overall financial sector and of individual
     financial institutions. If a certain type of SME—for example, early-stage SMEs or those owned by
     women—is to be promoted, regardless of the specific project presented, the portfolio approach may
     be used. Other SMEs would necessitate the individual approach. Alternatively, loans up to a certain
     amount may qualify for portfolio guarantees, whereas large loans may be assessed by the CGS
     individually. However, in countries where market failures and imperfections in SME credit markets
     are pervasive, the focus should be on the individual approach. In such circumstances, the individual
     approach may reduce information asymmetries and improve lenders’ perceptions of high risk in the
     SME segment, while also helping establish a trusted relationship between the CGS and the lenders.

     Principle 11: The guarantees issued by the CGS should be partial, providing the
     right incentives for SME borrowers and lenders, and should be designed to ensure
     compliance with the relevant prudential requirements for lenders, in particular with
     capital requirements for credit risk.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     To avoid moral hazard on the parts of both lenders and SMEs, credit risk must be shared
     appropriately among the CGS, lenders, and SMEs. Sharing credit risk ensures that the right
     incentives are in place so that default and claim rates are kept as low as possible. The CGS can
     distribute risk to lenders through the guarantee coverage ratio, which is usually expressed as a
     percentage of the underlying loan exposure. The guarantee coverage ratio should be high enough
     to induce lenders to participate. At the same time, the ratio should allow lenders to assume a
     meaningful share of credit risk. In principle, the guarantee coverage ratio should not be lower than
     50 percent. The ratio should be clearly indicated in the contractual agreements between the CGS
     and the lender. These agreements should also clarify whether the losses are shared pari passu
     between the CGS and the lender or whether the CGS covers the first loss.

     The appropriate guarantee coverage ratio should be determined by the SME target sectors and
     groups. For example, higher coverage may be granted to SMEs operating in sectors with higher
     potential for job creation or job preservation, or to early-stage firms. The appropriate coverage
     ratio should also be a function of the delivery approach employed by the CGS. Under the portfolio
     approach, the guarantee coverage ratio should be lower than under the individual approach because,
     in the former, the lender conducts the appraisal of the SME borrowers. Finally, the appropriate
     guarantee coverage ratio should reflect the country’s level of financial sector development. Higher
     coverage may be established in less developed jurisdictions. The CGS should be able to adjust its
     guarantee coverage ratio to reflect the CGS’s credit loss history and external market developments.




20 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
Risk sharing is also important for preventing moral hazard on the part of SME borrowers, who
should, therefore, retain part of the risk and demonstrate their commitment to repayment
by supplying adequate collateral, if available. However, excessive collateral requirements can
defeat the purpose of the guarantee; hence the CGS should work with the lender to determine
appropriate collateral requirements.

The guarantee extended by the CGS should include terms and conditions that are clearly specified
through contractual agreements between the CGS and the lender. These terms and conditions
should comply with relevant prudential regulation of credit risk mitigation techniques, such as the
Basel requirements, as they are applicable to the lender. This ensures that the guarantee issued by
the CGS can provide capital relief to the lender for the proportion of the underlying loan exposure
covered by the guarantee. In most jurisdictions, the prudential regulatory framework for lenders
provides for favorable treatment of exposures to the government for the purpose of calculating
prudential capital requirements. This implies that the guaranteed loans will benefit from lower
risk weight or equivalent probability of default. However, the guarantee issued by the CGS should
meet certain minimum legal requirements in seniority, revocability, and effectiveness as set by
the financial regulator. The guarantee issued by the CGS should comply with these minimum
requirements to maximize incentives for lenders to participate in the CGS. The guarantee issued
by the CGS should also comply with the prudential rules for loan loss classification and loan loss
provisioning requirements for collateralized assets, as they are applicable to the lender, thus
providing a further incentive for lenders to use the guarantee.

Principle 12: The CGS should adopt a transparent and consistent risk-based
pricing policy to ensure that the guarantee program is financially sustainable and
attractive for both SMEs and lenders.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
The CGS should charge fees for the guarantees it provides on the basis of the riskiness of the
underlying loan, which is reflected in the combination of guarantee coverage ratio, exposure at
default, and loss given default. Such risk-based fees signal that guarantees have a value and also
that financial sustainability is a priority for the CGS. The pricing policy should be transparent and
codified in the CGS’s relevant operational documents.

When determining the size and the structure of the fees, the CGS should strike a balance between
the outreach goals of the guarantee program and its financial sustainability. Fees, along with the
income that the CGS derives from its investment activities and any agreed-upon level of operational
subsidy through government budgetary subventions, should cover the cost of operations and the
expected cost of credit risk (or claims). Fees should always be levied on the amount guaranteed.
The CGS should be able to adjust its pricing policy on the basis of the CGS’s credit loss history and
market developments.




                                                  Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs | 21
     Principle 13: The claim management process should be efficient, clearly
     documented, and transparent, providing incentives for loan loss recovery, and
     should align with the home country’s legal and regulatory framework.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     A timely, efficient, and transparent procedure for triggering claims is important to build and maintain
     lenders confidence. The precise circumstances under which a claim can be made should be clearly
     articulated in the contractual agreement between the CGS and the lender. Many CGSs have a
     minimum mandatory waiting period after loan disbursement before a claim can be entered. The
     trigger conditions for claims should specify the maximum period after a missed payment(s) and
     should not be conditional on initiating legal action against the SME borrower. Lenders, however,
     should proactively explore alternative solutions, including rescheduling, to receive payment from the
     SME borrower.

     A clear and transparent process should ensure that guarantee payments are settled in a timely
     manner to avoid costly disputes. A CGS’s credibility is largely dependent on how claims are
     handled once they have been submitted. Contractual agreements between the CGS and the
     lender should clearly state the conditions under which a claim is acceptable, and a detailed written
     explanation should accompany the refusal of a claim. The maximum amount of unpaid interest
     covered by the guarantee should also be clearly specified. There should be a time limit for the
     settlement of claims.

     Contractual agreements with the lender should detail an unambiguous and efficient process for
     post claim loss recovery. Loss-given-default rates for both the CGS and the lender can be reduced
     by pursuing SME borrowers who have defaulted on the guaranteed loans after claims have been
     paid. Because there may be economies of scale and scope in concentrating recovery activities in
     one organization, an ex-ante division of labor must be clear between the CGS and the lender, with
     responsibilities clearly delineated on the basis of expertise and resources. Should the CGS take
     over responsibility for debt recovery, the subrogation of the loan must be documented and legally
     enforceable. The process of debt recovery should be consistent with the home country’s legal and
     regulatory framework.

     Monitoring and Evaluation
     Principle 14: The CGS should be subject to rigorous financial reporting
     requirements and should have its financial statements audited externally.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     Timely, accurate, and appropriately audited financial statements hold the management of a CGS
     accountable for the stewardship of the organization. The CGS should produce and disclose financial
     statements—including a balance sheet, cash flow statement, profit and loss statement, statement
     of changes to equity, and notes—at least annually. A management commentary should accompany
     annual financial statements. Financial statements should be prepared in accordance with the




22 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
home country’s accounting standards for domestic private sector financial enterprises. Using the
same reporting standards as private sector enterprises allows the CGS to draw on an established
independent body of expertise for organizing and auditing financial statements, as well as for
evaluating the statements’ significance.

The CGS’s financial statements should be audited by a professional, certified audit firm. An
independent external audit contributes to the credibility of the CGS’s financial reporting and
provides reasonable assurance to the government or ownership entity, to other CGS shareholders,
and to the general public that the financial statements fairly represent, in all material respects,
the financial position and performance of the CGS. An external audit also provides the CGS’s
management with useful insights into the CGS’s main risk areas related to its internal controls and
reporting processes.

Principle 15: The CGS should periodically and publicly disclose nonfinancial
information related to its operations.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
The CGS should publicly report nonfinancial information annually, at least. Such disclosure, often
qualitative in nature, should give stakeholders key insights into the workings of the CGS, its
prospects, and its relationship with the government or ownership entity. Nonfinancial reporting
should be linked to the policy objectives of the CGS. At minimum, the following nonfinancial
information should be disclosed: (a) social and economic commitments made, (b) social and
economic outcomes, and (c) any other material engagement into which the CGS has entered as a
result of its status as a government-owned institution.

The CGS should disclose information related to its corporate governance structure, including board
committees, if any, and relevant policies. Like private sector companies, the CGS should also
disclose the aggregate and individual pay of board members and the chief executive officer, as well
as the policy on which the pay is based. Board members’ background, current employment, other
directorships, and board and committee attendance should also be disclosed. This information
should clarify which board members are serving as government officials, which members are
primarily from the public sector, and which members are from the private sector. Finally, where
a mixed ownership model is adopted, the CGS should disclose ownership structure and rights of
minority shareholders, as well as any special right retained by the government or ownership entity.
Last, the CGS should make public any agreement, including its terms, between the government
and private shareholders.

     Principle 16: The performance of the CGS—in particular its outreach, additionality,
     and financial sustainability—should be systematically and periodically evaluated,
     and the findings from the evaluation publicly disclosed.

     EXPLANATORY NOTES
     A comprehensive evaluation of the CGS’s performance is necessary to account for the use of
     public resources, to measure the achievement of CGS policy objectives, and to improve CGS
     operations. The CGS should establish a sound mechanism for systematically assessing the
     performance of its operations. The framework for performance evaluation should be linked with
     the internal control environment to generate relevant data and information. The performance of the
     CGS should be evaluated at least every three to five years. The methodology of the performance
     assessment should be transparent and the findings publicly disclosed.

     The performance of the CGS should be measured and evaluated along the dimensions of outreach,
     additionality, and financial sustainability. “Outreach” refers to the capacity of the CGS to meet
     the demand for guaranteed loans by SMEs. Outreach should be measured, at minimum, by the
     number of guarantees issued to eligible SMEs and by the amount of outstanding guarantees.
     However, the scale of activity of the CGS does not necessarily imply effect of the CGS.

     The effect of the CGS should be assessed through measurement and evaluation of the CGS’s
     financial and economic additionality. “Financial additionality” refers to incremental credit volumes
     granted to eligible SMEs as a result of CGS activities. Financial additionality also includes more
     favorable conditions for eligible SMEs in loan size, pricing and maturities, reduced amount of
     collateral required to obtain credit, and faster loan-processing time. “Economic additionality”
     refers to the economic welfare that the CGS generates as a result of its operations. In particular,
     economic additionality speaks to the effect of guarantees on employment, investment, and
     ultimately, economic growth. The task force acknowledges that evaluating the impact of a CGS
     is technically challenging because of the difficulties in establishing a counterfactual baseline.
     Nonetheless, the CGS should assess its financial and economic additionality on the basis of
     existing and widely adopted methodologies, ideally in partnership with academic and research
     organizations. In any event, the CGS should ensure that it collects and retains relevant data from its
     operations to facilitate future evaluations.

     Finally, the performance evaluation framework of the CGS should include an assessment of its
     financial sustainability. “Financial sustainability” refers to the CGS’s capacity to contain losses
     while continually maintaining an adequate capital base relative to its liabilities on a going concern
     basis. Financial sustainability indicates CGS operations’ degree of reliance on public support and
     should, therefore, be assessed from a long-term perspective.

PART 2: Methodology for Assessing
Implementation of the Principles

I. INTRODUCTION
The principles for the design, implementation, and evaluation of public credit guarantee schemes
(CGSs) for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are intended to become the de facto standard
for effectively and efficiently establishing and running public CGSs for SMEs around the world.
To fully meet their policy objectives, public CGSs must be designed and operated to achieve both
outreach and additionality in a financially sustainable way. The principles are expected (a) to provide
guidance to country authorities on the design, execution, and performance assessment of existing
and newly established public CGSs for SMEs and (b) to help inform any related policy, legal, and
institutional reform.

The principles are a set of good practices that public CGSs either are implementing or intend
to implement voluntarily. Given their nature, the principles are envisioned to be applicable in all
jurisdictions, regardless of their relative level of economic and financial sector development.
The principles cover four key dimensions deemed critical for the success of CGSs: (a) legal and
regulatory framework, (b) corporate governance and risk management, (c) operational framework,
and (d) monitoring and evaluation.

The principles have been drafted at a broad conceptual level to accommodate different legal,
regulatory, and institutional settings in various jurisdictions. In drafting the principles, the task force
has attempted to avoid being overly prescriptive while providing sufficient guidance on the core
elements of an effective and efficient legal, regulatory, operational, and evaluation framework for
public CGSs. Because the principles are broadly stated, they should be complemented with a set
of criteria that assesses implementation of the principles at the country level.

For that purpose, and to achieve objectivity and comparability across CGSs in different countries,
the task force has developed this methodology for assessing implementation of the principles.
Assessing a CGS’s implementation of the principles can be considered a useful tool in measuring
the CGS’s adherence to an effective and efficient legal, regulatory, and operational framework.
Such an assessment is expected to identify gaps in the existing framework and form the basis for
remedial measures by authorities.

Application of the Methodology
The methodology can be applied in different ways: (a) self-assessment performed by the CGSs
themselves; (b) assessment performed by the government or the regulator of the CGS; (c) World
Bank Group diagnostic of CGSs for SMEs—for example, in the context of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program or operational work; (d) reviews conducted by third parties, such as consulting
firms; or (e) peer reviews conducted, for example, by the international associations of CGSs.


                                                    Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs | 25
     Scope and Objectives of the Methodology
     The primary objective of an assessment should be to identify the nature and extent of any gap
     in the legal, regulatory, and operational framework governing a public CGS for SMEs. However,
     the assessment should not be an objective in itself; rather, it represents a means to an end. The
     assessment is expected to signal to the authorities any relevant area where reforms and actions
     may be necessary to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a CGS.

     The methodology addresses the preconditions for effective and efficient design, implementation, and
     evaluation of public CGSs and also addresses each principle in detail. The assessment should start
     with a review of the preconditions. The review should not evaluate a country’s observance of the
     preconditions, as this is beyond the scope of this methodology. Instead, the objective of the review is
     to gain information about the legal and financial sector in which the CGS operates. The review should
     include an opinion on how any weaknesses in the preconditions may hinder an effective and efficient
     implementation of the CGS, and how the CGS should address those weaknesses.

     To assess implementation of the individual principles, the methodology sets out (a) the key issues
     addressed by the principles and (b) the key questions relevant to assessing how the key issues
     are addressed. However, the assessment should be seen not as a checklist to be completed
     but rather as a qualitative and judgmental exercise to be conducted. Any “yes” or “no” (or “not
     applicable”) answer to a key question should be augmented by commentary that refines and
     explains the answer in the context of a particular country. An answer that is neither a full “yes”
     nor a “no” should be qualified with proper explanations. The primary goal of the assessment is not
     to assign a rating but rather to focus authorities on areas needing attention. This focus will set the
     stage for development of an action plan that prioritizes the improvements necessary to achieve full
     implementation of the principles.



     II. REVIEW OF THE PRECONDITIONS
     This section offers general guidance on how to review the preconditions for effective design,
     implementation, and evaluation of public CGSs. The results of this review can provide context to the
     legal and financial sector environment within which the CGS operates.

     The preconditions comprise the following: (a) a system of business laws, including corporate,
     bankruptcy, contract, collateral, consumer protection, and private property laws, that provides
     an acceptable degree of enforcement and a mechanism for the fair resolution of disputes; (b)
     a sufficiently independent and efficient judiciary; (c) a comprehensive and well-defined set of
     accounting standards and rules and reasonably well-regulated legal, accounting, and auditing
     professions; and (d) a sound and liquid financial system able to originate and manage credit
     effectively.




26 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
The review should pay close attention to the adequacy of the preconditions and should provide a
succinct and structured factual summary that follows the headings indicated in the appendix. The
review of the preconditions should be targeted, focusing on essential aspects and based as much
as possible on available assessments and indicators to reduce excessive discretion.4 This review
should illustrate the preconditions’ interaction with the assessment of implementation of the
principles, thus helping to flag any individual principle whose implementation is likely to be affected
by any material weakness in the preconditions.

The review of the legal environment, especially those aspects related to insolvency and creditor
and debtor rights, could cover the mechanisms that provide methods for recovering debt.
These include the seizure and sale of immovable and movable assets and the sale or collection
of intangible assets; the legal framework for secured lending, including the existence and the
main features of a reliable public registry system; any informal out-of-court process for cases of
corporate financial difficulty; and the institutional framework of the insolvency system.

An overview of the independence and efficiency of the judiciary could look at the degree of
integrity and impartiality of the courts; the time, cost, and number of procedures involved in a
commercial sale dispute; and the main procedural and administrative bottlenecks in the insolvency
process.

Review of the accounting and auditing environment could consider the strengths and weaknesses
of the institutional frameworks underpinning financial accounting and auditing practices, especially
for SMEs; the comparability of national accounting and auditing standards with internationally
recognized standards; and the general degree of compliance with national accounting and auditing
standards.

The overview of the financial system—particularly the banking sector—intended to determine
its soundness and liquidity, as well as its capability to originate and manage credit effectively,
could cover the capital adequacy and liquidity profile of the main financial intermediaries, and the
main products and services offered to SMEs. The review could also record the track record of
lenders, especially in the SME segment, in the size of their aggregate portfolio, asset quality, and
profitability.

     III. CRITERIA FOR ASSESSING IMPLEMENTATION OF
     THE PRINCIPLES
     This section lists the assessment criteria for each of the 16 principles. The criteria appear under two
     separate headings: key issues and key questions. As mentioned previously, the key issues detail
     those elements that should be present to demonstrate implementation of the principles. The key
     questions are intended to guide the use of the methodology in how the key issues are addressed.

     The Appendix provides a template for conducting comparable and consistent assessments of the
     state of implementation of the principles in individual countries and for individual CGSs.

     Legal and Regulatory Framework
     Principle 1: The CGS should be established as an independent legal entity on the
     basis of a sound and clearly defined legal and regulatory framework to support the
     effective implementation of the CGS’s operations and the achievement of its policy
     objectives.

     KEY ISSUES
     1.	 The legal and regulatory framework of the CGS should have its basis in appropriate and
         specific legislation, such as a law or decree.
     2.	 The CGS should be established as an independent legal entity and should have legal personality.
     3.	 The legal and regulatory framework of the CGS should clarify the ownership policy of the
         government, including who is responsible and accountable for representing the government.
     4.	 The legal and regulatory framework should specify which government body is charged with
         supervising the CGS.
     5.	 The legal and regulatory framework of the CGS should define the relationship between the
         government-as-shareholder and the CGS’s board and management—separating control from
         oversight—and should give independence and autonomy to both the board and management.
     6.	 The legal and regulatory framework should indicate the CGS’s sources of funding.
     7.	 A CGS operated through a development finance institution should be financially and
         operationally independent.

     KEY QUESTIONS
     1.	 Is the CGS established by law, decree, or other relevant source of primary legislation?
     2.	 Is the CGS established as an independent legal entity with legal personality?
     3.	 Does the legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS indicate which ownership entity
         (ministry, agency, and so forth) is responsible and accountable for representing the government?
     4.	 Does the legal and regulatory framework indicate which government body is charged with
         supervising the CGS?
     5.	 In the legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS,
         5.1.	 Is the separation between government control and oversight and supervision explicitly
               and clearly specified?
         5.2.	 Are the CGS’s board and management explicitly given sufficient independence and autonomy?


28 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
6.	 Does the legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS indicate its sources of funding?
7.	 If the CGS is operated as a part of a government-owned development finance institution,
    7.1.	 Does the CGS have financial autonomy in the form of a separate budget and capital?
    7.2.	 Does the CGS have operational autonomy in the form of a dedicated governance body,
          management, and staff?
    7.3.	 Does the CGS have a specific operational framework that differs from the rest of the
          development finance institution’s business activities?

Principle 2: The CGS should have adequate funding to achieve its policy objectives,
and the sources of funding, including any reliance on explicit and implicit subsidies,
should be transparent and publicly disclosed.

KEY ISSUES
1.	 The CGS should have adequate capital and government financial support to ensure effective
    implementation of CGS operations in line with policy objectives set by the government.
2.	 The rules, procedures, or arrangements that determine the responsibilities of the ownership
    entity for providing the CGS’s initial capital—as well as any commitment to provide additional
    capital or subsidies during the course of operations—should be clear and publicly disclosed.
3.	 The CGS should be primarily funded by equity endowments, which can be complemented
    by long-term concessionary loans either from government sources or from multilateral and
    bilateral institutions. The CGS should not borrow from public or private debt markets.
4.	 Limits on budget appropriations, subsidies, and government guarantees should be spelled out
    in the appropriate legislation.
5.	 The CGS should have minimum capital adequacy standards specified in its legal and regulatory
    framework.
6.	 Funding use and existing limits should be periodically reviewed and revised, as appropriate,
    under a fully transparent process, and they should be audited by a supreme audit institution or
    by any other mandated institution.

KEY QUESTIONS
1.	 Does the CGS have sufficient capital and other government financial support to fulfill the
    CGS’s policy mandate in a financially sustainable way?
2.	 Are the rules, procedures, or arrangements determining the contribution of the CGS’s initial
    capital and other financial commitments, including subsidies, clear and publicly disclosed?
3.	 Is the CGS primarily funded through equity endowments with no recourse to borrowing from
    public or private debt markets?
4.	 Is the CGS subject to minimum capital adequacy standards established by the chartering
    legislation or regulation?
5.	 Are limits on budget appropriations, subsidies, and government guarantees clearly indicated
    in the appropriate legislation, and are they consistent with the fiscal resources provided in the
    government accounts?
6.	 Are funding use and existing limits on budget appropriations, subsidies, and government
    guarantees reviewed periodically and audited by a supreme audit institution or by any other
    mandated institution in line with the country laws?

     Principle 3: The legal and regulatory framework should promote mixed ownership
     of the CGS, ensuring equitable treatment of minority shareholders.

     KEY ISSUES
     1.	 The legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS should encourage voluntary private
         sector minority participation in the CGS’s capital.
     2.	 Lenders and SMEs should, in particular, be encouraged to participate in the CGS’s capital.
     3.	 The legal and regulatory framework should assign clear responsibility for protecting the basic
         rights of minority shareholders.
     4.	 The legal and regulatory framework should promote active shareholder participation in the
         governance and decisions of the CGS, for example, through direct involvement in the nomination
         or appointment of a representative(s) to the CGS board.

     KEY QUESTIONS
     1.	 Does the legal and regulatory framework promote voluntary minority private sector
         participation in the ownership of the CGS?
     2.	 Does the CGS have lenders or SMEs among its minority shareholders?
     3.	 Are the basic rights of minority shareholders clearly acknowledged and protected in the legal
         and regulatory framework?
     4.	 Do minority shareholders actively participate in the governance and decisions of the CGS?

     Principle 4: The CGS should be independently and effectively supervised on the basis
     of risk-proportionate regulation scaled by the products and services offered.

     KEY ISSUES
     1.	 The legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS should delineate supervisory
         accountabilities separate from its ownership and management.
     2.	 The supervisor should be given clear responsibilities and objectives under the legal and
         regulatory framework.
     3.	 Supervisory powers should be vested in one entity, typically the financial sector supervisor.
     4.	 The supervisor should have both legal authority and means to enforce prudential standards
         and to secure corrective measures when necessary, including the power to formally raise
         objections and seek administrative injunctions of inadmissible activities (should such activities
         be identified).
     5.	 The supervisor should have adequate funding, and the culture of prudential supervision should
         be consistent with the supervisory culture of commercial financial institutions.
     6.	 Supervision should be calibrated according to the nature and risks of the products and
         services provided by the CGS.
     7.	 The legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS should set minimum capital
         adequacy standards for the CGS.
     8.	 The supervisor should have, at minimum, the following responsibilities:
         8.1. Determining that the CGS has a sound corporate governance framework in line with
              international best practices.
         8.2. Determining that the CGS has appropriate risk management strategies, policies,
              processes, and limits.


30 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
    8.3. Determining that the CGS has an internal process for assessing its overall capital
         adequacy in relation to its risk profile.
    8.4. Taking necessary measures should the CGS fall below the minimum capital ratio.
    8.5. Determining that the CGS has adequate policies and processes for identifying, classifying,
         provisioning, and managing problem assets.
    8.6. Evaluating and restricting policy-related activities to those explicitly listed in chartering
         legislation and fiscal budgets.

KEY QUESTIONS
1.	 Does the legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS assign supervisory
    accountabilities separate from ownership and management?
2.	 Is the supervisor given clear responsibilities and objectives?
3.	 Does the supervisor have the legal means to enforce prudential standards and to secure
    corrective measures when necessary, including formally raising objections and seeking
    administrative injunctions of inadmissible activities?
4.	 Is the financial sector supervisor vested with supervisory powers?
5.	 Does the supervisor have both adequate funding and capacity to carry out supervisory
    functions?
6.	 Is supervision according to the nature and risks of the products and services provided by the
    CGS?
7.	 Does the legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS include minimum capital
    requirements for the CGS?
8.	 Is the supervisor empowered with the following:
    8.1. Determining that the CGS has a sound corporate governance framework in line with
         international best practices?
    8.2. Determining that the CGS has appropriate risk management strategies, policies,
         processes, and limits?
    8.3. Determining that the CGS has an internal process for assessing its overall capital
         adequacy in relation to its risk profile?
    8.4. Taking necessary measures should the CGS fall below the minimum capital ratio?
    8.5. Determining that the CGS has adequate policies and processes for identifying, classifying,
         provisioning, and managing problem assets?
    8.6. Ensuring that the CGS performs only those activities that are explicitly listed in chartering
         legislation and fiscal budgets?

     Corporate Governance and Risk Management
     Principle 5: The CGS should have a clearly defined mandate supported by strategies
     and operational goals consistent with policy objectives.

     KEY ISSUES
     1.	 The legislation establishing the CGS should explicitly state a clear mandate for the CGS.
     2.	 The CGS’s mandate should encompass, at minimum, the target SMEs and the CGS’s main
         line(s) of business.
     3.	 There should be an explicitly defined and transparent procedure for periodically reviewing the
         mandate in order to assess its continuing relevance.
     4.	 In line with its mandate and according to clearly defined policies and processes, the CGS
         should develop tailored strategies and specific programs for its SME target sectors and
         groups.
     5.	 The CGS’s strategies should include specific and measurable operational goals to ensure that
         the CGS performs well and is financially sustainable.

     KEY QUESTIONS
     1.	 Does the law or decree establishing the CGS include a clear and explicit mandate for the CGS?
     2.	 Does the CGS’s mandate specify, at minimum, the target SMEs and the CGS’s main line(s) of
         business?
     3.	 Is there an explicit and transparent mechanism included in the legal and regulatory framework
         for periodically assessing the relevance of the CGS’s mandate?
     4.	 Does the CGS have clear strategies tailored to and specific programs for its target sectors and
         groups?
     5.	 Does the CGS have specific and measurable operational goals associated with those
         strategies?

     Principle 6: The CGS should have a sound corporate governance structure with
     an independent and competent board of directors appointed according to clearly
     defined criteria.

     KEY ISSUES
     1.	 The legal and regulatory framework, charter, or other constitutive document should delineate
         the corporate governance framework for the CGS, ensuring appropriate division of roles and
         responsibilities among the government or ownership entity, the supervisor, the board, and the
         management of the CGS.
     2.	 The legal and regulatory framework of the CGS should explicitly spell out a structured and
         transparent board appointment process.
     3.	 There should be a clear policy that sets minimum competency standards for board members.
     4.	 Board members should serve a fixed term and should act in the best interest of the CGS
         without any conflicts of interest.
     5.	 The board should include an independent and unaffiliated member(s) from the private sector.




32 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
KEY QUESTIONS

    appropriate constitutive documents?
2.	 Does the legal and regulatory framework establishing the CGS include a clear and transparent
    board appointment process?
3.	 Is there a policy specifying minimum criteria to ensure that CGS board members are
    technically capable and act independently?
4.	 Are CGS board members serving a fixed term?
5.	 Does the CGS board include an independent and unaffiliated member(s) from the private
    sector?

Principle 7: The CGS should have a sound internal control framework to safeguard
the integrity and efficiency of its governance and operations.

KEY ISSUES
1.	 The CGS management should establish a strong system of internal controls to ensure that
    business processes and other activities are conducted consistently with the CGS’s governance
    structure.
2.	 Either the board or any relevant board committee should periodically review the internal
    controls established by management.
3.	 The CGS should have an internal audit and compliance function.
4.	 The internal audit and compliance function should report to the board or to the relevant board
    committee.
5.	 The internal audit and compliance function should be able to carry out ad hoc investigations at
    the request of the board or of relevant board committee.
6.	 The internal audit and compliance function should have the necessary power to ensure that
    issues raised in investigations will be addressed and, if needed, escalated either to the board
    or to relevant board committee.

KEY QUESTIONS
1.	 Does the CGS have a system of internal controls?
2.	 Is the system of internal controls established by the management periodically reviewed by the
    board or the appropriate board committee?
3.	 Does the CGS have an internal audit and compliance function?
4.	 Does the internal audit and compliance function report to the board or to the appropriate board
    committee?
5.	 Is the internal audit and compliance function empowered to conduct investigations at the
    request of the board or of the relevant board committee?
6.	 Does the internal audit and compliance function have the necessary power to ensure that any
    issue raised during investigations will be formally addressed?

     Principle 8: The CGS should have an effective and comprehensive enterprise risk
     management framework that identifies, assesses, and manages the risks related to
     CGS operations.

     KEY ISSUES
     1.	 The CGS should adopt a sound enterprise risk management framework as part of its internal
         controls.
     2.	 The board should approve the enterprise risk management framework, which should be
         periodically reviewed to assess its continuing relevance.
     3.	 Ideally, the CGS should adopt a system to identify environmental, social, and corporate
         governance risks associated with its guarantee business.

     Credit risk
     4.	 The CGS should adopt a comprehensive credit risk management framework based on
         quantitative and qualitative techniques.
     5.	 The CGSs’ credit risk management framework should establish and enforce a set of relevant
         exposure limits (by subsector, geographical area, and so on).
     6.	 The CGS should use any appropriate credit risk mitigation technique available, such as counter-
         guarantees, to manage concentration risk.
     7.	 The CGS should adopt sound guarantee evaluation policies and practices.

     Liquidity and market risk
     8.	 The CGS should have a sound liquidity and market risk management framework to ensure that
          it is able to meet claims and to hedge against adverse movements in market prices.
     9.	 The liquidity and market risk management framework should include proper governance
          arrangements, management information systems, analysis of liquidity requirements, and
          contingency planning.
     10.	 The CGS should have a transparent investment policy that defines permissible asset classes
          and provides guidance on concentration risk through individual exposures, the liquidity profile,
          and sectoral and geographical concentration.

     Operational risk
     11.	 The CGS should adopt an operational risk management framework that clearly identifies lines
          of responsibility, segregation of duties, and reliable control mechanisms.
     12.	 The CGS should have established codes of conduct and recruitment policies that ensure
          professional and ethical staff behavior.
     The CGS should develop a business resumption or continuity plan to ensure that
     the CGS can continue operations in case of a technology breakdown or natural
     disaster.

     Operational Framework
     Principle 9: The CGS should adopt clearly defined and transparent eligibility and
     qualification criteria for SMEs, lenders, and credit instruments.

     KEY ISSUES
     1.	 The CGS should adopt clear eligibility criteria for target SMEs to guide the CGS’s operations in
         line with its mandate.
     2.	 The eligibility criteria should be publicly communicated.
     3.	 The eligibility criteria should be periodically reviewed.
     4.	 The CGS should adopt qualification rules for partner lenders on the basis of objective criteria.
     5.	 The CGS should clarify the type of credit instrument targeted—that is, investment finance and/
         or working capital finance.
     6.	 The CGS should provide guarantees for both working capital and investment finance.
     7.	 The CGS should cover the principal loan amount of the underlying credit instrument and, to a
         limited extent, the unpaid interest.

     KEY QUESTIONS
     1.	 Does the CGS have clear eligibility criteria for target SMEs?
     2.	 Are eligibility criteria for target SMEs publicly communicated?
     3.	 Are eligibility criteria for target SMEs periodically reviewed to ascertain their relevance?
     4.	 Has the CGS adopted qualification rules for partner lenders on the basis of objective criteria?
     5.	 Is the credit instrument targeted by the CGS—that is, investment finance and/or working
         capital finance—clearly specified in the appropriate policy and legal documents?
     6.	 Does the CGS extend guarantees for both working capital and investment finance?
     7.	 Does the guarantee issued by the CGS cover the principal loan amount of the underlying credit
         instrument and part of the unpaid interest?

     Principle 10: The CGS’s guarantee delivery approach should appropriately reflect a
     trade-off between outreach, additionality, and financial sustainability, taking into
     account the level of financial sector development of the country.

     KEY ISSUES
     1.	 The selection of the delivery approach should involve an analysis of the trade-off between
         outreach, additionality, and financial sustainability.
     2.	 The individual approach is generally preferable for relatively large loans or when the
         guarantee is to be used for supporting a specific project submitted by the SME borrower.
     3.	 The portfolio approach is generally preferable for relatively small loans or when a certain type
         of SME—for example, early-stage SMEs or those owned by women—is to be promoted,
         regardless of the specific project presented.
     4.	 In countries where market failures and imperfections in SME credit markets are pervasive
         and the financial sector is either unable or unwilling to engage with SME borrowers on a large
         scale, the focus should be on the individual approach.




36 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
KEY QUESTIONS
1.	 Does the choice of the CGS’s delivery approach take into account the CGS’s policy objectives
    in outreach, additionality, and financial sustainability?
2.	 Is the individual approach adopted for relatively large loans or when there is emphasis on a
    specific project submitted by the SME borrower?
3.	 Is the portfolio approach adopted for relatively small loans or when there is emphasis on
    promoting a certain type of SME?
4.	 Is the individual approach justified by the pervasiveness of market failures and imperfections or
    by the relatively low degree of sophistication of the financial sector?

Principle 11: The guarantees issued by the CGS should be partial, thus providing the
right incentives for SME borrowers and lenders, and should be designed to ensure
compliance with the relevant prudential requirements for lenders, in particular with
capital requirements for credit risk.

KEY ISSUES
1.	 The guarantee coverage ratio should not be lower than 50 percent, which allows for
    appropriate risk sharing among the CGS, the lender, and the SME borrower.
2.	 The guarantee coverage ratio should be clearly indicated in contractual agreements between
    the CGS and the lender.
3.	 Contractual agreements between the CGS and the lender should clarify whether loan losses are
    shared pari passu between the CGS and the lender or whether the CGS covers the first loss.
4.	 The guarantee coverage ratio should depend on the SME target sectors and groups (for
    example, higher coverage may be granted to SMEs operating in sectors with higher potential
    for job creation or preservation or to early-stage firms).
5.	 The guarantee coverage ratio should be a function of the delivery approach employed by the
    CGS, with the guarantee coverage ratio lower under the portfolio approach than under the
    individual approach.
6.	 The CGS should be able to adjust its guarantee coverage ratio to reflect the CGS’s credit loss
    history and external market developments.
7.	 The guarantee extended by the CGS should include terms and conditions that are clearly
    specified in contractual agreements with the lender. These terms and conditions should
    comply with relevant prudential regulation of credit risk mitigation techniques, as they are
    applicable to the lender, so as to provide capital relief to the lender.
8.	 The guarantee issued by the CGS should comply with prudential rules for loan loss
    classification and with loan loss provisioning requirements for collateralized assets, as they are
    applicable to the lender.

         the riskiness of the guarantee provided?
     2.	 Is the CGS’s pricing policy transparent and clearly specified in the relevant operational
         documents?
     3.	 Is fee amount sufficient to ensure the financial sustainability of the CGS while also attracting
         the interest of both SMEs and lenders?
     4.	 Are fees levied on the loan amount guaranteed?
     5.	 Is the pricing policy flexible enough to allow the CGS to adjust its fees on the basis of its credit
         loss history and market developments?

     Appendix: Template for Assessing
     Implementation of the Principles
     This section presents guidance and a format for the organization and methodology of the assessment
     reports, which the task force recommends for use by assessors in diagnostic work, including country
     self-assessments. The assessment report should be divided into six sections: (a) a general section
     providing background information; (b) the information and methodology adopted; (c) an analysis of
     preconditions for effective design, implementation, and evaluation of public CGSs; (d) a detailed
     principle-by-principle assessment; (e) a recommended action plan; and (f) authorities’ responses and
     comments.

     The following paragraphs provide a brief description of each of the six sections.



     BACKGROUND INFORMATION
     This is a general section that describes the CGS being assessed and the context in which the
     assessment is conducted. This section should include the names and qualifications of the
     assessors.



     INFORMATION AND METHODOLOGY
     This section should mention any self-assessments conducted by the authorities before the
     assessment along with any questionnaire filled out by the authorities in preparation for the
     assessment. The section should also mention relevant laws, regulations, and other documentation
     such as reports, studies, public statements, websites, and directives used for the assessment.
     In addition, this section should identify counterparty authorities and should mention (in generic
     terms) the CGS officials with whom interviews were held; other relevant government authorities;
     private sector counterparties; and industry associations (such as bankers’ associations, auditors,
     and accountants). Last, this section should mention factors that impeded or facilitated the
     assessment—in particular, information gaps—along with an indication of the extent to which these
     factors may have affected the assessment.




42 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
ANALYSIS OF THE PRECONDITIONS
This section should provide an overview of the preconditions for effective design, implementation,
and evaluation of public CGSs as described in this document as follows:
•	 A system of business laws, including corporate, bankruptcy, contract, collateral, consumer
   protection, and private property laws, that provides an acceptable degree of enforcement and a
   mechanism for the fair resolution of disputes
•	 A sufficiently independent and efficient judiciary
•	 A comprehensive and well-defined set of accounting standards and rules, and reasonably well-
   regulated legal, accounting, and auditing professions
•	 A sound and liquid financial system able to originate and manage credit effectively

Assessors should pay particular attention to the adequacy of the preconditions. This section requires a
succinct and well-structured factual review of the preconditions; experience has shown that insufficient
implementation of the preconditions can seriously undermine the CGS’s efficiency and effectiveness.
The review of the preconditions should strictly follow the bulleted categories indicated above and
should provide the information necessary to provide the reader with a clear idea of the assessment.

The assessment of implementation of individual principles should flag those principles likely to
be affected by weak preconditions. However, assessors should not undertake assessment of the
preconditions themselves, as this is beyond the scope of the assessment. A typical review should
devote no more than one or two paragraphs to each type of precondition. The review should rely as
much as possible on available assessments and indicators to reduce excessive discretion.



PRINCIPLE-BY-PRINCIPLE ASSESSMENT
This section should provide a description of the CGS with regard to a particular principle, along with
comments discussing the level of principle implementation. The assessment should be prepared
according to the simple format that follows. In cases in which the authorities or the CGS are
preparing either a self-assessment or an “expert-assisted” self-assessment, they should use the
same template.




                                                   Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs | 43
     The template for the detailed assessment is structured as follows:


       Principle (x) (repeating principle text)
       Description
       Comments
       Principle (y) (repeating principle text)
       Description
       Comments


     The “description” section of the template should provide observations of the practice as observed
     in the CGS undergoing assessment. Observations should cite the relevant laws, regulations,
     operational manuals, and so forth, insofar as it is possible. The description should be structured
     as follows: (a) laws and supporting regulations, (b) operational manuals and other internal
     documentation, (c) institutional capacity of the CGS, and (d) evidence or lack of implementation.
     The description should also highlight when and why assessment of a particular key issue could not
     be adequately performed (for example, if certain information was not provided or key individuals
     were unavailable to discuss important issues). If any portion of the key issue is irrelevant or not
     applicable to the CGS being assessed, this should also be highlighted.
     The “comments” section should be used to refine and explain the answers given to the key
     questions in the context of the specific principle. These comments should be structured as follows:
     (a) the state of the laws and regulations and their implementation; (b) the state of the operational
     manuals and other internal documentation; (c) the state of the institutional capacity of the CGS, with
     particular attention given to organizational setup, staffing, information technology systems, and so
     forth; and (d) implementation practices.



     RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN
     Because preconditions are not part of the principles, the assessment should not contain
     recommendations with regard to the preconditions. However, the assessor may point out where
     weaknesses in the preconditions are likely to hamper effective implementation of the principles.
     This section should list the suggested steps for improving implementation of the principles.
     Recommendations should be specific in nature and proposed in the order of priority in every case
     of deficiency. An explanation could also be provided as to how the recommended action would
     lead to improving the level of implementation. The institutional responsibility for each suggested
     action should also be clearly indicated in order to prevent overlap or confusion. Only those
     principles with specific recommendations should be presented.




44 | Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for SMEs
The template for the recommended action plan is as follows:


 Recommended Action Plan to Improve Implementation of the Principles
 Reference principle                  Recommended action
 Principle (x)                        Description of deficiency; suggested improvement
 Principle (y)                        Description of deficiency; suggested improvement




AUTHORITIES’ RESPONSES AND COMMENTS
The assessor should provide the authorities and the CGS undergoing assessment with an
opportunity to respond to the assessment findings. This would include providing the authorities and
the CGS with a full written draft of the assessment. Any differences of opinion on the assessment
results should be clearly identified and included in the report. Because the assessment allows for
greater dialogue among the parties involved, the assessment team should have had a number of
discussions with relevant stakeholders during the assessment, so that the report might reflect
the comments, concerns, and factual corrections of the authorities and the CGS. Last, the CGS
should prepare a concise written response to the assessment findings. The assessment should
not, however, become the object of negotiations, and assessors and authorities should be willing to
“agree to disagree,” provided the authorities’ views are represented fairly and accurately.
