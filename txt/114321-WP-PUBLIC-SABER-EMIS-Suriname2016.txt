    1. Enabling Environment
       Suriname has begun the process of building and institutionalizing an EMIS. The Ministry
       of Education, Culture and Science (MINOWC) lacks a comprehensive legal framework,
       strategy and policy to drive the process and management of an EMIS. The absence of
       these has resulted in a lack of commitment towards devoting resources, including human
       resources and budget, towards developing EMIS as the core Ministry system. This has
       threatened the long-term viability of the system. In addition, the lack of policies hamper
       efforts to streamline coordination and sharing of data within the ministry.

    2. System Soundness
       The current EMIS is a SQLServer based software solution hosted by an outside vendor.
       The system captures administrative data, including demographic data on schools and
       teachers. Paper-based annual census forms are used to collect data from schools, which
       are manually entered into the EMIS system at central level. Trust within the government in
       the quality of data is low. However, a new School Information Management System is
       being introduced that has the potential to address a number of the challenges that existed
       in the legacy OIS system, particularly in the areas of data architecture and data analytics.
       This process of implementing this system is in its nascent stage.

    3. Quality Data
       In Suriname, there are gaps in the methodological soundness underpinning the education
       data, the EMIS is not aligned with national datasets and there is an urgent need for
       standardization of processes, data codes, and metadata across agencies. Despite this,
       there are currently some practices underway to validate the accuracy and reliability of
       data, although further support is needed both in terms of automated technical validation,
       as well as manual validation efforts. The EMIS has had issues disseminating findings.
       The annual education statistics yearbook has not been produced since 2008, making it
       four years behind schedule and revealing major challenges with periodicity and
       timeliness.

    4. Utilization for Decision Making
       Currently, the EMIS data is primarily used for reporting indicators to UNESCO. The data
       is not being utilized by schools, nor is education data being used to drive the policy
       agenda within the government. EMIS utilization is limited and does not play a significant
       role in operational use. Finally, Suriname’s EMIS is currently not publicly disseminating
       education statistics via a website or a statistics yearbook.

Introduction
In 2011, the World Bank Group commenced a multiyear program designed to support countries in systematically
examining and strengthening the performance of their education systems. Part of the World Bank’s new Education
Sector Strategy, this evidence-based initiative, called SABER (Systems Approach for Better Education Results), uses
diagnostic tools for examining education systems and their component policy domains against global standards and best
practices and in comparison with the policies and practices of countries around the world. By leveraging this global
knowledge, the SABER tools fill a gap in the availability of data and evidence on what matters most to improve the quality
of education and achievement of better results.

This report discusses the results of applying the SABER–Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) tool in
Suriname. The objectives of this report are to examine the system according to key policy areas, identify successes and
challenges in the system, and provide recommendations to support the continued advancement of EMIS in Suriname.

Overview of SABER-EMIS
Information is a key ingredient in an effective education system. SABER–EMIS aims to help countries improve data
collection, data and system management, and data use in decision making. SABER-EMIS assesses the effectiveness of a
country’s EMIS, with the aim of informing policy dialogue and helping countries better manage education inputs and
processes to achieve overall efficiency and strong learning outcomes.

A successful EMIS is credible and operational in planning and policy dialogue, as well as teaching and learning. It
produces and monitors education statistics within an education system and has a multifaceted structure, comprising the
technological and institutional arrangements for collecting, processing, and disseminating data (Abdul-Hamid 2014). It is
crucial for tracking changes, ensuring data quality and timely reporting of information, and facilitating the utilization of
information in decision making.

                                                                           Source: Abdul-Hamid 2014
policy area is the context in which an EMIS exists. This defined
scope of an enabling environment builds on lessons learned from
studies of education management systems.

System soundness ensures key processes, structures and integration capabilities in an effective EMIS. Education data
are sourced from different institutions, but all data feed into and make up EMIS. Databases within an EMIS are not viewed
as separate databases, but as part of the whole EMIS. Key aspects of system soundness include what data are covered in
EMIS and how they come together in the overarching system.

Quality data establishes the mechanisms required to collect, save, produce, and utilize information in an accurate,
secure, and timely manner. Data quality is a multidimensional concept that encompasses more than just the underlying

Approach
Intent & Implementation
The EMIS assessment examines policy intent and the degree to which intended policies are effectively implemented on
the ground (figure 3). Intent refers to the way in which EMIS and its overarching purpose are articulated by decision makers
and documented in policies and legislation, as well as standards and strategy documents. Assessing intent alone only
reveals part of the picture.
                                                                         Figure 3: Policy Intent, Implementation and Outcomes Cycle,
                                                                         with Examples
As such, this EMIS assessment also evaluates policy execution.

intent and implementation are analyzed, the EMIS assessment
explores the results of these two key components, with a focus
on system effectiveness and efficiency, in addition to teaching

Methodology
The EMIS assessment methodology consists of a review of written policies and technical documents as well as interviews
with key stakeholders across the education system to ensure proper implementation.

Research and investigation for the Suriname EMIS assessment took place from March to June, 2015. The authors
conducted a comprehensive review of policies, as well as technical documents and other background materials. To further
examine policy intent and implementation, a series of interviews and meetings took place with the following entities:
   1. Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (MINOWC), including the Development Services Division, Education
       Inspection Division, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Unit, and other education divisions
   2. Bureau of Statistics
   3. Sample of schools

Country Overview
Suriname is an upper middle income country in northern South America. Suriname borders the North Atlantic Ocean,
French Guiana, Guyana and Brazil. One of South America’s smallest countries, 95 percent of Surname is covered in forest.

Suriname has a population of 538,200, 27 percent of which is between the ages of 0-14 (World Development Indicators,
2014). East Indians, Creoles, Javanese, Maroons and Amerindians make up the largest ethnic groups in the country, making
it one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world. Over 85 percent of the population lives in coastal districts,
primarily concentrated in the capital - Paramaribo (Bureau of Statistics, 2012). Although the interior makes up the majority
of the country, it is remote, sparsely populated, highly isolated and poorer than the rest of the country.

Suriname is divided into ten districts, each with a district commissioner. Each district is further divided into ressorts, of
which there are sixty-two in total. In Paramaribo, the ressorts are akin to neighborhoods, however in other districts the
resorts are more similar to municipalities.

Although Suriname has a GDP per capita of $16,637, the economy is facing significant challenges (World Development
Indicators, 2014). Heavily reliant on its mining industry, the economy is vulnerable to mineral price volatility. As a result,
Suriname’s annual economic growth dropped from 5.3 percent in 2011 to 1.8 percent in 2014.

Previous efforts to implement EMIS in Suriname have
encountered significant challenges. The Department of Research and Planning (formally the Department of Research
Planning and Monitoring) is responsible for the production of education statistics. From its inception in the 1970s until
2003, all data was collected and recorded by hand. In 2003, an EMIS referred to as OIS (Education Information System)
was introduced. According to an external evaluation of OIS (Luursma et al. 2009), the database was initially designed as
an Informix database on UNIX. MS SQL Server was later chosen with a client front-end written in Delphi 6. The transition
was managed by local firm, Business and Data Solutions (BDS). By the 2004/05 school year, education data was available
in OIS and the first education indicators and trends yearbook were published in the 2006/07 school year, with another in
2007/08; however, after that point yearbooks were not published. The Department of Research and Planning is in the final
stages of cleaning data from 2008 to 2014. An internal meeting in July will review progress and determine next steps with
regard to publishing the data.
Several fundamental issues blocked the effectiveness of OIS implementation. First and foremost, the implementation
was heavily focused on establishing the software, but failed to train and build capacity across MINOWC. This process of
building capacity and ensuring that the technology is understood and incorporated into MINOWC is referred to as
“institutionalizing” or “operationalizing” an EMIS. It is critical to the success of an EMIS because it ensures that:
x Users across MINOWC from teachers to high-level officials understand how to use the EMIS;
x The enabling environment (e.g., policies, standards, budget, etc.) is established to ensure integration across MINOWC
    and sustainability so that when the government changes, the EMIS will be easily continued by the next administration;
    and
x Communication about EMIS reaches across the education system so that everyone knows about the value, vision,
    strategy and objectives of the EMIS and how it contributes to quality education.
Second, due to the absence of effective institutionalization, government transitions took place and when new staff
joined MINOWC, there was no context or process for working with OIS. New staff in the Department of Research and
Planning lacked the information on OIS that was necessary to maintain momentum around collection, management and
utilization of education data. Further, a series of changes in high-level staff, including the Minister of Education and the
Permanent Secretary, led to shifts in the EMIS strategy and decisions to stop certain software and vendor agreements and
start new contracts elsewhere.
Third, the contract with Business Development Solutions (BDS) did not give full control of education data to the
Department of Research and Planning. Instead it effectively made BDS a gatekeeper that the department had to go
through anytime it wanted to make changes to existing data. The department can access the data, but cannot add variables
or make additional changes to the data.

Finally, the quality of data in OIS is poor. Due to the issues raised above as well as software limitations, OIS is not
effectively producing quality data. For example, duplicate records exist, and codes are not up to date with those of other
government agencies, causing major integration bottlenecks. As the data is not directly hosted by the Department of
Research and Planning, updating fields and codes or adding verification levels is difficult or not possible.

Prior attempts by donors to develop a well-functioning EMIS faced challenges. IDB’s Basic Education Improvement
Project is a multi-phase operation with two phases spanning an eight year period. The phase I (2004-12) investment
totaled US$ 13.7 million and the phase II (2012-16) investment is estimated at US$ 12 million. With regards to EMIS, the
program (part of phase II) aimed to finance: (i) a needs assessment to expand the EMIS at MINOWC and school levels; (ii)
the consolidation and linking of MINOWC personnel information; (iii) the establishment of a student performance tracking
system in at least 150 schools; (iv) an expansion of the physical infrastructure to house an EMIS data center; and (v) training
for at least 10 MINOWC staff and staff from the selected schools on using the EMIS (IDB Second Basic Education
Improvement Program Loan Proposal). The proposal stated that the Dutch Government, UNICEF and the Flemish
Association for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance (VVOB) would supportMINOWC in strengthening
EMIS, but ultimately the EMIS component of this project did not achieve its intended objectives and the proposal was not
fully realized. The Department of Research and Planning worked with UNICEF on a school mapping project, but has not
worked with UNICEF on activities specific to EMIS.

The Government of Suriname has prioritized EMIS, investing in the new system and engaging donors to support the
process. UNICEF and IDB also recognize the need for an effective EMIS. Due to resource and operational constraints,
neither IDB nor UNICEF are able to lead the advancement of EMIS in Suriname.

Currently, the Government of Suriname is in the process of deploying two new information systems. The Ministry of
Finance is implementing an off-the-shelf product by a Canadian software company, FreeBalance. The customized product
will launch this year and be used by the finance departments of all 17 ministries. The system will be fully integrated across
the government, and will also run according to the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology. MINOWC has also
invested in a new product, the School Information Management System (SIMS), a product designed by Milestone
Consulting & Solutions NV. Milestone is providing technical support for the roll-out of the product, which will take place
this year. SIMS is a web-based, customizable, modular framework that provides a central platform for the management
of educational activities and access to data. If deployed and used effectively, the system represents a major opportunity
to ease integration issues both within MINOWC and with external agencies.

Major barriers around coordination block MINOWC from effectively collecting, managing and using education data. This
challenge was communicated consistently across conversations with MINOWC departments. Based on the current
organizational structure, MINOWC has 36 units and 20 of those units collect data (Appendix D: MINOWC Education
Organizational Chart). It seems that many of these units have individual processes and systems for collecting, managing
and analyzing data. Tremendous gains on efficiency and spending would be made by streamlining siloed data management
processes. Additionally, improvements in communication and coordination between units would reduce redundancies. A
monthly internal MINOWC staff memo, or even an internal blog could help improve communication and coordination
between units.

With regard to data collection, several challenges exist ranging from regional and technical challenges, to coordination
issues. First, there are inconsistencies and gaps in reporting from the school level. Schools in the interior especially have
challenges reporting data. The current process that the Department of Research and Planning aims to follow has the
department receiving school data once per year in August, primarily in hard copy form, which is then manually inputted
into an excel table (figure 4). Quality checks and follow-up with schools that did not submit data takes place through
November. Between January and March the Department of Research and Planning conducts quality checks and sends a
CD with the final administrative data to the Central Bureau for Computerized Administration (CEBUMA).

Suriname EMIS Results
This section presents the main results of EMIS diagnostics described in the previous sections. Results and scores for each
policy goal are presented, along with supporting evidence.

Policy Area 1: Enabling Environment
Latent z|||
Suriname’s enabling environment was assessed in the following areas: (1) Legal Framework; (2) Organizational Structure
and Institutionalized Processes; (3) Human Resources; (4) Infrastructural Capacity; (5) Budget; and (6) Data-driven Culture.

Suriname’s EMIS lacks a comprehensive and explicit legal framework to drive the process and management of the
system. Policy gaps exist in a number of key areas:
    x The lack of a comprehensive and explicit EMIS strategy.
    x Policies do not clearly define roles and responsibilities.
    x Policies do not state budget needs.
    x Policies are not in place that set utilization or confidentiality requirements for education data.
    x Policies do not mandate technical requirements for the system.
    x Some data reporting requirements exist in reporting obligations and instructional standards, as well as subsidy
       agreements, but they do not appear comprehensive. For example, non-compliance penalties and the ability to
       implement such penalties are weak.

A good legal framework will strengthen EMIS sustainability by helping the flow of data continue amidst government
transitions. In Suriname, changes in administration have been an obstacle to EMIS in the past, and continue as a threat,
making the legal framework a priority for improvement.

SURINAME ǀ EMIS                                                                         SABER COUNTRY REPORT |2016

In Suriname, EMIS struggles in part due to a lack of institutionalization. The central system put in place with the external
vendor, Business and Data Solutions, does not effectively empower the Department of Research and Planning to manage,
process, adjust and disseminate data on a regular basis. Once up and running, SIMS certainly has the potential to fill this
gap. Currently, the Department of Research and Planning must go through the vendor to make changes to data, which
takes significant time. Further, the Department of Research and Planning has decided not to continue working with the
vendor, but a transition plan to migrate the data from the vendor’s server to a server controlled by the Department is a
lengthy process.

While the responsibility for collecting, processing, and disseminating education statistics is designated to the
Department of Research and Planning, the department is not able to fulfill the full scope of responsibilities at this time.
Lack of coordination and communication with other units within MINOWC creates redundancies and impedes efficient
progress. For example, schools currently send data to Inspection Bureaus and Research and Planning. In addition, due to
conflicting time frames in reporting needs, both the General Bureau of Statistics and O&P collect separate school census
data. Identifying one department as the primary collector of data may improve efficiency. The education system
specifically, and the government in general, would benefit significantly from a strategy on government data including a
law/policy that guides the processes and procedures for working with other government units.

There are no policies in place to streamline coordination and sharing of data, leading to major breakdowns and
inefficiencies within MINOWC, across the education system, and between MINOWC and other ministries and bureaus.
Duplication of efforts and lack of coordination create challenges that could be alleviated by clear data sharing procedures.
Schools currently report the same data to multiple departments at different times of the year. Some schools are more
willing to share data than others. A policy that mandates data reporting and provides guidance on coordination may
improve this process. Additionally, SIMS provides an opportunity to streamline these efforts with a single point of entry
through which schools input data once into an integrated and centralized system, where data is validated and then shared
with the appropriate stakeholders.

General improvements to MINOWC’s organizational structure and institutional processes will greatly enhance EMIS
functionality. For example, the ICT Department is leading the process of securing and implementing the new system;
however, the Department of Policy and Planning, one of the primary users of the new system, does not receive consistent
communication and updates on the new system. Robust processes and better communication between departments will
contribute to the effective rollout of the new system. There appears to be an assumption that once schools input data
into the system, data will be validated by the various Inspection Bureaus; however, these Bureaus have not been
consulted. Further, much of the data validation process is currently taking place with the Department of Research and
Planning. Identifying the department responsible for validating data submitted into the new system, and defining this
process is absolutely essential. If this does not happen, the quality of data in the system will be poor, and effective
utilization will be significantly blocked, if not impossible.

Currently EMIS in Suriname is struggling due to a significant lack of human resources and opportunities for capacity
development. While there are talented staff across MINOWC, lack of complete staffing (Appendix E: Research & Planning
Organizational Chart with Current Staffing Numbers), as well as limited professional development opportunities pose
formidable challenges to the long-term success of EMIS and should be remedied. Further, staffing guidelines produced by
the Ministry of Internal Affairs block the Department of Research and Planning from hiring ICT staff and data analysts that
are essential to the department’s core work. The core team currently at the Department of Research and Planning is strong
and continues to do great work, powered by a sound guiding vision, yet the team is eager to add technical specialists to
support them in reaching this vision. An effective EMIS is powered by qualified staff who operate the system and have
access to multiple opportunities to improve their performance, and remain current with the latest technology and best
practices.

Data supply in Suriname could be improved by establishing a clear data reporting policy and by linking incentives to
compliance with data reporting procedures. According to the Legal Affairs Department of MINOWC, because public

SURINAME ǀ EMIS                                                                         SABER COUNTRY REPORT |2016

schools hierarchically are under MINOWC, neither agreements nor legislation exist to mandate schools to submit data.
Instead, requirements for public schools to submit data fall under regular reporting obligations as defined in instructional
standards. Data supply is an essential consideration for any EMIS because it ensures the gathering of data at the school-
level. In many countries this is done through an annual school census. Explicit policies that mandate data supply and link
to a national EMIS policy and strategy help make data supply occur in a smooth and consistent manner.

Policy Area 2: System Soundness
Emerging zz||
Suriname’s EMIS soundness was assessed in five critical areas: (1) Data Architecture; (2) Data Coverage; (3) Data Analytics;
(4) Dynamic System; and (5) Serviceability.

Significant challenges existed in the legacy OIS system, especially in the areas of data architecture and data analytics;
however, the new system, SIMS, has been identified, is being customized, and has the potential to advance EMIS in
Suriname to a new level. As SIMS is customized and deployed, it will be important to consider data architecture from the
perspective of the overarching system and what it intends to produce. Constructing a well-defined wireframe to inform
the architecture, using a table of specifications to guide the structure of databases, and ensuring mechanisms to bring
data from different sources together are important considerations for the system. As highlighted in the EMIS Background
section, the legacy OIS system was limited. It focused more on establishing the technological architecture, but failed to
build capacity for utilization. The new system should offer the appropriate departments with direct access to data and the
ability to run data analysis, tabulations, associations, correlations, projections, and to make changes to variables, create
new indicators, etc. With these pathways in place, the project should also include ongoing utilization training.

Currently, MINOWC’s data coverage is limited to administrative data. Minimal administrative data is collected via the
annual survey circulated by the Department of Research and Planning, which is delivered in hard copy and then manually
inputted into the system. According to the Department of Research and Planning, EMIS currently includes data from
primary and secondary schools (including religious schools), though there is little data from upper secondary. Minimal
data from tertiary education and private schools is collected by the Department of Research and Planning, though efforts
are underway to begin collecting more tertiary data. In addition to MINOWC’s data collection, the GBS independently
collects administrative data from schools, collected primarily through phone calls, although in some cases the Bureau
receives data in the form of excel tables. The GBS also collects data from tertiary schools, including the number of part
and fulltime students, enrollment rates by degree program and the number of teachers.

Data and statistics have mostly not been analyzed and disseminated since 2008. However, the Department of Research
and Planning does track a small scope of indicators (mostly to report to UNESCO). This is a good first step, but more work
needs to be done to expand this list and train the Department accordingly. Most of the current indicators track internal,
not external, efficiency (such as learning outcomes). Indicators should also examine regional educational variation. In
addition, the data behind the indicators needs to be verified to ensure quality. The Department currently tracks the
indicators listed in box 1.

Efforts are underway to establish a unique student identifier. Unique student IDs provide the ability to identify students,
track their movement and progress in the school system, and collect and report student-level data. This is a strong step
forward for EMIS in Suriname. In designing the unique student ID system, ensuring student confidentiality and data
security is key. The unique ID should not just be a number that MINOWC uses, but instead a tool that other ministries use
as well. To do this effectively and securely, collaboration with other ministries will allow MINOWC to gather a variety of
information such as birth registration or certificate, birth date, or other unique IDs. A good student ID system will take
combinations of identifiable data and encrypt it, giving each student a unique and unidentifiable ID that will follow them
through their academic career. Identifying and training a responsible entity to manage, make changes and update IDs will
also streamline the process. Considering unique IDs for teachers and even courses is another step that enables EMIS to
better analyze the quality and efficiency of the education system.

The new EMIS is expected to include a learning management system (LMS), transport data, a financial module, teacher
administration data, and an assessment module. A good practice for data coverage includes collection of administrative
(student & school), financial, human resources, and learning outcomes data (table 3). While the new system does not
need to include all types of data from the onset, designing the system such that greater data coverage can be added in

Challenges with regard to validity, integration of data, and archived data inhibit serviceability of the system. Databases
are not integrated and there are silos at different levels of the education system, which limit evidence-based decision
making. Data is archived in the legacy system and is difficult to access because the vendor acts as a gatekeeper, often
blocking the Department of Research and Planning from the data, or taking weeks to respond. Overcoming these
challenges will move Suriname much closer to an effective EMIS, and also carry positive outcomes for the overall
management and efficiency of the education system. Regular maintenance procedures that monitor the quality of EMIS
(such as fixing system bugs and upgrading software) are also essential.

Policy Area 3: Quality Data                                         Source: Abdul-Hamid 2014


Latent z|||
The quality of data captured by Suriname’s EMIS was assessed in four areas: (1) Methodological Soundness; (2) Accuracy
and Reliability; (3) Integrity; and (4) Periodicity and Timeliness.

In Suriname, there are currently gaps in methodological soundness, EMIS is not aligned with national datasets and there
is an urgent need for standardization of processes, data codes, and metadata across agencies. For example, the General
Bureau of Statistics should be able to access current, accurate data from the Department of Research and Planning. Every
month the GBS receives data from MINOWC. However due to difficulties in ensuring high response rates from schools to
the Department of Research and Planning’s annual school survey, the GBS has begun conducting its own data collection
as well. This is evidence of a breakdown in EMIS. When multiple entities are collecting the same data, problems emerge
that stem from having more than one official source of data and variation in data collection, validation and management.
Further, it puts added pressure on schools, which are reporting the same data to multiple entities. GBS also follows
international standards in data coding, which allows for integration and data sharing. Codes should follow common
standards and consistent training and support materials should be provided to ensure that agreed upon standards are
understood and followed. Methodological soundness is a fundamental part of quality data because it provides the basis
for producing educational statistics from raw data, generally based upon internationally accepted standards, guidelines,
and good practices. In developing the new system, establishing strong methodological soundness is a priority, as problems
in this area can carry highly problematic repercussions across other parts of the system.

In Suriname, there are currently some practices underway to validate the accuracy and reliability of data, though further
support is needed both in terms of automated technical validation, as well as manual validation efforts. Automated
procedures to cross-check data do not exist, instead validation is conducted through follow-up phone calls, which is time
consuming and inefficient. Throughout meetings, numerous remarks were made about challenges associated with
inaccurate and unreliable data. Accuracy and reliability is achieved when source data and statistical techniques are sound,
and statistical outputs sufficiently portray reality. This is not yet a reality in Suriname, though pieces of this validation
process are underway, and the launch of the new system is a key turning point, with potential to make the necessary
adjustments to improve data accuracy and reliability.

SURINAME ǀ EMIS                                                                          SABER COUNTRY REPORT |2016

EMIS has not been able to produce the annual education statistics yearbook since 2008, making it four years behind
schedule and revealing major challenges with periodicity and timeliness. Currently there is not an efficient way to
produce timely reports. Data is collected, but not analyzed or disseminated.

With regard to statistical techniques, the Department of Research and Planning needs training on areas such as
techniques used to validate data accuracy, as well as calculating a wider variety of relevant indicators (in addition to
those listed above). The Department of Research and Planning requested capacity building support in both quantitative
and qualitative analysis, good practices in research and planning, as well as excel and SPSS, databases, Microsoft Project,
and other ICT-related topics. The General Bureau of Statistics also voiced interest in similar trainings, and highlighted that
collaborative training sessions across data collecting agencies would not only increase capacity, but also build alignment
and integration between units. The Department has three sections, research, planning and monitoring; however, both
planning and monitoring are currently not staffed. For the new system to be effective, these positions must be filled and
training in statistical techniques, as well as the other areas mentioned, must be prioritized.

Policy Area 4: Utilization for Decision Making
Latent z|||
The utilization of Suriname’s EMIS was assessed by examining four areas: (1) openness; (2) operational use; (3)
accessibility; and (4) effectiveness in disseminating findings.

In Suriname, EMIS utilization is limited and does not play a significant role in operational use. A significant portion of
time is committed to data collection and validation, which is conducted manually with little automated support from the
system. Once in the system and validated, data is not analyzed strategically nor is it utilized to achieve learning outcomes.

Suriname’s EMIS is not currently disseminating education statistics via a website or the statistics yearbook. As previously
described, between 2009 and 2013, data was collected, analyzed and is in the final stages of being validated and cleaned,
but there has been no public dissemination of data. Moving forward, efforts to disseminate data (especially circulating it
back to schools), consider new platforms for utilization, publish simple comprehensible data, and support capacity of EMIS
users are important steps to strengthen the accessibility of EMIS in Suriname. Education statistics should be presented in
an understandable manner and widely disseminated using simple platforms for utilization, complemented by user
support. Dissemination of education statistics should be strategic and effective. To achieve effectiveness in disseminating
findings/results, a dissemination strategy should be developed along with measurable objectives. As the new SIMS
platform takes root in Suriname, a dissemination strategy and measures of effectiveness should be put into practice.

EMIS in Suriname is not open to education stakeholders. Openness is a central part of utilization and is demonstrated by
a system that is accessible to education stakeholders, in terms of both their awareness of the system, and their capacity
to use the system. When openness is achieved, stakeholders can use the system in accordance with the legal framework,
and current and potential EMIS users are aware of the EMIS and its outputs. Additionally, EMIS users have the skills to
interpret, manipulate, and utilize data produced by the system, in order to ultimately disseminate findings.

Summary
This assessment highlighted weaknesses in the current EMIS in the areas of enabling environment, system soundness,
quality data, and utilization. Suriname’s EMIS benchmark (table 4) portray a country that has experienced some difficulty
in establishing an effective EMIS. Government officials at MINOWC are keenly aware of these issues and eager to identify
and pursue solutions.

A variety of contributing factors make this a promising time for EMIS in Suriname. There is high-level buy-in, both within
MINOWC and across the government, to improve processes for collecting, managing and utilizing data. MINOWC selected
a new system with strong potential for robust data coverage. Powered by political will and stakeholder interest, the
country is now poised to move into the next stage of steady EMIS advancement.

To make the most of current opportunities, MINOWC could benefit from thinking strategically about EMIS, not only as an
information system, but holistically in the context of the larger education system. A thoughtful, long-term strategy needs
to focus on moving from a software platform to an institutionalized system. The government is addressing some of these
issues by deploying a new software solution. However the move to a new EMIS needs to be executed carefully as it requires
serious planning, budgeting, capacity building, proper sequencing, communication and collaboration. All stakeholders
need to be involved to ensure system completeness. Intergovernmental collaboration between ministries, and
collaboration between departments within ministries is essential, as it is critical to maximize proper implementation and
better returns on government expenditures.

For EMIS to steadily advance, MINOWC must get the technical aspects right in regard to customization and deployment
of the new product. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to link EMIS with overarching education goals, use the system
to answer key policy questions, track progress to strategic goals, and to plan into the future.

In examining successful EMIS deployments, decision makers often set a 3 to 5 year plan with strategic EMIS milestones.
Milestones might include rolling out a new module or program, expanding data coverage, or integrating with another
agency. Mapping to each milestone, decision makers identify the necessary staff, professional development, and technical
tools necessary to reach the milestone; as well as the associated measures that assess the extent to which the milestone
was achieved.

Given that Suriname has invested in a new information management system called SIMS, considerable time should be
spent planning its design and implementation. This should include a review of the system’s existing technical capabilities,
followed by subsequent efforts to design necessary modules for data collection, data processing, analysis, and utilization
at local, regional and central levels. Ensuring pathways for integration should be a priority, including the complete
migration of data from old systems such as OIS, as well as integration of the new system with additional ones such as the
Ministry of Finance’s FreeBalance software or the information system used by the Bureau of Examinations. Even if these
systems are not immediately integrated, key steps to ensure the integration should be undertaken at this early stage.

The customization and rollout of SIMS will be a complex and challenging process, some of the essential activities that
will contribute to effectively implementing the new system are:
x Fit/Gap analysis – Develop a strategy that identifies the extent to which the new system fits the needs and meets the
     necessary requirements of Suriname’s education system. This process should identify the major gaps, and employ
     techniques to address them.
x User group meetings – Convene stakeholder groups at all levels including MINOWC (Research and Planning,
     Inspection Bureaus, Examination, etc.) and representative groups from schools (teachers, principals and parents) to
     review goals with regard to data utilization. What key questions do users want to have answered by the data? How
     will the data be used to monitor and guide the larger education strategy? Work backwards to identify data coverage
     needs based on these questions. Also, user group meetings should identify key areas of responsibility, for example,
     which groups are responsible for data validation? User group meetings also clarify collaboration and data sharing
     procedures.
x Establish the enabling environment – A review of existing policies (policy gap analysis) and identification of areas
     where more comprehensive EMIS policies might be able to enhance the system’s effectiveness.

Building and strengthening a team to lead the efforts in
implementing, maintaining and driving forward Suriname’s EMIS is vital to the success of the new system. As part of
this process, the Department of Research and Planning should be recognized as the initial and primary recipient of
education data. Currently, primary and lower secondary schools report data directly to the Department of Research and
Planning; however, senior secondary schools report to the Inspection Bureaus. The Department of Research and Planning
is in the process of working with the Inspection Bureaus to transition all school data to go directly to Research and
Planning. This transition will help streamline the flow of data and positions the Department of Research and Planning to
be primarily responsible for Suriname’s EMIS.The Government of Suriname should support the Department of Research
and Planning in recruitment, capacity building and training, to help the Department reach its vision of becoming “a
professional research center with data collected, managed, analyzed, and utilized at all levels of the education system”.
O&P should be strengthened with additional technical ICT staff, to increase in-house expertise where possible.
Strengthening coordination and cooperating with the ICT team is also vital to success.

A consistent need for capacity building across MINOWC was voiced across meetings. MINOWC staff are highly capable
and have a strong sense of where their strengths and weaknesses lie. There are opportunities to build capacity at all levels
of the education system, in areas ranging from enabling environment and system soundness, to quality of data and
utilization of data for decision making. Training should continue over time, with initial training programs followed by
refresher trainings.

The type of data collected and indicators produced by the EMIS should be reviewed and further developed. Workshops
with the Department of Research and Planning that include participants from other MINOWC departments as well as
schools, could review existing data and determine the adjustments to data coverage and the indicators produced. Once
data and key performance indicators are identified, dashboards need to be developed in order to monitor indicators.

Security protocols for the new system may need to be reviewed and revised. The Department of Research and Planning
should lead this process with input from technical teams and the EMIS vendor.

The launch of SIMS presents an opportunity to increase the participation of schools, including having schools report
data directly into a centralized and integrated system. This reduces chances of error in data handling and recording, and
saves a substantial amount of time, previously committed to manually inputting hand-written data into the system. This
type of integrated system would also increase efficiency for principals who currently report data to multiple sources. With
SIMS they will be able to simply report data into the system once, where it can be accessed by other departments.
Efficiency gains also extend beyond MINOWC. For example, the Department of Research and Planning reports data to the
General Bureau of Statistics among other agencies, and the General Bureau of Statistics also collects and validates
education data separately. Currently a tremendous amount of time and effort is going into data collection and reporting
processes that are inefficient and redundant, a challenge that was emphasized by MINOWC staff.

The validity of data need to be ensured through both technical and manual processes. Automated and built-in
mechanisms to conduct audits, quality assurance measures, and flag inconsistent/inaccurate data need to be established.

Further, processes to hold schools and regional offices accountable for the accuracy of data should be put in place. Regular
internal and external audits need to be established. The Department of Research and Planning should lead these validation
efforts.

Improve data utilization for better system-wide efficiency as well as teaching and learning practices. Too often a country
will spend considerable investment in establishing an EMIS, but will overlook the critical aspect of utilization. An EMIS is
only as good as its utilization. Without being used, data loses its value. Additionally, utilization is not limited to central
government, but must include district and school-level stakeholders, as well as parents, students, and even community
members.

Schools should be active data users. Schools are the frontline of data collection, and for data collection to be truly
effective, teachers and principals should do more than simply collect data for a school census. The Department of Research
and Planning should develop utilization training materials for teachers and principals with the goal of helping them to
understand the value of data and gain tangible skills in data manipulation. Additionally, the new SIMS platform should
provide a direct access point to EMIS data. It should be capable of creating feedback loops carrying national and regional
analysis back to schools so that the flow of data is not one-directional. Training strategies, such as networks of trainers,
could be employed to scale training opportunities across the country.

In order to achieve all these recommendations, the enabling environment for EMIS needs to be strengthened. This
involves developing an explicit EMIS policy that includes key elements such as budgeting, human resources, institutional
structure, data collection and utilization. EMIS policies drive the effectives of an EMIS, while securing the sustainability
of the system. Drawing from regional and global best practices, the design of a comprehensive EMIS strategy, and
associated policies, should be a phased process led by the Department of Research and Planning. Preparation of this
document and related policies could include a series of conversations and workshops with stakeholders across MINOWC,
as well as external stakeholders from relevant government agencies such as the General Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry
of Planning, the Bureau of Examinations and the Inspection Bureaus.

EMIS policies drive effectiveness and safeguard the system in a variety of ways. Policies that mandate EMIS and EMIS
resources establish continuity and sustainability for the system. Further, policies that specify responsibilities and roles for
data collection and management prevent interference from external agencies. Similarly, policies that guide processes and
procedures for working with other units and other sources of data contribute to improvements in quality, efficiency, and
integration. Policies can also help to establish the supply of data into the EMIS by requiring schools to submit data in a
timely manner, and positioning the EMIS team as the primary data collection authority.

     The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
     collects data on the policies and institutions of education systems around
     the world and benchmarks them against practices associated with
     student learning. SABER aims to give all parties with a stake in
     educational results—from students, administrators, teachers, and
     parents to policy makers and business people—an accessible, detailed,
     objective snapshot of how well the policies of their country's education
     system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

     This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Education
     Management Information Systems.
