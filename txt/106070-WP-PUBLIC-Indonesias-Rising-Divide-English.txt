                                                                                 The World Bank




Indonesia has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past 15 years. The national
poverty rate was halved, from 24 percent in 1999 to 11.3 percent in 2014. Growth averaged at 6
percent annually for a decade up until 2015. Internationally, Indonesia also joined the G-20 as
Southeast Asia’s only representative.

But the quest for widely shared prosperity is not over. Indonesia is at risk of leaving its poor
and vulnerable behind. Poverty reduction has begun to stagnate, with a near zero decline
in 2014. Income inequality is rapidly rising and up to one third of it is explained by inequal-
ity of opportunities. Healthy and well educated children live side by side with children
who suffer from malnutrition, learn little when they are in school, and drop out too early.
And there are stark inequalities between regions; for example, 6 percent of children in Jakar-
ta do not have access to proper sanitation while, at the same time, 98 percent of children in
rural Papua have no access. This kind of inequality dims the prospects of important segments
of society for generations.

The Government of Indonesia has rightly identified inequality as an obstacle to sustainable
development and has set targets to reduce it. In support of this public policy objective, the
World Bank embarked on research to better understand why inequality is rising in Indonesia,
why it matters, and what can be done about it. This work is the result of partnerships between
many government agencies and The World Bank. The study enjoyed the financial support
from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Inequality is complex, impacting many facets of life and involving many actors. We hope that
this report will encourage public policy based on evidence and informed by experiences from
countries that have successfully reduced inequality.

In the country Indonesians deserve and want, extreme poverty is eliminated. In the Indonesia
its people dream of, the poor and vulnerable have more opportunities to enjoy ‘shared pros-
perity’. This is not an agenda of redistributing an economy of a fixed size. Indonesians need to
expand the size of the pie, and keep expanding it and sharing it, to ensure that the welfare of
all, and especially the most vulnerable, rises as quickly as possible.

The task of slowing – or even reversing – the trend of rising inequality is a large challenge, and
one that will take time to achieve. But we believe that by standing together – the government,
alongside civil society and the private sector, with the support of development partners – the
country will be able to make a difference for current and future generations who deserve a fair
opportunity for a better life.

We at the World Bank Group stand ready to continue supporting these objectives.

  Rising inequality is creating an Indonesia
  that is more divided than ever before . Fifteen
  years of sustained economic growth in Indonesia have
  helped to reduce poverty and create a growing middle

                Allowing inequality to grow unchecked could
                give rise to slower economic growth and poverty
                reduction, and increase the risk of conflict.


                There are four main drivers of inequality in Indonesia that affect both current and
                future generations. Taking action requires a better understanding of why inequality is rising. So in partnership
                with the Government of Indonesia and supported by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the World
                Bank conducted a research project that explored this question and identified four main causes.

               Inequality
           of opportunity      Poorer children often have an unfair start in life, undermining their ability to succeed later. At least one-
                               third of inequality is due to factors outside an individual’s control.
                 Unequal
                    jobs       The labor market is divided between high-skilled workers who receive increasing wages, and the rest
                               of the workforce that does not have the opportunity to develop these skills and is trapped in low-
                               productivity, informal, and low-wage jobs.
              High wealth
            concentration      A minority of Indonesians are benefitting from the possession of financial assets—sometimes acquired
                               through corrupt means—that, in turn, drives inequality higher both today and in the future.

                      Low
                resiliency     Shocks are becoming increasingly more common and disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable
                               households, eroding their ability to earn incomes and invest in the health and education needed to climb
                               up the economic ladder.



                Public policies can help Indonesia to break the intergenerational cycle of inequality.
                High inequality is not inevitable; policymakers can reduce inequality by tackling those factors exacerbating inequality
                that lie outside an individual’s control. The World Bank recommends four key actions:

          Improving local
          service delivery     A key to a better start for the next generation lies in enhanced local service delivery, which can improve
                               health, education and family planning opportunities for all.

    Promoting better jobs
       and skills training     Skills training programs can improve the competitiveness of workers who have missed out on a
     opportunities for the     quality education. Also, the Government can help to create better jobs through greater investment in
               workforce       infrastructure, a more conducive investment climate and a less rigid regulatory approach.

     Ensuring protection
            from shocks        Government policies can reduce the frequency and severity of shocks, as well as provide coping
                               mechanisms to ensure that all households have access to adequate protection when shocks do occur.


          Using taxes and
  government spending to       Specific fiscal policies could focus on increasing spending on infrastructure, health and education,
reduce inequality now and      social assistance and social insurance. Such improved public spending could also be supported by
             in the future     a fairer taxation system designed to address some of the current tax regulations that encourage the
                               concentration of wealth.

                               income divide between the richest 10 percent and        formal safety nets that can protect them from the
                               the rest of the population, and this gap is driven      many shocks that occur in life; many do not. And a
                               by many other types of inequality in Indonesia.         fortunate few Indonesians have access to financial
                               People are divided into haves and have-nots from        and physical assets (such as land and property)
                               before birth. Some children are born healthy and        that increase their wealth over time. This wealth
                               grow up well in their early years; many do not.         is passed down from generation to generation,
                               Some children go to school and receive a quality        both in the form of money and physical assets,
                               education; many do not. This means that some            and through greater access to better health and
                               young adults enter the workforce with the right         education. As a result, inequalities are being
                               skills that are increasingly needed and rewarded        compounded and deepened over time.

                               and innovation. However, when inequality is             economic growth and leading to policy-making

                            consumed as much as the poorest 42 percent               during the crisis to 11 percent by 2014. Growth

Worker wage premium represents how much higher wages workers at each level of education receive compared with workers
with primary or less education, controlling for experience, gender, work status, location and other factors. Household consumption
premium represents the same thing for per capita consumption and head of household’s education.


The increasing skilled wage gap is                                                     returns to education, which is one indicator of the

INDONESIA's Rising Divide
 How Inequality
Can B e Addressed
 Inequality in Indonesia depends upon households’ human and financial resources, and
how much those resources earn. Based on the income-generating asset model used in this
report, we can gain an overall understanding of how the drivers explained in the previous
                   section have led to increasing inequality (Table 3.1).

       Income Ginis are higher than consumption Ginis because rich households save more income, meaning consumption is more equally distributed than income.
     The Indonesian income Gini was 6.4 points higher than the consumption Gini, based on the average difference for the three years when both income and
     consumption Ginis were collected in Indonesia (1984, 1990 and 1993).

Providing opportunities for hard work, protecting people from shocks, and eradicating corruption
are seen as top priorities for reducing inequality. (tab. 3.4)
