                               Monthly Economic Developments

                                              April 2014

        The ruling coalition won the elections;
        Industrial production growth was a solid 3 percent in March 2014 ;
        Credit to the corporate sector seems to recover.

The ruling government coalition won the parliamentary and the second round of presidential
elections on April 27. The two ruling parties VMRO-DPMNE and DUI won 61 and 19 MPs, respectively,
putting them in the position to form a stable government if they manage to negotiate a coalition. The
opposition has not accepted the election results, accusing the government of electoral fraud and
announced that it will not participate in parliament. International institutions, which monitored the
elections (such as OSCE and ODIHR), reported that the elections were conducted fairly, but noted a
number of issues, such as biased reporting by the media and lack of differentiation between the state
and the party. These issues were similar to those highlighted in previous elections.

Though industrial production growth continued to slow down in March, it averaged a solid 3 percent
in Q1 2014. After peaking at 9.6 in December 2013 (y-o-y), industrial production growth declined
steadily in the first three months of 2014 to 0.6 percent (y-o-y) in March. Still, overall industrial
production growth reached a solid 3.0 percent (y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2014. Its slow-down resulted
from a decline in manufacturing growth which had
peaked at 13.1 percent (y-o-y) in December 2013 due
to an exceptionally strong performance in the
production of textiles, leather products and
machinery and equipment. Available data for the
first two months of 2014, also confirm a strong
performance of the construction sector, Macedonia’s
key driver of growth in 2013, as both the number of
new construction permits and their value increased
compared to the same period in 2013 and the last                               2013                  2014
two months of 2013. Notwithstanding the decline in
industrial     production    growth,     companies’
assessment of the current economic situation has
improved slightly in March, but still remains below
the level of end 2013. Companies’ expectation about
future production has improved in March, reaching its highest level since June 2013.

Credit and deposit growth further accelerated in March 2014. Credit growth to companies finally
seems to recover after a steep decline in the course of 2013. Credit to nonfinancial, private corporations
grew by 4.7 percent (y-o-y), a level not reached since December 2012. Credit to households grew by
11.3 percent. Deposits also continued their upward trend, rising by 6.9 percent (y-o-y) in March and
helping to maintain the loan-to-deposit ratio at below 90 percent (benchmark 100). Corporate NPLs
declined slightly in March to 14.3 percent, while household NPLs were broadly stable at 6.3 percent.
