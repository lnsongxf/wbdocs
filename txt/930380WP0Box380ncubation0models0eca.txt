        AN OVERVIEW

    infoDev1 recognizes business incubation as a process
    aimed at supporting the development and scaling of
    growth-oriented, early-stage enterprises. The process
    provides entrepreneurs with an enabling environment
    at the startup stage of enterprise development. This
    environment should help reduce the cost of launching                       profitability. Business incubation is one of many tools
    the enterprise, increase the confidence and capacity                       aimed at fostering innovative enterprise creation and
    of the entrepreneur, and link the entrepreneur to                          growth. Other complementary intermediaries exist,

     process designed to nurture businesses from idea generation to startup companies and, through a comprehensive
     business support program, help them establish and accelerate their growth and success

     development of enterprises and nurturing their growth.

     	SUMMARY


 Business incubation can be a valuable tool
 for stimulating the startup and growth of new
 enterprises. Successful incubators accelerate the
 growth of their clients’ businesses as compared to                                 innovation and entrepreneurship stakeholders that

     the region, little research has been done at the national or                     business incubators studied is that they offer business

     to provide further insights on the outcomes of business                          parts of the world. Another notable observation is that the

   12 · Innovations versus Outsourcing: The region is a major destination for IT, mainly software development outsourcing. Among
        ICT business incubators in the region, outsourcing is a major activity for incubatees. According to the incubators interviewed,
        outsourcing is still the major revenue source for clients but the share of new product development is steadily increasing. In
        this context, the share of new IT products exported by incubatees is also increasing.

     universities. Among its key partners, the local Institute of Technology of Metals is home to knowledge-based

     great deal of fundamental and applied research in the field of technology of materials.

     The incubator is run by the East-Kazakhstan Technological University (EKTU) as part of its innovation activities,
     which also include an annual innovation competition, cooperation with the National Innovation Fund, and a
     technology park program (since 2003), which is a network of student design bureaus, university laboratories,
     University Science and Technology Council, Science Fund Parasat, and the Ministry of Science.

     The main idea behind the creation of the incubator was to teach students how to create jobs and to promote
     innovations. It would be fair to say that the incubator achieves this goal. However, there still is a challenge in
     commercializing the innovative products developed by the incubatees. With limited government support in this
     sector, such a challenge could only be addressed by developing international networks and information exchange,
     developing cooperation with funding agencies and venture funds — this is going to be the incubator’s and university’s
     goal for the future. — BASTAU stakeholder

     Union of Innovation Technology Centers of Russia (UNITC), which provides opportunities for incubatees to promote

The majority of the incubators’ end users (incubatees and graduate companies) participating in the study perceive
incubators as gateways for enterprises – a place where all actors in the entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem
can meet and exchange views and information. Incubatees and graduates often cited the feeling of being part of
a community. They also mentioned the incubator’s role as a trigger for entrepreneurial activities and ICT cluster
development, particularly those where support for SMEs was inefficient or inexistent.

     UBIT Software Incubator Timisoara, Romania

     Over its seven-year existence, UBIT has not limited its activities to supporting startups and early-stage businesses
     within its premises. UBIT’s Director has developed and operated a number of activities, with the objective of
     fostering an entrepreneurial spirit within the area as well as generating client deal-flow (lack of demand for
     business incubation is an issue in Timisoara). UBIT has also been instrumental in the development and operation
     of the ICT cluster in Timisoara. Data collected during this study demonstrates that over the years UBIT has
     worked with more than 300 individuals outside incubation, in a context where the structure to support startups
     and early-stage businesses and government support are limited and entrepreneurial spirit is just emerging.

     “The incubator plays an important role as a gateway for the enterprise, but resources (human and financial) are
     limited. In a country where support for SMEs and startups is very limited, more initiatives like this are needed.
     This incubator is an example of a sustainable program funded by regional bodies (not the government). …The
     business model itself (as a tool for regional economic development) is very well perceived and evidence exists
     of its impact: the incubator is at the center of -and drives the ICT cluster in the area. The business incubator
     therefore needs to be integrated further to clustering activities because this is where the money currently is.”-
     UBIT Board Member

     “It is very difficult for a business to get visibility in the marketplace, as there is no real structure in place for
     supporting startups and SMEs. The incubator manages just that. Networking and exposure are key assets of the
     program.”—Incubatee

     “The main reason for moving in was the low-cost rental system, but I now realize that the work by the business
     incubation director to expose my business to the ICT and business community of the area has been key in the

     EIF has been not only a business incubator but also a business development agency for the past nine years. In fact,
     incubatees represent only about four percent of the total client base, while the majority of other businesses served
     receive support other than incubation. Since the start of operations, EIF has been instrumental in the development
     and operation of the national ICT cluster, and now enjoys an established reputation. Additionally, EIF serves as
     a gateway to Armenia for transnational companies including Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, HP, Sun Microsystems, and
     National Instruments, which receive specific incubation services and have become cornerstones of the Armenian
     IT market.

     EIF facilitates networking activities with the Armenian diaspora worldwide. For instance, it has helped create
     sales offices in Canada and Austria to help its clients promote ICT services in other countries. The incubator
     also organizes matchmaking events targeted at addressing the specific needs of its clients. Given that EIF hosts
     companies working in the same industry sector, the incubatees cooperate with each other closely in outsourcing
     various services that are add-ons to their main product, and help reduce project completion time. This has a
     positive effect on the companies’ image and revenues. In fact, the incubatees’ community has been called a “mini-
     Silicon Valley” by end users consulted as part of the study.

deal-flow, allows the incubator to keep in touch with
companies post-graduation, and helps strengthen the
local business community. Through these activities,
the ECA incubators studied here meet their objectives
of fostering the entrepreneurial spirit within their
business communities and of stimulating demand for
business incubation.

These activities outside of the business incubation
process itself contribute to the perception of ECA
incubators as gateways for enterprises, stimulating
entrepreneurship and innovation and, in some cases,
playing a key role in the development of local industry
clusters. They directly foster the flow of startups to
the incubation environment and create the business
networks the incubatees need for growth. At the same
time, non-incubation activities allow incubators in ECA
to cross-finance their incubation work. Indeed, the
incubator studies report that on average, incubation
activities contribute only 18 percent of their total
revenue.

     	 of Business Incubation


     Survival rates

     All incubators studied provided figures on the survival                           Firm survival rates five years after graduation are
     rates of their client; however, one incubator has not yet                         more relevant in terms of quantifying longer term

     typically mean that the firm has been incubated for a
     period of two to three years and is on average three
     years old. It is generally understood that about 50
     percent of new firms fail within the first five years, so
     this data point around 80 is encouraging.




     Bridging the financing gap

     Financing is perceived as a challenge for incubatees in                           • Micro-loans
     environments where the business and financial support                             • Collaboration and match-making with Business
     structure for startups and early-stage businesses is                              Angels (UBIT)
     not well developed.14 More than half of the incubators                            • Access to state and donor funds
     in the study directly assist their incubatees in securing
     finance through support such as:                                                  This kind of support is relatively uncommon in more
                                                                                       developed countries, where financial support is

     • Seed capital initiatives




                 13 · Other studies also come to the general conclusion that survival rates within incubators are higher, for example: Meredith
                 Erlewine, “Comparing Stats on Firm Survival” in Measuring Your Business Incubator’s Economic Impact: A Toolkit. Athens,
                 Ohio: National Business Incubation Association, 2007. The Centre for Strategy and Evaluation Services (2002) Benchmarking
                 of Business Incubators (Final report). Brussels, European Commission Enterprise Directorate General-survey reveals that
                 “the survival rate of firms reared in an incubator environment was significantly higher than the business success rate
                 amongst the wider SME community, estimated at 30-50% (over a 5 year period)… there was a notable clustering of incubators
                 reporting a survival rate amongst tenant firms of 80-90%, [however] survival rates are one indicator of the performance of
                 incubators, of more importance is the extent to which incubators can contribute to the accelerated development of innovative,
                 high-growth firms and their capacity to create new jobs.”
                 14 · Incubators taking part in the study that are located in more mature environments—such as Kalisz Innovation Centre
28               (Poland)—may therefore be used as models.
Case 1: Zelenograd Nanotechnology Centre, Russian Federation

Other than generic financial advice and access to Investment Readiness Program, finance providers (Angel
Investment and/or venture capital), and Seed Capital Fund initiatives, ZNTC has developed a policy regarding
equity stakes and has the target of holding 25 percent share of the equity (from RUSNANO funds) in the incubatees
with the following. This is done through an agreement of holding a 25 percent share in the business for the first
3 years, with the incubatee receiving preferential lease rates over a 3-year business incubation period. In total,
incubatees at ZNTC have secured a total of $500,000 in financing, with ZNTC directly supporting half of this
amount.
                                               Case 2: Kalisz Innovation Center, Poland

Operated by a foundation, the incubator has been a loan provider for SMEs and new businesses (including
incubatees) through its entrepreneurship development fund. In particular, it has helped the unemployed gain
access to financing and advising while guiding and counseling them on the implications of loan funding. It offers
rates below those of commercial banks, with interest rates of 5.26–8.26 percent for SMEs (depending on the
economic situation of the company, profitability, and the type of guarantee) and 6–8 percent for the unemployed.
Since the start of operations in the mid-1990s, the foundation has supported over 306 SMEs and over 263
individuals who would otherwise be unable to access traditional bank financing. This loan provision, alongside
its work in enterprise support, highlights the core added value of the foundation and the incubator to the local
business community.

Case 3: EIF, Armenia

Project-based financing is provided directly by EIF or partner funds in the form of equity investment of up to
30 percent, grants (using donor funds, industry specific, and depending on the donor framework) or micro-
loans. EIF provides assistance in access to funds, pre-seed financing, and matchmaking, specifically by providing
professional advice and support in preparing project proposals for equity financing and VC funding.


                                                  Case 4: SODBI, Shymkent, Kazakhstan

There are three ways the incubator secures finances for its clients: consulting on business planning, partner
search, and negotiations with the financial institutions and SME support funds; providing micro-loans to clients
through the micro-credit organization SODBI-Finance at an annual rate of up to 36 percent and taking up to a 49
percent equity share in the SME.

Case 5: EIF, Armenia

According to Radu Ticiu, head of UBIT, the initial investment for software development startups in Timisoara is
secured through contracts. Radu Ticiu estimates that UBIT has supported virtually every UBIT incubatee with at
least one contract, reaching a total value of more than $100,000 worth of such contracts.

  EXAMPLES OF MISSION AND OBJECTIVES FOR INCUBATORS



 EIF

 The incubator serves as a bridge between the IT sector, the government, and the international community. It
 catalyzes the creation of small ICT-enterprises, in close cooperation with giants of the IT industry.




                                                                                                             UBIT

 The incubator was conceived with the objective of retaining and exploiting local know-how in the software industry,
 and to take advantage of global players from the IT and software industry in the area.




 Technology Park Mogilev

 The incubator is incorporated into the science park. It supports startups and new entrepreneurs in developing
 their innovative R&D projects into marketable products.




                                                                                                         SODBI

 The mission of the incubator is to promote SME development in the region, and to support the development of
 production, processing, and service companies at the startup and development stages. The previous approach
 of the incubator was to deliver business advisory and training services and to coach the incubatees. However,
 the crisis period has proved that in addition to these services, financial support (access to finance, equity share,
 partner search or other) is also required.




 Kalisz Innovation Centre

 The current and longer term vision for the incubator is to become a technology incubator where “science,
 industry, and entrepreneurship meet,” and to be a link between science, education, and the local economy. This
 vision is included within the innovative development strategy for the area, with plans to incubate new industrial
 technologies (e.g., energy efficiency, low carbon technologies), develop socioeconomic science, create a new seed
 capital fund, and extend cooperation with European and international partners, particularly through engagement
 in European programs and funds.

     working in the same industry sector. There is a community that includes the incubator residents and graduates,

Timisoara Software Business incubator (UBIT)

In the Timisoara area, about 12,000 people are employed in the software industry, working for around 500 ICT
companies. Branches of multinational players, including companies such as Siemens, Alcatel­   Lucent, Continental,
Berg Computers, and Haufe-Lexware, are major employers, mainly in the software outsourcing industry. A major
objective of the incubator is to provide jobs and growth opportunities for young entrepreneurs with the ambition
to start their own businesses in the software industry. In 2008, 10 of 11 incubatees of UBIT provided outsourcing
services only, but now three incubatees are bringing their own products to (mainly international) markets.
According to Radu Ticiu, manager of UBIT, this share has been slowly but steadily rising. More details on these
three companies can be found here: http://123contactform.com, http://www.reflectionmedia.ro, and http://www.
nextroot.com.

“Investment needs during the startup stage are not as high as in other sectors,” says Mr. Ticiu. “What is needed
primarily is a contract, allowing the company to start working and to hire staff.” The incubator does not track
these contracts as part of the M&E system. According to Mr. Ticiu, virtually each incubatee was supported by UBIT
in order to get at least one contract for starting up. The overall value of the contracts that were facilitated by UBIT
exceeds $100,000. “Even though we could track this information, nobody in our region is really interested in this
data at the moment. For key policy makers, the main objective is to attract foreign investors to the region, and we
are considered to be a small niche only.”

     BAVIN Business angels and venture investors network / Minsk / Belarus

     BAVINCUBE is a virtual incubator and business accelerator operated by a business angel association in Minsk.
     BAVINCUBE’s goal is to foster access to finance for innovative startups by providing a virtual hub for business
     incubators and other entrepreneurship support organizations as well as business angels and private sector
     investors in Belarus—in other words, a “virtual incubation network and match-making platform.” The founder
     of BAVINCUBE is the Business Angels and Venture Investors Network (BAVIN), a for-profit angel association
     and business accelerator, which brings together the venture capital and business expertise of angel investors
     with entrepreneurs, their new business ideas, and startup companies. Unique in Belarus, BAVIN was founded in
     November 2010 by a number of pioneer Belarus Business Angels. By joining BAVINCUBE, entrepreneurs will have
     opportunities to meet online and face-to-face with successful Belarusian entrepreneurs and business angels, pitch
     and win investments, participate in master classes online, and to receive mentoring, thus accelerating startup and
     new business development in Belarus.

     In August 2012, 203 companies with business plans applied to the a BAVIN network. BAVIN incubatees include
     34 selected companies in pre-incubation, five in incubation, and four graduates. Several projects have received
     business-angel support through mentoring but without financing. A total of 930 projects applied to enter BAVIN in
     August 2012.

     Art hostel “Traveler” Minsk is one case of a successful a BAVIN incubatee. The 36-bed hostel is the first of its kind
     in Belarus. Started by Kseniya Kurus, a Belarusian student who secured a BAVIN angel investment of $50,000, the
     hostel reached its break-even point after one month of operation. According to Mr. Kurus, the BAVIN angel has
     not only contributed with investment but also provided frequent business advice. “Oftentimes he uses his personal
     business network contacts to help with our business development,” says Mr. Kurus. Following the success of the
     Traveler hostel, plans to expand the network are under way.

Example 1:
“Initially, the main reason for us to apply for business incubation services was the low-cost rental space. Almost
half as expensive as the market rate, the incubation fee is based on a stepped rent.” (incubatee)

Example 2:
“The incubator consists of a decent facility (including equipped office) with a competitive price…The location of a
business can tell the client a lot about its character—I wish to be treated as a serious partner for businesses, so
the incubator, with its facility and reputation, are contributing to my company’s image.” (incubatee)

Example 3:
“I was attracted by the cheap rent (the rent is 30–40% cheaper than any commercial facility) as well as the contacts
and exchange opportunities with counterparts at the incubator.” (incubatee)

ZNTC

 ZNTC was founded as a limited company in 2010 at the initiative of National Research University of Electronic
 Technology (MIET), Zelenograd Innovation Technology Centre (ZITC), and the Russian Corporation of
 Nanotechnologies (RUSNANO), a government-owned, non-commercial organization created to support
 nanotechnology development through subsidies and training. In addition to generic financial advice and access
 to the Investment Readiness Program, finance providers (angel investment and/or venture capital), and seed
 capital fund initiatives, ZNTC has also developed a policy that aims to hold a 25 percent share of the equity from
 RUSNANO funds in incubatees. The incubator has secured $250,000 for incubatees so far, while the incubatees
 themselves have raised $500,000.

 SODBI Incubator is a subdivision of the SODBI private fund, an NGO targeted at SME development in the region.
 The incubator secures finances for its clients in three ways:
 • Consulting on business planning, partner search and negotiations with the financial institutions, and SME
 support funds
 • Providing micro-loans to clients through SODBI-Finance, a micro-credit organization, at an annual rate of up
 to 36 percent
 • Taking up to 49 percent of the equity from the client.

 SODBI’s management is seeking to attract additional investments to the fund as they are required to make it
 self-sustainable.


Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF)


 EIF is focusing on networking and cooperation with donor funds that provide project-based financing aimed at
 addressing specific industry-related issues. EIF serves as a platform for implementation of donor initiatives in
 this sector in Armenia. Most of the incubation services are subsidized by donor-funded activities and public-
 private partnerships. Project-based financing is provided by EIF or by partner funds in form of equity investment
 (up to 30 percent), grants (using industry-specific donor funds), or micro-loans.

         17 · For the purposes of this study, break-even is considered as the time in which an incubator through its operations or otherwise has
              been able to recuperate the cost of investment of establishing the incubator. Incubators studied here and those located in the ECA
              region generally are primarily established through public funding; therefore, the return on investment is considered in broader socio-
              economic impact terms as a “return” for the government investment.

     The incubator is self-sustainable as it owns the building, its strong team of managers and experts, a large

     The incubator currently provides space free of charge, as is required by one of the key stakeholders. Most of the
     advisory services are also free. However, management is planning to introduce fee-based services to strengthen
     the incubator’s sustainability and reduce the risk of failure. Fees would be set based on the incubatee’s
     development stage and business needs.

     The incubator provides office space, but only to a small number of tenants (the available space is 600 square
     meters). The main source of revenue (80 percent) is participation in projects (donor or government-funded) that
     do not directly relate to incubatee activities. A new facility of 2,000 square meters is under construction. BITF
     partly cross-subsidizes incubatee support with project-related (not incubatee-related) revenues.

 6.4	 Selection and Graduation
      (Exit) Policies

Selection and graduation (exit) policies are among the
processes that distinguish incubators from general
business development services. International good
practice indicates that incubators are selective about
choosing clients in a particular stage of development
and industry sector, so that they can make a positive
difference to the small-firm economy in the area
and region by starting and maintaining the deal
flow of startups moving into the incubator and then
graduating.




“It should be common sense for incubator clients that once having achieved a certain development milestone you
decide to leave the incubator walls to let other businesses at their startup stage enjoy the favorable conditions at the
incubator—this is my corporate social responsibility—this is how I can contribute to small business development,
in a way... It is not really fair to set up rigid frames for the incubatee to leave the warm nest, but it makes sense
limiting the time and space allowed for the company. The business has to be growing and increasing the number of
jobs created and space occupied—these are the sustainability indicators that must lead the company to a decision
to find a larger facility outside of the incubator… or possess its own facility.”— (incubatee taking part in the study)

The incubator foundation is governed by a council (Board of Trustees) comprised of five members from the local
industrial and educational sectors appointed by the Mayor of Kalisz. The foundation council has an oversight role in
the development and management of the incubator deciding on the projects and programs that the incubator will
pursue, with an annual plan presented and discussed in January each year and with a minimum of four meetings
held per annum. The Board of Directors consists of two members, including the president, Piotr Sadowski, who has
day-to-day operational responsibility for the foundation and the incubator.

Alongside Board Member Kazimierz Mochalski, they have responsibility for the line management of 14 staff
members who deliver the business loan fund, provide enterprise support services, e.g., Enterprise Europe Network,
and provide administration for the incubator. The foundation staff includes technical personnel, loan officers, and
innovation and technology specialists who deliver the day-to-day activities of the foundation. Mr. Sadowski has
extensive experience in business incubation, having managed the Kalisz incubator since its inception in 1994
and been involved in its planning, financing, and development in his previous role working with the Kalisz local
authority. The development of the incubator, as a result of loan funding through the World Bank TOR-10 program,
included support through a training program directed at establishing a network of Polish incubators in which Mr.
Sadowski was a participant. In addition, Mr. Sadowski has been a consultant for the Polish Agency for Enterprise
Development and has been involved in numerous projects focused on SME development and enterprise.

     Timisoara Software Business
     incubator — UBIT Romania


     All data and information contained in the study was collected in September and November 2011.



           UBIT has played a catalytic role in the emergence and development of the local and regional
           tech entrepreneurship ecosystem. However, following research for this study, the Timisoara
           Software Business Incubator, UBIT as it was known during the research period, closed in July
           2012. The initial partnership that had established the incubator (comprising Timisoara City
           Council, Timis County Council, and the Polytechnic University of Timisoara) could no longer
           be sustained due to varying motivations of the three partners: Timisoara City Council opted to
           establish its own IT-focused incubator while Timis County Council set up a non-specialized/
           mixed use incubator. With both councils pulling out, the university was unable to finance UBIT
           by itself. It however, allowed tenants to remain on former UBIT premises with favourable
           contractual conditions.

           The Timisoara Start-up Hub, a privately developed and run start-up support infrastructure
           for tech and creative industry, was launched in December 2012 and took over the community
           development functions and initiatives previously run by Timisoara Software Business
           Incubator. It also offers support services for the Timisoara Software Business Incubator
           tenants.

           The overall tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Timisoara was not disrupted with the closing
           of the UBIT project. On the contrary, notable achievements were recorded in 2013 (former UBIT
           clients won the Next Web Romania Start-up Award for the best mobile app, SlickFlick), and
           the Best Business Angel Investment Award, 123contactform). A Timisoara Start-up Weekend
           was organized by the Start-up Hub, and various other activities are ongoing in the Timisoara
           ecosystem.
