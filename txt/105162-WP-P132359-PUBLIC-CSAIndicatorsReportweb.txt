FOREWORD

There is by now substantial consensus within the development community over the
need for a more climate smart agriculture, which consists of three defining princi-
ples: enhancing agriculture’s resilience to climate change, reducing agricultural green-
house gas emissions, and sustainably increasing production. With 795 million people
still not getting their minimum dietary requirements, there is little scope for trade-offs
between increasing production and improving agriculture’s environmental impacts.
Making climate smart agriculture operational will rely on our ability to measure pro-
duction, resilience, and emissions in a way that informs decision makers about the
policies, technologies, and practices that most effectively promotes each. In addition to
the direct results of an improved activity or practice, longer term outcomes can lead
to fundamental changes in the way that producers, consumers, investors, and others
behave—and what they base their production, consumption, and investment decisions
on. The indicators described in this document were developed for this purpose.

Applying the indicators to examine the agricultural performance of different countries
reveals a number of correlates relating to institutions, legal frameworks, and the rela-
tionships between agriculture and other sectors like water and energy. Applying them
to projects affirms the important advantages of approaches that employ appropriate
technologies and that incorporate broader, landscape-based perspectives that recog-
nize and allow for competing demands for land and water resources.

The type of highly practical empirical evidence that will be amassed by monitoring
these indicators is going to be pivotal in mitigating agriculture’s large ecological foot-
print, in capitalizing on its potential to provide environmental services, and in guid-
ing the forms of intensification that lead to substantially higher and more sustainable
production.

This report drew from contributions from a range of experts working on agriculture
                                                                           richness
food security and climate change. We thank everyone who contributed to its ­
and multidisciplinary outlook. The work was led by Ademola Braimoh, who devel-
oped the concepts and provided overall guidance to the team. The preparation of
    Technology indicators was led by Ijeoma Emenanjo, Policy indicators by Maurice
the ­
Rawlins, and the Results indicators by Christine Heumesser. Yuxuan Zhao developed
the computer programs for all the indicators, whereas Maria de Rijk, Xiaoyue Hou,
Elizabeth Minchew, Wisambi Loundu, and Julia Isabel Espinal provided invaluable
research support. The web interface technology for the indicators was coordinated
by Xenia Zia Morales and Varuna Somaweera, with invaluable support from Ritesh
Sanan and Christopher Nammour.

We acknowledge the inputs of all the experts at the three consultative meetings that

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Agriculture accounts for 40 percent of the land area and 70 percent of
the freshwater resources that humans use, and 24 percent of human-
induced greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to its role as a contributor to cli-
mate change, agriculture, with its direct reliance on natural resources, is also the sector
of the economy that is the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. And the
pressures that population growth and urbanization are putting on the sector are grow-
ing at the same time that many of the resources that agricultural production depends
on are diminishing throughout much of the developing world. The human population
is projected to increase to 9.5 billion people by 2050, and agricultural demand for
water may increase by 30 percent by 2030. The proportion of the human population
that resides in water-stressed or water-scarce areas is likely to increase from about
18 percent today to 44 percent by 2050. The increased risks associated with higher
frequencies of drought, flooding, and heat stress will have significant impacts on agri-
cultural production systems, resulting in lower yields, rising food prices, and increased
greenhouse gas emissions. For every degree Celsius of global warming, yields are at
risk of declining by 5 percent, leading to further insecurity for the 805 million already
food insecure.

Agriculture is also the most vital sector of the economy for food security,
and employs some 2.6 billion people worldwide. More than any other sector
in developing countries, growth in the agricultural sector is associated with poverty
reduction. The growth in gross domestic product (GDP) that takes place in agriculture
is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as the growth that takes place in other
sectors, and its significance to poverty rates increases roughly in proportion to the size
of its role in the larger economy. In the largely agriculture-based economies of the
developing world, where poverty rates are the highest and the largest ratios of poor
people live in rural areas, its significance is the greatest.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in its broadest usage refers to a global
agenda with three fundamental elements. The first element is to increase agri-
cultural production and incomes to meet increasing demand while ensuring the sustain-
ability of the soil and water resources used. The second is to make production systems

BACKGROUND

CLIMATE CHANGE AND AGRICULTURE
Global agriculture has a lot on its plate. It is self-evidently the sector that will be most
instrumental in feeding nine billion people by the year 2050 and in addressing the
needs of the 795 to 805 million people who are food insecure today. It also provides
livelihoods for some 2.6 billion people worldwide and accounts for between 20 and
60 percent of the gross domestic product in most developing countries. No other sec-
tor of the economy is as effective in raising people out of poverty. And no other sector
is as directly reliant on its natural resource base, the land and water resources that
are the fundamental elements of crop and livestock production. The sector consumes
40 ­percent of global land area and 70 percent of global freshwater. The other fun-
damental element is the climate. And no other sector is as vulnerable to the effects
of a changing climate. Throughout much of the world, for instance, grain yields will
decline by 5 percent with each degree Celsius the temperature warms.

The vulnerability of agricultural systems to climate change are chiefly described in
terms of risk, in what is already an exceptionally risky sector. Much of this involves
the increased risk associated with more frequent instances of heat stress, drought, and
flooding, or what are generally referred to as production risks (as opposed to market or
commodity price risks). The price hikes between 2008 and 2010 were caused by natural
disasters like wildfires in some of the world’s largest food exporting regions. Severe
droughts in the summer of 2012 pushed prices even higher.

This vulnerability to the effects of climate change has a dramatic counterpoint in the
massive effects that agricultural production has on climate change. Crop and livestock
production, including land use change and the use of synthetic fertilizers are a colos-
sal source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the principal source of greenhouse gases
with exceptionally high carbon equivalence like nitrous oxide and methane. Agriculture
accounts for 52 percent of methane emissions and 84 percent of nitrous oxide emis-
sions in addition to its role as the principal driver of global deforestation. Agriculture
and agriculture-driven land-use change contribute 24 percent of anthropogenic global
greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural practices in their current “business as usual”

CHAPTER TWO
IMPACT PATHWAY AND THEORY OF CHANGE
The CSA indices are informed by an impact pathway and provide a framework for
measuring the outputs and outcomes of a CSA intervention highlighting behavio-
ral change that will support the achievement of the CSA triple-wins. The impact
pathway is a theoretical framework that helps guide program planning, manage-
ment, and evaluation. In contrast to the frequently used logical framework, which
describes the project by proceeding from inputs and activities to outputs and out-
comes to the ultimate goals by an if-then causal logic, the impact pathways provide
a more holistic view of the change process. It is a flexible approach that allows
investigating change processes independent of concrete interventions by articulat-
ing hypotheses as to how impacts are being achieved (Kim et al. 2011). It can
incorporate the views of different stakeholders and it is assumed that it can evolve
over time, as more knowledge is gained about agricultural innovation processes
(Springer-Heinze et al. 2003).

To understand which indicators and indices are relevant to monitor and measure the
success of a CSA intervention in terms of achieving the CSA triple-win goals, we
developed an impact pathway. The pathway is general in nature and does not relate
to specific project activities. Instead, we captured how stakeholders’ behavior could
change (see the section “Outcomes—Behavioral Change” for further description)—
on a project and national scale—to support the achievement and sustainability of
CSA goals and impacts in the agricultural sector (see the section “Agricultural Sector
Impacts”) and how these relate to the sustainable development goals and the World
Bank’s twin goals of shared prosperity and ending extreme poverty. Although we rec-
ognize that these relations are partial in nature, it is important to note the sustainability
of the CSA impacts can only be achieved when stakeholders change their behav-
ior. Thus, the impact pathway provides a conceptual framework for determining a
clustered set of indicators, which allow measurement of behavioral change (project
outcomes), direct project outputs, and aspects of the enabling policy and institutional
environment that may be necessary to support the CSA intervention and subsequently

CHAPTER THREE
INDICATOR SELECTION AND APPLICATION
The selection and development of the indicators encompassed an extensive literature
review, the development of an impact pathway (desirable impacts in the agricultural
sector and behavioral changes leading up to it) and theory of change, and three expert
consultations. The project team also examined and selected some World Bank Core
Sector Indicators that were eventually included in the CSA Results Index. Nearly 80
experts from the World Bank Group and development partners participated in the
consultations.

A key to an effective assessment of the “CSA-ness” of a project is to strategically select
the most accurate indicators for the project of interest. Although there are several
indicators that could potentially work, it may be impractical to use more than a few.
Effective indicators should be the following (FAO 2010):
    »» Relevant: The indicator reveals something that you want to know about the
       system.
    »» Precise: You can reliably trust the information that the indicator provides.
    »» Sensitive: As the system changes, the indicator changes in a predictable
       fashion.
    »» Easy to understand: The indicator is intuitive to laypersons and decision
       makers.
    »» Measurable: The indicator is based on accessible data that are already avail-
       able or can be collected and interpreted with relatively easily.

In the process of indicator selection, indicators were chosen to ensure that indica-
tors are Specific, Measurable, Achievable and Attributable, Relevant and Time Bound
(SMART). These attributes are defined as follows:
      i.  Specific: Indicators should reflect simple information that is communicable
          and easily understood
     ii.  Measurable: Information can be readily obtained. Are changes objectively
          verifiable?
    iii.  Achievable and Attributable: Indicators and their measurement units must be
          achievable and sensitive to change during the life of the project.

KEY FINDINGS FOR THE CSA POLICY INDEX
An assessment of the adoption of CSA policies was performed on 88 countries includ-
ing 32 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), 22 in Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC), 12 in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), 9 in East Asia and the Pacific, 8 coun-
tries in the Middle East and North Africa, and 5 countries in South Asia. For each
country, a composite CSA-Pol Index score was calculated using the weighted average
of 31 subindicators.

This report highlights the importance of adopting CSA policies to address food inse-
curity under changing climatic conditions. A 1 percent increase in the CSA-Pol Index
is predicted to lead to a 0.4 percent decline in the proportion of undernourished popu-
lation (figure 4.1). Cereal yields increase 47 kilograms per hectare for every 1 percent
increase in the CSA-Pol Index (figure 4.2). Appropriate policies, institutions, and sup-
port services targeted at farmers can include measures aimed at building economic
resilience at farm level by increasing productivity and income, enabling saving, and
promoting diversification. A 1 percent increase in CSA-Pol Index is predicted to lead
to a 0.08 decrease in coefficient of variance of cereal yield (figure 4.3).

A 1 percent increase in the CSA-Pol Index is predicted to decrease GHG intensity of
milk by 0.11 kg CO2-e/kg (figure 4.4). A 1 percent increase in CSA-Pol Index is also
predicted to decrease GHG intensity of chicken by 0.11 kg CO2-e/kg (figure 4.5).
GHG intensity of paddy rice will decrease by 0.02 kg CO2-e/kg (figure 4.6).

Countries in the assessment are at varying stages of the adoption of policies to sup-
port CSA implementation—the CSA-Pol Index ranged from 31 percent for Sudan to
87 percent for Chile (figure 4.7). CSA-Pol Index, readiness mechanisms, and services
and infrastructure support scores increase with increasing level of income (figure 4.8).
This suggests that national investments in services that support CSA such as agri-
culture crop insurance, social safety nets, and market information systems may yield
greater returns in terms of strengthening the country’s enabling environment for CSA
than investing in policies or coordinating mechanisms.

TECHNOLOGY INDEX AND THE CSA RESULTS
INDEX
The CSA-Tech Index and the CSA-Res Index measure a project’s achievements in
the CSA triple-win areas. Each indicator in the CSA-Tech and CSA-Res Indices are
aligned to one, two, or all of the triple-win P, R, and M goals. To show how the CSA-
Tech and CSA-Res Indices cay be applied to projects, the report selected and tested
projects from five countries across the world (figure 5.1). These projects were selected
for their diverse representation in location and project objectives.

Based on the testing results, case studies were developed to determine the appropriate
climate-smart technologies for the proposed project. The results from the index testing
are described in the following sections.

TESTING OF PROJECTS USING
THE CSA-TECH INDEX
The testing of the CSA-Tech Index has yielded the following insights:
   1.	 Monitoring a CSA-Tech indicator involves establishment costs with benefits
       occurring at some later time.
   2.	 To calculate the value of a CSA-Tech indicator, it is necessary to determine a
       short list of optimal technologies in the proposed context.
   3.	 There is likely to be wide variation between the values of different CSA indica-
       tors in a given situation, and a variation in the value of a given indicator in dif-
       ferent situations. Each must be assessed separately in different farming systems.
   4.	 In many cases, the costs of using the CSA-Tech Index would fall over time as
       uncertainty is reduced.
   5.	 The gross value of the CSA-Tech Index can never be negative. At worst, its
       value would be zero if no values exist.
   6.	 The greater the current level of uncertainty about a variable, the greater is the
       value of monitoring, as long as monitoring does lead to reductions in uncertainty.

CHAPTER SIX
CONCLUSION AND THE WAY FORWARD
The report identified three indices to support policy makers and development practi-
tioners in identifying and implementing the necessary policy, technical, and monitor-
ing framework to enable and operationalizing CSA.

The CSA-Pol Index allows policy makers and other users to compare how a coun-
try’s enabling environment for CSA is changing over time; identifies gaps in support-
ing CSA implementation; and to develop benchmarks for reform. The CSA-Tech
Index helps to guide thinking about the values of technology, specifically looking at
its potential to improve decision making. The CSA-Res Index measures an agricul-
tural project’s performance toward achieving the CSA triple wins individually and
jointly.

The development of the CSA indicators was informed by the impact pathway and
theory of change. It presented the rationale for the selection of the indicators that
included a range of policies, technologies, and practices focused on the CSA pillars.
To achieve the medium- and long-term goals of environmental sustainability, CSA
interventions must be regarded within a landscape approach that is cognizant of the
competing demand for land, water, and natural resources use and that equips farmers
with an understanding of the cost-benefits or trade-offs of adopting certain practices
and technologies.


REPORT HIGHLIGHTS
    »» Adopting CSA policies to address food insecurity under changing climatic con-
       ditions is critical. A 1 percent increase in the CSA-Pol Index is predicted to
       lead to a 0.4 percent decline in the proportion of undernourished population.
       Cereal yields increase 47 kilograms per hecatre for every 1 percent increase in
       the CSA-Pol Index.
    »» Public expenditure for services and infrastructure could be more important
       than readiness mechanisms and coordination mechanisms for achieving CSA
       goals.

REVIEW OF EXISTING INDICES RELATING TO
AGRICULTURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE
A range of indicator and index initiatives exists. These inform about agriculture and
climate change topics, rank countries accordingly, and allow for recommendations
toward policy and project-level CSA interventions. However, as the review of indictors
shows here, very rarely are the CSA dimensions of food security, agricultural produc-
tivity, resilience, climate change mitigation, and sustainable use of natural resources
addressed in one indicator.

Achieving food security is a determined aim of CSA. There is a range of indica-
tors and indices that capture the state of food security and nutrition in developing
countries. The available indicators often point toward gaps in the provision of food
and nutrition and highlight the importance of good governance to support agricul-
tural development. However, these indicators and indices typically fail to capture the
interdependencies between food security and productivity; environmental and natu-
ral resources management; or agriculture’s impact on climate change or the need for
increasing resilience toward climate-induced risks. A prominent example is the Global
Food Security Index (from the Economist Intelligence Unit, which comprises 18 indi-
cators and assesses food security of 109 countries). The indicators are categorized in
three groups—food affordability, availability, and quality and safety. The index encom-
passes various dimensions of food demand, production volatility, rural poverty, and
nutrition.1 The complexity of calculating the composite index is frequently cited as
a weakness because it makes recommendations for policy interventions based on an
index score difficult. In addition, a theoretical framework is lacking that explains the
rationale for the selection of indicators for the composite index.2

In contrast to measuring the status of food and nutrition security, the HANCI attempts
to assess governance and political will to reduce undernutrition and hunger. HANCI is
a project of the Institute of Development Studies with funding from Irish Aid, UKAid,

  Indigenous knowledge: “local, orally transmitted, a consequence of practical engagement reinforced by experience, empirical rather than theoretical, repetitive, fluid
and negotiable, shared but asymmetrically distributed, largely functional, and embedded in a more encompassing cultural matrix” (Buchmann and Darnhoffer).

  The capacity for self-organization is cited as one of the three properties common to all resilient systems. Individuals, local and regional networks, and smaller institu-
tions of governance can be more responsive and adaptable to changing conditions than can larger groups. Any configuration that they create is more likely to contribute
to overall system resilience in the long term because it was created by their own initiative.

TECHNICAL NOTES FOR THE CSA
RESULTS INDEX
The CSA Results indicators are part of the set of three CSA-related indicators: CSA
Technology, CSA Policy, and CSA Results indicators.

The CSA-Res indicator set has two purposes:
    i.  It informs stakeholders about indicators for relevant M&E systems in CSA
        interventions. The CSA Results indicators are associated with an impact
        pathway (focusing on outputs and medium- to long-term outcomes) and a
        theory of change, which explains how a CSA intervention can lead to the
        desirable development impacts in the long term. This embedment is crucial
        because long-term impacts are not easily measured by this type of indicator.
        Instead, the CSA Results indicators focus on measurable project results—­
        outputs, outcomes—which can eventually lead to these impacts.
   ii.  The set of CSA Results indicators will be the basis for the calculation of the
        CSA Results Index, which provides stakeholders with an indication of
        how the respective project has performed in reaching its targets in the CSA triple-win
        areas—Resilience, Mitigation, and Productivity—separately and jointly. To
        derive the index, the following steps are required:
        1.	 Designing the results framework and choosing indicators. A project
            team designs a results framework and chooses indicators to measure the Project Develop-
            ment Objective and the project’s Intermediate results. Ideally, CSA indicators are applied
            if suitable. For calculating the index, the core CSA-Res indicators are recommended
            (chapter 3, page 22).
        2.	 Target values are defined. For each indicator, a baseline value and a target
            value to be reached at the end of the project, and for each fiscal year or other relevant time
            interval, are set.
        3.	 The indicators are assigned to the CSA triple-win areas. The chosen
            indicators are assigned to one or multiple triple-win areas—Productivity, Resilience, and
            Mitigation, indicating that the outputs or outcomes that are monitored contribute in par-
            ticular to these specific CSA goals. For the set of CSA indicators, a default assignment
            has been proposed. However, for the calculation of the index, the default assignment can

  A list of practices/techniques that are considered CSA will be provided in the Report. CSA practices span agronomic practices such as conservation agriculture,
no tillage, applying improved seeds, sustainable management of fertilizer, such as matching the nutrients with plant needs during the growing season, fractioning the
total amount in multiple doses, precision farming and placing nutrients closer to plant roots, such as deep placement of urea for improved rice conditions, sustainable
management of herbicides, pesticides, and so on, water management, improved feeding strategies, rotational grazing, pasture management or manure treatment, and
agro-forestry.

  If this is not the case, an additional indicator specifying the use or application of a practice should be adopted.

                                          but cannot be automatically assumed to be a positive or
                                          negative development. Further, the introduction of irrigation
                                          systems cannot automatically be assumed to be a CSA
                                          practice. It may improve adaptation and adaptive capacity to
                                          climate change but whether there are mitigation cobenefits
                                          will depend on the type of irrigation system. The subindicator
                                          thus suggests measuring separately those irrigation systems that
                                          satisfy the World Bank’s climate change cobenefit criteria.

                                  capital, to the rural poor and provides benefits such as increased
                                  bargaining power and resource sharing, reducing transaction

                                  achievement of CSA goals. There are many types of agricultural
                                  associations or cooperatives in the developing world (for example,
                                  community-based and resource-orientated organizations or

                                  association will have to fulfill certain conditions and provide

           III. Indicators measuring the medium- to long-term consequences of CSA intervention
     Topic: Natural resources
     14 Annual total volume            %             This indicator aims to show the intensity of agricultural uses        R
        of groundwater                               compared with total renewable but finite water resources
        and surface water                            and aims to give an indication of “unsustainable resources
        withdrawal for                               use,” in particular when measured over time to see how
        agricultural use,                            water withdrawals have evolved. This indicator is frequently
        expressed as a                               complemented with indicators measuring water withdrawal
        percentage of                                over total actual renewable water resources from other sectors
        the total actual                             such as industry and urban and municipality use. This set
        renewable water                              of indicators can give indications of increasing competition
        resources (in the                            and conflict between water uses. Increases in the value of
        project area)                                the indicator is suggested to imply negative effects on the
                                                     sustainability of the natural resources base, whereas low values
                                                     of the indicator can indicate potential for increase in water use
                                                     in a sustainable way (MDGs).9
                                                     This measure has shortcomings. Although considering the
                                                     withdrawal from agriculture over the total resources, it does
                                                     not consider the return flows from agriculture, which can
                                                     add up to 50% of water withdrawals (source) and thus tend
                                                     to overestimate total water withdrawal. Apart from this
                                                     problematic issue, the indicator provides, again, only a partial
                                                     assessment of the multiple dimensions of water use. At the
                                                     project level, it may be difficult to obtain the data needed
                                                     to measure the indicator. Taken by itself, the indicator may
                                                     not be meaningful, but could be measured together with
                                                     water withdrawal from other sectors to give an indication
                                                     of competing uses between sectors. It may be difficult to
                                                     determine the references or desirable value that indicates
                                                     “sustainable” use of the resource.
                                                     Similar indicators suggested in the literature, for example,
                                                     developed by the EC External Services Evaluation Unit10 are

                                                     to its minimum annual recharge rate” and UN-Water’s

                                                     (without consideration of the capacity to harvest and use this
                                                     resource).11

                                                     water withdrawal, the indicator will tend to overestimate
                                                     total water withdrawal. There is no universally agreed on
                                                     method for the computation of incoming flows originating

                                                     through indirect methods.14 Indirect measures may include

                                                    compared with a business-as-usual scenario. The net carbon
                                                    balance should account for the emissions from all GHGs, that

                                                    biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil carbon). The IPCC
                                                    provides a methodology for national and subnational estimation

                                                    relies on a universal emission factor combined with activity
                                                    data; Tier 2 utilizes a country-specific emission factor; and
                                                    Tier 3 involves direct measurement or modeling approaches.
                                                    Such estimates are used for both international reporting to the
                                                    UNFCCC and national and subnational reporting purposes.18
                                                    There is a range of GHG accounting tools that allow the
                                                    estimation of this indicator. For instance, the Ex-ante Carbon-

                                                    ante estimates of the impact of AFOLU projects and can be
                                                    used for monitoring progress.19 Considering the landscape
                                                    approach, the net carbon balance can be computed for several
                                                    activities separately. These activities may include land use
                                                    change, improvement of crop management practices, and
                                                    reduction of land degradation.

 Topic: Yield
     18 Crop yield in                  kg/ha         In the past decades, crop production increased significantly,            P, R
        kilograms per                                mainly owing to intensification of crop production. Although
        hectare and year                             intensification and increased input use may lead to increases
                                                     in GHG emission, studies have concluded that the avoided
                                                     emission from land use change outweighs this increase (FAO,

                                                     year allows insights into reaching yield gap, which is essential
                                                     to improve food security. “Yield gap” refers to the difference
                                                     between actual and potential yield, where the yield potential
                                                     should ideally be collected from the project area rather than
                                                     using national crop statistics (GDPRD 2008).

                                                     crop or cereal yield can be considered. “The aggregation of

     19 Yield variability per standard  Indicator 19 focuses on changes in mean yield as a response to                   R
        hectare and year and deviation/ CSA practices. An indicator on yield variability is needed to
        crop                  mean      assess the stability of food supply. A recent study demonstrated
                                        that in the past, climate variability accounted for roughly
                                        a third of crop yield variability in key crops (maize, wheat,
                                        soybeans), on average 30%, but in some regions even causing
                                        more than 60% of the variability. Future increases in yield
                                        variability are expected, posing increasing challenges to
                                        farmers (Challinor et al. 2014).22 The coefficients of variation
                                        measure is frequently used to assess yield variability. It is a
                                        relative measure of variation, defined as the standard deviation
                                        expressed as a percentage of the mean. Ray et al. (2015)
                                        assessed the CV for several crops for a period of 30 years and
                                        found that maize yields had a global average variability of
                                        ~0.9 tons/ha/year (s.d.), which corresponds to ~22% of the
                                        global average yields of ~4 tons/ha/year. The global average
                                        rice yield variability was 13% of average rice yields and the
                                        global average wheat yield variability (s.d.) was 0.4 tons/ha/
                                        year (~17% of average yields over the study period).

Topic: Benefits and welfare
21 Annual household                USD       Agricultural household income is considered among the key             R
   income from                               indicators to monitor and evaluate the results of development
   agricultural activity                     policies and interventions. However, national statistical offices
                                             often have difficulties in providing this indicator owing to
                                             technical difficulties or data availability (Keita and Pizzoli
                                             n.d.). Often microdata on household expenditures derived
                                             from household surveys is used. Increasing trends in household
                                             income as a consequence of the intervention may be realized
                                             only several years after the intervention. Similarly, yield
                                             increases may be realized only years after the intervention
                                             and farmers may have to bear increased costs related to the
                                             adoption of the technique in the initial phase of intervention.
                                             This indicator could also be expressed in terms of annual
                                             growth rate of household income rather than an absolute
                                             measure. Complementarily, it may be interesting to look at
                                             the income from nonagricultural activities to understand how
                                             farmers diversify their income when confronted with climate-
                                             induced production risk.
