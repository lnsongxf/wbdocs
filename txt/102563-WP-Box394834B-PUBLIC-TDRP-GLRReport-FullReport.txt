                                                7. Demographics

T        he following is a capture of the demographics of the ex-combatant sample for this comparative study. The
         demographics reflected in the sample here are not those of the overall ex-combatant populations in each of
         the five GLR countries at the time of study, but rather reflect certain purposive sampling biases. For more
information about the specific sampling methods and decisions in each of the GLR countries please see the individ-
ual survey studies for ex-combatants in each of the five GLR countries.93 For a brief introduction to the reintegration
programming context in each of the GLR countries see section 5.1.
The unweighted ex-combatant sample contributions from the five GLR countries for the total sample of 6,475 ex-
combatants in this study is as follows: Burundi comprises 19.4% (n=1,256) of the total raw sample, DRC 56%
(n=3,625), Republic of Congo 10.3% (N=667), Rwanda 8% (N=517) and Uganda 6.3% (N=410). However, in
an effort to create valid cross-country analysis of ex-combatants across the GLR, and especially for comparison to
the community member sample, which contains proportionally different sample contributions from the five GLR
countries, the raw sample contributions from each country have been weighted evenly.
Integrating the full range of data from Rwanda has proved challenging in this study. The evolving format for the
individual GLR country surveys has been a continual process of learning and iterative refinement. The Rwanda
survey format is the starting point from which surveys evolved in RoC, Burundi, Uganda, and DRC. So, while data
content in the Rwanda surveys is very much in line with the rest of the GLR countries, much of the specific question
formatting is often different enough that a direct comparison of data is not feasible. Such instances are explained in
footnotes.
Collectively the data restrictions present in this study of ex-combatants across the GLR countries mean that the task
of this study is to present a mosaic of findings. Up close, the pieces of the picture are not always complete and data
is not always congruent. Nonetheless, there are clear data trends that represent a distinct narrative of ex-combatant
reintegration across the GLR countries.
Of the total sample of ex-combatants 88.1% were male and 11.9% were female. While across all individual coun-
tries the disparity of representation of males and females was high, this is most true in Rwanda where only 2.5% of
the country sample was female. The sample contribution from Uganda was comprised of the largest proportion
of women (25.4%). The remaining countries fell closer to the overall sample composition.94 Table 1 above gives
a cross-tabulated breakdown of the age, sex and disability of the ex-combatant sample from each of the five GLR
countries.95

94   It is important to note that a portion of ex-combatants never participate in formal reintegration programming. This is especially true of female
ex-combatants who are hyperaware of the heavy stigmatization that can accopmony self-identification as an ex-combatant. As such, the actual proportion of
female ex-combatants in the GLR is likely higher than the figures above suggest.
95   For the purposes of this report as a comparative study the demographic breakdown of the Ex-combatant sample by armed group will not be included
for systematic analysis. The contexts of the different armed groups within the five GLR countries are seen as unique to each country context thus, while
important units of analysis within each GLR country, not systematically comparable across the GLR countries. Further details on the Ex-combatant sample
by armed group within each country are available in some of the five GLR country survey reports.

In the total sample of ex-combatants 10.9% were categorized as disabled, the remaining 89.1% were categorized as
not disabled. Most GLR countries were composed of a similar proportion of disabled ex-combatants, though Rwanda
and Uganda had higher representations of disabled ex-combatants – 24.1% and 17.1% respectively. However, these
higher compositions of disabled ex-combatants may be an artifact of the process by which disability categorizations
were combined across the total sample.96
Of the total sample of ex-combatants 39.5% are between the ages of 18 and 30, 35% are between 31 and 40 years of
age, and 25.6% are over the age of 40.97 Most of the GLR countries’ age compositions follow the trend of the total
sample split, with two notable exceptions. Burundi’s age composition is heavily skewed towards those aged 18-30
(65.4%), and Rwanda is particularly heavy in the 31-40 years of age category (53.4%). In the case of Rwanda this
age composition is likely a result of ex-combatants prolonged time spent participating in conflict – 50.9% of ex-
combatants in Rwanda having spent between 10 and 20 years participating in conflict.
The aspects of the lives of ex-combatants discussed in the following sections are key indicators of the process that
ex-combatants experience in accessing pathways to reintegration across the GLR countries. Within the following
sections of this report age, gender and disability dimensions to these processes to reintegration are explored to
extract key trends across the GLR countries. The family and community, education and training, and addressing
health needs are all seen as key pathways to reintegration of ex-combatants that will temper this discussion.

7.1 From Mobilization to Demobilization
The following is a brief snapshot of the ex-combatants’ time with armed groups and the ways in which pertinent
demographic details play in their experiences. Indeed, understanding the dynamics of the pathways into mobiliza-
tion can add considerable nuance to our understanding of the specific challenges that ex-combatants can face at the
time of demobilization.


96   Criteria for disability varied slightly from country to country across the GLR. To create a consistent categorization of disabled ex-combatants across
the GLR countries, disability status was computed using the disability criteria from the Ugandan Amnesty Commission which included: (i) amputees; (ii)
blind and partially blind; (iii) paralysis and partial paralysis; and (iv) body and head injury.
97   Across the total sample of ex-combatants from across the five GLR countries there were 300 under the age of 18. These 300 have been omitted
from the analysis in this study for two main reasons: (i) the systematic capture of information pertaining to the specific dynamics of reintegration facing
minors was absent from the surveys used across the GLR countries – with the exception of DRC, where 291 of the total 300 ex-combatants under the age
were sampled; and (ii) the validity issues that the small sample of ex-combatants under the age of 18 (again, almost entirely from DRC) make meaningful
comparative analysis infeasible.

While obtaining reliable information about ex-combatants’ age at mobilization, especially younger ex-combatants
who may have been only adolescents, is a challenging endeavor we can pull out general trends for comparison across
the GLR countries. The following data should be treated with caution and be regarded as a rough picture rather than
concrete truth of age of mobilization in the GLR countries.98 The average age at mobilization was 23.8 across the
GLR countries, however this figure masks considerable nuance in the age at mobilization.99 There are two steps to
understanding age at mobilization more deeply. First is to understand the proportion of ex-combatants mobilized
in different age brackets and then to understand the average age at mobilization within each bracket – this data is
displayed in Table 2.
The largest proportion of ex-combatants across the GLR countries (46.1%) was between the ages of 18 and 30 at the
time of mobilization (on average aged 22.6). Indeed, with all GLR countries the 18-30 group is the largest. However,
it is important to note the sizable number of ex-combatants who were mobilized under the age of 18 (38.9%) and
who were very young at the time (on average at age 13.79) – a factor that can have a profound impact on their psy-
chosocial wellbeing and in turn prospects for reintegration. The under 18 category was second largest within all GLR
countries and in some almost even with the 18-30 category – for example in DRC where 43% of ex-combatants were
aged under 18 at the time of mobilization (on average 13.79) and 48.1% were aged 18-30 (on average 22.21).100
Mobilization into violent conflict at an adolescent age can have a profound impact on the social and psychologi-
cal development of individuals as they mature and, in turn, carry considerable weight for their ability to interact


98  	 For example, in Uganda 41.95% of ex-combatants were unsure of their age at the time of mobilization. However, working backwards from the
current age of ex-combatants we can subtract away the time since demobilization and the time spent with armed groups to calculate an approximate age at
mobilization for all ex-combatants. 	
99  	 Rwanda is excluded from all findings on age at mobilization due to lack of directly comparable data. 
100  	 Disaggregation of the average age at mobilization in Uganda by armed group provides some necessary nuance here. The average age at mobilization
for members of the LRA in Uganda, known for their strategy of youth abduction for mobilization, was 18.38 years. This stands in contrast to the ADF who
had an average age of mobilization at 31.02 years, West Nile Bank Front with 41.34 years, and UNRF with 42.18 years. Further examination reveals that
51.3% of LRA ex-combatants were mobilized under the age of 18, with an average age of 12.78.




                                                                                43
with communities upon their return. While data on abduction versus voluntary mobilization was not available for
comparison across the GLR countries, this data may have added considerable nuance in exploring further gendered
dynamics of mobilization. For example in Uganda, the only GLR country in which such data is available, where
abduction is a well-known tactic for recruitment and mobilization 92.9% of females sampled between the age of 18
and 30 reported being abducted. Though as a counterpoint, there is reason to be cautious to such data. There are
enormous social pressures at work and ex-combatants may fear stigma, retribution, or denial of amnesty as a result
identifying themselves as willing participants in conflict – possibly inflating the proportion of ex-combatants that
report abduction.
As illustrated in Table 2, it appears that there are certain gendered dynamics to the age of mobilization. Across the
GLR sample, female ex-combatants were more frequently mobilized under the age of 18 (40.1%, average age 13.58)
when compared to male ex-combatants (32.3%, average age 13.83), and with decreasing frequency as the age at mo-
bilization increases – 64.1% between the ages of 18 and 30, 8.8% between the ages of 31 and 40, and 3.9% over the
age of 40. This trend holds true in all of the GLR countries except for the Republic of Congo in which the pattern of
age at mobilization follows more closely to the male ex-combatants’ trend in which the majority of ex-combatants
are mobilized between the ages of 18 and 30. Thought he exact reason for this gendered dimension to the age of
mobilization is unclear, it is likely related to the benefits of mobilizing child soldier from an armed group’s perspec-
tive – though child soldiers may be less effective soldiers in the traditional sense they are also easier to intimidate,
indoctrinate, and misinform than adults.101
Not surprisingly current age showed a positive correlation to age at mobilization – meaning that on average the older
an ex-combatant was at the age of mobilization the older they were at the time of sampling. Disability did not show
any relationship to age at mobilization.
Across the GLR countries the average number of years ex-combatants had spent with armed groups varied. At a
cross-country level ex-combatants in the GLR countries spent an average of 7.08 years with armed groups. DRC and
Rwanda stand out on the high end of this cross-country average with 11.16 years and 9.09 years spent with armed
groups on average (respectively). Ex-combatants in Uganda spent the least amount of time on average with armed
groups (4.38 years). A full table of the average time spent with armed groups is presented in Table 3. Drawing from
DRC and Rwanda we can observe that those ex-combatants that were members of national armed forces (FAC in
DRC and RPA in Rwanda) spent longer on average participating in conflict than those in other irregular armed
groups (mean 18.99 years vs. 5.27 years in DRC and mean 12.57 vs. 8.15 years in Rwanda).102
The number of years spent with armed groups displayed a gendered trend across the GLR countries. Female ex-
combatants spent a lower average number of years (mean = 4.95 years) with armed groups compared to their male
ex-combatant counterparts (mean = 7.37 years). This trend holds across the GLR countries with the exception of
Uganda – in which female ex-combatants spent on average slightly more years (mean = 4.84 years) than their male
ex-combatant counterparts (mean = 4.22 years). A more detailed breakdown of years spent with armed groups
across cross-cutting demographic lines can be found below in Table 3.
Again, as with age at time of mobilization, current age showed a positive correlation to years spent with armed
groups at a cross-country level. Though RoC and Uganda stood apart from this trend – in Uganda there was even
a negative relationship between current age and average years spent with armed groups. Those ex-combatants who
were categorized as disabled spent slightly longer on average (mean = 9.40 years) compared to their non-disabled
counterparts (mean = 7.27 years).

102   The caseload of ex-combatants in Uganda and RoC consisted almost wholly of ex-combatants from irregular armed groups (such as the LRA and
ADF in Uganda and the Ninjas in RoC), thus a valid comparison of their average time spent with armed groups compared to national armed forces is not
feasible here.

On average across the GLR countries it had been 4.05 years since ex-combatants were formally demobilized at the
time of sampling. In Uganda the time since demobilization was about half the cross-country average (1.87 years)
while in RoC it was roughly twice the cross-country average (8.07 years).103 It is important to remember that some
ex-combatants may spontaneously self-demobilize during conflict, leaving behind their armed groups. In addition,
after the cessation of violence, ex-combatants may leave armed groups and return to their home community, or
another place, on their own initiative. A considerable amount of time may pass between these ‘informal’ demobili-
zations and the point at which ex-combatants take part in a formal demobilization process. Being able to measure
this gap may prove an important indicator in assessing dynamics of return within the GLR countries. Unfortunately,
while there is data on formal demobilization across the GLR countries, there is only data in Uganda on both informal
and formal demobilization collected – 42.1% having informally demobilized as much as a decade or more before
participating in formal demobilization processes. These findings however are most likely relevant to the specific
dynamics of return and reintegration in Uganda where ex-combatants escape from armed groups (primarily the
LRA) and return directly to their communities and then retroactively applying for amnesty, reinsertion assistance
and possibly attain further referral to reintegration programming – often with a lengthy time-lapse. In contrast, other
reintegration programs in the GLR leave few opportunities for accessing reintegration benefits without participating
in a formal demobilization process and a fairly linear supply of reinsertion and reintegration assistance upon their
return.104

7.2 Marriage and Household
Marriage dynamics are an important indicator of ex-combatants’ basic social standing. Indeed, marriage dynamics
can tell us much about ex-combatants’ ability to leverage familial, economic, and social networks towards the attain-
ment of marriage and in turn their ability redouble their engagement in these social structures through marriage – all
indicators of a strong footing in the community.
Across the GLR countries there is a clear trend of increasing marriage and cohabitation rates among ex-combatants
at three time points: before demobilization, at demobilization, and at sampling. As is visible in Table 4, the propor-
tion of ex-combatants that were married across the GLR countries increased from 33.9% prior to demobilization,



103   Though examination of trends by armed group is not included in the analysis here, it is worth noting that in Uganda membership to different armed
groups appeared to play an important role in the time since demobilization and could serve as a valuable line of inquiry for more focused analysis within each
of the individual GLR countries.

Dynamics Survey Report Reporter Re-integration and Community Dynamics Survey Report.




                                                                             45
to 36% at demobilization, and 46.8% at the time of sampling.105 These increases in marriage (and cohabitation)
rates among ex-combatants are matched by an even clearer decline in the proportions that were single and or never
married.
There are two noteworthy trends in regards to the trajectory of ex-combatant marital status with the specific GLR
countries. First, in RoC the proportion of married ex-combatants at all three time points was much lower than
the GLR cross-country average (6.7% prior to demobilization, 5.6% at demobilization, and 5.6% at the time of
sampling), instead the decrease in the proportion of ex-combatants that were single / never married were absorbed
into the category ‘living together’ (47.1% prior demobilization, 60.1% at demobilization, and 75.3% at the time of
sampling). Second, Rwanda is the only GLR country in which ex-combatants are more frequently married than
community members at the time of sampling (77.4% vs. 46.9%) – a point that will receive attention in the summary
of the ex-combatant portion of this study.
There are certain demographic trends that can be extracted regarding marriage. Concerning gender, female ex-com-
batants are less likely to be married at all time points than male ex-combatants. As is visible in Table 4, this disparity
between female and male ex-combatants grows from 7.7% prior to demobilization, to 13.2% at the time of demo-
bilization, and 24.2% at the time of sampling. This growing disparity between male and female ex-combatants can
be explained in part by looking at the proportion of female-combatants who were divorced, separated, or widowed
compared to male ex-combatants – female ex-combatants are the most likely to be divorced, separated, or widowed
at any time period.
Essentially it appears that while male ex-combatants’ marital trajectory across the three time points is primarily one
of moving from single / never married to married or living together, female ex-combatants by contrast see only very
marginal increases in marriage and cohabitation – instead their decreases in the single / never married category are
absorbed into the divorced or separated, or widowed categories. These differing trajectories flag female ex-combat-
ants across the GLR countries as facing clear barriers to accessing marriage and in turn the primary social unit for
reintegration, the family, leaving them at increased risk for social isolation and marginalization. It is likely that stigma
plays a core role in female ex-combatants very shallow trajectory towards marriage compared male ex-combatants.106
While male and female ex-combatants alike carry the burden of stigma and distrust as perpetrators of violence,
female ex-combatants can face the additional cultural stigma of having stepped out of traditional gender roles.
Turning now to age demographics, at all time points age shows a positive relationship to the likelihood of being
married and accordingly a negative relationship to the likelihood of being single / never married (as is visible in
Table 4). While those aged 18-30 are the least likely age demographic to be married at all time points they have the
most positive trajectory towards marriage across age demographics – there is a 25.6% increase in the rate of marriage
between prior to demobilization and the time of sampling among those aged 18-30 versus a 22.1% increase in those
31-40, and only 1.9% increase in those over the age of 40. So while it appears that younger ex-combatants face
considerable challenges in accessing reintegration pathways through marriage compared to other age demograph-
ics, their rate of change towards the near stagnant levels of marriage among those over 40 is the greatest – giving
credence to the idea that one dimension to younger ex-combatants’ lag behind their elder peers, struggling to make
up for time lost in conflict.
As seen above divorce was low across the GLR countries, however of those who were divorced 26% of ex-combatants
across the GLR countries said that their divorce was related to their ex-combatant status.107 When asked to explain

Burundi is excluded from findings on marital status at demobilization due to lack of directly comparable data.

Rwanda is not calculated into the cross-country statistics for marital status at the time of sampling. Essentially, even with the sample weighting, including Rwanda
in cross-country figures on marital status at the time of sampling can make it appear as though across the entire GLR ex-combatants marry more often than com-
munity members – even though Rwanda is the only country in which this is actually true.




                                                                                47
more specifically the most common responses were: (i) Stigma or the influence of the spouses family (19%); (ii)
the emotional abuse and fear that spouses married with ex-combatants faces; (iii) lack of tools or money. Female
ex-combatants most notably cited that they were in the bush with their spouse, but escaped leaving them behind
(29.9%).
On average across the GLR countries, 13.5% of ex-combatants who were married had a spouse who either was then,
or had at one point been a combatant.108 The GLR countries deviating notably from this trend were RoC, in which
a slightly higher proportion of ex-combatants had a spouse who was or had at one point been a combatant (24%),
and Rwanda where rates of marriage with other ex-combatants were considerably lower (3%). The proportion of ex-
combatants with a current or past spouse who is or was a combatant was fairly even across all demographics except
for sex. Female ex-combatants were vastly more likely to currently have, or at one point have had, a spouse who was
a combatant (53%) compared to male ex-combatants (9.1%). There are two dynamics which likely play some role in
these findings: (i) in conflict where the proportion of females to males is relatively low it may be that female combat-
ants marry at a higher rate than male combatants and (ii) upon return to the community female ex-combatants may
face higher barriers (e.g. stigma) to marriage with non ex-combatants (see below).
Across the GLR countries, ex-combatants’ attitudes towards marrying another ex-combatant varied considerably –
in DRC as low as 25% would consider marrying another ex-combatant, and as high as 54.2% in Uganda. However, on
average 32.2% of ex-combatants across the GLR countries would consider marrying another ex-combatant.109 Con-
current to the rate at which ex-combatants marry other ex-combatants outlined above, attitudes towards marrying
ex-combatants in the future display a distinctly gendered dynamic – 50.2% of female ex-combatants across the GLR
countries would consider marrying an ex-combatant versus 29.8% of males.
When asked to explain negative attitudes towards marrying another ex-combatant respondents most commonly
cited the misbehavior of ex-combatants (22.7%) or stigma related the perceived criminality of ex-combatants
(16.7%).110 Uganda was the only GLR country that departed from this trend – as stigma was only cited by 3.1% of
ex-combatants and instead risk associated with living with ex-combatants (12.5%) was cited most commonly. Of
female ex-combatants that would not consider marrying an ex-combatant, 28.4% cited stigma due to their perceived
criminality as an explanation, compared to 15.6% of male ex-combatants.
Across the GLR countries ex-combatants most commonly saw themselves as the household head (52.8%) – re-
sponsible for household food and finances – followed by those who saw themselves and their spouse as respon-
sible (19%) and those who saw only their spouse as responsible (6.7%).111 Across demographic lines there are
clear trends: (I) female ex-combatants are less than half as likely as male ex-combatants to cite themselves as the
household head (25.4% vs. 57%); (ii) female ex-combatants are vastly more likely to cite solely their spouse as the
household head than male ex-combatants (21.9% vs. 4.4%); and (iii) both disabled ex-combatants and those aged
18-30 are far more likely to cite their parents and grandparents than non-disabled and other age demographic ex-
combatants (14% of disabled vs. 5.7% of non-disabled, and 15.3% of those aged 18-30 vs. 1.3% of those 31-40 and
0.5% of those over 40).

asked in one question, whereas in Uganda these were two separate questions (finance and food respectively). However, due to the high correlation between
the two answers in Uganda (over 80%) they were recoded as one question for direct comparability with the other GLR countries. Rwanda is excluded from
findings on household food and finance responsibility due to lack of directly comparable data.

males for example).112 Disabled ex-com-
batants and ex-combatants age 18-30 also scored notably lower on literacy. Across the GLR countries these three
categories (female, disabled and age 18-30) of ex-combatants were consistently poor performers on literacy, though
they closely switch places for worst performer within the individual GLR countries. These trends are displayed in
Table 5.
Regarding educational achievement there was very little change across all demographic groups between level of
educational achievement at demobilization and at the time of sampling. The largest portion of all ex-combatants
had some primary level of education (33.6%) at the time of demobilization and at the time of sampling (34.2%),
followed by some secondary education (26.3% at demobilization and 23.4% at sampling).113 However, as is visible
in Table 6, there is considerable variation in the individual GLR countries as far as the levels of ex-combatant educa-
tional achievement. Generally speaking, ex-combatants in Burundi and Uganda had educational achievement levels
skewed more towards partial or complete primary education, while those in DRC and RoC were more skewed
towards partial or complete secondary education.
Again, while there was generally very little change in ex-combatants’ educational achievement levels in the time
between demobilization and sampling (which as discussed above was on average 4.05 years) DRC and RoC stand
out in that ex-combatants across all levels of educational achievement at the time of demobilization were absorbed
substantially into professional level achievement at the time of sampling (visible in Table 6), though this was especial-
ly true for male ex-combatants in DRC.114 Across the GLR countries female ex-combatants educational achievement
levels were skewed lower than their male counterparts at demobilization and the time of sampling. Ex-combatants

114   Movement into professional level educational achievement is likely related to vocational training provided as a part of reintegration programming.
Vocational training is a component of most reintegration programs in the GLR countries, however they were an especially large component in DRC
specifically – where vocational training was given to ex-combatants and community members together in combination with the formation of related
economic associations.

In line with the very low levels of mobility in ex-combatants’ levels of educational achievement between demobi-
lization and sampling, only 15.2% of ex-combatants across the GLR countries reported that they were continuing
education since demobilization.115 DRC, where 30.2% of ex-combatants were continuing education, was the only
GLR country that stood out significantly from this trend. Ex-combatants aged 18-30 were the most likely (18.8%)
demographic group across the GLR countries to be continuing education since demobilization. Of those who were
continuing education since demobilization across the GLR countries, the most notable pathways were: (i) pursuing
professional qualifications (34.8%), or (ii) pursuing normal academic qualifications (34.1%).

considerably lower reported participation.
While at a cross-country level it appears as though there is a slight positive relationship between age and the likeli-
hood of receiving vocational training, this is only truly evident in DRC. Female ex-combatants, however, are slightly
more likely to receive vocational training compared to male ex-combatants (47.3% vs. 41.2%), with the exception of
RoC where they pair only slightly lower (18% vs. 20.6%).
Of those ex-combatants who had received skills or vocational training, the majority (62.7%) were utilizing these
skills and training.118 Female ex-combatants were using skills and training slightly less than male ex-combatants
(61.3% vs. 63%). In addition ex-combatants were using their skills and training progressively more across age demo-
graphics (53.9% for ages 18-30, 56.8% for ages 31-40, and 76.3% for those over 40). Disabled ex-combatants utilized
their skills and training at a lesser frequency (54.5%) than their non-disabled counterparts (63.8%).119 Of those ex-
combatants who were not using their skills and vocational training the most common explanations were: (i) 29.4%
lost necessary tools and have no money for new ones, (ii) 21.6% lack of capital, and (iii) 10.9% lack of facilities for
carrying out the vocation and skills they were trained in.

7.4 Summary
Conflict represents an immense social disruption that often results in the disintegration of families, communities,
and the broader fabric of society. The process of DDR is aimed at reconnecting the fractured pieces of these social
entities so that collective norms and processes can be re-solidified. For ex-combatants facing this transition from
conflict to peace by returning to families, gaining economic independence and participating in their communities
represent the core challenges of reintegration. While there are few that do not feel the effects of conflict across the

GLR countries, it is noteworthy that ex-combatants face a range of distinct challenges in the process of reintegra-
tion.
A large proportion of ex-combatants across the GLR countries were mobilized into conflict under the age of 18
(who were on average only early adolescents around 13 years old) and spent a number of their formative years as
adults socialized in a context of violence. One way to view this is that a significant proportion of ex-combatants have
missed the opportunity of the socialization of adult norms and behavior during normal peacetime, setting them
with a steep learning curve upon return for socializing to these norms and values that they may have never learned in
the first place – due to their absence from traditional family and community structures during their formative adult
years in conflict. Further study into the specific modes of mobilization, for example abduction, may add consider-
able explanatory power to the specific challenges the ex-combatants who were mobilized at a young age face. While
the evidence presented on the age at mobilization is not conclusive, this line of inquiry deserves further attention in
future studies.
Ex-combatants across the GLR countries, with the exception of Rwanda, are married less frequently than commu-
nity members. However, ex-combatants generally show a positive trajectory towards marriage and cohabitation over
time. It appears that across the GLR, ex-combatants’ largest obstacle in reintegrating into, or in most cases building
the familial unit is making up for the time lost by participation in conflict, especially for younger ex-combatants.
Ex-combatants’ levels of educational achievement and literacy are skewed slightly lower than community members’
– with lower levels of partial secondary, secondary, partial tertiary, or complete tertiary level achievement. While
educational mobility was very low in general, it appears as though time lost while in conflict is a significant barrier
to educational achievement – especially for younger ex-combatants who are a step behind their older peers, but are
more aggressive about closing this gap through continuing education since demobilization.

7.4.1 Vulnerable Subgroups
As discussed above, while younger ex-combatants (aged 18-30) tend to be a step behind their older peers as far as
access to marriage and educational achievement, this appears to be a product of the time lost while in conflict. In
addition, though younger ex-combatants tend to be a step behind, they share the same general positive trajectory
as their older peers. Female ex-combatants, however, show a widening gap in relation to male ex-combatants – who
themselves generally have a positive trajectory in terms of education and marriage.
In assessing trends in marriage across the GLR countries we can summarize several key points regarding female
ex-combatants: (i) female ex-combatants are less likely than male ex-combatants to be married or cohabitate; (ii)
the gap in marriage and cohabitation rates between male and female ex-combatants has grown over time from prior
to demobilization to the time of sampling; and (iii) female ex-combatants are the most likely group to be divorced,
widowed, or separated. The weight of female ex-combatants’ disadvantage in these regards is exaggerated further
when compared to female community members marriage rates – who themselves rank lower in marriage rates than
male community members, though still notably higher than female ex-combatants (31.7% of female ex-combatants
are married versus 38.1% of female community members). Essentially while male ex-combatants are making steady
progress towards parity with community members in terms of marriage, female ex-combatants’ progress is extreme-
ly shallow.
Female ex-combatants also have the lowest prospects for marriage in the future, as attitudinal indicators reveal that
male ex-combatants are much less likely to be willing to marry another ex-combatant than female ex-combatant
(29.8% vs. 50.2%). When analyzed against the back drop of community members’ ranking on the same attitudinal
indicator (25.7% of male community members and 25% of female community members would consider marrying
an ex-combatant) we can see that female ex-combatants have a considerably smaller pool of individuals who are at-
titudinally open to marrying them compared to male ex-combatants.




                                                          52
Collectively these findings cement the fact that in the GLR countries female ex-combatants are not only the least
likely group across all demographics (ex-combatants and community members alike) to be married and have a
family, but also the group that faces the largest barriers to accessing marriage in the future – placing them outside of
the primary unit of reintegration and at substantial risk for marginalization and social isolation.
As an additional note, female ex-combatants lag behind male ex-combatants with lower levels of literacy, and educa-
tional achievement – also lagging behind the female community members on both measures as well. As with those
aged 18-30, female ex-combatants are slightly more aggressive than their male counterparts (16.5% vs. 15.1%) in
pursuing further education to close this gap.
7.4.2 Unique Country Trends
Rwanda stands out from the rest of the GLR countries as the only country where ex-combatants appear to be more
frequently married than community members – and to a considerable extent (77.4% versus 46.9%). However, there
are reasons to be skeptical to these figures. In the Rwandan sample female ex-combatants (a group that consistently
displayed the lowest marriage rates across the other GLR countries) were severely under represented (only 2.5% or
n= 13 of the total 517 Rwandan ex-combatants) compared to female community members (31.2% or n=159 or the
total community member sample). In addition, those ex-combatants aged 18-30 (who across all other GLR coun-
tries were the least likely age demographic to be married) were more than twice as represented in the community
member sample (57% or n=290) as in the ex-combatant sample (22.6% or n=132). In effect, these facets of the
demographic representations in the ex-combatant and community member samples may have inflated the rate at
which it appears that ex-combatants marry, and deflated the rate at which community members appear to marry.
However, there are further contextual details to consider in terms of marriage in the case of Rwanda. In Rwanda
males are required to have access to adequate housing in order to get married. However, the formal regulations for
what qualifies as adequate housing in Rwanda are somewhat narrowly defined under the policy of imidugudu – a
large scale body of housing policy aimed at consolidating dispersed land and housing in an overall effort toward
villagization. The result has been inflation in adequate housing prices and in turn a severe crisis in the availability
of adequate housing overall that in effect is locking many Rwandans out of official marriage – though they may co-
habitate without formalized marital status.120 This dynamic may further deflate the rate of marriage in Rwanda for
community members.
In contrast to community members, most ex-combatants are returning to Rwanda from Eastern DRC, where they
have been away for an average of nine years. In this time some ex-combatants have married and when returning to
Rwanda bring their spouse with them. The legal status of these marriages in Rwanda is unclear, however it is possible
that some ex-combatants unwittingly navigate past the formal barriers to marriage that community members
face – in turn accounting for their slightly higher marriage rates. While it is likely that the interaction of housing
policy, marriage, and dynamics of return are key in understanding why ex-combatants marry more than community
members in Rwanda, this exact narrative must be treated as conjecture. In the future a more focused inquiry into
the dynamics of ex-combatant and community member marriage in Rwanda could prove prudent. For if indeed ex-
combatants have been more successful than community members in accessing pathways to marriage in Rwanda the
details of this finding could hold considerable explanatory value in analyzing other cases and, not least, in develop-
ing reintegration programming in the future.

other GLR countries (5.6% of ex-combatants and 18.5% of community members at the time of sampling were

married versus 60.2% and 64.3% on average of the remaining respective ex-combatants and community members),
stood out as well. What is notable in RoC is that while marriage rates are much lower than average across the GLR
countries, a much higher proportion of both ex-combatants and community members are cohabitating, but are not
married, than on average across the GLR countries (75.3% of ex-combatants and 53.5% of community members in
RoC were cohabitation versus 8.9% and 4.9% on average of the remaining respective ex-combatants and community
members across the GLR).
It appears that while community members do access marriage at a higher rate than ex-combatants in RoC, commu-
nity members also face considerable barriers to accessing marriage themselves. Instead the most significant marital
status for both community members and ex-combatants alike is cohabitation. As ex-combatants’ levels of cohabi-
tation in RoC increase from 47.1% prior to demobilization, to 60.1% at demobilization, and 75.3% at sampling,
it would appear as though this is the primary pathway to accessing the familial unit. Further study to explore the
dynamics of formal and informal marriage in RoC would prove illuminating – especially if formal marriage, largely
understood as the primary pathway to accessing the familial unit, is not necessary for reintegration in the RoC
context. It should also be noted that without a clear explanation or triangulation for RoC’s departure in terms of
marriage rates the data should also be treated carefully. It is possible that there are unbeknownst errors in data
capture or coding that have produced these findings.
Lastly, in Uganda ex-combatants are considerably more likely than average across the GLR countries to report will-
ingness to marrying an ex-combatant in the future. Though there is no direct explanation it is possible that the
specific dynamics of combatant mobilization in Uganda may play a role in this trend. In Uganda abduction was
a well-known tactic of mobilization, especially by the LRA. Though abductees may have committed violent acts
against their communities, often forcibly, there is evidence that ex-combatants are simultaneously understood as
victims and perpetrators by community members – a factor that has reportedly contributed to a general willingness
to accept returning ex-combatants back into communities.121 This dynamic, combined with the extensive use of
traditional reconciliation ceremonies (not necessarily part of reintegration programming), may contribute to com-
munity members in Uganda’s openness to marriage with ex-combatants. Futures studies could flag this conjecture
for further analysis.

                                   and Food Security
The following is an examination of the core dimensions of: (i) the types of dwellings that ex-combatants live in and
related issues such as ownership and tenure; (ii) access to land for agricultural production and (iii) its connection
to food security.

8.1 Dwelling, Living Conditions and Land Security
In examining who ex-combatants live with across the GLR countries the three most common categories are: (i)
with the same family as before conflict (29.2%), (ii) with a family but different to that from before conflict (24.3%),
and (iii) with a partner (19.9%). Two countries across the GLR stood out from this general trend. First in RoC the
majority ex-combatants reported living with a partner (43.6%) at a proportion more than double the cross-country
average. Second, in Rwanda the majority of ex-combatants reported living with a family that was different from the
one before conflict (57.7%) at a proportion more than double the cross-country average.
As is visible in Table 8 above, female ex-combatants were more likely to be living with a family either the same or dif-
ferent to the one before conflict than male ex-combatants – though less likely to be living with a partner or a family
that consisted of a partner and children. It is also noteworthy that disabled ex-combatants were the least likely demo-
graphic group to be living with a partner – at a proportion less than half the cross-country average.
Regarding housing types, there were diverse compositions across the GLR countries; however at a cross-country
level ex-combatants were most commonly living in: (i) a house (48.2%); or (ii) in a hut or tent (30.8%). Only

 The use of XXX indicates that respondents in Rwanda were not given the option to respond that they live with a partner or spouse – the responses that would have
 been in the feild are likely absorbed into the categories of those who live with a family either the same or different from the one before conflict.

Uganda stood out significantly from this trend, with the majority of ex-combatants (77.6%) living in a hut or tent.
Across demographic categories there was fairly even membership to types of housing categories. Though, female ex-
combatants were notably less likely to live in a house compared to male ex-combatants (41.8% vs. 49.1%) and more
likely to live in a hut or tent (43.7% vs. 29%).
There were varying rates of housing ownership across the GLR countries. Generally speaking self-ownership was the
most common across the GLR countries (41%), followed by family ownership (17.8%). However, in RoC family
member ownership was most common (29.7%) followed by self-ownership (24.7%).
As is visible in Table 9, housing ownership rates were consistently lower for female ex-combatants than male ex-com-
batants across the GLR countries; 22.8% of female ex-combatants owned their land versus 43.7% of male ex-com-
batants – though Rwanda is an exception from this trend where 63.9% of female ex-combatants owned their land
versus 39.1% of male ex-combatants. In contrast female ex-combatants were more likely to cite that their housing
was owned by their spouse (17.6% vs. 1.7%) or by family that they live with (13.7% vs. 6.8%) when compared
to male ex-combatants. Concerning age dynamics of housing ownership, there was a positive correlation visible
between age and rate of housing ownership. Inversely, as age increased ex-combatants were less likely to rely on their
relatives or family.
When housing ownership was cross-tabulated against marital status a clear trend emerged. Of those ex-combatants
who reported self-ownership of their housing, 68.4% were married and 16.9% were cohabitating – only 5.8% of
those who reported self-ownership were single / never married. Inversely, when we look at the marital status of
those who reported family ownership of their housing, 52.2% of those who reported their housing as owned by
family they live with and 39.8% of those who reported family ownership were single / never married. Marriage rates
show a clear correlation to housing ownership. This evidence supports the idea that marriage is a key pathway to
housing, land access and security.
Ex-combatants had a standard distribution of perceptions of their current living situation relative to perceptions at
the time of demobilization across all the GLR countries – 21.8% of ex-combatants saw their current living situation




                                                                56
as better than at the time of demobilization, 49% saw it as the same, 26.2% saw it as worse, and only 2.9% pointed out
that they did not have housing at the time of demobilization.122 Across demographic categories these perceptions
were remarkably even as well.
When examining ex-combatants’ perceptions of their own living situation compared to their neighbors, the majority
saw themselves as well off, or worse off.123 Only 10.9% of ex-combatants saw their neighbors as having a better living
situation, 47.8% saw it as the same, and 40.8% saw it as worse. There was some notable variation in ex-combatants’
perceptions of their living situation relative to their neighbors within specific GLR countries. In Uganda and Rwanda
ex-combatants were more likely to have seen their living situation as worse than their neighbors (53.7% and 52.6%
respectively) than in DRC and RoC (31.4% and 29.1% respectively). Looking at specific demographic differences it
is apparent that disabled ex-combatants more commonly saw their situation as worse than their neighbors (59.6%),
than non-disabled ex-combatants (38.3%).

8.2 Land Access and Food Security
Gaining access to land for agricultural production is seen as a key pathway to both economic mobility and food
security for ex-combatants. However, comparing land ownership across, and even within, the GLR countries can
prove challenging. In many areas land ownership structures vary considerably and thus across the context of findings.
For example, in many areas land ownership is organized around clans and infrequently owned on a private basis.
However, land tenure can be very secure because of the clan structure despite the absence of deeds or titles. Though
there is no systematic capture of the types of ownership structures across the GLR countries, these must be kept in
mind when viewing the findings in this section.
Land access for cultivation purposes was universally high across GLR countries and within crosscutting demograph-
ic categories, with 92.6% of ex-combatants having access to land for cultivation purposes. In Uganda a more in-depth
questioning of the tenure status of the land ex-combatants used for cultivation showed ex-combatants aged 18-31
were more likely to have a title for the land they cultivated (58.6%) compared to those 31-40 (29%) and those over
40 (30%). However these older age demographic groups were more likely than their younger counterparts to use
communally owned land: 40% of those aged over 40, 28% of those aged 31-40, and 16.6% of those 18-31. Disabled
ex-combatants also more frequently accessed communally owned land than non-disabled counterparts (35.7% vs.
26.5%). Though there is no comparable data for the other GLR countries these findings from Uganda may lend
some nuance to the land ownership dynamics across demographic lines.
Of the ex-combatants who did not have any access to land for cultivation at all in the DRC and RoC, lack of interest
(29.9%) and lack of capital (27.2%) were the most common explanations.124 Other notable trends were that female
ex-combatants more commonly cited fear of conflict (35.7%) than male ex-combatants (13.5%). Also, disabled ex-
combatants more commonly cited distance / living in the city (28.6%) as an explanation for their lack of access to
land for cultivation than their non-disabled counterparts (8.1%).
In examining changes in ex-combatants’ access to arable land over a two-year period it was found that a significant
proportion of ex-combatants (38%) had experienced an increase in their access to arable land over the last two
years.125 Despite this general trend, the GLR countries vary considerably on this point – see Table 10. On the one
hand, in DRC and RoC the majority ex-combatants had seen an increase in their access to land and, on the other

creased access to land for cultivation across the GLR countries. Looking to DRC, RoC, and Uganda we can observe
that 42.2% of ex-combatants explained their increased access to land as a result of a combination of factors: (i)
capital accrued from bountiful agricultural yields and (ii) the desire to produce more agriculturally for both subsis-
tence and commercial purposes. Likewise, when explaining unchanged or decreased access to land for agricultural
production in DRC and RoC 48.3% of ex-combatants cited lack of capital or resources as their primary barrier to
land access mobility.
While capital, especially that acquired through strong agricultural production, appears to be an important explana-
tion for ex-combatants’ upward land access mobility across the GLR countries, two other explanations also deserve
attention: (i) inheritance dynamics and (ii) marriage. These two pathways to land mobility appear especially relevant
to female ex-combatants and young ex-combatants (age 18-30).
In DRC and RoC 28.7% of ex-combatants (40.3% in DRC alone) cited inheritance as their pathway to increased
land access. This was especially true for younger ex-combatants (aged 18-30), of which 32.8% cited inheritance.
Further, while inheritance was only cited by 19.3% of ex-combatants in Uganda as their explanation for upward land
access mobility, 53.5% cited regulated division of their land, such as inheritance, sharing and dividing, as the reason
for their decreased access to land for cultivation. Female ex-combatants were significantly less likely than male ex-
combatants (19.7% vs. 29.6%) to cite inheritance as a pathway to increased land access – which could suggest a lack
of access to inheritance structures. Ex-combatants aged 18-30 were the most likely age demographic to cite inheri-
tance (32.3%) as their pathway to increased land access.
In terms of marriage, while in Uganda only 12.9% of ex-combatants cited marriage as a pathway to increased land
access an examination of demographic subgroups reveals that only 3.4% of male ex-combatants cited marriage as
their pathway to increased land access compared to 36.4% of female ex-combatants. In addition, 38.5% of those aged
18-30 cited marriage as their pathway to increased land access compared to 0.0% of those aged 31-40 or over 40.


126   With specific reference to Uganda, a more finely grained scale reveals that 10.4% had more land access, 63.4% had the same level of access, and
26.3% had less access.
127   Burundi and Rwanda are excluded from findings regarding explanations for access to more or less arable land due to lack of directly comparable
data.

countries – 33.5% of those aged 18-30, 35.1% of those aged 31-40 and 42.2% of those over 40. Increases in livestock
in the last two years were cited by 54.2% of ex-combatants across the GLR with a similar distribution across demo-
graphic lines. Of those ex-combatants who had no livestock, poverty and lack of resources was the most common
explanation (56.7%) followed by insecurity due to conflict (11.8%).
Beyond access to land for cultivation and the ownership of livestock, another important indicator of food security
is the level of household hunger and nutrition – presented in Table 11. Across the GLR countries 13% of ex-com-
batants explained that people in their household always go hungry, 37.3% they often went hungry, 28.7% that they
seldom went hungry and 16.1% that they never went hungry.129 The exception to this distribution is Uganda, where
the majority seldom went hungry (45.3%). In general rates of household hunger were very even across demographic
lines.
In regards to household nutrition 24.6% of ex-combatants said that in the last two years nutrition had improved,
43.8% that nutrition was unchanged and the remaining 31.6% that nutrition had worsened.130 Again, the only excep-
tion is Uganda, in which the proportion of ex-combatants with improvements in household nutrition was greater
(36.9%). Of those ex-combatants for which household nutrition had gotten worse in the last two years disabled ex-
combatants (39.2%) were more commonly represented compared to non-disabled ex-combatants (31%).

8.3 Summary
Ex-combatants display a very high level of access to housing and land for cultivation across the GLR countries. The
majorities of ex-combatants across the GLR countries are living in permanent housing, with a family or spouse
and see their living situation as equal to their neighbors – and in this sense have reached considerable parity with
community members. Assessing the security of their housing tenure, however, is more challenging. The variety of
housing ownership structures that exist across, and within, the GLR countries create unique contexts to land tenure

security. Owing to a lack of systematic capture of land ownership structures a direct comparison is not possible here.
However, what we can note is that lack of housing and land title does not necessarily indicate a lack of tenure security
– there are other structures such as clans that can insure land tenure.
While at a cross-country level ex-combatants have exhibited a significant level of upward mobility in terms of their
access to land for cultivation there remains a divergence between DRC and RoC, on the one hand, which showed
very high rates of increased access to arable land and Burundi and Uganda, on the other, which displayed much lower
rates of increased access to arable land. Accounting for this divergence is puzzling. While the absolute availability of
land is important dimension of increased land access (for example in Rwanda land scarcity is a well identified issue,
while in DRC there are large tracts of uninhabited land) it is likely that the local dynamics of negotiating access to
land through various pathways is equally if not more important component (for example in DRC ex-combatants and
community members alike must navigate between both customary and statutory land access regimes that can stand
in direct contradiction to each other).131 As gaining access to land is a key pathway to ex-combatants’ economic
stability, food security, and contribution to the community then further investigation of this divergence could prove
important for future programming.
While access to arable land and livestock ownership are generally considered important indicators of the food security
of ex-combatants, it appears as though there is little correlation between these indicators and ex-combatants’ levels
of household hunger and nutritional improvement. While ex-combatants’ access to arable land was very high across
the GLR countries, nearly on par with community members, they were significantly more likely to face hunger and
nutrition problems. Future inquiry into the sources and nature of household hunger and nutrition problems to
nuance these findings could prove insightful.
8.3.1 Vulnerable Subgroups
Female ex-combatants face a unique set of challenges in regards to access to arable land. Female ex-combatants
across the GLR are less likely than male ex-combatants to see increases in their access to land for cultivation (26.5%
vs. 39.8%) – the low level of female ex-combatants’ land access mobility is even more stark when they are compared
to female community members (45.4%), who are themselves on par with male community members. Scattered
evidence suggests that, as with male ex-combatants, female ex-combatants view capital as their primary pathway to
increased land access. However, as female ex-combatants are the least likely group to see increases in their access to
land this could suggest that they also face considerable barriers in access to capital. There is evidence to suggest that
female ex-combatants experience additional barriers to land access mobility, especially in terms of (I) inheritance
dynamics and (ii) marriage.
Female ex-combatants less frequently cite inheritance as a pathway to land access mobility than male ex-combat-
ants and female community members – who are on par with male community members. This could suggest that
female ex-combatants face challenges in accessing land inheritance structures that are open to not only community
members, but male ex-combatants as well. Lack of access to capital and inheritance structures for female ex-combat-
ants is accentuated further when contextualized against marriage dynamics. Female ex-combatants in Uganda are
more than ten times as likely to cite marriage as their pathway to increased land access compared to males – however
(as discussed in section 7.2) female ex-combatants remain the least marrying demographic group with the weakest
prospects for marriage in the future. Collectively this evidence suggests that female ex-combatants face a diverse
range of barriers to land access. Future study to confirm and nuance these findings could prove beneficial for devel-
oping gender focused reintegration programming.



131   Some scholars have posited that local – national contradictions in land access and ownership structures have played a role in shaping new power
structures in effect shaping and sustaining insecurity in some parts of the GLR. See for example: Huggins and Clover (2005) From the Ground Up: Land
Rights, Conflict and Peace in Sub-Saharan Africa, ISS Africa




                                                                           60
Young ex-combatants (aged 18-30) tend to be a step behind their elder peers in terms of many housing, land access,
and food security indicators. Young ex-combatants are less likely to own their housing, less likely to have livestock,
and less likely to see increases in their access to land. However it appears that these disadvantages, as with marriage
and education, may be a product of their years lost in conflict – as they now struggle to make parity with elder ex-
combatants and show a clear trajectory of improvement – most notably in terms of accessing marriage, and in turn
the familial unit, and access to land for agricultural production, which is tied to the primary economic pathway for
ex-combatants across the GLR: small scale agriculture.
Supporting the findings that disabled ex-combatants are slightly more likely to be married, so too are they slightly
more likely to be living in household with a family. It appears that the majority of disabled ex-combatants fall in line
with line with their non-disabled peers in terms of housing, access to land, and livestock. However, few those who
do fall behind do so at varying levels – likely commensurate to their particular level of disability. Overall, disabled
ex-combatants saw similar levels of access to land for cultivation, but fewer increases in their land access in the years
prior to sampling.
8.3.2 Unique Country Trends
While across the GLR countries ex-combatants were most likely to be living with the same family as prior to conflict,
Rwanda and RoC stand out from this trend. In Rwanda ex-combatants were more likely to be living with a family,
but one different from prior to conflict. Have ex-combatants in Rwanda faced challenges in reintegrating into the
same familial unit as prior to conflict? While there is no clear evidence in this study, it is possible that this may in part
be a product of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and the prolonged period of time that ex-combatants have been away
from communities since the first and second Congo Wars. By contrast, in RoC ex-combatants were more likely to be
living with a spouse (though unmarried, as detailed in section 7.2). Have ex-combatants in RoC been more success-
ful in accessing the familial unit, even if it is not officiated in marriage? As accessing the familial unit is understood as
a key pathway to reintegration, further investigation into these diverging trends could prove instrumental.

                                           9. Economic Issues

A        ttaining a level of economic stability through employment, access to credit and participation in economic as-
         sociations are seen as key elements to the economic prospects of ex-combatants and essential for peace and
         development. As such, the analysis here is presented in five main parts: (i) an examination of ex-combatants’
employment statuses and general outlooks on employment; (ii) an examination of the barriers that non-econom-
ically active ex-combatants face to gaining a stable economic status; (iii) an examination of female ex-combatants’
specific economic issues; (iv) an examination of ex-combatants’ levels of income, savings, and access to credit as in-
dicators of their general economic stability and ability to leverage economic opportunities; and (v) an examination
of ex-combatants’ level of engagement with economic associations as an extended support / opportunity network.
In the context of the severe development challenges that characterize the GLR countries, attaining economic rein-
tegration (parity with community members) and economic stability may not necessarily be the same thing. Thus,
to truly identify the economic challenges that are specific to ex-combatants, we must understand ex-combatants
economic prospects in relation to the wider community. As such, this section should be read in conjunction with
section 15 on economic issues in the Community Dynamics Comparative Survey and Analysis in Annex II of this
report.

9.1 Economic Status and History
Concerning employment status, at a cross-country level prior to conflict ex-combatants were most commonly
studying or training (37.6%), self-employed in agriculture (26.3%), or unemployed (12.9%).132 At the time of de-
mobilization the number of ex-combatants studying or training had dropped to 2.2%. Those who had previously
been studying or training prior to conflict were effectively absorbed into the categories of self-employed in agricul-
ture (which grew to 33.3%), unemployment (which grew to 31.1%), and employed working in the public sector
(which grew from 3.1% prior to the conflict to 11% at demobilization. At the time of sampling unemployment had
shrunk to 21.3% and the number of ex-combatants working in the public sector had shrunk to 1.7%. These changes
in ex-combatant employment status continued to be absorbed into the categories of self-employed in agriculture
which grew to 36.7% and other self-employed in non-agricultural services categories which had grown to 10.4%
from the time of demobilization (see Table 12 below) – RoC is an exception to this trend towards self-employment
in agriculture with retail instead being the primary pathway.
Though levels of employment varied from country to country, with each GLR country ex-combatants followed
the same arc in their employment trajectory – a spike of unemployment at the time of demobilization, to a drop in
unemployment at the time of sampling that was slightly worse than pre-conflict levels. This unemployment trend
coupled with a continual growth in self-employment in agriculture, services, and retail.
In examining the demographic trends in employment status across the GLR countries at these three time points we
can observe some trends. Female ex-combatants are slightly more frequently unemployed than male ex-combatants
prior to conflict and at demobilization, though slightly less so at the time of sampling. Though Rwanda, where 54.5%
of female versus 38.2% of male ex-combatants were unemployed at the time of sampling, stood apart in this regard.
Younger ex-combatants (age 18-31) are most frequently studying compared to other age groups at all time points.



132   Rwanda is excluded from findings regarding employment status prior to demobilization and at demobilization and Burundi is excluded from

Older ex-combatants (over the age of 40) are most frequently in the self-employed agriculture group at all time
points. Disabled ex-combatants were more frequently unemployed at the time of demobilization and the time of
sampling compared to non-disabled ex-combatants. These trends are visible in Table 12.
Of those ex-combatants who were unemployed at the time of sampling the explanations most commonly given were
lack of work opportunities (61.2%) followed by financial problems (12.2%).133 Uganda departed from this cross-
country trend and instead health and disability (46.9%) was most commonly cited as the reason for not working,
followed by financial problems (21.9%).
Within demographic categories female ex-combatants were slightly less likely to perceive their unemployment as a
result of a lack of opportunity (44.1%) and slightly more likely to view it as a result of financial problems (21.3%) or
lack of skills (14.5%) than male ex-combatants (63.8%, 10.9% and 7.6% respectively). Disabled ex-combatants were
much more likely to perceive health and disability constraints (58.4%) as their primary reason for unemployment
compared to non-disabled ex-combatants (3.2%).
On average across the GLR countries 31.7% of ex-combatants relied on more than one income earning activity.134
RoC, where 93.6% of ex-combatants relied on more than one income generating activity, departed dramatically
from this cross-country trend. Female ex-combatants were slightly less likely to rely on multiple income generating
activities (27.1%) compared to male ex-combatants (32.5%). Again, RoC is the exception to the gendered trend for
multiple income sources as 100% of female ex-combatants relied on multiple income sources as compared to 92.8%
of males. Disabled ex-combatants were slightly less likely to rely on multiple income generating activities (25.6%)
compared to non-disabled ex-combatants (32.1%).
On average across the GLR countries, 40.6% of ex-combatants returned to their pre-conflict employment / type of
work. On average younger ex-combatants were less likely to return to their previous field of work or employment:
28.9% of those aged 18-31 versus 40.1% of those 31-40 and 56.4% of those over 40. Viewed in the context of age
at mobilization into conflict, though approximate, it is perhaps understandable that younger ex-combatants do not
return to the same employment type – indeed, as 64% of ex-combatants aged 18-30 were under the age of 18 at the
time of mobilization they may not yet have had an established employment type. Further, those ex-combatants aged
18-30 were also slightly more likely to be studying or training at the time of sampling, likely returning to study inter-
rupted by mobilization (10.4% vs. 3.1% of those aged 31-40 and 0.9% of those aged over 40).
When asked to explain why they had chosen to return to their previous line of work after conflict in DRC and RoC
ex-combatants most commonly cited three key explanations: (i) lack of other opportunities (51.8%); followed by
(ii) that it was a reliable job (18.6%); and (iii) out of economic necessity to take care of the family (16.4%).135
Across the GLR countries ex-combatants communicated that they on average would be very willing to move to
another part of their own country for a better job (75.4%) – though significantly lower in Uganda (40.7%).136
Though there is no cross-country data for comparison on explanations for ex-combatants’ attitudes towards migra-
tion, looking at Uganda alone may provide some initial insights. The most common explanation for willingness to
migrate in Uganda was that ex-combatants were willing to move for financial reasons and the prospect of improving
their standard of living (58.4%). A smaller proportion of ex-combatants (15.5%) was bored of their environment



133   Rwanda is excluded from findings regarding reasons for unemployment due to lack of directly comparable data.
134   Rwanda is excluded from findings regarding multiple incomes sources due to lack of directly comparable data.
135   Questions regarding ex-combatants reasons for returning to the same job as prior to conflict were only asked in DRC and RoC.
136   This lower willingness to migrate among ex-combatants in Uganda may be related to their overall higher levels of social capital compared to other
GLR countries – discussed more in depth in section 10. Rwanda is excluded from findings regarding willingness to migrate for work due to lack of directly
comparable data.

finding employment.
Of those ex-combatants who thought that ex-combatants find it more difficult to find a job than community members
there were diverse explanations across the GLR countries however, the common thread through all countries was
stigma or distrust towards ex-combatants at varying levels – though in Uganda the most common explanation was
ex-combatants’ low education levels (59.7%).139 A table of the proportion of ex-combatants from each GLR country

that cited stigma or distrust of ex-combatants as the reason why they find it more difficult than non-ex-combatants
to find a job is presented in Table 14. On average across the GLR countries, 52.2% of ex-combatants saw stigma /
distrust as a barrier to employment – though this was higher in RoC (88.9%) and lower in Uganda (17.6%).140
Concerning outlook for economic prospects in the future, across the GLR countries 73.7% of ex-combatants per-
ceived that their economic situation would improve in the near future. Across demographic lines the perceptions
of ex-combatants about their economic prospects in the future were remarkably even. However, across and within
the GLR countries, disabled ex-combatants perceived slightly weaker economic outlooks (66.5% versus 74.3% at a
total sample level).
When asked to explain the main reasons for if they perceived their economic situation improving in the future ex-
combatants across the GLR countries gave a wide range of responses.141 Very generally speaking, we can say that
in Uganda ex-combatants with both positive and negative outlooks for the future saw this as tied to their ability
to participate and produce in agriculture. In contrast, in Burundi, DRC and RoC ex-combatants more commonly
expressed a range of explanations for positive and negative outlooks more closely tied to their attainment of employ-
ment and capital. Across all countries disabled ex-combatants saw health as a key barrier to their economic future.
Looking specifically across Burundi, DRC and RoC we can observe that on average ex-combatants work 9.34
months of the year in paid employment – a proportion roughly reflected across all three countries.142 However
in contrast, when looking at the number of months that ex-combatants spend participating in unpaid labor, for
example subsistence farming or labor in trade for food or housing, there is a division that emerges. In DRC and RoC
the majority of ex-combatants spend on average 3.97 months in unpaid labor through the year. However in Burundi
the ex-combatants work 10.93 months a year in unpaid labor; in fact the vast majority (78.4%) spend 12 months of
the year working in unpaid labor. By cross tabulating months of the year spent in paid versus unpaid labor we find
that 83.8% of those who spend 12 months of the year in unpaid labor (heavily represented in Burundi) do this in
addition to working 12 months of the year for paid labor. Of those who work for paid labor for 9 months of the year
(heavily represented in DRC and RoC), 96.2% do so in addition to working 9 months of the year for unpaid labor.
These trends are likely indicative of regional and seasonal farming and employment practices.

9.2 Non-Economically Active Ex-Combatants on Employment Issues
When non-economically active ex-combatants across the GLR countries are asked how they get by when they are
not working the most common responses are: (i) 29.3% reply that they rely on their family cash contributions; (ii)
18.6% have to borrow money; and (iii) 12.8% say they just find a way to cope.143 Looking within gender demograph-
ics we can see that female ex-combatants more commonly rely on family cash contributions (49.9%) compared to
male ex-combatants (26.4%). Younger ex-combatants (age 18-30) are also more likely to rely on family cash contri-
butions (37.1% vs. 22.1% of those 31-40 and 26.8% of those over 40).
At a cross-country level of those ex-combatants that are not economically active, 33.2% of them feel that being an ex-



140   The analysis throughout annex I & II suggest that stigma and distrust are considerably less prominent in Uganda – it is possible that this is related
to the dynamics of ex-combatant return in Uganda – where ex-combatants who were abducted return to communities and are seen as both victims and
perpetrators. In some communities this dynamic can play a role in greater overall acceptance of ex-combatants in Uganda. In addition, the extensive use of
traditional reconciliation ceremonies in Uganda, though not a part of reintegration programming, may play a role in explaining this stark contrast against
RoC.
141   Rwanda is excluded from findings regarding reasons for outlook on future economic situation due to lack of directly comparable data.
142   Rwanda and Uganda are excluded from findings regarding annual time spent working for pay and without pay due to lack of directly comparable
data.

ex-combatants get by due to lack of directly comparable data.

extent of these trends can be seen in Table 15.
Attempting to account for the sharp split between Burundi and Uganda, on the one hand, and DRC and RoC, on the
other, in the perception of ex-combatant status playing a contributing role in the unemployment of non-econom-
ically active x-combatants is challenging. In Burundi the most common explanation for why ex-combatant status
contributes to unemployment is unspecified political problems (44.6%) followed by stigma and distrust in ex-com-
batants (34.7%). In Uganda, lack of skills and education are the most common explanations (43.5%), followed by
poor health (26.1%) and stigma/ distrust in ex-combatants (21.7%). By contrast, in DRC and RoC stigma accounts
for the vast majority of explanations for why ex-combatant status contributes to unemployment (80.2% in DRC
and 79.6% in RoC). In summary, in DRC and RoC where the likelihood of perceiving ex-combatant status as con-
tributing to unemployment was dramatically lower than in other GLR countries – the perception that stigma and
distrust in ex-combatants was the reason why ex-combatant status contributed unemployment was dramatically
higher. While the relationship between perceptions of stigma and the perception of ex-combatant status playing a
contributing role to being non-economically active is unclear here, stigma should at the very least be flagged as an
important dimension.
At a cross-country level there is a very even split in the perceptions of non-economically active ex-combatants on
their future prospects of gaining employment – 50.4% saying that they had a good chance of finding a job in the
future, 2.4% saying they had a neither good or bad chance, and 48.6% saying that they had a poor chance. Disabled
ex-combatants consistently expressed a less positive outlook towards future employment – 25.4% of disabled ex-
combatants across the GLR countries having a positive outlook versus 54.3% of non-disabled ex-combatants. While
there is no data to directly compare across GLR countries, it is notable that in Uganda 100% of disabled ex-combat-
ants explained their positive outlook on gaining employment in the future on improved health and/or healing.

9.3 Female Ex-Combatants on Employment Issues
Of female ex-combatants who were not economically active 36.5% feel that they are discriminated against as a female




144   To further complicate these findings on the role that ex-combatant status plays in gaining employment for those who are non-economically active,
they stand in contrast to the similar findings on the role that stigma / distrust plays in gaining employment presented in Table 14.




                                                                          67
– though in Burundi this number was significantly higher (66%) and in Uganda significantly lower (16.7%).145 Simi-
larly, of female ex-combatants who are economically active 24.5% feel they are discriminated against as a female
in the workplace. In both instances female ex-combatants between the ages of 18 and 30 are the most likely age
demographic to perceive discrimination (44.7% of those unemployed and 23.2% of those employed). In addition,
in both of these instances 34.8% perceive their status as not just a female, but a female ex-combatant is related to the
discrimination they encounter.
While there is no data for direct comparison across GLR countries as to who female ex-combatants see as the main
people discriminating against them, Uganda can offer some leads for further investigation. In Uganda 50% of un-
employed female ex-combatants see female employers or bosses as the main group discriminating against them, the
other 50% see everyone as discriminating against them. Of those female ex-combatants who were employed 30%
saw female co-workers as the main group discriminating against them, followed by 15.4% who saw all employers
at the main group discriminating against them, 15.4% who saw male co-workers discriminating against them, and
15.4% who saw everybody discriminating against them. What is notable is that, at least in the case of Uganda, in both
instances of female ex-combatants who are employed and those who are unemployed, the group most commonly
perceived as discriminating against them is other females – be they employers or co-workers. This point could be
related to female community members’ overall higher levels of fear, and perhaps in turn discrimination, surrounding
the return of ex-combatants discussed in section 17.2.

9.4 Disabled Ex-Combatants on Employment Issues
Of disabled ex-combatants who are not economically active 62.4% feel they are discriminated against as a disabled
person and 37.6% feel they are not.146 Of those disabled ex-combatants who are economically active the propor-
tions of those who feel they are discriminated against is almost perfectly inverse, with 34.2% saying that they per-
ceived being discriminated against and 62.5% saying they did not. When asked if discrimination was related to their
ex-combatant status 51.1% of disabled ex-combatants perceive that this discrimination has to do specifically with
them being a disabled ex-combatant rather than merely disabled. Female disabled ex-combatants were less likely to
perceive discrimination linked to their ex-combatant status, 37.5% versus 58.7%.
Again, as with the case of female ex-combatants on employment issues, there is no data to directly compare across
the GLR countries as to who disabled ex-combatants see as the main groups discriminating against them. However,
again looking at data from Uganda can offer some initial insights. In Uganda 80% of non-economically active disabled
ex-combatants who perceived discrimination see all employers or bosses as discriminating against them, with the
remaining 20% seeing everyone as discriminating against them. Of those economically active ex-combatants who
perceived discrimination 40% saw the discrimination as coming primarily from all employers or bosses, 20% from
male co-workers, 20% from all co-workers, and 20% from everybody. Confirming these trends across the GLR coun-
tries would require further triangulation.

9.5 Income, Savings and Access to Credit
In the context of the severe development challenges that characterize most of the Great Lakes Region, ex-combat-
ants’ economic statuses are a good starting point for understanding basic individual and household economic stabil-
ity. However, a deeper examination of ex-combatants’ income, savings and access to credit can begin to reveal some
about their ability, or inability, to move beyond mere subsistence by leveraging economic opportunities.

Of those ex-combatants who identify themselves as the sole breadwinner in their household across the GLR coun-
tries 39.3% say that they usually have to borrow money to meet their monthly household expenses, 22.4% say that
they usually break even, 20.4% rely on family money transfers, 13.5% usually have to use past savings, and only 4.4%
have money left over.147 As displayed in Table 17, these trends were remarkably durable within each of the GLR
countries with the exception of RoC in which a similar proportion of ex-combatants (41.2%) had to borrow to
meet monthly expenses, but in contrast to the cross-country trend 41.2% of ex-combatants usually had money left
over.148
Across the GLR countries, female ex-combatants were more likely to rely on family money transfers (27.2%) when
compared to male ex-combatants (19.1%), and less likely to use past savings to meet monthly expenses (7.8%)
when compared to male ex-combatants (14.6%). Younger ex-combatants were also more likely to rely on family
money transfers than their elder peers (27.8% vs. 12.4% of those 31-40 and 15.4% of those over 40).
Of those ex-combatants who were sole breadwinners and did not earn enough to meet monthly household expenses
across the GLR countries, they were on average short by 41% of their income.149 DRC and, to a larger extent, RoC
sat below this cross-country average, with average sole breadwinner income shortages of 23% and 7% respectively.
Across demographic lines these disabled ex-combatants had notably higher income shortages on average (52%)
compared to non-disabled ex-combatants (40%). Of those ex-combatants who were sole breadwinners and did
meet monthly household expenses there was a clear trend in which ex-combatants had a surplus on average of
22%.150 However, as is visible in Table 18, in RoC income surpluses were on average only 5%.
Of those 49.6% of ex-combatants across the GLR countries who say that their household relies on multiple incomes,
there was an average contribution of 46% of their total household income. As is visible in Table 19, Rwanda and DRC
stand out with smaller average non-sole breadwinner household income contributions (35% and 37% respectively).

business investments, and 18.9% as assistance for their family.152 Similarly, 27.8% of ex-combatants identified their
second use of borrowed funds as to assist their family, 24.7% as subsistence, and 11.3% as a business investment.

centuated in the cases of Uganda (27.9% vs. 13.6% and 9.8%) and Rwanda (18.6% vs. 11.5% and 10.3%) where the
overall proportion of ex-combatants who had at some point applied for micro-credit was significantly higher.
Of those ex-combatants who had applied for micro-credit at some point, 76.6% had had a successful application.
The only GLR country that did not reflect this average was RoC in which only 28.6% of micro-credit applications
were successful – the explanation for this is unclear. Female ex-combatants more commonly had successful micro
credit applications (86.9%) than male ex-combatants (78.5%). There were no other consistent demographic trends
across the GLR countries.

9.6 Economic Associations
Across the GLR countries 37.3% of ex-combatants were currently involved in some form of micro-economic activity.
Burundi departed most significantly from this trend with 78.6% of ex-combatants being involved in a micro-eco-
nomic activity.153 In Uganda and Burundi female ex-combatants (39.4% and 100% respectively) were more likely
to be currently participating in some form of micro-economic activity than male ex-combatants (32.5% and 76.9%
respectively). In contrast, in DRC and RoC female ex-combatants (22.2% and 0.0% respectively) were less likely to
be involved in some form of micro-economic activity (46.2% and 80% respectively).
Since receiving reinsertion packages, 72.2% of ex-combatants across the GLR countries have never been a member
of an economic association, 21.9% are currently members, and 5.9% have previously been members but are not
currently.154 Across all GLR countries ex-combatants aged 18-30 were least frequently currently a member of an
economic association (15.6%) compared to those aged 31-40 (23%) and those over 40 (29.1%). This could be an
indication of older ex-combatants’ generally longer economic track record with economic associations and access to
credit. Looking to Rwanda and Uganda we can see that local savings and credit associations and farmers associations

batants (33% and 22.4% respectively).
Of those ex-combatants across the GLR countries who were members of an economic association, there were
varying compositions of ex-combatant versus non-ex-combatant membership in the given economic association.156
As is visible in Table 21 below, at a cross-country level there was a typical bell curve distribution between categories
of economic association membership composition. However, closer inspection within countries shows that there
are diverging trends. What is noteworthy is that the level at which ex-combatants move into economic associa-
tions with only other ex-combatants is low – suggesting that the majority of those ex-combatants who do join an
economic association have the benefit of social interaction with community members, building social and economic
networks, in addition to the economic benefits of associations.

9.7 Summary
Across the GLR countries the general economic trajectory of ex-combatants is positive. The number of ex-combat-
ants who are unemployed is shrinking – these ex-combatants are most commonly being absorbed into self-employ-
ment in agriculture, followed by self-employment in non-agricultural business. In line with this positive trajectory,
ex-combatants generally have a positive outlook on their economic situation in the future; 76.3% saying that they
expected their situation to improve in the future. When ex-combatants explain this positive outlook they generally
cite improved agricultural production and improved access to capital and credit – two explanations that can be tied
to ex-combatants’ main paths of economic reintegration: self-employment in agriculture and small business. This
signals that ex-combatants’ perceptions of their future economic situation and the pathways to attaining it are rooted
in their collective trajectory towards self-employment in agriculture or small business.
This generally positive economic trajectory has seen ex-combatants reach near parity, but slightly weaker across

all indicators, in levels of economic stability compared to community members. Ex-combatants are more likely to
be unemployed, less likely to meet their household expenses, and more likely to borrow from family than formal
economic institutions to close this income gap than community members. Ex-combatants are considerably less
likely to participate in micro-economic activities or belong to economic associations than community members –
an indication of their considerably shortened economic track record and the time lost while in conflict for establish-
ing themselves in formal economic institutions.
Regarding ex-combatants perceptions of the barriers they face to gaining productive economic status, the majority
of ex-combatants cite lack of opportunity, signaling that they generally identify the barriers to economic improve-
ment as contextualized in larger development challenges that affect the entire community. Simultaneously, ex-com-
batants perceive themselves as a disadvantaged group that have a harder time finding a job and are subject to stigma
and distrust in the community. By contrast community members are much more likely to cite lack of access to credit
and lack of skills as key barriers to their economic stability.
It appears that ex-combatants understand the dual dimensions of the barriers they face to gaining a productive
economic status – the larger context of severe development challenges that characterize the GLR countries, and
the context of being an ex-combatant in this development setting – facing challenges with stigma and distrust in the
community. Indeed, ex-combatants are far more likely to identify the social networking value of economic interac-
tions, bringing about the slow set of social interactions that erode stigma and facilitate social reintegration, than
community members. However, in this it appears that with weaker economic track records ex-combatants also fail
to recognize capital and credit barriers to economic prosperity to the same extent as community members.
In summary, ex-combatants’ economic trajectories are generally positive though in absolute terms they are disad-
vantaged to community members. The barriers to reaching true parity with community members revolve around:
(i) closing literacy, education and skill gaps with community members; (ii) establishing an economic track record;
(iii) accessing credit and other financial institutions; and (iv) eroding stigma and distrust through the slow process
of confrontation that social reintegration entails.

9.7.1 Vulnerable Subgroups
In this analysis of the economic dimensions of reintegration, female ex-combatants continue to stand out as a key
vulnerable group. Female ex-combatants are more likely to be unemployed than male ex-combatants and more likely
to see lack of skills as among their core barriers to reaching economic stability – this aligns with earlier analysis re-
vealing that female ex-combatants have significantly lower literacy and educational achievement levels compared to
male ex-combatants. Female ex-combatants and community members alike report significant levels discrimination
on the basis of gender as a barrier to gaining employment, though female ex-combatants report this at twice the rate
of community members. This may suggest that stigma associated with ex-combatant status may have an amplifying
effect on already entrenched gender inequalities present in the community. Interestingly while female community
members that experienced gender-based discrimination identified it as coming primarily from males, female ex-
combatants identified female community members as the main sources of discrimination. This point may be related
to female community members’ overall higher levels of fear surrounding the return of ex-combatants to their com-
munity discussed in section 17.2 of the community dynamics annex of this study. Collectively, these issues represent
a clear set of challenges for female ex-combatants in achieving economic reintegration.
Health is a key barrier to economic reintegration for disabled ex-combatants who are the most likely demographic
group, of ex-combatants and community members alike, to be unemployed at the time of sampling across the GLR
countries. Accordingly disabled ex-combatants are the least likely demographic group to have a positive outlook on
their economic future. In addition disabled ex-combatants who are unemployed report high levels of discrimination
in seeking employment on the basis of their disability (twice the proportion of females that perceive discrimina-
tion). However – those who are employed perceive discrimination on the basis of their disability at half the rate (on

par with females). This may suggest that while there is clearly discrimination in terms of gender and disability, there
is an amplifying effect that overall levels of stigma and distrust in the community have on these dynamics.
9.7.2 Unique Country Trends
In terms of economic reintegration ex-combatants in the Republic of Congo display a number of unique trends –
though they do not necessarily depart from the dominant narrative of economic reintegration for ex-combatants
across the GLR. Most notably perhaps is that while self-employment in agriculture is still an important economic
pathway for ex-combatants in RoC, self-employment in non-agricultural services is the dominant economic path.
It is possible that migration to the urban capital of Brazzaville among ex-combatants has removed agriculture as a
viable economic activity – lending some explanation to this trend of economic status tending away from the self-
employment in agriculture.

                                              10. Social Capital

E       xamining the social dynamics of ex-combatant reintegration requires the exploration of a range of concepts
        including: (i) social networks, (ii) trust, (iii) social cohesion, (iv) social inclusion, and (v) empowerment.
        Collectively these various concepts come together to represent social capital, essentially the idea that social
networks have value, both tangible and intangible, for individuals and communities and are a key indicator of the
overall social health of ex-combatants – and in turn their ability to leverage this social capital towards social and
economic outcomes. Examining social capital can allow us some insights into the process of social reintegration
that ex-combatants go through upon return to their communities. However, when looking at the complex social
dynamics that ex-combatants experience we cannot draw meaningful insights without contextualizing these social
dimensions with that of the community at large. Thus for optimal analytical value this section of the report should
be read in conjunction with section 16 on social capital in the community dynamics annex of this report.

10.1 Networks and Sociability
Across the GLR countries ex-combatants and community members are unlikely to be in many social groups – though
community members are in slightly more. On average ex-combatants were in 0.46 social groups, while community
members were in 0.63.157 Uganda stood apart from this overall GLR trend – community members averaging 0.93
social groups. Age showed a positive relationship to the average number of social groups among ex-combatants and
community members alike, however this trend was much more pronounced among ex-combatants – in which young
(18-30) ex-combatants have the lowest average number of social groups across all demographic groups (0.37).
Across the GLR countries, 38.5% of ex-combatants said that the current number of social groups to which they are
a member is greater than that of one year ago, 50.8% said the number is the same as one year prior and 10.7% said
that their current number of social groups is less than it was one year ago. These proportions were reflected well
within the GLR countries with the exception of Uganda, in which 85.3% said that their number of social groups had
stayed the same in the last year. Across the GLR countries, female ex-combatants less frequently saw an increase in
their number of social groups (23.1%) when compared to male ex-combatants (41.4%). Similarly, disabled ex-com-
batants less frequently saw an increase in their number of social groups (24.4%) when compared to non-disabled
ex-combatants (40.1%).
Of ex-combatants, 32.6% were on a management or organizing committee for a local group or organization. Female
ex-combatants were significantly less likely to be on a management committee (25.9%) compared to male ex-com-
batants (34%). Ex-combatants over the age of 40 are most frequently on management or organizing committees
(37.4%) compared to those 31-40 (36.8%) and those 18-30 (24.3%). The fact that older ex-combatants (over 40)
have the most social groups on average and are most frequently on management committees is a broad indication of
their social footing in the community. Inversely it flags younger ex-combatants as lagging behind in building a social
foundation in the community.
Generally speaking a large proportion of ex-combatants across the GLR countries had contact with their families
(91.3%). However, DRC is a clear standout in this trend of high familial contact – only 62.1% reported having

with their families, 30.9% of those who thought they could see their family more frequently cited the distance of
travel as the main reason they do not see their family more often, 20.4% cited lack of time, and 17.1% cited the cost
of travel – flagging the geographic spread of families as a dimension to reintegration in these countries.
Across the GLR countries, 49.1% of all ex-combatants had lots of friends, 30% had a few, good friends and 20.9%
did not have many friends.159 This trend is well reflected within the GLR countries with the exception of Rwanda
– where 23% had lots of friends, 44.2% had a few good friends and 32.8% did not have many friends. On average
female ex-combatants slightly less frequently had lots of friends (44.3%) and more frequently had a few good friends
(33.4%) or not many friends (22.3%) than male ex-combatants (49.9%, 29.5% and 20.6% respectively). Rwanda is
the exception to this gender demographic trend in which female ex-combatants slightly more frequently than male
ex-combatants had lots of friends (27.3%) or a few good friends (54.5%) than male ex-combatants (22.9% and
43.9% respectively).
Across the GLR countries there were clear and consistent trends in terms of the age, gender, ex-combatant status and
educational background of the friends of ex-combatants.160 The majority of ex-combatants across the GLR countries
were likely to have friends within the same age and gender categories, but less likely to have friends who were ex-
combatants or shared the same education level. These trends are displayed in Table 24.

status of ex-combatants’ social groups Rwanda is excluded from direct comparison due to a scaling issue in the data. In Rwanda 68.9% said that some of their
friends were ex-combatants, 22.9% said that most of them were ex-combatants, 7.6% said none were ex-combatants and only 0.5% said that all their friends
were ex-combatants.




                                                                            77
fied, especially in terms of having friends who are ex-combatants. Indeed, only 26.7% of ex-combatants say that most
of their friends are fellow ex-combatants, 23.6% say some, 36.4% say few and 13.3% say none. This suggests that ex-
combatants are not becoming an isolated social group – only socializing with each other.
Across the GLR countries, when asked who they would turn to for help if they were to encounter an economic
problem 39.7% of ex-combatants responded that they would turn to their family; 30.9% responded that they would
turn to a friend; 13.5% would turn to no one; and 10% would rely on a range of business, communal, or formal
financial resources. Generally across the GLR countries older ex-combatants were more likely to rely on friends for
economic help than younger ex-combatants – who were, themselves, more likely to rely on family than older ex-
combatants. This lends evidence to the idea that, in general, ex-combatants’ primary pathway to economic assistance
is through their families and extended social circles as opposed to formal institutional pathways. Indeed, while as a
whole ex-combatants would turn to similar sources as their community member counterparts for economic help,
community members were slightly more likely (7.5% vs. 3.3%) to rely on formal institutions.

10.2 Trust and Solidarity
Drawing from Rwanda and Uganda we can see that ex-combatants have generally high levels of trust in their com-
munities.161 Of the respondents, 58% said that they trust people in their community to a great extent, 31.2% said
to neither a great nor small extent, and the remaining 10.8% said they trusted those in their community to a small
extent. In Rwanda and Uganda female ex-combatants generally trusted less than male ex-combatants (18.5% vs.
9.5% trusted those in their community to a small extent). Age displayed a positive correlation to high trust in others
in the community (47% of those 18-30, 62% of those 31-40, and 64.3% of those over 40). Overall ex-combatants
displayed a similar level of trust, though slightly weaker than community members.
Across the GLR countries, 18.3% of
ex-combatants felt that if they were to                              Table 25: Ex-Combatant Perceptions of Change in Trust

                                                                           78
people in the area that they lived in had improved, 38.3% felt that trust had stayed the same and the remaining 9.7%
felt that trust had deteriorated (displayed in Table 25).163 Female ex-combatants less frequently thought that trust
had improved (42.3%) than male ex-combatants (53.4%). Disabled ex-combatants also slightly less frequently felt
that trust had improved (45.8%) compared to non-disabled ex-combatants (52.7%). Community members were
less likely to see trust as improved than ex-combatants (43.4% vs. 52%) but more likely to think it had stayed the
same (47.9% vs. 38.3%).
When those ex-combatants who felt that trust had improved were asked to explain why they thought it had improved
the most common responses were: (i) 25.4% of ex-combatants across the GLR countries felt that peace in general
was the reason for improved trust; and (ii) 22.5% thought communal living and growing understanding were the
reasons for improved trust.164
It is important to note that while these trends give a general picture of the perceived drivers of trust across the GLR
countries, within each country there were unique trends as well that deserve further investigation – for example in
Burundi the charging of ex-combatants for their behavior was seen as the main driver of improvements in trust by
56% of the ex-combatants sample.165 One demographic trend that does endure across the GLR countries is that
those ex-combatants aged 18-30 most frequently see the charging of ex-combatants for their behavior as the central
driver of improved trust – 32.2% of those 18-30 compared to 15.8% of those 31-40 and 5% of those over the age of
40.
When those ex-combatants who felt that trust had gotten worse were asked to explain why they thought trust had
deteriorated, 27.8% cited dishonest people and 21.9% cited political problems or distrust in authorities. While the
internal proportions of these two driving factors behind worsening perceptions of trust among ex-combatants varied
within the individual GLR countries they were consistently the two most common explanations.

10.3 Social Cohesion and Inclusion
When asked about the level of diversity in the area in which they live ex-combatants displayed a spread of respons-
es across the GLR countries almost identical to community members.166 35.2% of ex-combatants described the
people in the area in which they live in as characterized by many differences (diverse), 24% characterized them as
having neither a great or small extent of differences, and 40.8% said there were few differences between people (not
diverse). As visible in Table 26, Rwanda stood out from this trend – 61.4% saw high diversity, 17.8% average, and
20.8% low diversity.167
When asked whether or not the differences between people (level of diversity) were a source of problems such as
disagreement, arguments, and disputes there were split results. In DRC and RoC, a low portion of ex-combatants



163   In Uganda and Rwanda this question was asked with reference to the last year, where as in DRC and RoC it was asked in reference to the last two
years. This creates some issues with periodization and comparability. These figures should be treated with caution. Interestingly, though the question refers to
a longer period of time in DRC, this does not appear to translate to greater perceptions of improved trust among community members. In the case of DRC
this may be the product of continuing insecurity.
164   It is unclear whether ex-combatants being charged for their behavior is in formal or informal charging / accountability. Rwanda is excluded from
findings regarding drivers of improved or depreciating levels of trust due to lack of directly comparable data.
165   Further information regarding trends within each of the countries can be found in each of the individual survey reports from the GLR countries.
166   Here the percpetion of diversity in consttuted but the perception of unsepcified differences among people in the community. Another way to phrase
this would be the level of ”differentness” that ex-combatants percieve in their community.
167   It is possible that the perception of differences (or diversity) can have a varying range of meanings across the contexts of different GLR countries.
For example DRC is a country with rich diversity along cultural, ethnic, and linguistic groups. However, the difficulty of movement in eastern DRC means
that many such socio-linguistic groups live in isolation from each other. The community members may accurately perceive low diversity in their community,
though at a national level diversity may be high. In contrast, the perception of differences (or diversity) may be high in Rwanda due to the centrality of the
Hutu / Tutsi divide in the social history of the country and conflict there. Deciphering the role of perceived differences across the different GLR countries is a
challenging task with few clear answers.

When questioned as to the level of to-
getherness that ex-combatants feel with
other people (unspecified who) in the area they live the response across the GLR countries was generally a high
level of togetherness / closeness that was on par with community members. 76.6% felt close with others, 16.6%
felt neither close nor distant and 6.8% felt distant from others in the area they lived – this trend was well reflected
within the individual GLR countries – though in DRC, ex-combatants were slightly less likely to report high levels
of togetherness (63.1%). Across demographic dimensions only age stood out – which showed a slight positive rela-
tionship to the likelihood of feeling close to the community (75.3% of those 18-30, 77.6% of those 31-40, and 79.3%
of those over 40).
Across the GLR countries, 69.3% of ex-combatants had at some point in the past year worked with others in the
place where they live to do something for the benefit of the community. Burundi and Rwanda stand out with even
higher levels of working with the community – 79.3% in Burundi and 90.8% in Rwanda.168 Female ex-combatants
less frequently took part in community projects (57.5%) when compared to male ex-combatants (71%) across the
GLR countries – again, with the exception of Rwanda where female participation in community projects in the last
year was absolute (100%), exceeding male ex-combatants (90.5%).
When ex-combatants were asked whether there were any penalties for those who did not participate in community
activities, 33.3% responded that penalties were very likely, 23.9% that they were somewhat likely, 16.9% that they
were neither unlikely nor likely, 7% that they were somewhat unlikely, 14.3% that they were very unlikely and 4.7%
that total social exclusion would be the result.169




168   In the case of Rwanda, higher levels of working for the benefit of the community is very likely a result of the institutionalized practice of Umuganda
– a practice dating back to Rwanda’s colonial era in which on the last Saturday of every month all able bodied adults participate in unpaid communal labor –
with enforced penalties for non-participation. In Burundi this trend is likely related to the similar policy of Travaux Communataires.
169   Rwanda and Uganda are excluded from these findings due to lack of directly comparable data.

10.4 Empowerment
Empowerment is an important indicator of overall levels of social capital and is understood as a result of individu-
als’ levels of social connection and their ability to leverage the benefits of these connections in the community and
the larger context of society. Collectively, the extent of these benefits, and in turn the functions that they fulfill for
individuals, play a role in the psychosocial concept of empowerment – the individual or collective ability to affect
change in one’s life. In exploring issues around empowerment this report builds on survey data regarding: (i) the
extent to which ex-combatants feel generally happy; (ii) the extent to which they perceive that they can make impor-
tant decisions; (iii) the extent to which they have control over decisions in their daily life; (iv) the extent to which
they feel valued by the community; and (v) the extent to which they engage in collective political action.
Across the GLR countries when asked about their level of happiness 57.2% of all ex-combatants said that they were
generally happy, 23.7% were neither happy nor unhappy, and 19.1% were generally unhappy. In this regard ex-com-
batants were considerably less likely to report themselves as happy than community members (57.2% vs. 71.8%).
This trend was well displayed with the individual GLR countries with the exception of Burundi in which the spread
of responses from ex-combatants was much more even (31.6% happy, 39.7% neither happy nor unhappy, and 28.7%
unhappy). Generally speaking, female ex-combatants were slightly less happy across the GLR countries than male
ex-combatants in terms of happiness within the GLR countries with the exception of Rwanda where female ex-
combatants were considerably more happy (90.9%) compared to male ex-combatants (61.6%). Across the GLR
countries there was a slight positive relationship between age and happiness – 54% of those aged 18-30, 58.1% of
those 31-40, and 60.7% of those over 40 identified as happy.
When questioned about the extent to which they felt that they had the power to make important decisions that
change the course of their lives 59.9% of all ex-combatants across the GLR countries responded that they felt that
they had this power to a large extent, 25.7% to neither a large nor small extent, and 14.4% to a small extent. 170 This
trend was consistently displayed within all of the GLR countries. In examining demographic subgroups both female
ex-combatants and disabled ex-combatants showed considerably lower perceptions of power in shaping their lives
(see Table 27). Overall, 44.1% of female ex-combatants compared to 62.5% of male ex-combatants felt they had
the power to make important decisions in their lives to a large extent. Similarly, 49% of disabled ex-combatants
compared to 61% of non-disabled ex-combatants felt they had the power to make important decisions in their lives
to a large extent.
While in the case of female ex-combatants the disparity with males was absorbed into both the categories “neither
to a large nor small extent” and “to a small extent,” however in the case of disabled ex-combatants this difference
with non-disabled ex-combatants was almost absolutely absorbed into the category “to a small extent” (28.1% of
disabled vs. 16.1% of non-disabled). This may perhaps suggest that there is a more polarizing dynamic to the nature
of empowerment for disabled ex-combatants than female ex-combatants, or any other demographic subgroup for
that matter.
Ex-combatants were asked the extent to which they felt they had the ability to make important decisions that change
their lives.171 Across the GLR countries, 82.9% felt they were able to change their lives, 11.2% felt that they were
neither able nor unable, and 5.9% felt that they were unable to make important decisions to change their lives. As
with sense of power to change their lives, female and disabled ex-combatants less frequently reported having the
ability to change their lives (73% and 68.8% respectively).
When questioned as to the extent to which ex-combatants felt they had control over decisions that affect their

of those in Rwanda) – see Table 28.
Across age demographics lines there was a positive relationship visible between age and ex-combatants perception
of having a positive impact on the area in which they lived – 52.4% of those aged 18-30, 64.4% of those 31-40, and
67.8% of those over 40.
Across the GLR countries, 72.1% of all ex-combatants felt that people in the area in which they live valued them,
the remaining 27.9% did not feel valued. Uganda was the only country that departed slightly from the cross-coun-
try trend, displaying higher levels of perceived value among ex-combatants (94.6%). Female ex-combatants were
slightly less likely to feel valued (62.3%) compared to male ex-combatants (73.6%).
Regarding collective political action, ex-combatants were asked how often they had joined with other people to
express concerns to government officials or local leaders on issues concerning the community. Across the GLR
countries 43% of all ex-combatants said that they had never done so in the last year, 12.7% that they had once, 18.1%
that they had a few times (five or less), and 26.3% that they had many times (more than five times) – levels very
similar to community members. Burundi to some extent, and Rwanda to a greater extent, broke from this trend and
displayed higher levels of collective political action (visible in Table 29). In Burundi, 34.5% of ex-combatants had
joined to address local leaders many times (more than 5) and 30.7% had a few times (less than five). In Rwanda, 91%
of ex-combatants had joined to address local leaders many times in the last year.175 Across the GLR countries female
ex-combatants were less likely to have gathered for collective political action then male ex-combatants, though at a



173   The analytical distinction between senses of empowerment in terms of power vs. ability is not clear. Interpreting any meaning to the disparity in
levels of power and ability is therefore problematic and these data should be treated as a broad indicator of a positive sense of empowerment rather than as
exact measures of different components of empowerment.
174   Rwanda is excluded from findings regarding ex-combatants’ perceived impact on their community due to lack of directly comparable data.
175   This high rate of public gathering to express concerns in Rwanda is likely another effect of Umuganda. While the main purpose of Umuganda
is community work it also serves as a platform for leaders to communicate important news on a national and local level as well as for individuals and
communities to express concerns and plan for future Umuganda. Further, every community has an ex-combatant representative who is responsible for
relaying specific communication.

very similar level to female community members– 58.8% of female ex-combatants having never gathered and 11.6%
having gathered many times versus 40.8% and 28.3.2% respectively of male ex-combatants.
When asked to what extent local government and leaders take into account the concerns voiced by their community
when they make decisions, 17.6% of all ex-combatants across the GLR countries felt that local leaders took them
into account a lot, 41.2% felt their voices were taken into account a little, and 41.2% felt that their concerns were
not taken into account at all – nearly identical levels to those expressed by community members.176 Across gender
and disability dimensions, ex-combatants’ responses were approximately even. However concerning age, older ex-
combatants (aged over 40) were the most likely age demographic group (54.7%) to feel that their concerns were not
taken into account, while younger ex-combatants (aged 18-30) were most likely of age demographic groups to feel
that they were taken into account a lot (19.2%). This is likely related to older ex-combatants overall higher levels of
social capital.

10.5 Social Change
When asked about their outlook on the likelihood of their overall situation improving in the future, responses were
quite polarized between those who thought that things would improve in a few years and those that thought that
their situation would deteriorate in the future.177 Overall, only 1.2% of all ex-combatants across the GLR countries
thought that their situation would improve within some weeks, 5.2% thought it would improve in some months,
43.7% thought that it would hopefully improve in some years, 8.7% thought that their situation would not improve
in the future but stay the same, and 41.2% expressed that they thought that their situation would deteriorate in the
future. The only GLR country that stepped away from this trend was Uganda in which 71.7% of ex-combatants were

178   While there is no direct evidence for explaining why in this case ex-combatants in Uganda have more optimistic outlooks for their future, it is
possible that this is linked to the relative stability of Northern Uganda and the overall pace of improvement away from a context of widespread displacement
due to conflict and humanitarian intervention.

reported seeing their economic situation improving in the future) than their overall outlook (a total of 58.8% report-
ing expected improvement at various time scales). This evidence tacitly supports the idea that while ex-combatants
can make improvements relatively quickly in economic terms, the diverse set of challenges that exist in the social
sphere are slower to resolve.
When asked about whether or not they were satisfied with their life in general up until then, 30.6% of all ex-com-

61.9% were dissatisfied.179 This trend of the overwhelming majority of ex-combatants expressing dissatisfaction with
their life was consistent in all the GLR countries except for Uganda where the spread of responses was much more
even – 33.2% were satisfied, 30.7% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 36.1% were dissatisfied. These findings
are perhaps not surprising, considering the heavy toll conflict can take on the lives of individuals. However, these
effects are not isolated to ex-combatants – community member displayed a similar range of responses about life sat-
isfaction. However, these findings stand in contrast to those on overall happiness (see section 10.4) in which nearly
60% of ex-combatants indicated that they were generally happy. Understanding the interplay between ex-combat-
ants levels of happiness and their overall life satisfaction is a challenging task with no clear explanation in study.
Ex-combatants were questioned using a 10-step ladder response prompt. Their responses are tabulated below in
Table 12 by mean score.180 The lower the mean score is the closer the ex-combatant is to the bottom rung of the
ladder – where the poorest people tend to be. Generally speaking, across and within the GLR countries ex-combat-
ants consistently identified themselves in the poorest half of society (between steps 2 and 4).
When looking across the GLR countries as a whole, there is a slight improvement in mean scores in all question
categories from one year ago to the time of sampling. This trend is almost completely consistent within the indi-
vidual GLR countries with the only exception being DRC – in which there was a slight decrease in mean scores
from one year ago and time of sampling in the categories of finance, clothing and food. When focusing on demo-
graphic subgroups, however, there are less consistent results. Three demographic subgroups standout in particular:
female ex-combatants, ex-combatants aged 31-40, and disabled ex-combatants. Though female ex-combatants saw
near unanimous improvements across all categories, leisure being the only exception, they consistently ranked a
rung lower than male ex-combatants. Those aged 31-40 rank higher or equal than other age demographics across
all categories. Similar to the trend of female ex-combatants, disabled ex-combatants saw improvements across all
categories, leisure being the only exception. However disabled ex-combatants ranked consistently lower than non-
disabled ex-combatants.

10.6 Summary
The social-fabric of communities endures great detriment in the course of violent conflict. Indeed, it is no wonder
that ex-combatants and community members alike struggle to mend their damaged social footing. However, con-
sistent with analysis presented throughout much of this study, ex-combatants experience a range of additional chal-
lenges in the process of social reintegration that collectively entail their disadvantage to community members. While
collectively ex-combatants display a positive trajectory in terms of social reintegration, rebuilding social capital, and
connecting into the social fabric of the community, the angle of this trajectory is considerably more shallow than

in other dimensions of reintegration, such as economic – i.e. though ex-combatants are catching up to community
members in terms of social indicators, the rate at which they are doing so is considerably slower than in other dimen-
sions of reintegration. This evidence supports the idea that social reintegration is a slow process of social confronta-
tion and atonement with no shortcuts. Though trust with community members may improve quickly, as outlined
in section 17, ex-combatants still struggle to recover from the damage done to their social networks, solidarity with
the community, their cohesion and inclusion in the community, as well as their overall sense of empowerment and
positive social change.
Ex-combatants have fewer social groups than community members and slightly less familial contact than commu-
nity members overall. Though, ex-combatants who do have contact with their families have it much more frequently
than community members indicating their heavy reliance on their immediate family for social support. Accordingly
ex-combatants are more likely to turn to their family for economic help than friends or community / formal institu-
tions. In terms of ex-combatants’ friend base there is a clear split in the GLR countries. In Uganda and Rwanda, on
the one hand, ex-combatants have fewer friends than community members and thus an extremely focused social
support network relying heavily on the family. However, by contrast, in DRC and RoC ex-combatants had larger
friend bases than community members, indicating a good extended social support network – despite the clear
presence of a range of social limitations in relation to community members. Collectively these findings indicate the
extent to which ex-combatants’ social networks are more limited than those of community members and in turn the
extent to which the functions of those social networks are limited as well – i.e. the psychosocial and economic value
of social and familial networks.
Despite the challenges that ex-combatants face in the process of rebuilding interpersonal social ties within the com-
munity, they are generally well integrated and have a very similar understanding of the dynamics of their community.
Ex-combatants and community members alike have generally high levels of trust – though ex-combatants perceive
larger improvements in trust. The frequency at which ex-combatants work for the improvement of the community
and feel an overall sense of togetherness is similar to community members.
Ex-combatants generally feel similar if not stronger senses of empowerment to affect changes in the direction of their
lives and control their everyday circumstance than community members. This is further evidenced in ex-combat-
ants’ similar level of political engagement in community issues to community members. However, it is interesting
to see that higher senses of empowerment among ex-combatants does not necessarily translate to higher levels of
overall happiness or better perceptions of impact on the community. Indeed ex-combatants across the GLR coun-
tries report being much less happy than community members and are less likely to view themselves as having a
positive impact on the community. It is possible that ex-combatants’ overall happiness and senses of self-worth may
be more tied to the personal psychological trauma ex-combatants carry with them in the wake of conflict than their
absolute conditions (which while worse than community members in absolute terms, do display a clear positive
trajectory) at the time of sampling. If this is so, it would lend considerable support to the idea of social reintegration
as a slow, long-term process of interpersonal exchange and in turn intrapersonal betterment.
Despite ex-combatants’ lower levels of happiness and sense of positive impact on the community, their outlook on
the future and understanding of the temporal dynamics of social change are similar to community members. Ex-
combatants and community members alike understand that positive change in their overall situation will happen on
the scale of years – not weeks or months. This makes sense, as both community members and ex-combatants have
seen slight improvement in their overall conditions in the past years / since demobilization, ex-combatants less so in
absolute terms, but still consistently identify themselves in the worst off half of society.
10.6.1 Vulnerable Subgroups
When examining social reintegration female ex-combatants continue to represent the most clearly and consistent-
ly vulnerable demographic group among ex-combatants. Female ex-combatants have fewer and less diverse social
networks, tending to rely even more exclusively on their immediate family than the rest of ex-combatants – who do




                                                           87
so to a greater extent than community members. In this sense, female ex-combatants face the highest risk of social
isolation and marginalization across the GLR countries. This weak social capital in terms of the number and diver-
sity of social groups corresponds to lower levels of trust, lower perceptions of improvement in trust, dramatically
weaker senses of empowerment, and lower perceptions of their overall situation than the rest of ex-combatants.
Despite the clear and consistent rage of vulnerabilities that female ex-combatants exhibit, their overall levels of hap-
piness, life satisfaction and general outlook for the future are on par if not better than the rest of ex-combatants.
Developing a clear understanding of the social and psychological coping strategies that female ex-combatants have
developed to maintain even, if not more positive, senses of self worth, worth in the community, and outlook for the
future – effectively mitigating against their heightened vulnerability across almost all social indicators – could prove
relevant the development of future programming for female ex-combatants and male ex-combatants alike.
Disabled ex-combatants exhibit a complex range of disadvantages in terms of social capital. In general disabled ex-
combatants report far lower levels of personal empowerment and control of their lives. However, this is counter-
balanced against their unexpectedly higher levels of political engagement in the community and stronger sense of
positive impact on the community in comparison to non-disabled ex-combatants. In terms of social change disabled
ex-combatants perceive a positive trajectory of social change over time across a broad range of categories. However
despite this perceived positive trajectory, disabled ex-combatants consistently rank themselves a step below non-
disabled ex-combatants.

10.6.2 Unique Country Trends
Despite the many ways in which the individual GLR countries come together to represent a consistent collective
narrative of the process of reintegration, there are also many ways in which they diverge – especially in terms of
social reintegration. Here we can highlight a selection of unique country trends focused in DRC that represents an
alternate narrative of reintegration than the one consistent across the other GLR countries.
When examining the many dimensions of social reintegration across the GLR countries, DRC stands out most con-
sistently and sharply. As presented above, the dominant narrative of social reintegration reflected across the GLR
countries was one where ex-combatants had high levels contact with the family, though slightly less than community
members, but stunted development in terms of social networks, friends, and connections to the broader community
– in turn correlating to lower levels of happiness and perceptions of worth in the community. In DRC however, we
see a distinctly different narrative emerge.
Ex-combatants and community members alike in DRC have dramatically lower levels of familial contact than other
GLR countries. DRC stands out even further in this regard because it is the only GLR country where ex-combatants
are more likely to have contact with their family than community members – twice as much so. Further, those ex-
combatants who do have contact with their families have it at a much lower frequency (split between daily, weekly
and monthly contact) than in other GLR countries where daily contact was the norm (this divergence is also visible
in RoC). As such, it makes sense when ex-combatants in DRC are the most likely to say that their contact with their
family could be more frequent.
When pared with findings on marriage rates in section 7.2, what emerges is an image of ex-combatants in DRC
who are isolated from their immediate family though are on par with other GLR countries in terms of building new
familial connections (marriage / cohabitation). However, as mentioned, when ex-combatants in DRC are compared
to community members in DRC in terms of contact with the immediate family, community members are half as
likely to be in contact with their immediate family. This is a perplexing trend to explain. While ex-combatants in
DRC have weaker family networks than ex-combatants in other GLR countries, they are the only GLR country
that has stronger familial connections than community members – which could simultaneously suggest that ex-
combatants in DRC have been exceptionally successful in terms of rebuilding social capital relative to community




                                                           88
members; and that community members in DRC are a key vulnerable group across the GLR countries in terms of
social capital.
A hint to understanding the overall lower levels of familial contact in DRC is that of those few ex-combatants who
did have familial contact and felt that this contact was the maximum that they would desire – the distance, time and
cost of travel were all cited as reasons for not seeing their family more often. Indeed, the social geography of eastern
DRC is particularly troubling. While countries across the GLR have experienced varying scales of war, and in turn
levels of impact on society both economically and socially, the incessant insecurity in eastern DRC can perpetuate
a series of dynamic forces that disperse pre-conflict social networks through displacement and migration. Persistent
conflict and can trap individuals, due difficulty of travel due to zones continued insecurity. When these dynamic
forces are coupled with static forces such as the mountainous topography of eastern DRC and heavy rains that can
render roads impassible it is understandable that social networks are separated. Future study into this line of inquiry
could prove valuable for explaining why ex-combatants and community members alike in DRC have considerably
weaker familial and social networks than other GLR countries.
It appears that though ex-combatants in DRC have strong connections to their immediate family relative to com-
munity members this does not compensate for the overall lower levels of familial contact in absolute terms relative
to other GLR countries in terms of overall social capital. Indeed ex-combatants in DRC are the most likely group
among the GLR countries to turn to no one for economic help; have the weakest feeling of togetherness with the
community; feel they have the least amount of power to make important decisions in their life; perceive the weakest
ability to control their everyday activities; are the least likely to perceive that they make a positive impact on the
community; are the least likely to gather to express political concerns; the least likely to feel their voice is taken
into account by leaders; the most likely to think their overall situation will deteriorate in the future; and have the
lowest level of life satisfaction across the GLR countries. In terms of social change, DRC is the only country where
ex-combatants see drops in their perception of their situation relative to the rest of society in the last year in the cat-
egories of food, clothing, and finance – though beyond weak social capital ongoing insecurity in eastern DRC likely
plays a role in this.

                                          11. DDR Experiences

D         DR processes across the GLR countries have taken place in a diverse range of contexts, as such the amount
          of validly comparable data on all phases of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration is limited. As
          such, offering a comprehensive comparison of across the GLR countries of ex-combatants’ experiences of
the process and dynamics of return, reception, demobilization, reinsertion, and reintegration is unfortunately not
feasible in this study – primarily as a result of data validity challenges.181 However, drawing from the select data we
can offer comparative insights on: (i) ex-combatants’ experiences of reinsertion process across the GLR countries,
and (ii) a limited range of comparative insights regarding initial experiences with the community.

11.1 Reinsertion
In examining ex-combatants’ attendance to a range of information sessions on various topics from general informa-
tion to sessions on how to apply for credit or loans, and information on peace and reconciliation processes as part of
the reinsertion phase of programming there were quite unique trends in each GLR country, though approximately
even across all types of information sessions within each country.182 As a general indication, 96.3% of ex-combatants
attended a general presentation of information related to the reinsertion process in Burundi, 85.7% in DRC, 68.5% in
RoC, and 39.2% in Uganda. Looking at demographic subgroups, female ex-combatants and disabled ex-combatants
were noticeably less likely to have attended information sessions – 63.5% of all female ex-combatants versus 74.8%
of all male ex-combatants, and 59.5% of all disabled ex-combatants versus 74.5% of all non-disabled ex-combatants.
Within each GLR country the disparities between demographic subgroups were very similar to those at a cross-
country level, though fitting to the overall attendance level with each country.
When asked whether or not they thought they had received enough information about the reinsertion package
and its contents there was a clear correlation between the level of participation in information sessions within
GLR countries and the perception of receiving sufficient information. In Burundi 81.4% of ex-combatants felt they
received sufficient information regarding reinsertion, in DRC 65.2%, in RoC 45.8%, and in Uganda 19%. Further,
it is perhaps not surprising then that female ex-combatants and disabled ex-combatants, the two demographic sub-
groups least likely to attend information sessions on reinsertion package and process, were the most likely to feel that
they received insufficient information surrounding the reinsertion process and package – 44.4% of female ex-com-
batants versus 55.9% of male ex-combatants, and 41.7% of disabled ex-combatants versus 55.6% of non-disabled
ex-combatants.
Not only did the level of attendance to information sessions about the reinsertion package and process correlate
to the perceived level of information sufficiency among ex-combatants, but also to the actual frequency at which
they received reinsertion payments. The same descending trend can be observed again in Burundi, as 99.7% of




181   Essentially, the contextual differences between the different programming components of the entire DDR process in the various GLR coutnries
are at at times great – thus the range of captured data on ex-combatants’s experiences of these processes is equally diverse. A valid systemmatic comparison
of the different data from each context is judged as infeasible here. The few areas discussed here are those few in which data overlapped in each of the GLR
countries.
182   Rwanda is excluded from all findings regarding the reinsertion process due to incompatible data. For a review of the key trends in Rwanda see the
Rwanda comparative study report.




                                                                              90
ex-combatants received payments as a part of reinsertion, in DRC 88.3%, in RoC 56.2%, and in Uganda 35.6%.183
Collectively these findings suggest that across the GLR countries attaining a sufficient level of information and sen-
sitization regarding the reinsertion process is a key to reaping the benefits of reinsertion payments and support.
Female ex-combatants also showed a visible correlation between information and sensitization exposure and actual
reception of reinsertion payments at a cross-country level, though they were less likely to receive reinsertion as-
sistance than male ex-combatants overall - 62.9% of female ex-combatants versus 73.2% of male ex-combatants
received reinsertion payments. Interestingly, disabled ex-combatants – though they attended information sessions
on reinsertion less frequently and were less satisfied with the information they received – were nearly evenly as likely
(68.4%) compared to non-disabled ex-combatants (72%) to receive reinsertion payments at a cross country level.
When those ex-combatants who did not receive reinsertion payments were asked why they thought that they had
not received payments, a large number connected this to lack of information. In Uganda 44.4% of all ex-combatants
identified lack of information at some level as the primary reason they did not receive a reinsertion payment. Female
ex-combatants identified information more frequently than male ex-combatants in Uganda (55.1% vs. 43.7%). A
similar trend along gender lines existed across Burundi, DRC and RoC, in which 35.5% of females identified infor-
mation as the reason they did not receive reinsertion payments as compared to 13.7% of male ex-combatants.
Both ex-combatants who had received reinsertion payments and those who had not were question about their
levels of satisfaction with those payments. Surprisingly, there was no clear correlation between the rate at which ex-
combatants received reinsertion payments and their satisfaction with those payments. Across the GLR countries,
32.3% of ex-combatants were satisfied with their reinsertion payments, 33.9% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,
and 33.9% were dissatisfied. This trend was well reflected across the GLR countries with the exception of Uganda
where levels of satisfaction were more clearly polarized (41.3%, 14.3%, and 44.3%, respectively). With the exception
of RoC, female ex-combatants were generally more satisfied with reinsertion payments than male ex-combatants
(41.8% vs. 30.8% at a cross-country level), even though the rate at which they actually received reinsertion payments
was lower.
Similarly, when questioned further to their overall level of satisfaction with the totality of the reinsertion package
contents ex-combatants were generally satisfied. Across the GLR countries, 47.1% of ex-combatants said that they
were satisfied, 29.2% said that they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 23.7% were dissatisfied. This trend
towards general satisfaction is reflected within all of the GLR countries. Again, this is somewhat puzzling, as one
would expect some correlation between overall satisfaction of reinsertion packages and the rate at which they
are actually received. Female ex-combatants are more likely to be satisfied at a cross-country level (54.1%) when
compared to male ex-combatants (46%) – this is reflected in all GLR countries with the exception of DRC. Examin-
ing age demographics reveals some interesting contrasts. In Uganda and Burundi, there is a clear trend that as age
increases likelihood of satisfaction with the overall contents of the reinsertion package decreases. However this
trend was reversed in DRC, as age increased likelihood of being satisfied increased as well.
A comprehensive analysis of the uses of reinsertion payments across the GLR countries is challenging, however
we can extract several general observations here.184 Generally speaking the most consistently cited use of reinser-
tion payments was meeting immediate food and subsistence needs, suggesting that perhaps food security is among


183   The especially low reception of reinsertion payment in Uganda warrents some contextualization. Most ex-combatants in Uganda receive amnesty
and reinsertion / reintegration assistance retroactively after returning to their communities. This ”trickle in” model in the context of Uganda means that many
ex-combatants demobilize informally and thus the bottleneck for information and sensitization that formal demobilization processes represent is largely
absent – making information and sensitization a key programming challenge. In addition, this data does not necessarily mean that those ex-combatants that
have not received reinsertion payments have not received amnesty – as of 2011 (the time of sampling) the UgDRP still had a considerable backlog of upaid
reinsertion assistance.
184   The main barrier to a comprehensive analysis lay in the different scales used to capture data on the use of reinsertion payments across the GLR
countries. Rwanda is excluded from general trends due to lack of data.




                                                                              91
the most pressing needs for ex-combatants at the time of demobilization. Assistance to family, parents, spouse or
partner was also among the most common uses of the reinsertion payments. Additionally, investment of some sort,
for example for business or in livestock, ranked high among the uses of reinsertion payments.

11.2 Experiences of Return
Drawing from DRC, RoC, and Uganda we can see that the vast majority of ex-combatants (90.1%) report being
welcomed home by their families immediately after demobilization.185 This proportion was high in both DRC in
Uganda, but notably lower (81.4%) in RoC. This finding supports analysis across this report that ex-combatants
generally experience high levels of acceptance and support from their immediate families.
In accordance, after receiving reinsertion packages the majority (76.5%) of ex-combatants reported that they had
no problems with their families, however again in RoC this percentage was slightly lower – 63% of ex-combatants
had no problems with their family after reinsertion packages. In RoC female ex-combatants and disabled ex-combat-
ants were especially more likely to encounter problems with their families – 48.1% of female ex-combatants having
problems with their families after reinsertion payments versus 35.2% of male ex-combatants, and 53.6% of disabled
ex-combatants versus 35.7% of non-disabled ex-combatants.
When those ex-combatants who did encounter problems with their families after receiving reinsertion packages
were asked to explain the specific nature of these problems a distinct range of answers was given. Although there
is little data that is comparable across the GLR countries on this we can look at Uganda for a precursory survey of
the kinds of problems that ex-combatants may face. The range of explanations of the problems that ex-combatants
face with their families after receiving reinsertion packages in Uganda often reflected a perceived sense of animosity
from families and communities towards ex-combatants. Common explanations included: (i) family wanted to take
reinsertion money (19%), (ii) accusation of unfairness of payments to ex-combatants (14.3%); (iii) undermined
and ridiculed by community (9.5%); (iv) accused of seeking government handouts (9.5%); and (v) attacked by
neighbor for being an ex-combatant (9.5%).
Drawing from data on DRC and RoC we can observe that in general ex-combatants feel that most people in their
community treat them the same as they do everyone else – though this was slightly more so in DRC. This trend was
reflected in reference to a range of different social categories, e.g. elders, male peers, female peers, work colleagues,
people in authority, youth, and strangers. Younger ex-combatants (aged 18-30) were slightly less likely across almost
all categories to feel that people in their community treated them the same as other non-ex-combatants in the com-
munity.

11.3 Summary
This limited examination of the DDR experiences of ex-combatants across the GLR countries reveals two key findings
of substantial analytical value related to: (i) the importance of information and sensitization campaigns; and (ii) the
considerably different levels of acceptance and welcome that ex-combatants perceive from family members versus
the wider community upon initial return.
In terms of information sensitization, ex-combatants’ levels of participation in various information sessions about
the reinsertion and reintegration process has a clear correlation to ex-combatants’ levels of satisfaction with the
level of information they receive. This in itself is perhaps not surprising, but what is more so is that ex-combatants’
levels of participation in information and sensitization sessions have an equally clear correlation to the actual rate at
which ex-combatants receive reinsertion payments. Indeed, those ex-combatants who did not receive payment most


185   Rwanda and Burundi are absent from all findings on immediate reintegration experiences with the family and community due to lack of directly
comparable data.




                                                                         92
commonly cited lack of information as the reason why. The majority of ex-combatants are using reinsertion funds
for their intended purpose of meeting immediate subsistence needs. As such, It appears as though effective informa-
tion and sensitization campaigns, reaching a large proportion of ex-combatants, can play a key role in assuring that
ex-combatants do indeed receive reinsertion funds to meet their immediate subsistence needs upon return to their
communities – mitigating the economic burden on the families and wider communities that must absorb them.

Throughout this report there has been considerable evidence to show that ex-combatants experience very high
levels of acceptance and support from their immediate families upon return, in both social and economic dimen-
sions. However, by contrast, there is also considerable evidence to suggest that they face only a relatively moderate
level of acceptance from the broader community upon their immediate return. As outlined in section 17.2 of the
community dynamics portion of this survey, community members hold high levels of fear surrounding the return
of ex-combatants and the range of negative behaviors associated with them before ex-combatants’ return. However,
community members’ fear surrounding ex-combatants all but disappears in the time before their arrival in com-
munities to the time of sampling (4.05 years on average across the GLR countries). These findings are part of a
dispersed range of evidence that suggest that while the vast majority of ex-combatants are quick to reach accep-
tance and reintegrate into the family, they experience a slower, though positive, trajectory towards acceptance in the
broader community.

11.3.1 Vulnerable Subgroups

In terms of the limited range of DDR experiences explored here, female ex-combatants and disabled ex-combatants
experience a clear and continuous range of disadvantages. Female and disabled ex-combatants are the demographic
groups that are least likely to attend all varieties of information sessions about the reinsertion and reintegration
processes. In turn female and disabled ex-combatants are not only the groups least satisfied with the level informa-
tion that they received, but also the least likely groups to actually receive reinsertion payments – destabilizing their
ability to meet their immediate subsistence needs.

11.3.2 Unique Country Trends

As outlined repeatedly in the analysis in this section, the varying levels of ex-combatants participation in information
and sensitization sessions related to reinsertion and reintegration processes displayed a clear correlation to the rate
at which ex-combatants actually received reinsertion funds and presumably affected their ability to meet immediate
subsistence needs. With this we can ask: how were more ex-combatants exposed to information and sensitization in
Burundi and fewer in Uganda (the rest of the GLR countries falling in between)? What strategies were successful in
some instances and unsuccessful in others? A more explicit understanding of the considerable variation in informa-
tion and sensitization exposure across the GLR countries and its relationship to actual reinsertion payment recep-
tion and meeting of subsistence needs then would hold considerable programming value for the future.

                                       12. Conclusions

T        his study has found that across numerous dimensions ex-combatants in the GLR countries have been
         largely successful in reintegrating with community members. While across the range of core social and
         economic indicators explored in this study ex-combatants collectively represent a disadvantaged group,
they show a clear trajectory towards reaching economic and social parity with community members – in many cases
having already reached equal footing or occasionally exceeding community members’ performance across core indi-
cators of reintegration processes. This study has found that among ex-combatants across the GLR countries, female
ex-combatants and young ex-combatants (18-30) both male and female encounter a distinct range of additional
challenges in reintegration processes and in this represent key vulnerable groups. While young ex-combatants lag
behind their older peers, their overall trajectory is indeed positive. There is evidence to suggest that, however, for
female ex-combatants across the GLR countries there is a consistent range of structural barriers that at the very least
could slow down the processes of reintegration further, and at the very worst could leave them locked out of certain
economic and social processes – at a high risk for economic marginalization and social isolation.
There is no one driver or determinant of reintegration. Instead reintegration is understood here as embodied by a
diverse range of simultaneous and overlapping processes (e.g. social, psychological, political, economic) that dy-
namically interact with one another. In viewing the sum of these multiple reintegration processes and their interac-
tion we can grasp the overall trajectory of reintegration that ex-combatants hold in their return to and interaction
with the community.
Violent conflict throughout the Great Lakes Region has damaged the social and economic fabric of society; dis-
rupting economies, disintegrating families, and fragmenting social networks for ex-combatants and community
members alike. Thus understanding the challenges of reintegration must in part be understood in the context of
larger post-conflict peacebuilding and development processes. However the challenges that ex-combatants face in
rebuilding and reintegrating into the damaged social and economic fabric of society are immediate and acute. It is
ex-combatants’ ability to re-enter and make functional the familial unit and larger social networks in the community,
in turn the social and economic functions these social units play, that constitute evidence of successful reintegration
processes.
With this in mind it appears that ex-combatants have been successful in reintegrating into the family unit. Ex-com-
batants’ families have been open and accepting, serving the core function of the social and economic support while
ex-combatants gain footing. While families appear to have played an especially important role in the immediate
return of ex-combatants, the process of confrontation and exchange with the broader community appears to have
progressed much more slowly. Rebuilding social networks is not only essential for acceptance and participation
in the community, but for economic opportunity. In this, ex-combatants lag behind community members in their
broader social footing and economic security – remaining especially reliant on the familial unit.
It is with the support of the familial unit, and through their positive trajectory in terms of access to marriage, that ex-
combatants have reached parity with community members in terms of housing, access to land, and upward mobility
in land access. Though, ex-combatants continue to face challenges in terms of household hunger and nutrition.
Despite ex-combatants’ positive trajectory, they perceive themselves as worse off than others in the community
and see overcoming stigma and distrust in the community as the primary barrier to reintegrating with the commu-
nity, followed by education and qualification barriers that may exist as a result of time lost in conflict. Community

members corroborate ex-combatants’ perceptions, explaining a range of fears and stigma associated with ex-com-
batants upon their immediate return that, however, dissipate quickly over time leaving key barriers to ex-combat-
ants’ reintegration as revolving around making up time for missed education / skills qualification attainment and
a broader social and economic track record in the community. Even with the diverse range of social and economic
challenges that ex-combatants face, they have strong senses of empowerment to shape their situation going forward
(with the exception of females).

12.1 Ex-Combatants and Economic Reintegration
This study has found that ex-combatants across the GLR countries show a positive trajectory towards gaining self-
employment in agriculture or small business – though there is still considerable improvement that ex-combatants
must make to reach parity with community members. The context of economic reintegration across the GLR
countries is one of severe overall development challenges. As such, ex-combatants and community members alike
identify their primary barrier to gaining employment as lack of opportunity in general. Ex-combatants, however,
face a range of additional barriers related to: (i) closing literacy, education and skill gaps with community members;
(ii) establishing an economic track record; in order to (iii) access credit and other financial institutions; and (iv) to
erode stigma and distrust through the slow process of confrontation that social reintegration entails.
Collectively the unique barriers that ex-combatants face are a product of their overall stunted economic networks
– leading to an overall higher exposure to economic insecurity and reliance on the familial unit compared to com-
munity members – who have more diversified economic networks and tend to be more integrated into formal and
community based economic institutions.

12.2 Ex-Combatants and Social Reintegration
This study has found that ex-combatants across the GLR countries exhibit a positive, but shallow, trajectory of
social reintegration. While ex-combatants are quick to reintegrate with their immediate family and to breakdown
trust barriers with the wider community, their progress from there forward is slow – owing to their stunted social
networks and track record in the community. In this sense the social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants
are strongly interrelated – their long-term success revolving around rebuilding the networks that are instrumental
to social and economic security. Mending the damaged social networks and in many cases building new ones from
scratch, with the additional barriers of residual stigma and lack of social track record, is a slow process of confronta-
tion and atonement.
Though ex-combatants have remarkably high levels of agency in terms of social empowerment, often surpassing
community members, they understand that the process of social reintegration has no shortcuts and will take place
in the scale of years. With this ex-combatants remain significantly less happy and with lower levels of self worth than
community members – leaving them exposed to risk of marginalization and social isolation from the wider com-
munity.

12.3 Female Ex-Combatant Subgroup
Throughout the analysis of the reintegration processes of ex-combatants across the Great Lakes Region presented in
this study female ex-combatants have stood out as the most clear and consistent vulnerable subgroup. While young
ex-combatants (aged 18-30) and disabled ex-combatants display a range of disadvantages related to a lack of social
and economic track record and to health, respectively, they do not depart significantly from the overall positive
trajectory of ex-combatant reintegration in the Great Lakes Region. Female ex-combatants, however, encounter an
extensive range of disadvantages that collectively paint a picture of the structural barriers they face in reintegration
processes in terms of: (i) familial networks; (ii) economic networks; and (iii) broader social networks in the com-
munity. These structural barriers force a distinctly different trajectory of reintegration.




                                                           95
As discussed above, rebuilding damaged social and economic networks in the community is a key dimension to
the overall process of reintegration. Like male ex-combatants, female ex-combatants have done well to reintegrate
into their immediate families. However, unlike male ex-combatants, female ex-combatants have been largely unsuc-
cessful in building new familial connections through marriage – remaining the least marrying demographic group
across ex-combatants and community members alike. While male ex-combatants have seen a sharp rise in marriage
rates since demobilization, female ex-combatants have shown a very shallow, and ultimately marginal, trajectory of
increased marriage. Attitudinal indicators reveal that female ex-combatants have the smallest proportion of the pop-
ulation, both ex-combatant and community member, that is open to marrying them due primarily to stigma related
issues – lending some explanation for growing disparity in marriage rates between male and female ex-combatants.
Both male and female ex-combatants experience stigma, however in the case of marriage it appears to likely be a key
structural barrier to building new familial networks and in turn to accessing the social and economic resources that
they represent.
As discussed above, the context of economic reintegration in the Great Lakes Region is one of severe development
challenges. The primary pathway to economic stability for ex-combatants and community members alike is through
self-employment in agriculture – this is even more so for female ex-combatants. As such, access to arable land is
an important indicator of economic stability – in turn growth in access to arable land as an indicator of a positive
economic trajectory. In this female ex-combatants lag behind male ex-combatants with slightly lower levels of both
land access and improvement in access to land – which when combined indicate female ex-combatants’ shallower
trajectory of economic improvement – despite their slightly lower unemployment rate. There appear to be three
structural barriers to land access mobility for female ex-combatants: (i) capital; (ii) inheritance; and (iii) marriage.
First, both male and female ex-combatants alike identify access to capital as the largest barrier to increased land
access. However, for female ex-combatants, who have considerably lower literacy and educational achievement
levels, the challenges to accumulating capital through bountiful agricultural production are acute. Indeed, females
clearly identify lack of education and skills as among their key barriers to economic stability. Second, the challenges
to capital accumulation that female ex-combatants face are amplified when inheritance dynamics are taken into
account. Females who do experience increases in land access are much less likely than male ex-combatants to cite
inheritance – indicating that this is a pathway to land access, and in turn a positive economic trajectory, that females
are not accessing at the same level. Thirdly, marriage is an important pathway to increased land access for male
ex-combatants. However, as outlined above, female ex-combatants experience a set of distinct structural barriers
to accessing marriage. When these three dimensions interact, the result is a dynamic structural barrier that female
ex-combatants face in terms of building a positive economic trajectory and the economic networks associated with
them.
By effect of their structurally hindered familial and economic networks, female ex-combatants face challenges in
building social capital and broader networks in the community. This weak social capital in the community has con-
sequences for female ex-combatants in terms of lower levels of trust, lower perceptions of improvement in trust,
dramatically weaker senses of empowerment, and lower perceptions of their overall situation than the rest of ex-com-
batants. These factors collectively interact to put females at risk of marginalization and isolation with the community
– in turn potentially reinforcing the structural restraints that shape their weak familial and economic networks.
It is the dynamic interaction of the familial, economic and broader social structural dimensions that shape the overall
shallower trajectory of reintegration for female ex-combatants across the GLR countries and constitute them as a
distinctly disadvantaged group. Looking at the structural challenges that female ex-combatants face reveals much
about the overlapping, interrelated, and simultaneous nature of reintegration processes – an insight that is not only
relevant to female ex-combatants, but to all ex-combatants across the Great Lakes Region.

T        he following is a capture of the community member sample for this comparative study. The demographics
         presented here are not representative of the overall community member populations of each of the five
         GLR countries of study, but instead reflect a range of purposive sampling biases. For more information
about the specific sampling methods and decisions in each of the GLR countries please see the individual survey
studies in each of the five GLR countries.186 For a brief introduction to the reintegration programming context in
each of the GLR countries seesection 5.1.
The total unweighted sample of community members from across the five GLR countries amounts to 3,380 respon-
dents which, when combined with the ex-combatant sample of 6,475 respondents, represents 34.3% of the total
GLR sample. The total unweighted community member sample contributions from each of the five GLR countries
are as follows: Burundi comprises 15.1% (n=510) of the total Community Member Sample, DRC 21.4% (n=722),
RoC 43.1% (n=1456), Rwanda 15.1% (n=510), and Uganda 5.4% (n=182). However, in an effort to create valid
cross-country analysis of community members across the GLR, and especially for comparison to the ex-combatant
sample, which contains proportionally different sample contributions from the five GLR countries, the raw sample
contributions from each country have been weighted evenly. Further, for reasons explained below the valid sample
used for analysis in this study are often notably lower than the total sample of 3,380 community members.
Though Burundi does contribute 510 respondents to the total GLR Community Member sample no age, gender
or disability details were collected for respondents as a part of the Third Beneficiary Assessment in 2011 – thus a
systematic analysis of the Burundi portion of the total GLR community member sample along demographic lines is
not possible. In addition, little data was collected in Burundi that is directly comparable to the rest of the GLR data
anyways. In effect, with the exception of some short sections, data from Burundi will be absent from the analysis
here thus leaving the unweighted valid sample of community members at n=2870. Unless explicitly stated other-
wise, all cross country statistics from here forward refer to the valid sample excluding Burundi.
In addition, as discussed in more detail in Annex I, integration of the full range of data from the Rwanda Survey has
proved challenging in this study. The evolving format for the individual GLR country surveys has been a continual
process of learning and iterative refinement. The Rwanda survey format is the starting point from which surveys
evolved in RoC, Burundi, Uganda, and DRC. So, while data content in the Rwanda surveys is very much in line
with the rest of the GLR countries, much of the specific question formatting is often different enough that a direct
comparison of data is not feasible. Such instances are explained in footnotes.
Data along health and disability demographics also presents challenges in the total GLR community member
sample. Health and disability data for community members were only collected in Rwanda and Uganda – absent
from Burundi, DRC and RoC. However, even the data from Rwanda and Uganda is limited as only n=58 disabled
community members were sampled (n=49 from Rwanda and n=9 from Uganda). Thus, drawing valid comparisons
between these two samples of 49 and 9 disabled community members is judged as infeasible – furthermore, com-

paring these 58 disabled community members to the 454 disabled ex-combatants in Annex I of this study presents
further issues for validity. For these reasons analysis of community members along the lines of disability will be
absent from this section of the study.
Collectively the data restrictions present in this study of community members across the GLR countries mean that
the task of this study is to present a mosaic of findings. Up close, the pieces of the picture are not always complete
and data is not always congruent. However, there are clear data trends, nonetheless, that represent a distinct narra-
tive of community dynamics across the GLR countries.
Across the GLR countries, 61.2% of community members were male while 38.8% were female. In DRC and RoC
there was a fairly close split between male and female community members within the sample, while Rwanda and
Uganda were closer to the cross-country average split in gender. Table 31 above presents a cross-tabulated break-
down of age and gender demographics for the community member sample of each of the GLR countries.
Of the total sample of community members, 40% were between the ages of 18 and 30, 24.3% were between that ages
of 31 and 40, and 35.7% were over the age of 40.187 The within-country age splits of each of the GLR countries do not
necessarily follow cross-country trend. As is visible in Table 31 above, Rwanda and Uganda community members
between the ages of 18 and 30 are most dominantly represented while in RoC those over 40 are most represented
and DRC falls closer to the cross-country split.
The dimensions of the lives of community members explored in the following sections are key indicators of com-
munity dynamics and furthermore relate to the basic units and processes in society: the family unit, and the process
of marriage, in the community. The value of this section of the study is not just as a control group for which ex-
combatant progress can be studied, but also as a key measure of the overall levels of social and economic stability of
the core units of reintegration across society in the Great Lakes Region.

13.1 Marriage and Household
Marriage dynamics are an important indicator of community members’ basic social standing. Indeed, marriage
dynamics can tell us much about community members’ ability to leverage familial, economic, and social networks
towards the attainment of marriage and in turn their ability redouble their engagement in these social structures
through marriage – all indicators of a strong footing in the community.


187   Across the total sample of community members from the GLR countries there were 26 respondents under the age of 18. For purposes of
consistency in sample delimitation and comparative validity these 26 (3 from DRC and 23 from RoC) have been omitted from the sample for analysis here.

Across the GLR countries the most common groupings for marital status of community members are as follows:
48.6% are married, 16.9% are living with a partner but are not married, 22.3% are single and have never been married,
5.9% are separated or divorced, and the remaining 6.2% are widowed. These figures are very much an average as
within each of the GLR countries community members displayed a more unique distribution of marital statuses
(summarized in Table 32 below). In DRC and Uganda “married” is the most common marital status for community
members – at over 60% in both countries. While in Rwanda “married” is still the most common marital status, it
is almost evenly split with “single / never married”. The country that differs most from the general trend is RoC, in
which “living together” but not married is the most common marital status.
Across the GLR countries female community members were less likely to be married than male community members
(38.1% vs. 55.4%). In DRC and Uganda this trend was exaggerated and the gap between male and female commu-
nity members with the marital status “married” was as much as 38 percentage points (in Uganda). At a cross-country
level the lower representation of married female community members was effectively absorbed into the categories
of separated or divorced and widowed (11.1% and 12.8% respectively) which were much less common among male
community members (2.7% and 2.0% respectively). These findings should flag divorce, separation, and widowing as
key dimensions to female community members’ absolute disadvantage in marriage rates across the GLR countries
compared to male community members.
There was a visible positive relationship between age and likelihood of being separated, divorced, or widowed. Of
community members 18-30 years of age, 2.6% were separated or divorced and 0.3% were widowed, compared to 6%
and 3.3% (respectively) of those aged 31-40, and 9.6% and 14.4% (respectively) of those aged over 40.
Drawing exclusively from Rwanda and Uganda we can observe that only 5.8% of community members had a spouse
(married or unmarried) that was an ex-combatant, the remaining 94.2% having civilian spouses – though this does
not necessarily imply that their spouse was a combatant / ex-combatant at the time of marriage.188 On average female
community members were more likely to have an ex-combatant or combatant spouse (11.1%) compared to male
community members (3.9%). This could serve as at least a partial explanation for female community members’
higher levels of widowed marital status – while anecdotally this makes sense further study would be needed to
confirm this relationship


188   Rwanda and Uganda were the only GLR countries where surveys included questions on community members’ spousal ex-combatant status.




                                                                     100
Across the GLR countries 74.7% of community members report that they would not consider marrying an ex-
combatant, with the remaining 25.2% saying that they would consider marrying an ex-combatant. This trend was
generally reflected within the individual GLR countries with the exception of Uganda, where 56.8% of community
members said that they would consider marrying an ex-combatant and 43.2% would not.189 Across demographic
lines age showed a positive relationship with unwillingness to consider marrying an ex-combatant. Of those over
40 years of age, 85% were not willing to marry an ex-combatant, compared to 74% of those aged 31-40, and 66.7%
of those aged 18-30. The most common explanations for why community members were unwilling to marry an ex-
combatant revolved around various forms of stigma or fear.
Drawing exclusively from DRC and RoC, we can see that when community members observed other marriages
in the community in which one member is an ex-combatant, 44.9% of community members perceived these mar-
riages as having a harder time than those without an ex-combatant.190 When asked to explain further as to why they
thought these marriages were more difficult the most common explanations were as follows: (i) 35% of community
members cited misunderstandings; (ii) 22% cited brutality and fighting; and (iii) 8.5% cited bad habits of ex-com-
batants acquired during combat (including drug use).
Across the GLR countries 43.6% of community members see themselves alone as responsible for the financial and
food need of the family, 16.8% see their spouse or partner as responsible, and 25.5% see food and financial needs
as the shared responsibility of both themselves and their spouse or partner. The remaining 14.1% indicated that
household food and finance responsibility were dispersed among various other family members.191 Male communi-
ty members were significantly more likely to see household finance and food provision as solely their responsibility
(56.6%) compared to female community members (21.8%). Inversely, female community members were dramati-
cally more likely to see household finance and food provision as the sole responsibility of their spouse or partner
(36.8%) compared to male community members (4.7%). This gendered trend was especially exaggerated in DRC
(61.3 vs. 16.7% and 48.7 vs. 6.7 respectively).
 As age increases community members are more likely to see themselves as solely responsible for household finance
and food provision (32.7% of those age 18-30, 44.4% of those 31-40, and 51.5% of those over 40) and less likely
to see their spouse or partner as solely responsible (22.7% of those age 18-30, 18.8% of those 31-40, and 10.3% of
those over 40). It appears that this age-based trend may be primarily descriptive of female community members.
When looking at age trends in community members’ perceptions of household finance and food provision further
subdivided by gender there are distinct trends. Male community members see themselves as primarily responsible
for their household finance and food provision at even levels across all age categories (55.3% of those 18.30, 59.4%
of those 31-40, and 55.8% of those over 40). In contrast, as age increases for females so too does the likelihood of
seeing oneself as solely responsible for household finance and food (9.2% of those 18-30, 20.1% of those 31-40, and
40.2% of those over 40). As discussed above, as age increase so too does the likelihood of being separated, divorced,
or widowed. As such, those female community members who are separated, divorced, or widowed are highly likely
to see household finance and food provision as solely their responsibility (62.1% of those who are widowed and
70.1% of those who are separated or divorced). These findings should flag female-headed households as exposed to
particular economic instability.192


189   It is possible that the greater openess in Uganda is related to the nature of mobilization and reurn in which many ex-combatants were abducted or
forcibly recruited into conflict – upon return being simultaniously understood as victims and perpatrators. This dyanmic plus the widespread employment
of traditional reconciliation ceremonies in Northern Uganda (though not necessarily as a part of reintegration programming) may hold some explanitory
wieght.
190   DRC and RoC were the only countries where community members were asked about their perception of marriages in which one person was an
ex-combatant.
191      Rwanda is excluded from findings on household finance and food responsibility due to lack of directly comparable data.
192   A slightly exaggeraged version of this age trend in female community members existed for female ex-combatants as well.

13.2 Literacy, Education, and Vocational Training
Levels of literacy, educational achievement, and vocational training are important indicators of community members’
basic ability to engage with educational and vocational structures, to the extent they exist in the different GLR
country contexts, and further to leverage the dividends of this engagement towards further economic and social
opportunities – in the end solidifying their footing in the community.
Literacy was generally high
among community members                               Table 33: Community Member Literacy

more likely to be illiterate (32.4%
vs. 12.9%). After female community members, those aged over 40 are the second most likely group to be illiterate
(28.8%). These trends are displayed in Table 33.
In regards to educational achievement, community members most commonly had either some secondary education
(31%) or had completed secondary education (18.2); followed by some primary education (17.1%), completed
primary education (11.2%), and no education (11.1%).194 As is visible in Table 34, in Uganda education levels were
skewed lower overall. Across demographic lines there are a few interesting trends to extract. Female community
members are the most likely group to have no education (18.3% vs. 6.1% of male community members) followed by
those aged over 40 (17.3% vs. 8.4% of those aged 31-40 and 5.6% of those aged 18-30). Further, both female com-
munity members and those over 40 had educational achievement levels skewed lower overall.
Across the GLR, overall levels of educational achievement for community members were skewed higher than for ex-
combatants – with higher levels of partial secondary education (31% vs. 23.4%), full secondary completion (18.2%
vs. 5.2%), and partial or full higher education (8.5% vs. 2%). It is worth noting however that in DRC and RoC
ex-combatants displayed much higher levels of professional educational achievement than community members
(34.3% and 20.3% vs. 2.4% and 1.8% respectively).
Most community members reflected an understanding of the educational achievement gap between community
members and ex-combatants – (58.4%) of community members reported that they believe that ex-combatants have

lower levels of education than other people in the area in which they live.195 Of the remaining community members,
40.3% believe that ex-combatants and civilians have the same level of education and only 1.3% perceives that ex-
combatants have higher levels of education. In addition, 76.9% of community members said that the perceived
difference in levels of education between community members and ex-combatants was a problem. When asked
to explain further in Uganda community members most commonly pointed out that (i) ex-combatants wouldn’t
be able to gain employment and thus look after their families (33.9%) and that (ii) low literacy was a problem. In
DRC and RoC the most common responses from community members as to why ex-combatants’ lower education
levels were a problem were: (i) Irresponsible behavior (36.9%) and (ii) misunderstandings that lead to arguments
(31.4%).
Across the GLR countries, 20.8% of community members received vocational training in the last years.196 Male com-
munity members more frequently (22.9%) received vocational training compared to female community members
(17.6%). Age also showed a clear relationship to vocational training – the higher the age of community members
the less likely they were to have received vocational training (26.2% of those aged 18-30, 24.7% of those aged 31-40,
and 14.6% of those over the age of 40).
Of those 20.8% of community members who had received vocational training, 78.3% said that they were currently
using the vocational skills that they had been trained in.197 When the 21.7% of community members who were not
using their vocational training were asked to explain further the most common reasons cited were: (i) lack of tools or
work facilities (27%); (ii) still completing training; and (iii) no opportunity. Interestingly, while ex-combatants have

Uganda displays the highest rate of community member vocational training across the GLR countries (29.6%). Rwanda is excluded from findings on
vocational training due to lack of data.
197   Regardless of having received vocational training or not, 38.8% of community members across the GLR countries reported that they were

community members (35.7%).

received vocational training on average at twice the rate that community members do, in DRC as much four times
the rate and in Uganda at a quite similar rate, they are still less likely to be utilizing that vocational training than com-
munity members (62.7% vs. 78.3%). This could be an indication that while ex-combatants display a positive trajec-
tory in terms of closing education and skills gaps with community members, there may be additional barriers they
face to reaching parity that, at least in part, may revolve around access to social and economic networks or possibly
problems in reintegration programming design.198

13.3 Summary
The analysis of community member demographics and core indicators presented in this section are useful not only
as a backdrop against which to contextualize ex-combatant reintegration in the Great Lakes Region, but more gen-
erally as a baseline by which to understand the overall levels of societal stability and functionality of communities
across the Great Lakes Region in the wake of violent conflict.
Across the indicators explored in this section, community members consistently perform better than ex-combatants.
Community members are more likely to be married than ex-combatants – a fact that may help explain why com-
munity members are less likely than ex-combatants to see themselves alone as responsible for the food and finances
of their household.
Community members are married to ex-combatants at half the rate that ex-combatants are and attitudinally remain
largely closed to the idea – citing stigma as core reason.199 Indeed, when community members observe marriages in
which one member is an ex-combatant they commonly describe these marriages as problematic. These findings have
two core implications: (i) stigma is a core barrier to community member / ex-combatant intermarriage across the
GLR countries and (ii) beyond actual marriage rates the pool of partners who are attitudinally open to marriage with
ex-combatants is largest among other ex-combatants. If stigma shapes a portion of ex-combatants marriage pathway
as to one with only other ex-combatants this could have consequences for these familial units’ ability to interact
with the community – in a sense possibly facing compounded stigma barriers. The evolving nature of community
member and ex-combatant intermarriage should be flagged as a key issue for future studies in the GLR.
Community members across the GLR have education levels skewed significantly higher than ex-combatants – likely
a result of ex-combatants’ time lost while mobilized in conflict. Yet, community members are far less likely than
ex-combatants to receive vocational training as a part of reintegration related programming. Despite this, however,
community members are actually more likely to be currently utilizing their vocational training – suggesting that
there may be additional barriers to utilizing vocational training for ex-combatants including programming flaws.
Developing a stronger understanding of this dynamic should be flagged for future studies in the region.
13.3.1 Vulnerable Subgroups
In the demographics analyses of the community member sample for this study the most vulnerable sub-group that
emerges, as with the ex-combatant sample, is that of females. Generally speaking, female community members have
a similar range of disadvantages to male community members as female ex-combatants do to male ex-combatants.
However, the general gap between community member and ex-combatant samples is such that female community
members (and male community members for that matter) are almost always significantly better off than their ex-



198   Example of problems with vocational training components of reintegration programming design can include, for example, that vocational training
paths offered are not based on market analysis, in turn creating an oversupply of a particular set of skills in one area. This phenomenon is well documented
in a number of DDR programming contexts. See for example: Jennings, K. M. (2007). The struggle to satisfy: DDR through the eyes of ex-combatants in
Liberia. International Peacekeeping, 14(2), 204-218.
199   It is important to note that these findings do not differentiate between those community memebers who married combatants or ex-combatants and
those who married a civilians who later became combatants / ex-combatants.

combatant counterparts.
Female community members are less likely to be married than male community members (who are themselves
similarly likely to be married as male ex-combatants), though they are slightly more likely to be married than their
female ex-combatant counterparts. Female community members are three times more likely than male community
members to be separated or divorced and six times more likely to be widowed – though it is unknown whether
the male or female initiated the divorce or separation. Regarding marriage to ex-combatants, female community
members are three times more likely than their male counterparts to be married to an ex-combatant – though it is
unknown whether these marriages pre-exist the combatant / ex-combatant status of their spouse. However, female
ex-combatants are four times more likely than female community members to be married to an ex-combatant.
Similar to the ex-combatant sample, female community members had significantly lower literacy levels than male
community members. Both male and female community members displayed slightly higher levels of literacy than
ex-combatants – in accord, community members education levels were skewed higher overall than ex-combatants.
However, female community members’ educational achievement was skewed below that of male community
members.
13.3.2 Unique Country Trends
There are several important marriage-related trends that stand out in individual GLR countries that merit further ex-
amination. Rwanda stands out as the only country where community members marry less frequently than ex-com-
batants. However, we can add considerable contextual detail here. In Rwanda males are required to have access to
adequate housing in order to get married. However, the formal regulations for what qualifies as adequate housing in
Rwanda are somewhat narrowly defined under the policy of imidugudu - a large scale body of housing policy aimed
at consolidating dispersed housing in an overall effort toward villagization. The result has been inflation in adequate
housing prices and in turn a severe crisis in the availability of adequate housing overall that in effect is locking many
Rwandans out of official marriage – though they may cohabitate without formalized marital status.200
In contrast to community members, most ex-combatants are returning to Rwanda from Eastern DRC where they
have been away for an average of nine years. In this time some ex-combatants have married and when returning to
Rwanda bring their spouse with them. The legal status of these marriages in Rwanda is unclear, however it is possible
that some ex-combatants unwittingly navigate past the formal barriers to marriage that community members
face – in turn accounting for their slightly higher marriage rates. While it is likely that the interaction of housing
policy, marriage, and dynamics of return are key in understanding why ex-combatants marry more than community
members in Rwanda this exact narrative must be treated as conjecture. These topics should be flagged for future
analysis on reintegration processes in Rwanda.
Republic of Congo also stands out with unique marriage trends. In RoC marriage rates among community members,
and ex-combatants, are a fraction of those in other GLR countries. Instead, cohabitation with a spouse without formal
marriage is the primary marital status – even when disaggregated across age and gender groups. These findings are
confounding and go without clear explanation in this study. It is possible that: (i) there has been an unbeknownst
error in data capture and coding that produces these findings or (ii) that there is an unknown regional dynamic af-
fecting marriage for community members and ex-combatants alike in RoC. Future study on reintegration processes
in RoC should flag marriage as an area of special interest to further triangulate or refute these findings.
Lastly, in Uganda community members are more than twice as likely as the GLR average to report willingness to

marrying an ex-combatant in the future. Though there is no direct explanation it is possible that the specific dynamics
of combatant mobilization in Uganda may play a role in this trend. In Uganda abduction was a well-known tactic of
mobilization, especially by the LRA. Though abductees may have committed violent acts against their communities,
often forcibly, there is evidence that ex-combatants are simultaneously understood as victims (due to abduction and
forced recruiting) and perpetrators (due to the violence committed as soldiers) by community members – a factor
that has reportedly contributed to a general willingness to accept returning ex-combatants back into communi-
ties.201 This dynamic may contribute to community members in Uganda’s openness to marriage with ex-combatants.
Futures studies could flag this conjecture for further analysis.

                                 and Food Security

T         he context of communities in the Great Lakes Region is overwhelmingly one of severe development chal-
          lenges where small-scale agriculture is instrumental to individual and familial well-being in terms of both
          economic security and food security. As such, understanding the pathways to land access among communi-
ty members is a key contextual element for understanding the overall economic situation for community members
in the Great Lakes Region and their capacity to absorb returning ex-combatants. The following is an examination of
(i) the household characteristics of community members including issues of dwelling ownership and tenure; and
(ii) the food security of community members including their levels of access to land for cultivation.
Across the GLR countries community members are most likely to live with: (i) the same family as before conflict
(38.3%); (ii) with a family but different to that from before conflict (27.3%), or (iii) with a spouse or partner (21.5%).
These three categories were the most common across all GLR countries, but varied some in their distribution from
country to country. Uganda, where 51.7% of community members live with the same family; 25% live with a dif-
ferent family; and 22.2% live with a spouse or partner, displays the most exaggerated version of this cross-country
trend. As is visible in Table 35

the GLR countries with the clear exception of Uganda, where 67% live in a hut or tent, 18.1% live in a daub or wattle,
and 14.3% live in a house.203 Rwanda also stands out in that 68% of community members live in a house and only
1.8% live in a hut or tent. Across the GLR (including Uganda) female community members are more likely to live
in a house (50.2%) than male community members (37.2%). Marital status does not show a directly discernable
relationship to housing type. Age also shows a clear positive relationship to living in a house – 27.7% of those com-
munity members aged 18-30 live in a house, 45.1% of those aged 31-40, and 55.1% of those over the age of 40.204
Turning to patterns of ownership for housing among community members we can observe that most community
members either: (i) own the property they live on (43.2%); (ii) their relatives or parents own the property they
live on (20.5%); or (iii) their spouse / partner owns the property that they live on (9.3%). This trend was remark-
ably durable across the GLR countries, though in Uganda there were much higher levels of self-ownership (61.7%)
and in Rwanda renting was on par with self-ownership (36.9%).205 Despite the differences in housing ownership
among community members in Uganda and Rwanda there are very clear trends across gender and age demograph-
ics. As visible in Table 36 Female community members are less than half as likely to own the property they live on
compared to male community members (25.1% vs. 54.5%), and dramatically more likely to have their spouse /
partner own the property they live on (20.9% vs. 2%).
In regards to age demographics, as the age of community members increases the likelihood that relatives or family
own their housing decreases (34.4% of those community members aged 18-30, 14.8% of those aged 31-40, and 8.3%
of those over the age of 40) and the likelihood of self-ownership increases (23.2% of those aged 18-30, 44.7% of
those aged 31-40, and 64.4% of those over the age of 40).


203   It is possible that the dominance of semi-permanent housing in Uganda is an indication of the overall development level in Northern Uganda. It is
also possible that there is merely a reflection of traditional housing style preferences.
204   This age demographic trend is not reflected in Uganda – where hut / tent was the most common housing type across all demographics. For a more
in depth discussion of community member housing types see the Uganda Reporter Re-integration and Community Dynamics Survey Report (2011).
205   The higher rate of ownership in Uganda is likely a result of the lower barriers to owning the dominant housing type in Uganda: a hut or tent.
Inversely, in Rwanda housing shortages as a product of Imidugudu have increased the barriers to housing ownership.

Community members across the GLR countries generally see themselves as equally as well off as their neighbors
(57.3%), though 21.2% see themselves as worse off and 21.3% see themselves as better off. All of the GLR countries
reflect this trend of the bulk of community members seeing themselves as on equal footing to their neighbors. In
most countries the distribution is skewed towards seeing themselves as slightly better off, though RoC is the only
country where this skewing goes the other direction. Female community members were more likely to see them-
selves as worse off than their neighbors compared to male community members (25.2% vs. 18.6%).
In DRC and RoC, community members were asked how they perceived their living situation relative to two years
prior. The majority of community members (65.9%) see their situation as the same, while 18.5% see it as better and
13.8% see it as worse. In Uganda the same question was asked, but instead of being asked about their current situ-
ation relative to two years ago, community members were asked to rate their current living situation relative to five
years ago.206 In the case of Uganda, 62.6% of community members saw their current living situation as better than
five years prior, 16.8% saw it as the same, and 20.7% saw it as worse.207

14.1 Land Access and Food Security
Access to land for cultivation among community members across the GLR countries is generally high – 89.8%
report that they have access to land.208 This figure is characteristic of all the GLR countries except for RoC in which
access to land among community members was considerably lower (55.9%) in addition to being the only GLR
country where land access among community members was lower than for ex-combatants (94.2%) – though the
reason behind these findings are unclear. Female community members were slightly less likely to have access to land
for cultivation than male community members (87.3% vs. 91.3%).
When those community members who did not have access to land for cultivation were asked to explain why in
DRC and RoC the most common replies were: (i) all land was occupied (29.5%); (ii) fear for the return of conflict
(19.7%); and (iii) bad memories associated with their land and they did not want to return (14.2%).209 Female com-
munity members were less likely to cite land occupation as the reason for their lack of access to land for cultivation
than male community members (21.5% vs. 37.6%), and more likely to cite fear of conflict (25% vs. 14.3%) and lack
of capital (12.5% vs. 5.3%).
When community members who did have access to land for cultivation across the GLR countries were asked
whether they had more than two years prior, 44.5% said that they did have more access. This level of increased
access to land for cultivation is very much an averaged figure. There is a sharp split between DRC and RoC where
increased land access was high (69.1% and 71.6% respectively), and Uganda in which only 15% reported increased
access.210 However, a closer inspection of community members in Uganda with a more finely grained scaled shows
that while only 15% had increased access to land for cultivation, 49.4% had the same level of access as two years prior
and 36.5% had less access.
Of those community members who had less access to land than two years prior across the GLR countries there
were a range of explanations given. In Uganda the most common explanations were that there had been regulated


206       This question about community members’ perception of their current living situation relative to a previous point in time was not asked in Rwanda.
207       These findings are particularly subject to periodization issues and should be treated cautiously.
208   Rwanda is absent from findings related to land access, change in land access, and reasons for positive and negative changes in land access due to lack
of directly comparable data.
209       This question about why community members did not have access to land for cultivation was only asked in DRC and ROC.
210   One possible explanation that has been put forth, anecdotally, for the relatively high increases in access to land in DRC and RoC is that access to
land for cultivation in these countries has been so low to start with, due to displacement as a part of prolonged conflict and insecurity, that the consolidation
of a relative peace in DRC and RoC has exposed a larger proportion of the population to the possibility of increases (effectively having started with no land
access) than in other GLR countries where some land ownership may have persisted through conflict.

DRC and RoC lack of resources (25.8%), land infertility (20.8%), and land sale (20.8%) were the most common
explanations.
Across the GLR countries when community members were asked to explain why they had more access to arable
land for cultivation than two years prior there was a range of explanations. In Uganda the most common explanation
was that a household member had purchased more land for investment (40%) – this answer was especially promi-
nent for female community members (50%) compared to male community members (38.1%). In DRC and RoC,
inheritance was also an important pathway to increased access to land for cultivation (29.1%), especially for female
community members (33.4%) compared to males (26.7%).
Across the GLR countries livestock ownership, excluding poultry, is generally low among community members
(35.5%), with the exception of Uganda where livestock ownership is significantly higher (66.3%).211 Despite these
differences female community members were the least likely demographic group to own livestock (25.4%), espe-
cially when compared to male community members (42.7%).
When those who had no livestock were asked to explain further the four most common answers from community
members across the GLR countries were as follows: (i) 25.4% cited lack of access to suitable land; (ii) 19.7% cited
crime; (iii) 19.4% cited insecurity due to conflict (39.1% crime and insecurity collectively); and (iv) 18.8% cited
poverty. While instructive of general trends, these cross-country figures do not fully depict the intricacies of the
range of explanations given in each GLR country. For example, in DRC poverty was the most common explanation
(28.8%) and livestock theft was less frequently cited (9.7%), while in RoC poverty was infrequently cited (1.9%)
and livestock theft was much more frequent (31.8%). A summary of the range of explanations for lack of livestock
among community members can be found above in Table 37.

access to land for cultivation, in addition
to livestock ownership and household hunger and nutrition, as core indicators of food security for community
members, is important for understanding the overall development context of GLR countries.
Across the GLR countries, 27.5% of community members reported that people in their household never went
hungry, 35.4% seldom, 28.8% often, and 8.3% always.212 Uganda stood out from these dominant trends – the entire
distribution of community members being shifted towards less household hunger (35.9% never, 51.4% seldom,
11.6% often, and 11.1% always). Female community members across the GLR countries were slightly less likely to
never go hungry than males (24.9% vs. 29.3%). Age showed a distinct relationship to household hunger - as age in-
creases the likelihood of belonging to households where people always or often go hungry increases. In accordance,
as age increases the likelihood of coming from a household that seldom or never goes hungry decreases (as visible
in Table 38).
Household nutrition and nourishment has largely been unchanged (41.9%) for community members over the last
two years. Of those who have seen a change in household nutrition, 32.5% have seen improvements and 25.6% have
seen deterioration. Again, Uganda stood out from this trend with higher levels of nutritional improvement (55.2%),
and less unchanged nutrition (19.9%) as well as deterioration of nutrition (24.9%). Across GLR countries female
community members were slightly less likely to see improved nutrition and more likely to see worsening nutrition
(28.8% and 28.3% respectively) when compared to male community members (35.2% and 23.6% respectively).
Age showed a negative relationship to improved nutrition (38.6% of those 18-30 years of age, 37.9% of those 31-40
years of age, and 24.8% of those over 40 years of age) and, in accord, a positive relationship to worsening nutrition
(20% of those 18-30 years of age, 20.5% of those 31-40 years of age, and 32.8% of those over 40 years of age).

14.2 Summary
Community members across the GLR countries display a range of unique trends in regards to their patterns of
housing, property ownership, land access and livestock. Indeed, focused analysis reveals that there is much further
variation along regional and factional lines within each individual GLR country. However, despite this variation
there is a core set of trends that emerge. Community members are most likely to be living in some form of family
structure – whether it is the same family that they lived with before conflict or a different one. Community members



212   Rwanda is absent from findings on household hunger and nutritional change due to lack of directly comparable data.




                                                                        111
are most likely to be living in a house that they or someone in their family owns. This is a very similar picture to that
of ex-combatants across the GLR countries.
Access to land for cultivation is generally very high for community members as is the stability of this access – i.e.
while there is variation from country to country as to increases in land access, there are relatively few commu-
nity members who have seen decreases in land access since the years before sampling. Those who do see increased
access to land do so most commonly through household land purchase with capital from high agricultural yields
or through inheritance. In contrast to ex-combatants, few community members cited marriage as a key pathway to
increased land access.
Livestock ownership across the GLR countries is generally low – though slightly higher than among ex-combatants.
Community members cite lack of access to resources such as capital or suitable grazing land as a key reason for low
livestock ownership in addition to overarching concerns about crime and general insecurity.
Food security remains an important concern for community members across the GLR countries. While community
members generally face a significantly lower level of food insecurity compared to ex-combatants across the GLR
countries, there is still a sizable portion that often or always experience household hunger. Collectively, country to
country variation in levels of access to land for cultivation and livestock among community members appears to
show little relationship to core indicators of food security – which may be as much related to the overall economic
situation in each of the GLR countries (e.g. through inflated prices of food stocks) than to land access and livestock
ownership outright.
14.2.1 Vulnerable Subgroups
Female community members across the GLR countries display a range of differences in terms of the housing, land
access, and food security that collectively may not necessarily entail a disadvantage, but do at least indicate a slightly
altered narrative. Females are more likely to live with a different family than before conflict – possibly in part because
of their high rate of being widowed compared to male community members. Female community members are more
likely to live in a house, but dramatically less likely to own their house – instead commonly citing spousal or familial
ownership. Female community members have slightly less access to land for cultivation than male community
members in addition to being less likely to owning livestock. However, female community members fare better
overall in indicators of food security across the GLR countries.
Female community members overall perform slightly better than female ex-combatants across the GLR countries
in terms of housing, land, livestock, and food security. The core difference in the narrative that female community
members and female ex-combatants experience across the GLR countries is that female community members are
generally more likely to be integrated into a familial unit and reap the benefits this extended support network.
14.2.2 Unique Country Trends
As outlined above, land access among community members in RoC is considerably lower than on average across
the rest of the GLR countries. It is possible that this trend is a product of the sample from RoC being captured ex-
clusively in the Pool region of the country. Pool was the region of RoC in which the low level insurgency prevailed
in the early 2000s and persisted longer than in other parts of the country. Due to displacement, insecurity and
laggard recovery, land access has become a prevalent issue. Indeed, while community members in RoC have seen
the greatest increases in their levels of land access of the GLR countries this is likely because community members
in RoC started with very low land access at the end of conflict in the first place – and despite large improvements
continue to have the least access to land across the GLR countries. Land access in RoC is also likely tied to the lowest
levels of livestock ownership across the GLR countries.

T         he following is an analysis of the economic status of community members and their relationship to that of
          ex-combatants across the GLR countries. The analysis proceeds in five main parts: (i) an examination of
          community members’ employment statuses and general outlooks on employment; (ii) an examination of
the barriers that non-economically active community members face to gaining a stable economic status; (iii) an ex-
amination of female community members’ specific economic issues; (iv) an examination of community members’
levels of income, savings, and access to credit as indicators of their general economic stability and ability to leverage
economic opportunities; and (v) an examination of community members’ level of engagement with economic as-
sociations as an extended support / opportunity network.
The structured analysis here follows in close parity with that of the ex-combatant sample, serving as a comparison
for charting the degree to which ex-combatants achieve economic reintegration and economic stability – the two
not necessarily being the same thing. Indeed, conventional wisdom is that economic reintegration is essential for the
process of building peace and security – however the economic context across the Great Lakes Region is often one
of severe development challenges posed to both community members and ex-combatants alike. One way to view
this is that ex-combatants reaching parity with community members along economic lines may end up meaning
reaching a state of economic instability equal to community members.

15.1 Economic Status and History
Employment status was very consistent across the GLR countries for community members through time (prior to
conflict, at the end of conflict, and at the time of sampling).213 As can be seen in Table 39 the most common em-
ployment status for community members across the GLR countries was self-employed in agriculture (36.9% prior
to conflict, 42.5% at demobilization, and 38.3% at sampling). It appears that the slight spike in those community
members self-employed in agriculture at the end in conflict coincides with drops in the number of unemployed
and, more notably, drops in the number of community members studying or training compared to before conflict
(19% prior to conflict, 11.8% at the end of conflict, and 7.9% at sampling). Uganda displays an exaggerated version
of this trend, as prior to conflict most community members in Uganda were studying or training (43.3%) followed
by self-employed in agriculture (33.9%), however by the time of sampling the employment statuses of community
members in Uganda fell very much in line with the cross-country average.
Female community members were slightly more likely to be unemployed, self-employed in retail, or a housewife
working in the home at all time periods when compared to male community members (see Table 39). Over time
female community members have seen a slight drop in the rate of being self-employed in agriculture accompanied
by slight increases in public and private sector employment as well as unemployment.
When those community members across the GLR countries who were not employed at the time of sampling were
asked to explain why they were not working, there were several dominant responses: (i) 43% said they were not
working due to lack of opportunity; (ii) 16.8% cited financial problems (including lack of access to credit); (iii)



213   Due to the state of continued conflict in DRC, employment status was surveyed in reference to 5 years ago, 3 years ago, and today. Data on
community member employment status in Rwanda is only available for the time of sampling.

The use of the phrase “at three time points” indicates that respondents were surveyed at one time point with questions regarding three different time points.
Because of the inclusion of Rwanda, cross-country community member employment status at the time of sampling is biased compared to data for before conflict
and at the time of demobilization programming. For example, the cross-country GLR figure for unemployment at the time of sampling without Rwanda in the
sample is only 13% – compared to 17%. These cross-country figures should be approached cautiously and with an eye for detail.

11.1% cited lack of sponsor; and (iv) 11.8% pointed to lack of marketable skills.214 Uganda stood out from this
general trend in reasons for not working – instead the majority (44.4%) said they were not working because they
were a student (matching the findings on Uganda’s higher rate of studying and training above).
Female community members across the GLR countries were less likely to cite lack of opportunity and lack of
sponsor as the reason for their unemployment (37.6% and 8.6%, respectively) than male community members
(48.2% and 13.1%, respectively). Inversely, female community members were more likely to cite a lack of market-
able skills and financial problems including lack of credit (18.6% and 19.4%, respectively) compared to their male
community member counterparts (5.8% and 14.1%, respectively). Along age demographic categories, those com-
munity members aged over 40 were less likely to cite lack of opportunity as a reason for their unemployment (36.5%
vs. 51.9% of those 31-40 and 45.4% of those 18-30) and more likely to cite financial problems including lack of
credit (23.3% vs. 13.9% of those 31-40 and 8.5% of those 18-30).
Across the GLR countries 31.9% of community members reported having more than one job / income earning ac-
tivity.215 When asked to explain further in Uganda there were several key responses: (i) 31.1% cited income supple-
mentation for general survival as the reason for having more than one income earning activity; (ii) 19.7% explained
that they subsistence farmed in addition to having a small business; and (iii) 19.7% said they worked more than
one income generating activity for the general betterment of their economic situation. Females in Uganda were less
likely to subsistence farm on the side of another job (14.3%) and more likely to work more than one job to meet
basic needs (35.7%) than male community members (21.3% and 29.8%, respectively). In DRC and RoC the range
of explanations was similar though differently distributed, 40.7% farmed on the side of another income generating
activity and 19.1% worked more than one job to meet basic needs.
Of community members across the GLR countries, 57.3% would be willing to consider moving to another part
of their country for better job opportunities.216 This figure reflects the trends in DRC and RoC well, however in
Uganda the proportion of community members willing to consider moving for improved job opportunities was
tipped the opposite direction (66.9% reporting that they would not consider moving). Across the GLR countries
female community members were slightly less willing to consider moving for better job prospects compared to male
community members (53% vs. 60.3%). Also, community members over the age of 40 were less likely to be willing
to consider moving (49.2% vs. 64.5% of those 31-40 and 61.7% of those 18-30) – sacrificing their overall stronger
social footing in the community.
When community members who were willing to consider moving for improved job prospects in Uganda were asked
to explain further the most common responses were: (i) to improve their standard of living (33.9% total – 46.7% of
females vs. 29.3% of males) and (ii) to seek out new opportunities and experiences (21.4% total – 6.7% of females
vs. 26.8% of males).217 Again in Uganda, when those community members who were not willing to consider moving
to another part of the country for improved job prospects were asked to explain further the most common responses
were: (i) lack of education / still being a student prevents work (31.9% total – 42.5% of females vs. 26% of males)
and (ii) family responsibilities (30.1% total – 35% of females vs. 27.4% of males).
Drawing from Uganda only, 59.4% of community members reported that they believe that it is harder for ex-com-
batants than others to find a job (compared to 78.7% of ex-combatants in Uganda and 64.6% of ex-combatants


214   Rwanda is absent from findings on explanations for unemployment among community members due to lack of directly comparable data. The term
”sponsor” here refers to the apprentice / master relationship. Community members are saying that they do not have anyone to apprentice under.
215   Rwanda is absent from findings on number of community members who participate in more than one economic activity and the reason why due to
lack of directly comparable data.
216      Rwanda is absent from findings on community member willingness to migrate for better economic opportunities due to lack of directly comparable
data.
217   Questions regarding community members’ explanations for willingness to migrate for economic opportunities were only asked in Uganda.




                                                                        115
overall).218 Female community members in Uganda were slightly more likely to perceive that ex-combatants had a
harder time finding jobs than others when compared to male community members (64.2% vs. 57.4%). In addition,
age showed a negative relationship to the perception that ex-combatants have a harder time finding a job (67.5% of
those 18-30, 57.9% of those 31-40, and 48.1% of those over 40).
Collectively community members’ economic trajectory and understanding of the dynamics surrounding this tra-
jectory come together in community members’ overall outlook on their future. The vast majority of community
members (77.9%) see their economic situation improving in the future. Both male and female community members
across the GLR displayed a very similar positive outlook (79.3% vs. 76.8% respectively). Age displayed a negative re-
lationship to the frequency of reporting a positive outlook on one’s economic future with a steep threshold for those
aged over 40 (83.2% of those 18-30, 81.7% of those 31-40, and 65.3% of those over 40) which, as outlined below, is
especially tied to health related issues.
The range of explanations given from community members for a positive outlook on economic prospects in the
future were diverse across the GLR countries, making a meaningful cross-country comparison difficult, however a
certain range of responses were more common: (i) improved agricultural performance was seen as key in Uganda
(23.3%) however less important in DRC and RoC (11.6% and 8.6% respectively); (ii) gaining employment was
important in all countries (15.8% in Uganda, 16.8% in DRC, and 12.9% in RoC); (iii) personal effort or hard work
was especially important in RoC but much less so in Uganda and DRC (35.8% in RoC, 13% in Uganda, and 17% in
DRC); (iv) religious faith / grace of god was central in DRC and RoC (25% and 20.5% respectively) and completely
absent (0%) in Uganda.219
Of those community members who had a negative outlook on their economic prospects in the future there were
also a range of common answers: (i) ill health was a common response in Uganda and DRC (34% and 22.2%, re-
spectively) – this was an especially prevalent response among community members over the age of 40; (ii) poor
agricultural yield was a common explanation in Uganda and RoC (21.3% and 23.2%, respectively); and (iii) general
economic decline / lack of opportunities was a frequent explanation as well (14.9% in Uganda, 24.2% in DRC, and
34.3% in RoC).
As a final point, looking only to DRC and RoC we can observe that 56.1% of community members work for pay 12
months of the year, the remainder working for paid labor closer to the average 9.47 months a year. This makes sense,
as 72.3% of all community members work 1-3 months for unpaid labor in addition to their paid labor. Female com-
munity members worked slightly longer on average for both paid and unpaid labor compared to make community
members (9.59 months paid labor vs. 9.36 months, and 3.23 months unpaid labor vs. 3.05 months). Community
members over the age of 40 had the largest average period of the year spent in paid labor (9.78 months) and the
lowest average period spent in unpaid labor (3.07 months).
It appears as though in DRC and RoC, community members most commonly fall into one of three categories: (i)
working 12 months a year for paid labor; (ii) working 12 months a year for paid labor and for 1-3 months of the year
(farming season) working for unpaid labor; and (iii) working for around nine months of the year for paid labor and
spending the remaining three months (farming season) in unpaid labor.




218   Again, Uganda is discussed exclusively here because questions on the perception of relative difficulty that ex-combatants have finding jobs were only
asked to community members in Uganda, whereas in ex-combatant surveys the same question was asked across all GLR countries excluding Rwanda.
219   These findings should not play down the role of religion in Northern Ugandan culture. For example, the Acholi people have a rich tradition of belief
blending indigenous and Christian religious customs. Rwanda is excluded from findings on reasons for community members’ positive and negative outlooks
on their overall economic situation due to lack of directly comparable data.

15.2 Non-Economically Active Community Members on Employment Issues
Those community members across the GLR countries who were not economically active explained a range of
coping mechanisms to get by financially without an income. Most commonly, community members reported that
they relied on cash contributions from family (28%), borrowed money from unspecified sources (19.3%), used past
savings (15.8%), or got help from public sources such as the community or a church (14.1%).220 Female community
members were less likely to use savings (11.7%) compared to male community members (19.5%) and more likely
to rely on cash contributions from family than male community members (33.9% vs. 23%), supporting the idea
that females (ex-combatants and community members alike) are especially reliant on the family and have fewer
economic support networks overall. Age showed a positive relationship to the likelihood of using savings to get by
(8% of those 18-30, 17.8% of those 31-40, and 19.8% of those over 40).
Looking specifically to Uganda, a large proportion of non-economically active community members (77.8%) believe
that that they have a harder time finding a job than other people.221 Further, 100% of non-economically active female
community members thought they had a harder time finding a job compared to 66.7% of their male counterparts.
When asked to explain why they thought they had a harder time, non-economically active community members in
Uganda most commonly cited incomplete studies / still a student (28.6%), low or no education (28.6%), and dis-
ability (28.6%). Female community members cited lack of education or qualifications at a higher rate (50%). This
reinforces the evidence that community members, at least in Uganda, see education as a key pathway to gaining
employment.

answers.222 Those who had a positive outlook explained their optimism with one of three answers: (i) that they hold
qualifications and have papers (50%), (ii) that they are currently pursuing studies, and (iii) that they are bright,
capable, hard working and motivated. Of non-economically active female community members in Uganda with a
positive outlook on gaining employment in the near future, 100% explained their optimism as tied to their current
studying.
Of those non-economically active community members in Uganda who had a negative outlook on gaining employ-
ment in the near future there were also three common explanations: (i) that they were disabled (50%); (ii) that
they had low or no qualifications (25%); or (iii) that corrupt officials made gaining employment unlikely (25%).
We can take away that, at least in Uganda, non-economically active community members perceive the attainment
of education as among the key pathways to gaining employment in the near future – and inversely the lack there of
as a key barrier.

15.3 Female Community Members on Employment Issues
Non-economically active female community members across the GLR countries generally did not feel discrimi-
nated against as a female (83.2% did not feel discrimination and 16.8% did). Uganda was the only GLR country
that stood out from this trend – where 50% of non-economically active female community members felt discrimi-
nated against on the basis of being female. In Uganda, 100% of those non-economically active female community
members identified male bosses or employers as the ones discriminating against them on the basis of gender. 223
When economically active female community members across the GLR countries were asked whether they per-
ceived being discriminated against on the basis of being a female the proportion which felt discriminated against as a
female was similar, but slightly lower (14.6%) than with non-economically active females. In Rwanda discrimination
was perceived on the lowest level (4.8%) across the GLR countries, while it was highest in Uganda (23.3%). Still
looking at Uganda, of those economically active female community members who did feel discriminated against on
the basis of gender 57.2% identified that discrimination as coming from co-workers (50% of those specified male
co-workers, 25% female co-workers, and 25% all co-workers).
When economically active female community members across DRC and RoC were asked whether they perceived
female ex-combatants as having a harder time, 36% responded yes (the other 64% replying no). When those 36%
that did think that female ex-combatants had a harder time than others were asked to explain, the most common
explanations were the brutality and misconduct of ex-combatants (34.6%), the poor reputation of ex-combatants
(32.1%), and distrust of ex-combatants (12.6%).

15.4 Income, Savings and Access to Credit
In the context of the severe development challenges that characterize most of the Great Lakes Region, levels of
community member economic activity are a good starting point for understanding basic individual and household
economic stability. However, it is through more closely examining community members’ income, savings and access
to credit that we can begin to reveal some about their ability, or in some cases lack thereof, to move beyond mere
subsistence by leveraging economic opportunities and in turn exhibiting economic mobility.
Across the GLR countries, 49.7% of community members reported that they were the sole breadwinner in their
household, the remaining 50.3% reporting that others assist them. Despite this cross-country average, communi-
ty members within the individual GLR countries responded in different proportions as to whether they were the

usually have to borrow money, 21% rely on money transfers from family, and 4.5% use past savings.224 Only 3.2% of
community members usually have money left over after meeting their monthly expenses. Within each of the GLR
countries the variation across these responses is displayed in Table 42. Female community members were less likely
to break even in their monthly expenses than males (22.9% vs. 32.5%) and more likely to rely on family money
transfers (24.4% vs. 19.3%) and borrowing in general (49.8% vs. 38.2%).
Regarding age demographics, those 31-40 are the most likely age group to break even on their monthly expenses
(38.70%) and the least likely to rely on family money transfers (10.7%) – whereas those 18-30 and over 40 were
less likely to break even (25.1% and 29.5%, respectively) and more likely to rely on family money transfers (24.9%
and 23.7%, respectively). However, in terms of borrowing more generally those aged 31-40 were on par with other

pendent from the familial unit in which they were raised, though not yet having established their own familial unit

triangulation in future studies.
Of those 65.4% community members across the GLR countries who are sole breadwinners and have a shortage of
income for meeting their monthly expenses, they are on average short by 46% of their required income. Of those
4.2% of community members across the GLR who have a surplus of income after meeting monthly expenses, they
have on average a surplus of 32% of their income. Within-country averages for monthly income deficit and surplus
are displayed in Table 43. Female community members on average have larger income shortages (mean 53%) and
slightly smaller surpluses (mean 30%) than male community members (mean 41% and 34% respectively). Age
showed a negative relationship to the average income shortage among community members (mean 51% of those

financial institution, the remaining 86.7% never having applied (possibly due to lack of access). This cross-coun-
try figure is very much an average in that there was a clear split between DRC and RoC, on the one hand, where
micro-credit application rates were very low (5.3% in DRC and 3.4% in RoC), against Rwanda and Uganda, on
the other hand, where higher proportions of community members had applied for micro-credit (24.6% and 26.4%
respectively). This division may be a product of the overall levels of development in the sampled areas of DRC and
RoC (especially eastern DRC) – financial institutions as such being nearly non-existent. Generally speaking female
community members were just as likely to have applied for micro-credit across the GLR countries when compared
to male community members (13.1% vs. 13.4%). In Uganda there was a gendered trend visible in which 37.1% of
female community members versus 19.6% of male community members had applied for micro-credit.
Of those community members who had applied for micro-credit most had successful applications (90.4%). At
a cross-country level female community members reported slightly lower success rates in micro-credit applica-
tions (84.4% vs. 94.5%) – at a within-country level there is further nuance to examine. In Uganda, male commu-
nity members were 100% successful in their micro-credit applications compared to 69.2% of female community
members. Inversely, in RoC 85% of female community members had successful applications compared to 60% of
male community members. The explanatory factor behind these opposing gender trends in micro-credit application
rates is challenging to identify, but could prove a useful direction of inquiry in future studies.

economic association in Uganda belonged to and 61.1% of those in Rwanda belonged to.226 The next most common
form of economic association among community members was farmers associations (8.3%) – of which female com-
munity members were less likely to be a member of when compared to males (3.3% vs. 11.9%).
When asked about the primary benefits they gain from membership to their economic association there were diverse
trends across the GLR countries. In Rwanda and Uganda, community members most commonly identify financial
support as a key benefit of their membership to an economic association (38.9% and 69.2% respectively). However,
for community members in DRC and RoC, social networking (30.2% in DRC and 23.9% in RoC) and economic
networking (39.7% in DRC and 46.9% in RoC), and moral support (27% in DRC and 19.5% in RoC ) were the
key benefits to membership in an economic association. Though not the most common reply, social and economic
networking were also perceived as benefits to economic associations in Rwanda (14.2% and 20.4%) but not in as
much so in Uganda (3.1% and 4.6%).
Age appears to play a role in the value of economic associations in at least two ways. First, as age increases, commu-
nity members are less likely to see financial support as the main benefit of being in an economic association (52.3%
of those 18-30, 46.9% of those 31-40, and 37.5% of those over 40) – most relevant in Rwanda and Uganda. Second,
as age increases, community members are more likely to see economic networking as the chief benefit (14% of those
18-30, 19.1% of those 31-40, and 20% of those over 40) – especially relevant in DRC and RoC.227
Across the GLR countries when community members were asked about the membership of their economic as-
sociations there was considerable variation across countries. The variation within each GLR country for commu-
nity members’ perception of the membership of their economic association is presented in Table 46. Community
members in DRC and Rwanda, and to a lesser extent RoC, were most heavily involved in economic associations
without ex-combatant members, while community members in Uganda were more commonly members of
economic association that also had ex-combatant members. It unclear this is a reflection of programmatic design or
the result of social forces such as stigma.




226   Questions regarding the type of economic associations to which community members belonged were only asked in Rwanda and Uganda. In
Rwanda these local savings and credit cooperatives commonly existed under the name VSLA – Village Savings and Loan Association.
227   However, this age related trend in DRC and RoC may be a product of the sampling biases in these countries towards community members over the
age of 40.

15.6 Summary
Community members across the GLR countries show a relatively stable trajectory of economic status over time –
the average unemployment rate varying as little as 2%. The majority of community members are self-employed in
small-scale agriculture. Indeed, through time this remains the most important economic activity for community
members across the GLR. Though the proportion of community members self-employed in small-scale agriculture
peaks at the end of conflict and then drops some at the time of sampling, these drops, along with a continuous drop
in the number of community members studying, are absorbed most notably into employment in public and private
sector as well as self-employment in non-agricultural service and retail – indicative of the initial onset of improved
stability and security in the wake of peace. Though, in DRC these is a nearly static state of employment among com-
munity members through time – likely a result of the continuing state of conflict in Eastern DRC.
Like ex-combatants, community members see their primary barrier to gaining a stable economic status as the lack of
opportunities available to them but are also more likely to cite economic problems (such as access to credit) and lack
of marketable skills as barriers than ex-combatants. In further contrast to ex-combatants, few community members
were willing to migrate for better economic opportunities, likely an indicator of their stronger social and economic
footing in the community. Non-economically active community members relied heavily on borrowing from family
and friends to get by. However, overall community members had a positive outlook on their economic prospects in
the future.
Community members across the GLR displayed a near even split between household sole breadwinner and non-sole
breadwinner status. While on average non-sole breadwinners contributed less than half of their total monthly house-
hold income this was supplemented against the support of the rest of their household members’ income contribu-
tions, placing them at a clear advantage to sole breadwinners. Over half of sole breadwinners had to borrow money
from family or friends to meet their household expenses on a monthly basis. Sole breadwinners between the ages
of 31 and 40 were the most likely to meet their monthly expenses without borrowing, and when they did borrow
they were much more likely to do so from friends instead of family. Further, those non-sole breadwinners aged 31-40
also contributed the most to their total household income on average. These elements combined suggest that com-
munity members aged 31-40 are at their economic prime and among the most capable at meeting their household
economic responsibilities.
The number of community members who have access to micro-credit is low across the GLR countries, and few were
members of economic associations – though some community members came into economic associations with ex-
combatants as a part of reintegration programming in some countries (e.g. DRC and RoC). The primary value that
community members identified to economic associations (most commonly local credit and savings), was largely
reflective of programmatic dimensions in each country – e.g. in DRC and RoC social and economic networking
were the primary value of economic associations that community members identified.
15.6.1 Vulnerable Subgroups
As consistent with the analysis presented throughout this survey of community dynamics in the Great Lakes Region,
female community members exhibit a distinct range of characteristics that collectively paint a picture of a weaker
platform of economic stability. Female community members are more likely than males to be unemployed through
time, and vastly more likely to work taking care of the household – to an extent this can be expected as a result of
traditional gender roles in the GLR countries. Female community members are less likely to cite lack of opportunity
as the primary barrier to gaining productive economic status, though still the primary, and more likely to cite lack of
education or skills than male community members.
Across the GLR, household sole breadwinner status was generally an indicator of economic instability. In this sense
females are at an advantage to males, being less likely to be a sole breadwinner. However, those female community




                                                         123
members who were non-sole breadwinners contributed less to the household on average than males. Further, those
female community members who were sole breadwinners were less likely to meet their expenses and more likely to
borrow from family or friends to meet household expenses on a monthly basis than male community members –
their income shortages were larger and their surpluses were smaller. So while female community members are less
likely to be exposed to the economic vulnerability of sole breadwinner status, when they are, this vulnerability is
more accentuated than for male community members. These findings flag female headed households as particularly
vulnerable.
At first glace young community members (18-30) also appear to have some disadvantages to other age demographic
groups. Young community members are the most likely to be unemployed at any time point, are less likely to meet
monthly expenses, and have larger income shortages than their older peers. However, young community members
are also the least likely age group to identify themselves as a household head and receive the support of their familial/
household unit – in a sense insulating them from the weight of their employment and income disadvantages. It may
be that the disadvantages that young community members face are simply an indication of their life stage in estab-
lishing an income source and building economic networks.
15.6.2 Unique Country Trends
In the analysis of economic issues presented in this section of the study, community members in DRC stand out
subtly. First, across the GLR countries, self-employment in agriculture is the dominant economic status at all time
points. While this is still the case in DRC, the overall proportion of community members self-employed in agricul-
ture at all time points (before conflict, at start of demobilization programming, at the time of sampling) is consider-
ably lower than the cross-country average. The difference is explained in part by the community members in DRC’s
higher levels of unemployment (highest at all time points across the GLR), employment in the public sector, and
self-employment in services or retail. Overall this could suggest that community members in DRC have a harder
time gaining employment, specifically self-employment in agriculture, than in other GLR countries and as a result
participate more deeply in a range of alternative income activities.
In addition, community members in DRC are the most likely across the GLR to be sole breadwinners – and thus
subject to greater household economic instability. Indeed, while sole breadwinners in DRC are the most likely across
the GLR countries to meet their monthly expenses, less than half do so – instead relying on borrowing from friends
and family on a regular basis. Though sole breadwinners in DRC have smaller monthly income shortages than those
in other GLR countries, they also have smaller surpluses. Essentially, while sole breadwinner community members
in DRC are slightly better off than those in other GLR countries, community members in DRC are also more likely
to be a sole breadwinner – still an indicator of greater exposure to economic instability.
Collectively these two points, community members in DRC as the most likely to be unemployed and the most likely
to be a sole breadwinner, cement the economic conditions for community members in DRC as the weakest in the
GLR countries.

                                                16. Social Capital

T        he following section provides a discussion and analysis of the many facets of social capital in the commu-
         nity member sample. The concept of social capital essentially revolves around the idea that social networks
         have value, both tangible and intangible, for individuals and communities and are a key indicator of the
overall social health of communities – in turn, their ability to leverage this social capital towards social and economic
outcomes. As such the analysis of social capital for community members across the Great Lakes Region presented
here is comprised of five core components: (i) an examination of the size of community members’ social networks
and their levels of sociability; (ii) an examination of individual community members’ levels of trust and solidarity
with others in their community; (iii) an examination of community members levels of social cohesion and inclusion
in the community; (iv) in turn, an examination of how these factors come together in community members’ overall
sense of empowerment; and (v) their perception of social change over time. Beyond serving as a key backdrop for
understanding ex-combatants’ position relative to community members, the analysis here represents a look into the
core social dynamics present in communities across the GLR countries.

16.1 Networks and Sociability
Across the GLR countries, community members are unlikely to be in many social groups – though they are still
in more social groups than ex-combatants on average. Community members across the GLR countries are in an
average of 0.63 social groups. This average is reflected across the GLR countries with the exception of Uganda,
where community members had more (0.93) social groups on average. Female community members had slightly
fewer social groups than male community members on average (0.56 vs. 0.67).
In terms of change in number of social groups, 40.7% of community members across the GLR countries reported
that the number of social groups that they belonged to at the time of sampling was more than that of one year prior,
45.8% the same number as one year prior, and 13.5% reported their current number of social groups was less than
one year prior.228 However, there is a sharp division between DRC and RoC on the one hand and Uganda on the
other. In DRC and RoC, 77.9% of community members had seen an improvement in their number of social groups.
Uganda stood in contrast from DRC and RoC as only 9.8% of community members were currently in more social
groups than one year ago, 73.6% were in the same number, and 16.6% were in fewer groups. So while in Uganda
community members had more social groups than in DRC and Roc in absolute terms, those community members
in DRC and RoC had seen considerably more improvement.229
Across the GLR countries, female community members were more likely to be in more social groups than one year
ago compared to male community members (46.4% vs. 36.9%). In addition age displayed a positive relationship to
the likelihood of being in more social groups than one year ago (31.3% of those 18-30, 45.5% of those 31-40, and
46.1% of those over 40).
Only 39.6% of community members across the GLR countries were on a management or organizational committee


228   Rwanda is absent from findings on change in number of social groups due to lack of directly comparable data.
229   It is possible that this gap between DRC/RoC and Uganda could be an indicator of the health of the overall social fabric in these countries,
however it is also possible that it could be a product of periodization issues – e.g. a longer amount of time passed between the start of DDR programing and
the time of sampling in Uganda than DRC in which time the overall security situation has improved considerably.

for a local group or organization – another indicator of social interaction and overall engagement in the communi-
ty.230 Female community members were less likely to be on a committee than male community members (30.4% vs.
45.7%). Those between the ages of 31-40 were the age segment that most commonly was on a committee (45.7%),
compared to those 18-30 (33.1%), and those over 40 (41.5%).
The majority of community members (73%) across the GLR countries have contact with their immediate family.231
However this cross-country figure masks some nuance in the trends within each GLR country. For example in RoC
the proportion of community members who had contact with their families was absolute (100%) and in Uganda
nearly so (97.3%). However, in DRC only 31% of community members had contact with their immediate family
– likely a product of the extreme difficulty of travel and overall dynamics of displacement in eastern DRC. Female
community members across the GLR were slightly less likely than male community members to have contact with
their immediate family (68.2% vs. 76.2%).
Of those community members across the GLR countries who did have contact with their immediate family, they
most frequently had daily contact (63.9%), though in Uganda this proportion was much larger (93.2%). A cross-
country summary of community members’ frequency of familial contact is displayed in Table 47. Age showed a
negative relationship to the frequency which community members reported having daily contact with their immedi-
ate family (53.1% of those 18-30, 40.1% of those 31-40, and 25.9% of those over 40).
When community members across the GLR countries who did have contact with immediate family were asked
whether the current level of their contact was the maximum they would desire, 49.3% responded yes – the remain-
ing 50.7% responding no. Again, there is some nuance to be added here. In Uganda where daily contact was much
higher, 87% responded that their current level of familial contact was the maximum they would desire. In contrast,
in DRC, where the number of those who had contact with their family at all was much lower, only 11.9% felt they
currently had the maximum level of contact with their families that they would desire – these trends are displayed
in Table 48.

friends they had the majority reported that they
have lots of friends (48.5%), followed by a few
good friends (30.9%), and not many friends (20.6%). Uganda stands out from this trend with 74.3% of community
members reporting having lots of friends. Female community members across the GLR countries were less likely to
describe having lots of friends and more likely to describe having not many friends compared to male community
members (39% vs. 54.3% and 17.8% vs. 16.1%, respectively).
Across the GLR countries, when community members were asked to think about the age, gender, and educational
background of their friends,233 the majority of community members reported that their friends mostly shared the
same age (57.7%) and gender (62.1%), while few (25.7%) shared the same educational background. These trends
are durable across the GLR countries and are displayed in Table 49. In terms of demographic groups it is worth
noting that female community members were slightly less likely than male community members to have most of
their friends of the same age (54.4% vs. 60.1%) or educational background (24.9% vs. 26.3%), but slightly more
likely to have them of the same gender (64.5% vs. 60.4%). Across age demographics, those over 40 were consistently
the least likely to have most of their friends in the same age, gender, or education background group (only marginally
less than those 31-40, see Table 49) – an indicator of older community members slightly more diverse social groups
and overall stronger social footing.
When community members across the GLR countries were asked to whom they would turn to for help if they were
to encounter an economic problem the most common responses were (i) family (39.9%) and (ii) friends (33.4%)
– the remaining 26.7% said they would turn to no one (10.3%), to formal institutions such as local saving and credit
associations (7.5%) or a range of other sources including the church (8.9%). Female community members were
less likely to turn to friends and more likely to turn to family compared to male community members (27.2% vs.
37.2% and 44.9 vs. 36.8%, respectively). Age showed a negative relationship to the frequency at which community
members reported that they would turn to family for economic support (50.4% of those 18-30, 35.8% of those
31-40, and 31.8% of those over 40). In addition, age showed a positive relationship to the frequency which commu-
nity members reported turning to no one (6.3% of those 18-30, 9.2% of those 31-40, and 15.4% of those over 40).




232   Questions regarding the reasons for less familial contact than desired were only asked in DRC and RoC.
233   Rwanda is absent from findings of the demographic background of community members’ friends due to lack of directly comparable data.

Generally speaking, across the GLR countries community members did not socialize often in public – meeting
with people in a public place either to talk or have food or drinks. On average community members across the GLR
countries met in public to socialize 1.33 times a week – though females met less often than males (0.95 vs. 1.57
times a week). An interesting note is that in DRC and RoC when community members were asked how often they
met to discuss community issues with others over food or drinks, as opposed to just for socialization, the response
rates were notably higher (mean = 2.12 times a week). With this, the majority of community members (57.4%) in
DRC and RoC think that community issues have created the space by which they can more generally meet people
and socialize.

Community members across the GLR countries indicate that their level of public socialization is most commonly
the same as two years ago (50.4%), followed by more often (28.1%), and less often (21.5%). Female community
members were notably less likely to see improvements in their level of public socialization in the two years prior to
sampling than male community members (23.3% vs. 31.5%).

16.2 Trust and Solidarity
Drawing from Rwanda and Uganda, we can observe that trust among community members towards others in their
community is generally high.234 The majority of community members (63.3%) believe that people in their com-
munity can be trusted to a great extent, followed by to neither a great nor small extent (22.8%), and lastly to a
small extent (13.9%). Female community members on average were less trusting of others in the community than
their male counterparts – 58% of female community members had high trust compared to 65.7% of male com-
munity members and 18.8% of female community members had low trust compared to 11.7% of male community
members.
As a further indication of this general level of trust, across the GLR countries 18.8% of community members felt
that if they were to disagree with something that everyone else in their community agreed on they would not at all
feel free to speak out, 63.5% reported they would definitely feel free to speak out, and 17.7% that they would feel
free to speak out but only on certain matters.235 Female community members were slightly more likely to feel they
could not speak out at all and less likely to feel they could definitely speak out when compared to male community
members (22.8% vs. 15.9% and 57.6% vs. 67.8%, respectively). It is possible that local gender based social norms
play a role in these findings.

234   This specific question about general trust levels in the community was only asked in Uganda and Rwanda.
235       Rwanda is absent from findings on comfort of speaking out in disagreement with their community due to lack of directly comparable data.
236   In Uganda and Rwanda this question was asked with reference to the last year, where as in DRC and RoC it was asked in reference to the last two
years. This creates some issues with periodization and comparability. These figures should be treated with caution. Interestingly, though the question refers to
a longer period of time in DRC and RoC, this does not appear to translate to greater perceptions of improved trust among community members. In the case
of DRC this may be the product of continuing insecurity.

trend along gender demographic lines does, however, exist. Across and within the GLR countries, female commu-
nity members are consistently less likely than male community members to see trust as improved (39.4% vs. 45.9%
at a cross-country level) and more likely to see it as the same (51.7% vs. 45.5% at a cross-country level).
When those community members across the GLR countries who thought that trust had improved in the last two
years were asked to explain further, the majority (42.2%) cited improved safety and security as the main reason
for improved trust – this answer was particularly prevalent among female community members (56.6% vs. 34.7%
of male community members). A notable portion of community members (44.5%) also expressed a range of ex-
planations that related to improved collaboration, cooperation and understanding due to communal living – a key
component of the confrontational process of social reintegration.
Looking the other direction, when those community members across the GLR countries who thought that trust had
deteriorated in the last two years were asked to explain further, responses were diverse – however, the most common
were as follows: (I) dishonesty in general (23.4%), (ii) dishonest authorities (19.6%), and (iii) insecurity (11.9%)

16.3 Social Cohesion and Inclusion
When reflecting on the level of diversity among the people they live around, 36.7% of community members de-
scribed their community as diverse (characterized by lots of differences between people), 25.9% as neither particu-
larly diverse or homogenous (neither a great nor small extent of differences between people), and the remaining
37.4% described their community as fairly homogenous (characterized by few differences between people). This
relatively even distribution across the GLR countries can be nuanced with a closer look within each of the countries
– for example, in Uganda and DRC, community homogeneity (low diversity) was perceived as considerably higher
(57.5% and 56.7%, respectively) while in Rwanda, community members’ perceived high levels of diversity (62.1%).
These specific within-country trends are displayed in Table 51.
At a cross-country level, age showed a distinct relationship to the perception of community diversity among com-
munity members. As age increased the likelihood of perceiving high diversity decreased (42.4% of those 18-30,
36.9% of those 31-40, and 30.7% of those over 40) and accordingly the likelihood of perceiving low diversity in-
creased (33.5% of those 18-30, 34.5% of those 31-40, and 42.9% of those over 40).

as a source of problems (43.9% of those 18-30, 29.5% of those 31-40, and 24.3% of those over 40) and more likely to
not see them as a source of problems (56.1% of those 18-30, 70.5% of those 31-40, and 75.7% of those over 40). To
recap, older community members are both less likely to see differences between people, and less likely to see these
differences as a source of problems. Though female community members identified levels of diversity in their com-
munities on a level similar to male community members, they were less likely to think that diversity was a source of
problems (28.7% vs. 33.5%).
Looking specifically at DRC and RoC, community members were asked to further explain the nature of the kinds
of problems they encounter. Community members most commonly described the problems as revolving around
(i) envy, slander or taunts (29.8%); (ii) misunderstanding (20.5%); or (iii) unspecified accusations made towards
ex-combatants (12.7%).
Despite varying levels of perceived diversity and their association with problems in the community, across the GLR
countries the majority of community members (75.3%) report that they feel a high level of togetherness and close-
ness with their community (19.6% feel neither distant nor close and 5.1% feel distant). Across demographic lines,
this level is very even as well. However, DRC stands out from the trend as the country with the lowest proportion of
community members who feel a high level of closeness and togetherness (61.4%). In addition, while in other GLR
countries there is little variation along demographic lines, in DRC female community members are less likely to feel
close to their community (57.4% vs. 65.1%) and more likely to feel neither distant nor close (32.2% vs. 27.5%) or
distant (10.4% vs. 7.5%) compared to male community members.
In alignment with overall feelings of togetherness with the community, across the GLR countries 69.5% of com-
munity members had in the last year worked with others in the area they live to do something for the benefit of their
community (the remaining 30.5% not having done so). Despite this cross-country figure there is a clear polarization
between DRC and RoC, on the one hand, where the rate of participation was lower (53.2% and 54.9%, respectively)
and Rwanda and Uganda, on the other, where participation was higher (92.9% and 76.9%, respectively).
There is a dispersed range of information regarding the perceived importance of community participation from
community members. For example, in Uganda 25.3% of community members cite lack of participation in commu-
nity activities as the cause of marginalization in the area that they live. In DRC and RoC an average of 53.3% of com-
munity members reported that there were penalties, both formal (such as a ticket or fee) or informal (such as social
resentment or exclusion), for those who didn’t participate in community activities – though within each country the
figures were almost perfectly inverse (In DRC, 39.7% said that there were penalties and 60.3% said there were not,
while in RoC the distributions were 57.6% and 42.4%, respectively).

16.4 Empowerment
Empowerment is an important indicator of overall levels of social capital and is understood as a result of individuals’
levels of social connection and their ability to leverage the benefits of these connections and the community and
the larger context of society. Collectively, the extent of these benefits and in turn the functions that they fulfill for
individuals play a role in the psychosocial concept of empowerment – the individual or collective ability to affect
change in one’s life.
When asked to reflect on their general level of happiness, 71.8% described themselves as happy, 17.4% described
themselves as neither happy nor unhappy, and 10.8% reported that they were unhappy. Community members in
DRC were the least likely to report being happy (65.2%), while community members in Uganda were the most
likely to report so (80.8%). Across the GLR countries, female community members were slightly less likely to be
happy and more likely to be unhappy than male community members (67% vs. 70.6% and 15% vs. 11.4%, respec-
tively).

lives, community members across the GLR countries most commonly reported that they felt that they had such
power to a large extent (51.3%), followed with decreasing frequency by to a medium extent (33.3%) and to a small
extent (15.4%).237 These overall perceptions of power were remarkably durable within each of the GLR countries
– however there are distinct demographic trends in regard to gender. Female community members across the GLR
countries were nearly half as likely as their male counterparts to report having a large extent of power to make deci-
sions in their lives (35.6% vs. 62.3%) while more likely to perceive power to a medium extent (41.8% vs. 27.3%) and
more than twice as likely to have it to a small extent (22.6% vs. 10.4%).
Interestingly, when community members were asked a very similar question as to what extent they felt they had
the ability (as opposed to power) to make important decisions that affect the course of their lives, perceptions of
empowerment were considerably higher – 78.8% reporting that they were able to make changes, 14.9% that they
neither were able or unable to make changes, and 6.7% that they were unable to make changes in their life.238 Very


237   Rwanda is absent from findings on sense of empowerment in terms of power to make important decisions and ability to make important decisions
due to lack of directly comparable data.
238   The analytical distinction between senses of empowerment in terms of power versus ability is not clear. Interpreting any meaning to the disparity
in levels of power and ability is therefore problematic and these data should be treated as a broad indicator of a positive sense of empowerment rather than as
exact measures of different components of empowerment.

members questioned across the
GLR, 64.4% perceive that they control most decisions that affect their everyday lives, 25.6% perceive that they
control some decisions, and 10.1% few decisions. A very similar gender-based demographic trend was exhibited
here as well – as is visible in Table 52.
When community members across the GLR countries were asked about whether or not they had a positive impact
on the community they live in, there was a clear polarization between DRC and RoC on the one hand, and Rwanda
and Uganda on the other. As is visible in Table 53 in DRC and RoC there were relatively even distributions of
community members’ responses to having a positive impact, neither a positive nor negative impact, and a negative
impact. In Rwanda and Uganda, by contrast, the frequency of community members having the perception of having
a positive impact on their community was high – in the case of Rwanda, almost absolute.
In regards to gender, in DRC and RoC female community members much less frequently than male community
members reported having a positive impact on their community (27.9% vs. 46.1%), while in Rwanda the extent
of the gap between female and male community members is approximately half of that in DRC and RoC (87.9%
vs. 96.3%). In Uganda, female community members even have a slightly higher likelihood of perceiving a positive
impact than males (82.5% vs. 80.8%).
Turning to age demographics, in DRC and RoC age showed a positive relationship to the likelihood of the percep-
tion of having a positive impact on the community (26.3% of those 18-30, 39.1% of those 31-40, and 43.6% of
those over 40). While there was no linear trend in regards to age visible in Rwanda; in Uganda, age showed a slight
negative relationship to the likelihood of the perception of having a positive impact on the community (85.7% of
those 18-30, 82.5% of those 31-40, and 73.2% of those over 40).
Certain parts of this trend of polarity between DRC/RoC and Uganda/Rwanda continue when community members
are asked to what extent they feel valued by others in the area they live. On average across the GLR countries, 70.3%
of community members felt valued by others in their community. However DRC showed smaller proportions of

teristic of DRC, RoC and Uganda. However, in Rwanda the frequency of gathering was most commonly many times
(62.4%) – as is displayed in Table 54.240
Female community members were more likely to have never participated in voicing community issues when
compared to male community members (60.7% vs. 34.6%) and less likely than males to have participated once
(8.7% vs. 13.4%), a few times (16.3% vs. 24.1%), or many times (14.3% vs. 27.9%). Age shows a slight negative re-

25.9% of those 31-40, and 17% of those over 40).241
When questioned further as to the extent that they thought that local government and leaders take into account
those concerns voiced by the community when they make important decisions that affect the community, 17.4% of
community members across the GLR countries felt that leaders took their concerns into account a lot, 41.7% a little,
and 40.9% not at all.242 Female community members were less likely than male community members to feel that
leaders took their concerns into account either a lot or a little (15.8% and 37.5% vs. 17.6% and 44.7%, respectively)
and more likely to feel that leaders did not take their concerns into account at all (46.7% vs. 36.8%).

240   This high rate of public gathering to express concerns in Rwanda is likely another effect of Umuganda. While the main purpose of Umuganda
is community work it also serves as a platform for leaders to communicate important news on a national and local level as well as for individuals and
communities to express concerns and plan for future Umuganda.
241   This age related trend in the likelihood of public gathering may in part be related to the heavy sampling bias in RoC, the country where community
public gathering was lowest, towards community members over 40.
242   Rwanda is absent from findings on the extent to which community members feel leaders take their concerns into account due to lack of directly
comparable data.

that it would improve in a few years and those that thought that their situation would deteriorate in the future.
Overall, only 1.5% of community members thought that their situation would improve in a few weeks, 4.9% thought
it would improve in the coming months, 50% that it would improve in a few years, 6.4% that it would remain the
same, and 37.3% reporting that they foresee their overall situation deteriorating in the future.243 As in the ex-combat-
ant sample, only Uganda stood apart from this trend – 79.3% of community members reporting that they thought
their overall situation would improve in a few years. These findings may suggest that while in general communi-



243   Rwanda is absent from findings on community members’ overall outlook on their situation for the future and their overall level of satisfaction with
their life up until sampling due to lack of directly comparable data.

ty members have a polarized outlook for their future, those who do have a positive outlook understand the time
horizons of social change – occurring in the scale of years rather than days, weeks, or even months.
Female community members across the GLR were less likely to report that their situation would improve in the
next few years compared to male community member (43% vs. 54.9%) and more likely to think that their overall
situation would deteriorate in the future (44.7% vs. 32%). Age as well held a clear relationship to polarized response
between these two outcomes. As age increased community members were less likely to see their overall situation
improving in a few years (61.4% of those 18-30, 54.4% of those 31-40, and 40.3% of those over 40) and more likely
to see it deteriorating (24.8% of those 18-30, 37% of those 31-40, and 46.9% of those over 40).
When questioned whether they are satisfied with the way that their life has been to date, across the GLR countries
32.5% of community members reported that they were satisfied, 8.2% that they were neither satisfied nor dissat-
isfied, and the remaining 59.3% that they were dissatisfied. However, this cross-country figure fails to depict the
nuance between GLR countries as there was a clear split between Uganda on the one hand, and DRC / RoC on the
other. In Uganda 43.3% of community members being satisfied, 24.4% neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 32.2%
being dissatisfied. In contrast, in DRC and RoC 73% of community members were dissatisfied with their life to date
and only 27.1% were satisfied.244 Female community members were slightly more likely to be dissatisfied with their
life to date than male community members (62.9% vs. 55.9%).
Community members were questioned about their perceptions of their own position in society across a range of
fields at the time of sampling and a year prior using a nine-step ladder response prompt.245 Their responses are
tabulated below in Table 55 by mean score. The lower the mean score is the closer the community member is to
the bottom rung of the ladder – where the poorest people tend to be. Generally speaking, across and within the
GLR countries community members, as with ex-combatants, consistently identify themselves in the poorest half
of society – between steps two and four. However community members rank themselves slightly better than ex-
combatants on average across all categories.
Looking at the GLR countries as a whole there is a slight increase in the mean scores for community members across
all categories. This trend is reflected within each country with the exception of DRC – where on average, scores were
higher across all categories, but had declined across all categories from a year prior (with the exception of leisure).
A closer look at DRC reveals that the only demographic group that saw average improvements across any catego-
ries was those aged 18-30 (who improved across all categories with the exceptions of finance and school fees). At
a cross-country level, all gender and age demographic categories see improvements across all categories (with the
exception of the health category for those over 40 which stays the same over time). Interestingly, despite the range
of economic and social disadvantages that females hold, they perceive themselves as slightly better off than males
across all categories except for clothing and leisure at the time of sampling and one year prior.

16.6 Summary
Overall, community members across the GLR countries show positive levels of social capital and a general trajec-
tory of improvement. Community members have a growing number of social groups and high levels of contact with
their families, forming a broad social platform that can serve as a fallback position in times of hardship or a spring-
board in moments of opportunity. While community members have diverse friend groups who they can often turn
to for support, the family unit is still the core of their social support network.


244   It should be noted that in DRC and RoC, community members were not given the option of replying that they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied
with their life up to the time of sampling – this scaling issue may have inadvertently inflated the number of community members who expressed being
dissatisfied with their life.
245   Rwanda is absent from these social change findings due to lack of directly comparable data, however this is the only section in the community
dynamics annex of this study where Burundi is included.




                                                                          136
With these generally strong social networks, community members in turn display a high level of trust in the com-
munity and show a continued positive trajectory in this field – also aided by increased stability and security in the
end of conflict. These factors have set the context in which community members feel a strong sense of togetherness
and meet to work together for the betterment of their communities. Further, community members report being
generally happy and describe a broadly positive sense of empowerment in their lives (though they are simultane-
ously dissatisfied with their lives to date in general). While community members rank themselves consistently in
the poorest half of society across a range of categories, they also display a shallow trajectory of improvement over
time. Indeed, while community members are polarized in their general outlooks for the future, those with a positive
outlook express that they understand that social change does not occur over night, but rather in the scale of years.
Very generally speaking, it appears that the social dynamics of communities across the GLR countries (with the
exception of DRC) and provide a context for which ex-combatants can return to communities and strive towards
reintegration into an already stable community setting in terms of social capital. However, this general ability of the
communities in the GLR absorb ex-combatants and serve as a setting which they can reintegrate into should not
mask the realities of the post-conflict social landscape. Families, communities and broader networks in the GLR
countries have been affected severe violence and displacement - to the great detriment of trust, solidarity, and social
cohesion across the broader social fabric of society. In this sense to long-term project of rebuilding society is one that
ex-combatants and community members face together.

16.6.1 Vulnerable Subgroups
As consistent with the analysis presented throughout this report, female community members fare worse off than
male community members in terms of most indicators of social capital and are thus further solidified as a vulnerable
group. Female community members have weaker social networks and less family contact that subtracts overall from
their ability to leverage the value of these social connections – leaving female community members in a position of
relative social isolation.
Though there is some variation from country to country, female community members feel less trust with the com-
munity, less togetherness with the community, are less happy personally, are less likely to feel they have a positive
impact on the community, and feel less empowered to affect change in their lives. However, despite this broad range
of disadvantages in terms of social capital female community members consistently perceive themselves as slightly
better off relative to the rest of society than male community members across a broad range of categories including
food, housing, finances, and health.
Many of the social disadvantages that female community members display may be the result of traditional gender
structures and their resulting gender-based inequalities. Understanding these disadvantages is important in the
examination of community dynamics themselves, but also carries weight for the return of female ex-combatants.
What this means for female ex-combatants is that social reintegration (in terms of reaching parity with commu-
nity members) may inadvertently mean reintegrating back into basic gender inequalities – possibly with the added
dimension of stigma as an amplifying force to these disadvantages. With this in mind it is important to recognize
the importance of reintegration programming that not only addresses the specific disadvantages that female ex-
combatants face, but to fit in as part of and effort towards affecting a larger collective shift towards gender equality in
post-conflict and development settings.

16.6.2 Unique Country Trends
Overall, community members in DRC rank lower than community members in the rest of the GLR countries across
a broad range of social capital indicators. Collectively, the core weaknesses of community members in DRC in terms
of social capital can be characterized along three dimensions: (i) weak family connections; (ii) weak community
connections; and (iii) weak personal self-worth and empowerment.




                                                           137
Access to family networks is an important inroad for building further social and economic networks and in turn
leveraging the tangible and intangible value of these networks. In terms of family, community members in DRC
have the lowest levels of contact with their families, those who do have contact with their families have it the least
frequently, and in line with this community members in DRC are the least likely to be satisfied with their level of
familial contact. The weak state of familial networks that are characteristic of community members in the DRC
are likely a product of the social geography of eastern DRC. Many community members have been displaced or
migrated and continuing instability coupled with the mountainous landscape, near non-existent road infrastructure,
and heavy seasonal rains keep family networks effectively fractured – isolated by social and physical barriers.
The weakness in family connections in DRC corresponds to a distinct weakness in community connections among
community members as well. Community members in DRC have a low number of social groups on average,
reported weakest levels of improvement in trust in the community, the lowest sense of togetherness, and were the
least likely to work with others for the betterment of their community compared to community members in other
GLR countries. These indicators of weak social capital for community members in terms of family connections and
community networks correspond to the overall weaker economic situation of community members highlighted in
section 15.6.2 of this annex.
Further, these broad weaknesses in community members in DRC’s familial and community networks correspond
to their low senses of self-worth and empowerment. Community members in DRC are the least likely to feel they
have a positive impact on the community, the least likely to feel valued by others in the community, and the most
likely to be dissatisfied with their life compared to community members in other GLR countries. In addition while
community members in DRC perceive themselves as slightly better off compared to the rest of society across a range
of categories than community members in other GLR countries, they are the only group who see a decrease in their
perceived standing over time – possibly a result of continuing instability in the region.
Violent conflict has damaged the social fabric of individuals and communities across the GLR. However, it appears
that the continued insecurity in eastern DRC coupled with the intense geographic landscape in the region has con-
tributed to a fragmented social geography in which familial and communal networks are fractured and cannot be
leveraged for their value by community members – leaving them particularly exposed to social and economic isola-
tion. Future studies on social capital in the region could flag the interaction of social capital and social geography as
a field for further analysis.

                          17. Reintegration Experiences

T        he following is an analysis of community member experiences of the reinsertion and reintegration of ex-
         combatants. Most importantly, the analysis here highlights the changes in community perspectives towards
         ex-combatants since the reintegration process began. For the greatest analytical value this chapter should be
read in conjunction with section 11 on ex-combatants’ DDR experiences. Owing to data constraints, this section of
the study draws exclusively from DRC, RoC, and Uganda.

17.1 Community Sensitization and Preparedness
Across the GLR countries, community members most commonly received information, though not necessarily
official information, about ex-combatants coming to the area they live in to reintegrate through: (i) word of mouth
(41.2%); (ii) radio (27.3%); or (iii) a community meeting (11.1%). In Uganda, though the three most common
mediums by which community members received information about returning ex-combatants were the same, radio
was the most common medium (30.2%), followed by word of mouth (22.5%), and community meetings (14.8%).
Across the GLR countries, female community members were more likely to get information about ex-combatants
from word of mouth than male community members (49% vs. 35.9%) and less likely to get it from radio (23.8% vs.
29.8%). Those aged 18-30 were particularly likely to have received information through radio compared to other age
demographic groups (35.2% of those 18-30, 27.1% of those 31-40, and 22.1% of those over 40).
The vast majority of community members across the GLR countries (70.5%) reported that they were given no help
in understanding how reintegration was going to take place, the remainder reporting receiving some help (20%)
or reporting receiving lots of help (9.5%).246 Uganda stands out from the cross-country trend with a less unipolar
distribution (47.2% no help, 34.8% some help, 18% lots of help). In regards to gender, female community members
were more likely to report receiving no help compared to male community members (77.3% vs. 65.8%). While this
gendered trend continued in Uganda there was an additional dimension – female community members were also
more likely to have received lots of help on understanding how reintegration would take place compared to male
community members (23.2% vs. 15.6%).
When asked further whether they thought they should have been informed or given more help before ex-combat-
ants were reintegrated into their community, there was a near even split across the GLR countries in community
members responses – 52.1% reporting that yes they should have been given info and help and 47.9% replying no. A
closer look at each of the individual countries shows that in RoC and Uganda there was an approximate 60/40 split
between those who responded yes and no. Interestingly, in DRC this split in responses was reversed 40/60. This is
interesting because DRC was the country where community members most frequently (87.6%) reported receiving
no help on understanding how reintegration would take place.
When asked by what medium they would have liked to have received information about the reintegration process
the three most common replies are the same as the three most common mediums by which community members
actually did receive information – though with distinctly different distributions between these responses – 44.1% of
community members wanted to receive information about reintegration in community meetings, 29.3% preferred



246   At least in eastern DRC, the geographic challenges of face-to-face sensitization can play a role in these figures.

members were less likely to respond that they had lots of direct contact than male community members (7.8% vs.

direct contact than male community members (73.7% vs. 59.2%) and less likely to respond that they had no contact
(8.8% vs. 15.2%).249 Across the GLR countries, age showed a negative relationship to the likelihood of reporting
having lots of contact with returning ex-combatants (44.2% of those 18-30, 31.9% of those 31-40, and 287% of those
over 40) and, inversely, a positive relationship to the likelihood of having a little contact (13.7% of those 18-30,



247   Unfortunately there is no data available regarding community members’ perspectives on the content of the information and sensitization they did
receive.
248   In DRC, especially eastern DRC, these lower levels of community member contact with returning ex-combatants may be a product of the difficulty
of travel and continued insecurity as a part of the dynamics of return.
249   This gendered trend is likely a product of the fact that female community members who had a spouse were more than twice as likely as male
community members to have a spouse who was an ex-combatant.

it as neither positive nor negative
(26.7% vs. 23.9%) or just negative (12.9% vs. 9.4%). Community members over the age of 40 were the least likely
demographic subgroup to describe their interactions as positive (60.1%) and the most likely to see interactions as
neither negative nor positive (27.1). Interestingly, the two demographic subgroups with the highest frequencies of
describing their contact with ex-combatants as either negative or neither positive nor negative, females and those
over 40, were also those that reported the lowest levels of direct contact with ex-combatants as described above.251
When asked to reflect on when ex-combatants first came to live in their community, just over half of community
members (51.5%) reported that they had fears about their presence – the remaining 48.5% reporting that they had
no fears. This near even split is fairly durable across the GLR countries. Female community members are slightly
more likely than male community members to report having fears about ex-combatant presence in the community
(53.5% vs. 50%).
When asked about which specific groups of ex-combatants they feared, community members across the GLR coun-
tries gave a consistent message: community members reported fearing male ex-combatants to a very high level
(91.1%) and female, child and disabled ex-combatants to a considerably lower level (47.4%, 46.8% and 42.2%, re-
spectively). As is visible in Table 57, across all categories Uganda showed lower levels of overall fear – especially
in regards to female, child, and disabled ex-combatants.252 In regards to community member demographic trends,
female community members were slightly more likely to report fearing ex-combatants across all categories and age
showed a positive relationship to the likelihood of fearing ex-combatants across all categories.
In Uganda, community members were asked to outline what kinds of specific fears they held about different kinds
of ex-combatants. As is visible in Table 58, the most common fear that community members held in regards to the



250   Questions regarding the positive or negative nature of contact with returning ex-combatants were only asked in DRC and RoC.
251   It is difficult to decipher the relationship between levels of community member contact with returning ex-combatants and perceptions about the
positive or negative character of those interactions – if there is one at all. One could postulate that lower levels of contact with returning ex-combatants
provides a limited base on which for community members to break down stereotypes and stigma. Or, one could just as well propose that precisely because of
negative experiences with returning ex-combatants community members have minimized contact.
252   One explanation for the lower levels of fear of child ex-combatants in Uganda could be related to the dynamics of mobilization and return.
Abduction is a known recruitment tactic of the LRA in northern Uganda. In terms of dynamics of return this has created a sentiment among community
members in which they view child ex-combatants simultaneously as victims and perpetrators and have displayed accepting attitudes of their return. It is also
possible that the long period of time between informal and formal demobilizations and the overall trickle-in model of demobilization in Uganda may play
some role in the slightly lower overall levels of fear surrounding the return of ex-combatants.

return of all types of ex-combatants was the possibility of ex-combatants being a perpetrator of violent crime such
as murder or rape.
Interestingly when community members are asked about the fears they have about the presence of ex-combatants
in their community today now that ex-combatants have been there for some period of time, 93.1% report that they
have no fears – the remaining 6.9% still holding some fears. This denotes a dramatic improvement in the commu-
nity’s ability to absorb ex-combatants since their initial return and a key hint for understanding the process of social
reintegration in the GLR countries.
Across the GLR countries, 31.3% of community members believe that ex-combatants should have behaved dif-
ferently since coming to the community (the remaining 68.7% responding that ex-combatants should not have
behaved differently), a figure that is very consistent within the individual GLR countries and across demographic
subgroups. Similarly, when community members were asked whether they thought the community should have
behaved differently since the arrival of ex-combatants, 27.5% thought that the community should have behaved dif-
ferently. When asked about whether or not there was any resentment in the community about the support that ex-
combatants received, 27.9% thought that there was resentment, though it is unclear how this resentment is related
to the ways in which community members think returning ex-combatants and community members should have
behaved differently.

17.3 Positive and Negative Perceptions of Ex-Combatants
Across the GLR countries, 29.8% of community members believe that there are negative dimensions to having ex-
combatants in the community – the remaining 70.2% responding that there are no negative dimensions. However
Uganda stood apart from this trend, instead community members less frequently identified ex-combatant presence




                                                                        142
as having negative dimensions (18.1% yes negative factors, 81.9% no negative factors). When asked to outline the
types of negative dimensions related to having ex-combatants in the community the most notable responses were:
(i) that having ex-combatants in the community increased the risk for violent crime (54.4%); (ii) that ex-combat-
ants have generally bad or brutal behavior (18.3%); or (iii) that ex-combatants can bully, intimidate, or threaten
others (10.7%).
When asked whether there were positive aspects to having ex-combatants in the community, across the GLR coun-
tries, 67.7% of community members responded that there are distinct positive dimensions to having ex-combatants
in the community – a higher proportion than identified negative aspects. Again, Uganda stands apart with 95% of
community members identifying that there are distinct positive dimensions to having ex-combatants in the com-
munity. When asked to outline the main positive dimensions to having ex-combatants in the community, notable
responses from community members were: (i) that ex-combatants give sound advice to other people and serve as
good role models (23.9%); (ii) that ex-combatants make positive contributions to the economic fabric of the com-
munity (23.7%); and (iii) that ex-combatants handle all village security issues (7.8%).

17.4 Summary
There are several key findings to take away from this section. In terms of information and sensitization: (i) across the
GLR countries community members most commonly received information and sensitization about the return and
reintegration of ex-combatants through word of mouth; (ii) community members across the GLR countries would
most dominantly have preferred to receive information and sensitization about the return and reintegration of ex-
combatants in a community meeting forum.
Turning to community members’ levels of fear surrounding returning ex-combatants there are also several key
points: (i) community members across the GLR countries had generally high levels of fear, particularly in regards
to violent crime, associated with the return of ex-combatants – especially male ex-combatants before their return;
(ii) after ex-combatants have returned to communities the level of fear that community members hold towards ex-
combatants dropped drastically – though some resentment remained; and (iii) after ex-combatants have returned
to communities, community members more commonly identify a range of positive aspects to having ex-combatants
than negative.
Collectively this narrative of high community member fear, exposure to ex-combatants, followed by low fear with
a mostly positive perception of ex-combatants is a positive indication of communities’ ability to absorb returning
ex-combatants. Further, this narrative gives support to the idea that much of the social dimension of reintegra-
tion is constituted by a process of confrontation and atonement – eroding distrust and stigma. While it appears as
though initial trust barriers may fall quickly the longer road to reaching social and economic parity for ex-combat-
ants remains.

                                      18. Conclusions

C         onflict across the Great Lakes Region has carried enormous weight in affecting the lives of ex-combatants
          and community members alike. Though conflict-affected countries in the GLR are generally characterized
          by severe economic development challenges and a deteriorated social fabric, this study has revealed that in
the wake of peace, communities across the GLR have reached a level of relative social and economic stability. It is
this stability that constitutes communities’ capacity to play a positive role in accepting and absorbing returning ex-
combatants into their social and economic fabric. Indeed, without a relatively stable social and economic base in the
community the idea of the “reintegration” of ex-combatants would lose much meaning – as ex-combatants would
reintegrate into economic instability and social marginalization. Thus, understanding the state of communities and
their social and economic dynamics is an essential backdrop for understanding ex-combatants’ position and trajec-
tory on the path to reintegration – gaining social and economic parity with community members.

18.1 The Community and Economic Reintegration
The analyses of the community member sample presented in this study have shown that community members across
the GLR display a stable economic trajectory over time. The majority of community members are engaged in self-
employment in small-scale agriculture and as such land access for cultivation and grazing is a key issue. In addition,
community members show some diversification into self-employment in service or retail related activities. Overall
community members’ employment statuses are stable over time and unemployment varies little on average.
Like ex-combatants, community members see the primary barrier to improving their economic situation as revolv-
ing around lack of opportunities. Beyond this, community members cite lack of access to capital and credit as among
the additional barriers to leveraging what opportunities do come towards their economic betterment – and indeed
their access to capital and credit in terms of the reception of micro-loans or membership in economic associations
such as local savings and credit organizations is low.
In the context of the severe development challenges that characterize the GLR countries, community members’
core strength lies in their relative economic stability. The vast majority of community members meet their monthly
household expenses alone, or with the help of others in their household. Only a minority is locked into patterns of
borrowing from family and friend networks to meet their basic needs. It is this economic context of relative stability
that provides the context in which ex-combatants can return to communities and strive towards parity in a meaning-
ful sense – the longer term process of upward economic mobility occurring outside the bounds of reintegration.

18.2 The Community and Social Reintegration
The analysis presented in the community member sample presented in this study shows that across the GLR coun-
tries community members have a generally positive level of social capital, and further a positive trajectory over
time – as the social fabric of communities is mended in the wake of improved peace and security. The core of social
capital revolve around social networks, be they familial, communal, interpersonal friendships, or strictly economic.
Networks have value both in the sense that they serve as a platform for social and economic support within commu-
nities, but also can be leveraged to create new social and economic opportunities. Community members across the
GLR countries show that they have connection to those around them in terms of social groups, diverse friends, and
economic networks. In this sense older community members (over 40) have perhaps the highest social capital and a

solid footing in the community – often rank highest on core indicators. However the core of community members’
social capital, and gateway to accessing broader social networks, is their solid grounding in the family unit accessed
through marriage.
Indeed, marriage rates are a powerful indicator of overall community social capital – correlating to larger social and
economic networks on average. As community members marry they expand their social networks and the overlap
of these individual networks grows – in a very literal sense weaving together to constitute the social fabric of com-
munities and societies. Community members’ rates of marriage are entangled with their number of social groups in
general and contribute to their overall engagement in the community in terms of trust, solidarity, social cohesion,
and inclusion – in turn feeding back into network building. It is this dynamic interaction of community members’
networks and their collective benefits that feed back to the individual as well – cementing their personal sense of
empowerment and understanding of their place in society. Understanding the dynamism of social networks, the
family core among them, as fabric connecting individuals into communities is core to understanding the contexts
which ex-combatants approach in the process of social reintegration. Essentially social reintegration means that ex-
combatants must find a way to connect into this social fabric – perhaps most meaningfully through marriage.
The analysis presented in this annex suggests that though issues of stigma and distrust towards returning ex-com-
batants may exist in many contexts across the GLR, these barriers break down fairly quickly. It is the presence of an
underlying social fabric, in terms of individual social capital, that exists throughout communities across the GLR
countries, with the notable exception of DRC – discussed below, that can serve as the necessary condition for ex-
combatants’ embankment on a path towards social reintegration.

18.3 Female Community Member Sub-Group
Throughout the analysis of community dynamics presented in this annex female community members have consis-
tently displayed a range of disadvantages across nearly all core demographic, economic, and social indicators that
collectively paint a narrative of gender inequality across the GLR countries.
Female community members have lower literacy and educational achievement levels than male community members
– this, in part, affects their higher likelihood of unemployment through time. Female community members under-
stand this connection between education and unemployment – being more likely to cite lack of education and skills
as a barrier to gaining a productive economic status. Furthermore, perhaps not surprisingly, female community
members are more likely than males to work in the household fulfilling traditional gender roles. Female community
members are less likely to be a sole household breadwinner, an advantage, though when they are they fare consider-
ably worse off than male community members in terms of meeting monthly expenses.
Beyond their weaker overall economic position, female community members also face considerable disadvantages
in terms of social capital. Female community members have smaller social networks in terms of levels of familial
contact and number of social groups; in turn, they are less integrated into the social fabric of communities – leverag-
ing the value of their networks in terms of support and opportunities. Female community members feel less trust
in the community, less togetherness with the community, feel they have less of a positive impact on the community,
and are less happy and empowered overall.
Collectively the range of disadvantages that female community members face across the GLR countries is likely
a product of traditional gender inequalities. In this sense these disadvantages are both structurally ingrained and
culturally reproduced. Acknowledging the social-structural disadvantages that female community members face
across the GLR countries is not only an important dimension of understanding community dynamics, but also the
prospects that female ex-combatants face as they approach the process of reintegration. If female ex-combatants are
to gain parity with female community members, issues of stigma will no doubt serve as a barrier to entering the com-
munity, but if female ex-combatants are rather to reach parity with male community members, a much deeper set of




                                                         145
social-structural barriers stand in their way – barriers that they and their female community member counterparts
face together. In this sense reintegration programming is poised to serve not only the needs of female ex-combatants,
but also represents an opportunity to encourage a larger community-wide transformation.

18.4 DRC – A Splintered Society
While throughout the analysis of community members presented in this annex each of the GLR countries has varied
considerably in terms of specific contextual trends, only DRC displays a truly divergent narrative of community
dynamics. As outlined in section 16.6.2, community members in DRC stand out from the rest of the GLR countries
with the weakest levels of social capital across a broad range of indicators. When female community members across
the GLR countries display disadvantages, these disadvantages are often exaggerated in DRC. Though the exact
reasons for these trends are unclear, it is likely that this weak social capital at the individual level, and weak social
fabric at the community level, are related to ongoing instability in Eastern DRC coupled with the harsh social geog-
raphy in the region – keeping families, social groups, and networks separated by physical barriers. The analysis pre-
sented paints DRC as a splintered society where community members have weak familial and communal networks
– missing the opportunity to leverage their value.
This narrative has considerable weight for understanding the community dynamics in DRC itself, but is also essential
for understanding the prospects for meaningful ex-combatant reintegration in DRC. If reintegration means reaching
parity with community members then ex-combatants appear to have done well in reentering this splintered society
with weak social fabric – though this is not to suggest that ex-combatants in DRC do not face significant barriers to
reentering communities. However, if social reintegration is understood as going beyond mere parity, to a process
of building social networks and in turn leveraging their value then this is a challenge that community members and
ex-combatants alike will face in DRC. With this in mind, it may be that in the context of DRC, or perhaps settings
of long-lasting or continuing conflict in general, community based approaches to reintegration focused on benefit-
ing the community could prove particularly impactful. However, as always, reintegration programming must be
grounded in the context that is meant to affect. In DRC, or elsewhere, meaningful reintegration programming must
be anchored in complexities of the local context – a challenging endeavor indeed.
