 CASE STUDY
Improving Sustainability of Land Administration through
Decentralized Service Provision: Evidence from Rwanda
DANIEL ALI, KLAUS DEININGER AND MARGUERITE DUPONCHEL

  Summary: Recognizing that the impressive gains
  from comprehensive land tenure regularization
  may be short-lived if subsequent transactions are
  not registered, Rwanda has deployed close to 400
  Sector Land Managers (SLMs) throughout the
  country. Regressions using LAIS data highlight
  that posting of SLMs increased levels of
  registered sales but not inheritance transactions
  and that, for agricultural land, having an SLM
  taken refresher training almost doubled this
  effect. A survey of all SLMs in April 2016 suggests
  that they are fully functional and in close contact
  with DLOs. More training (possibly via new
  channels), access to LAIS, and some office
  equipment (locking cabinets) could enhance
  performance. Time spent by SLMs on land
  administration, levels of transactions handled,
  and reasons for them to reject applications
  provide pointers for improvement.
