 BREAKING BUSINESS AS USUAL
Fostering competitiveness and a dynamic
      Market-based reforms and   the opening up of trade and investment initiated over the past four years have had a
 environment for private sector growth
      positive impact on growth in Myanmar. These have enhanced private sector participation and increased the role of
      exports in the economy. Reforms have included streamlined business entry procedures, reduced export and import
      licensing requirements, and enhanced public-private partnerships and dialogue.

      Promoting private sector competitiveness and inclusion in Myanmar have enormous potential to drive job creation,
      economic diversification, and structural transformation. This would involve improving the investment climate with
      an emphasis on transparency and predictability; reducing trade costs and strengthening connectivity for economic
      integration; enhancing public-private partnerships; and strengthening institutional capacity to drive the reform pro-
      cess. The ongoing peace process calls for careful sequencing of reforms, starting with reducing the costs of doing
      business and engaging in trade; consulting with local communities; and supporting vulnerable groups adversely
      affected by economic changes.




       Context and opportunities for change

      Myanmar has the opportunity to revitalize private
      sector led growth. The latter was hampered by
      decades of economic isolation and state control. The
      provision of key goods and services have been largely
      dominated by a handful of businesses based on con-
      cessions and protection from the state at the expense
      of opportunities for smaller businesses and entrepre-
      neurs. This was compounded by a historically opaque
      and non-transparent regulatory system that promoted
      “crony capitalism” in the form of preferential access to
      factors of production, including in the exploitation of
      non-renewable resources.1

      Multiple bureaucracies, licensing regime, and state-led
      industrialization in trade undermined competitiveness
      and Myanmar’s ability to diversify its productive sectors      This context warrants continued efforts at opening
