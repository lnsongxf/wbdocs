The Economic Internet Toolkit for African Policy Makers was produced for the Africa
Internet Forum under the direction of Robert Schware, Senior Informatics Specialist in
the Telecommunications and Informatics Division of the World Bank. The models, data
and accompanying text were created by Charles Kenny; Anil Srivastava and Anat
Bernstein contributed to the section on examples of Internet use on the continent; and
Shampa Banerjee edited and prepared the document for publication. Our special thanks
and appreciation for major contributions made to the policy and global Internet sections
go to Robert Hawkins. We are very grateful for the help of Lane Smith (USAID), Inta
Brikovskis (NAS), Lee McKnight (MIT), Michael Jensen (UNIDO), Michel Menou
(CABECA), Nancy Hafkin (UNECA), John Mack (U.S. Department of State) and Raymond
Akwule (George Mason University). The project was funded by the World Bank's infoDev
program (ID 950920-10): infoDev is a grant-making program designed to encourage re-
form and investment for. improving access to information technology in
developingcountries.
     The toolkit will be available on infoDev' s website, part of the World Bank website

Liberalization of the telecommunications sector is progressing across Africa. One of the
most important benefits of this trend is that it will make value-added services, particu-
larly Internet access, more affordable and reliable for telecommunications users in the
continent.             '
      The Internet need not be a useful tool only for industrial societies. The poor in
many African countries, struggling to meet basic needs, often remain poor not only- be-
cause they are denied access to physical and human capital, but also because they lack
the information necessary to best convert that capital into wealth. By opening wide the
door to a huge store of global knowledge, the Internet offers untapped possibilities to
address the blight of information poverty. This Toolkit is inspired by the African experi-
ence where access to the World Wide Web is helping doctors to save patients, schools to
educate children, and communities to create businesses that will lift them out of destitu-
tion.
      Today there is growing exposure to the Internet in Africa. Over the last three years,
the number of Internet host sites, excluding the developed market of South Africa, has
risen twenty-fold. However, there are still many hurdles to a comprehensive coverage of
African nations. Issues that require urgent deliberation include pricing structures, mo- ·
nopoly controls and licensing charges. Often these are a result of state policies restricted
by a short-term view of the economy and its future, or by concerns over the immediate
effect of the Internet on telephone company revenues.
      This Toolkit closely examines these issues. It finds that, in the long term, the
Internet cannot be looked upon as a threat to telecommunications companies. It is true
that it is one of a range of technological advances that are forcing changes i:ri. the opera-
tion of telecommunications systems, but it also presents opportunities for new sources
of revenues and new ways to meet the demands of society. The Internet has become a
tool for development, with its ability to facilitate the delivery of social services, disaster
mitigation, and poverty relief. The Toolkit also finds that the move toward liberalization
is likely to have a beneficial effect on Internet roll out, just as it has on basic service pro-
vision.
      The Toolkit is part of a collaborative effort on expanding Internet access in Africa
that began in 1995 with the creation of the Africa Internet Forum (AIF). This is a group
of donors, users and other interested organizations including the UNDP, UNITAR,
USAID, CIDA, NASA, the Carnegie Corporation and the African Networking Initiative
- which itself includes groups such as the IDRC, ITU, ECA and UNESCO. The Toolkit is
intended to be used in policy dialogues and country assessments, broadly to facilitate
the involvement of the private sector in Internet provision, and specifically to help
policy makers shape their attitudes toward this exciting and expanding sector of the
telecommunications business.

                                             Further growth of the Internet in Africa is closely tied to the
                                             quality and availability of telecommunications infrastructure in

1
\   Models presented in this toolkit suggest that expansion of the

I   Internet in Africa cah provide opportunities for significant re-
    duction in the communications cost of a wide range of African
    telecommunications users. These savings would come almost
    exclusively from international calls. There are two reasons for
    this conclusion. First, at the moment, 80 to 90 percent of email
    are sent to and received from outside of the continent. Second,
    international calls from and to the continent attract revenues far
    in excess of the costs of completing the call.
         Ironically, given the pressures on rate rebalancing which
    are unconnected with the Internet, it is likely that emailing will
    become relatively less attractive as a substitute for voice or fax
    as international call costs drop and local call costs increase. At
    the moment, however, Internet access is a profitable investment,
    purely from the point of view of direct savings on
    communications for companies that do a lot of international
    business. Talking to the United Kingdom for about an hour each
    business day over the period of a year would cost a Mozambican
    businessman approximately US$38,250. Faxing that same
    information would cost US$7,650. All of the yearly costs of a
    regional Internet connection - a computer, a modem, and
    Internet access - used for international email alone as a
    substitute for fax traffic, would together amount to US$1,328.
    The yearly savings over fax use would thus be US$6,322.

                                                 few, it is vital that costs of Internet access are reduced.
                                                       As we have indicated earlier, the major costs of Internet

costs) to South African levels. This increase, however, depends
on these sites being accessible to a paying public. While the
private sector will likely compete for users in the urban areas,
there will be an increased role for government to insure access
to those users in rural areas. Unless Internet sites proliferate in
community centers, libraries, schools, and telecenters, access will
be restricted to a small urban elite.
     While financial considerations are clearly central, results
from a survey of Internet usage in Africa point to other impor-
tant factors in spreading the technology to a larger number of
people. First, usage was severely restricted by a lack of knowl-
edge and adequate training. Further, even those with the skill
to access the technology were discouraged by the paucity of rel-
evant content and the unreliability of the network connections.

Policy conclusions

The Internet is likely to continue to revolutionize the means in
which people communicate and access information. Because the
Internet represents such a- powerful new communication tool,
the environment in which it operates must be regulated differ-
ently from traditional information and communication media.
The toolkit stresses three general principles: the importance of
not trying to fit the Internet into existing regulatory structures,
the power of competition on Internet growth, and the necessity
of allowing the Internet to flourish without the burden of un-
necessary regulation.
     The models and data presented in the toolkit suggest a num-
ber of policy conclusions. To expand access and use of the Inter-
net in Africa, it is necessary to provide the following:
         • Low cost and reliable access to international band-
            width.
         • Low cost and reliable local bandwidth connectivity.
         • Countrywide reliable local cost access to ISPs.
         • Low cost access to network equipment.
         • Widespread public access to networked computers.
         • An educated and trained user and provider base .
       . • Support for the development of national and Afri-
            can Internet content.
     The policies that may help to meet these needs are:
         • Liberalization of the telecommunications network.
         • Liberalization of Internet service provision.
         • Lowering of tariffs on computer and telecommuni-
            cations equipment.
         • General tariff rebalancing with possible support for
            local cost ISP access.
         • Support for community access to the Internet.
         • Support for training in the use of the Internet.

                                                  The Internet represents a new opportunity for increased
                                             knowledge and information for development. In the long term,
                                             it will significantly alter the structure of telecommunications.
                                             In the short term, the main policy conclusions from this toolkit
                                             are not very different from those of studies that concentrate on
                                             telecommunications in general. The Internet is heavily depen-
                                             dent on an efficient telecommunications sector, which is usually
                                             market-based. The Internet is itself another pressure acting to-
                                             ward the market option of further competition and liberaliza-
                                             tion. However, while the market forces will expand access to a
                                             section of the population, there will still remain a role for gov-
                                             ernment to reach the poorest.

2              Global Telecommunications,
               Emergence of the Internet,
               and Africa

Not long ago, there were less than 200 telephone companies in
the world. Now there are perhaps 5,000 companies, and soon
there might be 100,000. Technological advances across the world
are making it difficult for monopolies to survive. This changing
environment is having diverse effects on the international tele-
communications system - not least on the costs and prices of
international phone calls (see box).
     International calls account for a large percentage of Afri-
can post and telecommunications (PTT) profits, and these prof-
its have been artificially maintained by agreements between
governments and the big national telephone companies. Chang-
ing technology and global policy reforms are now threatening
this arrangement, most visibly though the combined pressures
of accounting rates reform and call back services. This is only
the beginning, for there are other factors waiting to transform
the old telecommunications paradigm.
      Technological advances have also ushered in changes in
the economics of local supply (see box). Wireless local loop tech-
nology, for example, eliminates the need to run cables to every
home, by operating a short-distance wireless link that greatly

reduces the cost of connection. Such changes suggest that parts
of Africa might soon see local competition. In fact, in countries
that have opened up the telecommunications sector to a second·
network operator (SNO), the new entrant has frequently insti-
tuted wireless technology as the solution. Unfortunately, there
are many countries in Africa where liberalization attempts are
not keeping pace with technological change, as Table 2.1 amply
illustrates.
      While the global telecommunications sector has already
undergone significant changes, the technology of the Internet is
likely to add to both the rate and the scale of change. The Internet
is doubling in size each year. While Africa remains the least
connected continent on the globe (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3), it is
still likely to be affected by changes in global communications
systems brought about by the new technology - especially if
African nations embrace and encourage Internet development.

     The explosion of international bandwidth shows no signs
of slowing down. In 1994, George Gilder predicted in his "Gild-
ers Law" (Gilder, 1993) that the capacity of communications sys-
tems, the global bandwidth, will triple every 18 months. This
increase represents just one force that will continue to drive
down the price of communications.

Technological changes that shape telecommunications

This expansion of Internet traffic is partially driven by underly-
ing technological changes that threaten to further alter the shape
of the telecommunications industry. These forces include con-
vergence through digitalization, packet-switched networks, and
the standardization of the TCP /IP protocol.

                                                    bered. First, so far, losses arising from email substitution are
                                                    smaller than increased revenues provided by the rapid rise in
                                                    international telephone traffic in and out of Africa (ITU 1997).
                                                    Second, if the Internet poses a threat to telecommunications prof-
                                                    its in Africa, the threat is minimal when compared to that from
                                                    accounting rate reform. For example, annual U.S. accounting

      If African PTTs give way to pressures for rate rebalancing
 (charging less for international calls and more for a local con-
 nection and calls), this is likely to have a significant impact on
 the economics of the Internet in the continent, making email sub-
 stitution both less attractive to users and less of a threat to the
 region's telephone companies. More significantly, however, it
 might drive up the revenues that PTTs receive from World Wide
 Web users, which could turn Internet usage from a revenue drain
 into a profit center for telecommunications companies.                         Studies of Economic Growth and

3 The Internet in Africa



                                             Who uses the Internet iri Africa?

                                             The CABECA survey of African Internet users was carried out
                                             in 1997-98 to gather data on the characteristics of the average
                                             African Internet user (see Bibliography for full citation). The
                                             survey found that there was as yet little government use of the
                                             Internet: only one percent of users in Ethiopia, and only six per-
                                             cent in Zambia, were government employees. The highest num-
                                             ber of users belonged to nongovernment organizations (NGOs ),
                                             private companies, and universities. The ratio of nationals to
                                             non-nationals varied between countries: 44 percent of users sur-
                                             veyed in Zambia were nationals as compared to 90 percent in
                                             Ghana. Most users were male: 86 percent, 83 percent, and 64
                                             percent in Ethiopia, Senegal, and Zambia respectively. A large
                                             majority of users were well educated: 87 percent of users in Zam-
                                             bia and 98 percent in Ethiopia had a university degree. A recent
                                             South African survey of the Internet found similar results: the
                                             average user was male, 26 to 30, spoke English, was high school
                                             or university-educated, earned between US$24,000 and
                                             US$45,000 per year and worked in the computer industry.

                                             What is the Internet used for?

                                             The survey findings suggest that the average level of email use
                                             is one per day, sending and receiving. Email is used for general
                                             correspondence and document exchange, technical advice,
                                             managing projects, arranging meetings, and exchanging research
                                             ideas, although its use is still limited for finding and accessing
                                             formal information resources. Across the continent, users report
                                             that email has increased efficiency and reduced the cost of
                                             communication - but as yet it is used almost exclusively for
                                             contacting individuals in other regions. The WWW is still a
                                             relatively underutilized resource, although 40 percent of
                                             Zambian users questioned had conducted literature searches on
                                             the web. Further, there are signs that the Internet is beginning
                                             to play a larger role in the economies of the region.

                                             Exporting through the Internet

                                             African countries export many commodities that can be easily
18
traded over the web'. One example is coffee. In 1997, the world
consumption of coffee exceeded eight million metric tons, up
from 6.5 in 1987, and Africa produces more than 20 percent of
the world's coffee. Of the African nations, Cote D'Ivoire,
Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya and Zaire together produce over 60
percent of the continent's coffee crops. The Ugandan Coffee
Trade Federation (UCTF) has created a home page
(www.patriot.net/-Uganda) which provides information about
coffee production, the growers, the land, and the different kinds
of ,,coffee.
       The Ugandans also examined the possibility of growing an
organic coffee, posting the idea on their web site to research the
market and find possible collaborators. The Uganda web site is
only one example of how, by having better communications,
African growers can reach out to vendors, to other growers in
the area, as well as to growers in other countries who may share
experiences with Uganda.
       There are other examples of trade and commerce on the
Internet. Craftsmen in Uganda, Senegal, Botswana, and Zimba-
bwe are now marketing their products worldwide through the
UN International Trade Center's "Virtual Handicraft Exhibition"
web site (http:/ /www.unicc.org/itc/virtexib/vexhibl.html).
       A small import-export company in Tanzania, Regent Clear-
ing and Forwarding, now uses 10 cents electronic mail messages
and $1 email-to-fax gateways instead of $20 faxes to place or-
ders for products in North America and Europe. As a result the
company has seen its telecommunications bill go from over $500
each month to $45 a month.
       Also in Tanzania, a small African shipping company,            \
Sangare Clearing and Forwarding, has eliminated one of its big-
gest expenses. As agents for Fedex and Airborne Express, the
company went through three to four rolls of triplicate telex pa-
per each day. Now it uses email to send waybill numbers and
time of delivery.
       A British supermarket is planning to use email to conduct
just-in-time purchase of chili peppers from a farm in Kenya.
       The African Market only offers products from Africa and
more specifically from Southern Africa. The product are uniquely
African or depict African themes (http: I/ www.safari-

Take the Internet route to Africa

In the last three years, the Internet has become a new marketing
and sales tool for travel to Africa. Several countries offer a com-
plete tourism directory on the net. Zimbabwe's, for example, is
at www.zimbabwe.net/ tourism. A visitor to this site will be able
to get information on every aspect of a trip. The site provides
                                                                          19

                                             barriers (Quaynor, Tevie and Bulley, 1997).
                                                  The computer training center in Wa, Upper West Province
                                             in Ghana, exemplifies the additional problems that sites distant
                                             from the capital city can face in accessing the Internet. A range
                                             of infrastructure issues and the high fixed costs of Internet ser-
                                             vice provision make running such a center very challenging.
                                             First, the telephone connection cost to Accra is 33 cents and the
                                             hourly charge US$7.50. Poor line quality limits transmission
                                             speed and means that it usually takes five attempts to connect
                                             successfully to the ISP (adding another US$1.67 to the connec-
                                             tion charges). Line drops frequently disrupt downloads, neces-
                                             sitating reconnection and starting the download again. The
                                             training center also suffers from other infrastructure weaknesses:
                                             electricity has been rationed since the beginning of 1998 due to
                                             low rains. Repair and maintenance problems include the diffi-
                                             culties of a seven-hour bus ride to Accra over poor roads. At the
                                             moment, the center is only financially viable because it is run by
                                             volunteers: revenues are US$2,000 a year, but locals trained in
                                             computer skills and management are in high demand: they can
                                             fetch US$6,000 per year. Without a local user base of at least 35
                                             users, a commercially viable center will be impossible to oper-
                                             ate (Hirsch, 1998). Interviews with a number of schools in
                                             Uganda suggest similar problems. Complaints included diffi-
                                             culty in getting telephone lines, inadequate trained personnel,
                                             unreliable computer equipment, poor telephone links (especially
                                             when it rains) and unreliable electricity supplies (Hawkins,
                                             1998).
                                                   Another problem the Africa Internet faces right now is the
                                             poor speed of connectivity. The low bandwidth causes a slow
                                             download of sites that are hosted in Africa. This is why many of
                                             the African Internet sites mentioned earlier are hosted on serv-
                                             ers that are in Europe or the U.S. The Zambian web site, for ex-
                                             ample, is hosted by a company in London, a lodge in Zimbabwe
                                             has its own site on a Hungarian server and the Chiawa Camp in
                                             Zambia has its website hosted by a Florida Internet provider.
                                                   The CABECA survey reports that a low level of computer
                                             literacy in general and knowledge of mailer programs in par-
                                             ticular stifled Internet use. Overall, there was a clear correlation
                                             between low computer skills and the low number of email sent
                                             by users. This problem was exacerbated by a widespread pau-
                                             city of trainers in the countries surveyed. The high number of
                                             users per line and limited access to nodes also restrict use. How-

Providing cheaper, more reliable Internet access

Cost appears to be a central concern of users (and certainly of
nonusers) in the African continent, then. Annex 5 presents details
on potential Internet penetration in Africa. Table 3.1 shows the
estimated cost of an Internet access point in five countries, and
average potential per person communications expenditure,
based on the (low-end) assumption that one percent of income
goes toward communications.
      The figures in Table 3.1 clearly suggest that at the moment
only the very rich in Africa will be able to afford their own
Internet connection. It also emphasizes the need for genuine
public access if the Internet is going to be widely used. Even so,
if as much as 50 percent of low-income users' potential expen-
diture on communications was harnessed to provide Internet
access to the poorest 20 percent of the population in Tanzania,
the number of Internet access points they could afford per head
at present would be one per every 25,000 (one every 800 km 2 at
average population densities). This, in turn, emphasizes the vi-
tal importance of lowering connection costs. If Tanzania's cost
of connection was to fall to South Africa's level, potential Inter-
net connectivity would increase sevenfold, raising the average
potential ratio of one terminal per 10,000 people to one per 1,500.
The results also suggest how vital
public access to community Internet         Table 3.2 The Cost of Internet Access in Mozambique per Year

                                              be US$56,000. These figures probably underrate the costs of sala-

                                               connectivity is the most expensive item.
                                                     If we look at USAID' s model of the costs of an international
                                               gateway for Mozambique's Internet, we can see again that in-
                                               ternational connectivity forms the bulk of the expenditure.
                                                     The cost breakdown in Table 3.5 indicates that around 60
                                               percent of the costs for an International ISP gateway in
                                               Mozambique is for network connectivity. The greatest percent-
                                               age of this cost is international satellite connectivity which ac-
                                               counts for 88 percent of the network costs. Not surprisingly,
                                             . sensitivity tests of the model suggest that the high international
                                               connectivity costs are a major cause of high ISP charges (see An-

                                             The telecommunications company clearly plans a vital role in
                                             providing affordable access, then. What type of reaction the In-
                                             ternet creates in the telecoms sector is likely to be critical in de-
                                             termining the growth of the Internet. It is likely that a policy of
                                             active support will reap the highest rewards.
                                                  We have already seen that the Internet can be used to
                                             substitute email for voice and fax communication, but that is
                                             only one element of the relationship between Internet users and
                                             telecommunications companies. For example, PTTs gain profits
                                             from World Wide Web access. Internet access in Mozambique
                                             averages 100 hours a year per subscriber at the moment.
                                             Assuming that 90 percent of users have local access,
                                             Mozambique's PTT gains US$759,000 annually in telephone
                                             charges from users (see Annex 1 for details). If one in 20 users
                                             manage to obtain a second line dedicated to Internet use, another
                                             US$12,600 are added per year in revenues. There is also the
                                             revenue from ISP leased lines, subscriber lines and international
                                             connectivity.
                                                  Using the cost and load assumptions laid out in Annex 6, it
                                             appears that, even in Mozambique, where the PTT gains little
                                             revenue from the ISP's international connection, cost of provid-
                                             ing the services required by Internet users is below the revenues
                                             received for this service. Rough estimates suggest that present
                                             levels of Internet usage add US$500,000 to the PTT' s profits each
                                             year. The sensitivity tests carried out in Annex 1 suggest that if
                                             Internet usage was to increase in Mozambique, the extra rev-
                                             enues from calls into the ISPs would outweigh the revenue losses
                                             from email substitution. This is in the interests of the PTT to

            nies claim they need to upgrade their networks for
            handling Internet traffic.
      In other words, both the model and U.S. evidence suggest
that, while the Internet might change telephone usage patterns,
flexible PTTs should not be overly threatened by its expansion
and, in fact, should encourage it.
     One change mentioned earlier is likely to have an impact
on the rate of the Internet's expansion, however. Tariff rebalanc-
ing is narrowing the difference between the prices for local and
long distance services. In Australia, the ratio between the price
of a long distance call between Sydney and Melbourne and the
price of a local call was 45 to one in 1966. This had been reduced
to 30 to one in 1976, 15 to one in 1986 and four to one in 1996.

                                                    of liberalization, one based on the extent of private involvement
                                                    in the telecommunications market in 1998 and one based on the
                                                    broad extent of liberalization in the sector in 1997, it is clear that
                                                    more liberalized countries have more Internet hosts, and lower
                                                    monthly access costs when transferring 10 or 50 pages a day
                                                    (see Table 3.6). For both indices, 0 is a measure of little private
                                                    competition, and 4 (in the case of the private involvement in-
                                                    dex) or 7 (in the case of the liberal index) suggests a great deal
                                                    of competition in the sector.
                                                          It is similarly true that countries with competition in the
                                                    field of Internet service provision have lower costs of service
                                                    provision and a larger number of Internet hosts. Evidently, even
                                                    though there are small scale economies in this area, these are
                                                    outweighed by the efficiency gains brought on by competition.
                                                          Taking data from Table 3.7 on African Internet users, we
                                                    can see in Table 3.8 that countries that are more liberal by either

                                                    ISPs, more users and more international bandwidth.

                                             lenges present profit centers and network configurations. In
                                             particular, Internet telephony and substitution threaten profits
                                             from international voice communication. However, there are at
                                             least three arguments that suggest this is not reason enough for
                                             PTTs to control or discourage Internet expansion:
                                                     • The Internet is only one of a number of technology-
                                                         driven forces that are initiating changes in the
                                                         structure of the network and pricing. Discouraging
                                                         its expansion on the continent cannot preserve the
                                                         status quo.
                                                     • The Internet offers potential new revenue sources
                                                         - increased local call revenue and greater demand
                                                         for international bandwidth, for example. Evidence
                                                         suggests that an increased user base will generate
                                                         profits for the PTT.
                                                     • There is more than enough evidence to demonstrate
                                                         the value of the Internet and its ability to encourage
                                                         economic growth in Africa. Fear of change in tele-

                                                         restrict the opportunities that the Internet presents.
                                                  Even if official attitudes toward the Internet change for the
                                             better across Africa, there remain policy issues. One of the ma-
                                             jor ones, already discussed, deals with rate rebalancing which
                                             may lead to an increase in the cost ot local calls and connection
                                             to the network. This presents a challenge to policies encourag-

                                             and may also restrict Internet usage. To meet this challenge, and
                                             others involving costs and access, the toolkit offers the two-

                                                  There are other issues that may affect decision making in
                                             this sector. The toolkit offers some general principles for gov-

                                                     • Think differently and stress openness: governments
                                                         need to treat the Internet as a new technology and
                                                         not a mere addition to the existing telecommunica-
                                                         tions or broadcasting regimes. Policies and regula-
                                                         tion need to be open and flexible, to adjust to new

          •    Promote competition: governments should work to
               encourage competition at all levels, a tested tool for
               increasing efficiency and lowering costs.
          •    Avoid unnecessary regulation: governments need to
               work to avoid unnecessary interference with the
               Internet's development. The Internet has grown so
               rapidly primarily because it has been allowed the
               freedom to do so.

Think differently

It is important that government regulatory policies encourage
innovation and new service applications, and to do so, very of-
ten those policies have to undergo major redesign. The existing
definitions of broadcasting, publishing, and communications are
changing all over the world. Government policy must be sensi-
tive to these changes, and realize that the Internet landscape a
few years in the future may look very different from that of to-
day. Also, convergence is changing the way that voice, data, and
video content is delivered. Opportunities to create and deliver
this information will come from many sources, both domestic
and international. The regulatory infrastructure must be sensi-
tive to this and create conditions to allow many new entrants to
participate in and contribute to the development of a new infor-
mation society.

Promote competition

Competition in telecommunications network services, Internet
service provision, and content development should be stressed
in order to bring the greatest efficiency gains to the country.
Wherever possible, market forces should be harnessed to take
the place of direct regulatory intervention. Although new ser-
vices like Internet telephony and streaming audio and video may
create regulatory problems, these developments are positive ones
which governments should encourage.

                                             Avoid unnecessary regulation

                                             Governments should regulate the Internet as little as possible.
                                             The ultimate objective should be less regulation for all, rather
                                             than more regulation for some. For instance, if competitive im-
                                             balance exists because a new technology is not subject to the
                                             same regulatory constraints as a competing older technology,
                                             the answer should be reduced regulation of the older technol-
                                             ogy. However, positive contributions to network development
                                             by governments are important, especially in the area of univer-
                                             sal service, international cooperation, content creation, training
                                             and development of education and health networks.
                                                  The most common policy issues dealing with the Internet
                                             today have been categorized in five separate sections below: costs
                                             and liberalization, infrastructure, management, content, and
                                             training. The sections identify the questions raised by the chang-
                                             ing telecommunications environment, questions that the toolkit

                                             Internet as a liberalized value-added service

                                             Questions to be raised and debated about the basic nature of
                                             services offered by the Internet include:
                                                    • Should the Internet be considered a part of telecom-

                                                        services?
                                                    • Should the Internet fall into the existing regulations
                                                        for telecommunications or for broadcasting?
                                                    • What are the benefits of liberalizing the Internet in
                                                        my country?      .
                                                    • Should organizations be allowed to run private
                                                        Internet networks?
                                                  Although some African countries have already liberalized
                                             the Internet as a value-added service, many others have not. The
                                             toolkit clearly indicates that the Internet should be fully liber-
                                             alized as a value-added service and the government should en-
                                             courage the growth of the Internet by allowing private sector
                                             initiatives to flourish. The potential benefits of this liberaliza-
                                             tion are many. It will lower costs to consumers, generate more
                                             communication access points for the country, provide opportu-

                                             International gateways

                                             The next set of questions are concerned with restrictions that

32
relate to international Internet gateways:
        • If the Internet is liberalized, should there be any
            restrictions on the number of international gate-
            ways licensed?
        • Do many different international gateways present
            inefficiencies in traffic sharing within a country?
        • With a number of cable and satellite ventures
            offering expanded bandwidth, should participation
            in such a system be a matter of government policy
            or should decisions be based on the business needs
            of the operators?
     Policies vary widely across the African continent. In Ghana,
ISPs have access to three gateways. There is no official limit to
gateways in Mozambique or Uganda (although this is under
consideration), but South Africa and Zimbabwe have monopoly
providers. A number of countries have allowed companies and
organizations to bypass international gateways and construct
their own private networks. The toolkit has outlined that al-
though there are economies of scale in Internet service provi-
sion, the efficiency gains from competition outweigh the gains
from economies of scale. The continued increase in international
bandwidth suggests that costs and prices will continue to fall.
Governments, therefore, should not restrict access to this sup-
ply.

Licenses

Licenses and associated costs for operating an Internet service
are valid concerns for any government considering a liberal en-
vironment for the Internet. Questions include:
        • Should governments require licenses for Internet
           service provision?
                                                                             Policies Toward International

                                                         The model suggests that net density is strongly correlated
                                                    to the cost of Internet inputs such as computers and networking
                                                    equipment. In order to expand Internet access in a country, gov-
                                                    ernments should consider reducing tariffs on computer equip-
                                                    ment. For instance, a reduction from 45 percent to zero on

        • How can competition be encouraged?

     The toolkit demonstrates that competition in telecommu-

quality of service to customers, and provide a greater variety of
services. Local competition is likely to be a key policy instru-

                                             have not yet been answered in all countries. Here are some con-

                                                  Countries around the world have yet to determine how to,
                                             or whether to regulate Internet telephony. Many countries have
                                             existing voice monopolies and as such would view Internet te-

Management

The Internet is a decentralized and distributed network of net-
works and thus inherently difficult, if not impossible, to con-
trol. There is no single organization that manages the Internet;
rather, many individual networks cooperate to guarantee its
success. The issue of domain name registration, however, is an
area of Internet management in which governments might need
to intervene.

Domain name registration

A controversial policy question in Internet management is the
control of domain names - the brand names of the Internet.
     In the U.S., Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) currently charges
US$50 per year to register a domain name. A portion of this
money goes to NSI to recover administrative costs and a portion
goes into an "Internet Intellectual Infrastructure fund". But the
existing registration process for generic top-level domains has
generated substantial controversy. Some parties have objected
to what they consider to be NSis monopoly control over a valu-
able resource, especially since an entity in the U.S. is respon-
sible for assigning addresses with international ramifications.
The International Ad Hoc Committee, comprising representa-
tives from the Internet Society, International Telecommunications
Union, the World Intellectual Property Organization and other
groups, has issued a wide-ranging proposal to restructure the
generic top-level domain name system.
     In all countries outside of the U.S., the root domain has a
country designation at the end, and one entity in the country is
charged with distributing top level domain names. In some coun-
tries other bodies are charged with assigning lower level do-
main names such as .co for a private sector company, .school for
an educational institution, and .org for an organization. Sub-
stantial debate has revolved around control of the top level do-
mains in a number of African countries. The controversy centers
around the question of whether domain name provision should
be handled by a private entity or a government entity. For in-
stance, Malawi and Zimbabwe have recently debated this issue.

                                             as acceptable content, intellectual property, and privacy. One
                                             area, however, in which government should focus its attention
                                             is the creation of local content. With an increase in relevant local
                                             content, it can be hoped that more users will use the Internet
                                             and the number of individuals contributing to its growth will
                                             increase. Governments can play a significant role in assisting
                                             with the computerization of government and public informa-

                                             at best retained by only a limited audience.

                                                         focus its resources?
                                                  African governments need to invest in raising awareness
                                             of the benefits of the Internet across a broad range of sectors ,
                                             including education, trade, agriculture, and health. In addition,

                                                  For all of the policy areas listed above, the solutions will be
                                             different for each country. The toolkit's aim has been to provide
                                             a broad overview of the issues and work through some of the
                                             areas that need to be given extra consideration. In all cases local
                                             models for local needs will develop to address each country's
                                             specific and unique reality. But the Internet continues to expand
                                             globally, Africa must take advantage of the opportunities offered
                                             by the unique properties of this network of networks.

Economic Toolkit for African Policy Makers

Annex One:
Results of the Model for
Costs and Revenues from Communications

                                             The Internet is likely to have a variety of effects - on users,
                                             ISPs, and telecommunications companies in Africa. Mere access
                                             to email would make an enormous difference to traditional data
                                             transmission and communication methods. In three minutes, a
                                             voice call can "transmit" two pages of information; a fax can
                                             transmit 10 pages of information; while, in the same time, a 28
                                             k/ s modem is able to send an email of between 175 and 350
                                             pages.
                                                   At such rapid speeds, email is a very attractive alternative
                                             to traditional modes of communication. However, it has high
                                             fixed costs: users require a computer and a modem in addition
                                             to a telephone, and there are costs of leasing, access, personnel
                                             and equipment of the ISP which are passed on to the user through
                                             Internet tariffs. All the same, once the equipment has been pur-
                                             chased and an email account paid for, the price of sending a
                                             single page across the country or around the world is the price
                                             of a few seconds long local call to the users' ISP. To send that
                                             page by fax may cost up to US$30 in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                                                   In response to these opportunities, users are likely to com-
                                             municate more than they have done so far. They will email
                                             messages that they would not have bothered with if limited to
                                             voice or fax communication. But they will also substitute email
                                             for voice and fax communication, so reducing PTT revenues.
                                                   Of course, this exaggerates the scale of the problem for tele-
                                             communications companies.
                                                   First, home telecommunications companies have to pay the
                                             foreign company that provides service to the recipient an ac-
                                             counting rate fee for completing the international fax connec-
                                             tion, so that gross revenues are higher than net revenues for
                                             international calls.
                                                   Second, the telecommunications company will gain rev-
                                             enues from the ISP, which has to lease lines and equipment to
                                             connect to the Internet backbone in the U.S., along with tele-
                                             phone lines to connect to customers. Further, email substitution
                                             will reduce pressure on international connections and regional
                                             trunks, reducing the need to invest in new trunk lines. How-
                                             ever, as this need is chronic, and the effect of email on demand

                                             fort to the region's telecommunications companies.
                                                   Third, this is likely to be a temporary problem, and one that

will lose its importance with the general increase in international
traffic (outgoing traffic from Sub-Saharan Africa has increased
from 322,000 minutes in 1990, to 449,000 minutes in 1994), and
the changes underway due to political and technological pres-
sures on the accounting rate regime.
      Despite these ameliorating factors, however, email substi-
tution will reduce African telecommunications company profits
from outgoing calls, at least in the short term. Also, the compa-
nies will lose revenue they presently receive in the form of ac-
counting rate charges for incoming calls when foreign customers
email African countries instead of calling. These accounting rates
are far above the real costs. For example, Cameroon's account-
ing rate with the U.S. is US$1.80 per minute, so that for every
minute of incoming calls from the U.S., Cameroon's telecom-
munications company receives 90 cents (one half of the account-
ing rate, called the settlement rate). This compares to a local call
rate of under three cents per minute. African telecommunica-
tions companies, that cross-subsidize the cost of phone installa-
tion and local calls using regional and foreign phone charge
revenue, will find that an increasing number of users are using
telephone lines mainly to make local calls to their ISPs, leading
to large per line losses.
      World Wide Web access presents its own set of problems.
On the one hand, Web browsing involves long periods of local
calling that offers revenue opportunities. Further, expanded
Internet usage in the U.S. has seen approximately 10 million
people ask for a second telephone line, which are cheap to in-
stall and profitable to offer. If this trend is repeated in Africa,
telecommunications companies can expect to earn revenue from
second line installation and rental. They can also lease lines to
ISPs to handle the large quantity of data transfer that web ac-
cess requires.
      On the other hand, networks that were not designed to
handle calls measured in hours rather than minutes can be over-
loaded by. Internet browsing, requiring the installation of new
switch and transmit equipment. Whether this balance of prob-
lems and opportunities will lead to increased profitability or
further losses depends very much on the assumptions made
about network capacity and the pricing of telecommunications
company services.
      The following model explores the above issues. It was con-
structed to do two things. First, it measures the theoretical ad-
vantages (in reduced phone and/ or fax bills) to an individual
subscriber, and revenue losses to a phone company from using
email rather than phone or fax. This is calculated based on the
number of pages of information sent. Second, it calculates ISP
cost and revenue streams (based on a monopoly international
hub), telecommunications cost and revenue streams, and user

                                                    We have assumed that a telephone line is already installed (all
                                                    compared systems would require a telephone, anyway). There
                                                    is no extra equipment required to make a voice call, so the "fixed
                                                    cost" of phoning is zero. The fixed cost to faxing information is
                                                    the yearly cost of a fax machine allowing for depreciation and
                                                    cost of capital. Here, it has been estimated to be in the region of
                                                    US$155 per year. For email, the fixed cost is taken to be Internet
                                                    access charges and the cost of a computer and a modem, allow-

                                                    Given that computers are useful for far more than Internet ac-

                                                    costs effectively overestimates this cost. Internet access as de-
                                                    fined here also gives unlimited access to WWW, so that charg-

                                                    emailing also effectively overestimates the fixed costs of
                                                    emailing. The high cost of capital discriminates against emailing
                                                    as a cheap communications option as well. Therefore, the fixed
                                                    costs of emailing presented here are, if anything, exaggerated.
                                                          What are the costs of delivering this information per page?
                                                    As mentioned above, a person can read out a page of informa-
                                                    tion in about one and a half minutes. A fax can transmit the same
                                                    information in about 18 seconds. A standard 28 k/ s modem
                                                    should take around half a second to transmit the data. On the
                                                    basis of data given above, we can calculate the approximate cost
                                                    of sending a page of information by multiplying the number of
                                                    pages by the amount of time taken in minutes, dividing by three
                                                    and multiplying by the cost of a three minute call.
                                                          The actual time spent transferring data by email is prob-
                                                    ably shorter than the time taken to connect and disconnect from
                                                    the email server. To calculate the yearly cost of emailing, then,

    44
we have assumed that each business day it takes three minutes
to connect, upload and download email, and disconnect. This
gives a flat amount that emailers are likely to have to pay in
telephone charges. For emailers dialing into a local ISP, this will
amount to 260 multiplied by the cost of a three minute local call.
For emailers dialing into an ISP in a different region of the coun-
try, this will amount to 260 multiplied by the cost of a three
minute regional call. This is the only telephone charge that
emailers will face - in that three minute period, they can down-
load and upload their email for other regions in the country and
for other countries in the world. Once again, charging all email
telephone costs to local email (rather than dividing it up amongst
local, regional and international) gives an exaggerated picture
of the costs of local emailing.
      As is clear from Table Al.2, email is not a great money saver
on local calls in Mozambique. If a user talks on the telephone
for about 250 hours a year (about an hour each business day),
enough time to "speak" 10,000 pages, even over a local email
service the difference between email and voice costs is a mere
US$190. This is far less than the difference in fixed costs between
voice and email ($1,172). Given that email and voice are not
perfect substitutes, then, consumers will most likely continue
to use local voice whenever it is preferable.
      With regional calls, however, the savings are larger. Be-
cause the costs of email have all been accounted for, the cost of
10,000 pages of regional email is close to zero. This compares to
a cost of US$3,000 forl0,000 pages spoken (in 250 hours).
This difference is enough to pay for an emailer's com-          Table A 1.2 Non-Fixed Cost of

of email each year, the loss to the telephone company amounts
to US$7,650 in revenue per year if the email is substituting for
fax and US$38,250 in revenue per year if the email is substitut-
ing for voice.
      With the accounting rate calculation, it is possible to make
a rough estimate of the lost profits from email substitution. The
settlement rate is meant to compensate for the cost of delivering
the traffic from half way between the countries to the recipient
(the half circuit). In fact, accounting rates are known to be well
above cost. However, they present an upper estimate of the cost
of providing the connection. Three minutes of traffic at account-
ing rate cost equals US$3.57. The amount charged to Mozambican
users is US$7.65, suggesting an approximate profit margin to
the telephone company on outgoing calls of US$4.08, or 114 per-
cent. Given that real upper-bound estimates of the costs to tele-
communications companies of providing this service are
estimated at closer to 30 to 40 cents per minute, profit margins
rise to US$7.15 a minute.
      Data based broadly on the Mozambique cost and price struc-
ture for Internet provision, telecommunications supply and
equipment and usage levels, help to demonstrate the present
and potential financial impact of the Internet on ISPs, telecom-
munications companies and subscribers.             ·

                                                   It should also be pointed out that this ISP model probably

                                                     1. Cost of revenues (for ISP) is comparable to the cost
                                                        of .goods sold by a manufacturing company. This

                                                        Depreciation can be part of this cost, although

                                                  African ISPs are likely to face higher costs because
                                                  of their higher costs of equipment, financing and
                                                  communications in the region.

                                               2. The sales and marketing cost is a component that
                                                  should not be neglected. In the U.S., marketing
                                                  expenses account for 20 to 30 percent of total costs.
                                                  A large percentage of these costs is attributed to the
                                                  high comp~tition that exists among ISPs. A market-

                                                  the main model, and the model might, therefore,
                                                  underestimate the long term costs of Internet ser-

                                                  is much higher than that for the simple ISP in the
                                                  U.S. Unlike ISPs that provide simple connectivity,
                                                  the OLSP provides content and other Internet
                                                  applications as well. This requires the companies to
                                                  invest in product development and content. African
                                                  ISPs are also likely to have to develop content
                                                  because of the language issues and the need for
                                                  local content. Again, this is a cost not accounted for
                                                  in the main model.

reasonably good estimate of ISP costs and telecommunications
company revenues from ISPs.
      Assumptions necessary to the model are based on a range
of sources and estimates. Here, it should be noted that, as op-
posed to the results above, the assumption is that subscribers
share computers.
      In the Mozambican case, the primary source of telecommu-
nications company revenues from the Internet is the extra user
traffic. This new traffic will be driven by the use of WWW, and
not email. In Mozambique, the total user access to the Internet
adds US$760,000 to phone bills. A monopoly ISP would pay a
surprisingly small amount to Mozambique Telecom (US$36,600).
This is both because there· is no ISP license charge in the coun-
try, and because most payments for international access go to
the Leland link, rather than the Mozambique PTT. Further, leased
lines in Mozambique, at only US$6,000 for a connection to the
Leland link, are very cheap.
      In Kenya, on the other hand, where a 64k international
leased line connection costs US$177,000, ISP costs would be a
more significant percentage of total telecoms revenues (although
still smaller than user access). This also has a significant impact
on ISP profits. The relatively low cost of international Internet
connectivity, and the relatively low need for bandwidth because
of low usage, reduce dramatically the most significant portion
of an ISP' s costs in Mozambique. Although telephone, leased
line, satellite ari.d Internet connections account for about 48 per-
cent of the ISP's budget when it has 3,500 subscribers, this is
                                                                                                     51

                                                   be making revenues of over US$2 million. In part, this is be-
                                                   cause of returns to scale, but only in part. The estimated fixed
                                                   costs for a Mozambican ISP would amount to approximately
                                                   US$77,000 a year. More significant is that a company with such
                                                   comparatively low costs of international access, low demand for
                                                   bandwidth (an average of only 64kps for each 1,000 customers),
                                                   and an equally low demand for ISP computing power, faces very
                                                   low costs overall. This makes it a strong argument for competi-

appears that lowering the cost of telephone and Internet access
is probably the most significant thing that countries can do to
encourage users to access the new technology.
     By changing some of the underlying assumptions of the
model, it is possible to see the impact on ISP revenues. The first
scenario presents the base scenario, which suggests very large
profits for the hypothetical ISP. The second scenario is that the
ISP brings up its Internet access standards to international norms,
and that a 64 kps line is sufficient for 10 people to be on line at
any one time. Given average use of 100 hours per year, the aver-
age user is online 0.115 percent of the time, suggesting that, at
average loads, a 64 kps bandwi.dth is satisfactory for 874 sub-
scribers. Figures from NCS in Ghana suggest that peak hours
see up to three times the number of people on line than the av-
erage load. To provide a good quality of Internet access, there-
fore, 64kps of bandwidth is required for at least every 400
subscribers. Altering this assumption reduces ISP profits, but
because international bandwidth is so cheap, profits remain ex-
tremely healthy.
     In the third scenario, the cost of international bandwidth is
raised to US$170,000 for 64 kps. This is similar to prices paid by
ISPs in other countries, including Kenya. Raising the price of
connectivity at the present
level of service reduces prices
more significantly, bringing          Scenario ISP Profits (US$) at Number of Users
down ISP profits to 1.2 million
at the present level of usage.                  O users      1,000 users 3,500 users     10,000 users

Annex Two:
Calculation of Telecommunications Revenue
Lost to Substitution Using FCC Data

A second simple way to estimate the approximate losses to tele-
communications companies from international substitution is
presented below. We have already presented estimates for the
amount of incoming and outgoing telephone and fax traffic the
average user substitutes with email. The FCC, as part of its at-
tempts to put downward pressure on international accounting
rates, has estimated the real cost per minute for countries to ter-
minate an international call (the "half circuit cost") for a range
of countries. This will be broadly the same as the cost of origi-
nating the call (both halves of the circuit are identical). In Af-
rica, numbers are presented for Kenya (42.6 cents/minute) and
South Africa (16.9 cents/ minute). Despite methodological prob-
lems with the FCC' s calculations, these numbers should approxi-
mate the real costs of completing a call. We also know the
accounting rate and the international call charges of a range of
African countries. With all of this data, we can estimate the
amount of profit (revenue minus cost) that telecommunications
companies lose from each email user each year (using the Kenya
number as an upper bound of costs and South Africa as a lower
bound). This leads to the figures below:

                                                    The first takes two different measures of sector liberaliza-

                                             O'Neill's article onAfrica: "The New TelecomsFrontier" (1998).
                                             TaBie A3.1 lists this data for all Sub-Saharan African countries
                                             wherever information was available. The first column presents
                                             a private involvement index, based on O'Neill's report on the
                                             state of private involvement in African countries at the start of
                                             1998. Countries receive one point for each of the following: new

                                             investment into cellular services.
                                                    The second index measures a broader definition of liberal-
                                             ization from World Bank data at the start of 1997. Countries are
                                             given one point for each of seven stages:
                                                       • liberal CPE trade;
                                                       • separate posts and telecommunications;
                                                       • independent regulator;
                                                       • reform in progress (or announced);
                                                       • new sector law/ private cellular; and
                                                       • privatized telecommunications company.
                                                    The table then lists two basic features of the economy that
                                              are likely to be connected with the scale of Internet penetration
                                             - population and GDP per capita (data from the ITU Yearbook).

www.nw.com. However, it should be noted that Network Wiz-
ards have changed their method of counting host sites, so that
the data between 1998 and previous years are not strictly com-
parable.
     Access prices come from the list of recommended ISPs in
African countries, from the 1997 UNIDO study of Internet con-
nectivity in Africa. The next two columns measure the monthly
cost of web access per page as calculated for two levels of usage
(measured in terms of pages per day) by Jensen. The next col-
umn measures the age of Internet access in a country, with a
score of one indicating that there was TCP /IP connection at the
end of 1995 (from the ITU yearbook). The final column indicates

                                                        suggests that competition in Internet service provision is also

                                                        costs. Of course, this correlation between liberalization in tele-

 economies cannot explain lower costs or the num-
 ber of providers in the more liberal telecommuni-
 cations environments. The data provide enough evidence to
 suggest that liberalization is a boon to the spread of the Internet
 in Africa.
       The method of calculating the cost of Internet access above
 excludes one important component of the cost of access: the price
 of calling the ISP. Table A3.5 is based on a broadly similar meth-
 odology to the OECD' s Report on Information Infrastructure Con-
 vergence and Pricing (1996), which is the source of the OECD data
 reported in the table. Data on the pricing policies of African
 ISPs are from Jensen (1997), data on PTT pricing are taken from
 the ITU (1997). The price per month for Internet access is calcu-
 lated as follows: The ISP connection charge divided by 36, the
 monthly charge, and any extra charges that apply to 20 or 30
 hours of use. The PTT charge is the telephone connection charge
 divided by 60, the monthly charge for a telephone and the cost
 of 20 or 30 hours of local calls (multiplied up from the three-
 minute local call rate reported by the ITU). African countries in
 gray in the table have comparatively "liberal" telecommunica-
 tions sectors, scoring more than three on the liberalization in-
 dex based on World Bank data.
       In the OECD, seven out of the eight countries with tele-
 communications infrastructure competition had cheaper than
 average total access charges while 12 of the 17 countries with-
 out competition were above the same benchmark (OECD, 1996).
.These results are mirrored in estimates for African Internet pro-
 vision. Some African countries provide very competitive Internet
 access as compared to the OECD (although it should be noted
 that the calculation does not follow exactly the same methodol-
 ogy). Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, Senegal and South
 Africa, all provide~cheaper overall Internet access than the OECD
 average, for example. On the other hand, closed telecommuni-
 cations regimes in Africa provide 30 hours of Internet access at
 more than twice the OECD average cost. Only one closed re-
 gime provides cheaper Internet access than the OECD average
 - Lesotho. Lesotho appears to benefit from its proximity to the

efficient (and large) South African telecommunications market.
Open telecommunications regimes in Africa appear to provide
both cheaper ISP charges and cheaper PTT charges. This sug-
gests that market efficiencies rather than rebalancing lead to
cheaper access.
     Statistical analysis of the determinants of Internet penetra-
tion in Africa (this time including South Africa) confirms this
finding. Running a regression of Internet hosts in each country
against a constant and population (regression 1), there is a posi-
tive relationship, but it is insignificant. Replacing population
with GDP produces a strong positive relationship which is highly
significant (regression 2). Undoubtedly, then, wealth plays a
large role in determining the extent of Internet penetration in
Africa. However, replacing GDP with number of computers (re-
gression 3) produces an even better fit - the number of com-
puters in a country explains 85 percent of the variation in the
number of Internet hosts. This is a result that echoes one found
by the OECD (1996) for richer countries and by the ITU with a
global sample (1997). When entered with GDP per capita, the
number of computers in a country remains significantly corre-
lated with Internet penetration, whereas GDP does not (regres-
sion 4). The number of personal computers and population, when
entered together in a regression (5), account for 98 percent of
the variation in the number of Internet hosts in the 16 African
countries for which we have data. It has to be assumed that the
number of computers per capita is proxying for a technology-
friendly environment in general. This suggests that, while
wealth is undoubtedly one important determinant of such an
environment, even poor African countries can encourage far
wider Internet penetration by becoming more technology
friendly.
     However, it should be pointed out that these results will be
driven largely by South Africa. Further, regressing the number
of Internet hosts per capita against variables, found GDP per
capita a stronger determinant of Internet penetration than com-
puters per capita. Regressions of Internet hosts per capita against
GDP per capita and the cost of a local call, percentage of lines
that were digital, main lines per capita, modems per capita or
minutes of outgoing calls as percentage of incoming calls, found
all variables except GDP per capita insignificant.

The Importance of Accounting Rates.
to African Telecommunications Companies

                                      Table A4.1 presents a list of African countries and an "account-
                                      ing index". The index is designed to be a very rough measure of
                                      a country's reliance on income from accounting rates. It is cal-
                                      culated as follows:
                                           ((no of minutes, international telephone traffic in) - (no. of
                                      minutes, international traffic out))* (one half the accounting rate
                                      with the United States) all expressed as a percentage of GDP.
                                           This measure can only be an approximation for a number
                                      of reasons. First, if we take the example of Swaziland, it is prob-
                                      able that the huge negative index score, based on more outgo-
                                      ing than incoming traffic, is because of a disparity of calls with
                                                           South Africa, not a disparity with the US. To
                                                          make the index a true measure of reliance on

Potential Internet Penetration
in Africa

                                             Taking GDP and percentage of income by quintile from the World
                                             Bank, the model presented here estimates the potential expen-

                                             nectivity. This is based on the common assumption that
                                             communities are willing to spend around one percent of their
                                             income on access to telephones. Taking this number, estimates
                                             for the costs of computer equipment, and the costs of connectiv-
                                             ity from Jensen and the ITU, we can estimate achievable tele-
                                             phone and Internet densities (per 100 people) on the basis of
                                             costs and willingness to spend. There are three sets of estimates.
                                             The first assumes that all expenditure will go to telephone con-
                                             nectivity, the second that 75 percent will go to telephone con-
                                             nectivity, but consumers will be willing to spend 25 percent of
                                             their connectivity budget on the Internet. The third set assumes
                                             that the connectivity expenditure will be evenly divided between
                                             the Internet and the telephone. The estimates measure expected
                                             teledensity, or telephones per 100 people (teledens), and expected
                                             Internet density, or computers hooked to the Internet per 100
                                             people (netdens), for each of the five income groups, as well as
                                             an average. Below that, the total number of telephones and com-
                                             puters hooked to the Internet is estimated, and this number used
                                             to calculate an average density in terms of telephones or Inter-
                                             net sites per square kilometer.
                                                   The model, as it stands, appears to overestimate the actual
                                             number of telephones in the countries. There are two reasons
                                             for this, both connected with policy choices. The first is the prob-
                                             lem of waiting lists. In countries where political pressure keeps
                                             the costs of access low without concomitant transfers or subsi-

                                             ated by below-cost service provision. This leads to huge waiting
                                             lists and low levels of satisfied demand. In Tanzania, the wait-

                                             percent).
                                                   The second and more significant reason for the model over-
                                             estimating telephone demand is that although models based on
                                             the "one percent of expenditure" assumption do quite well in
                                             estimating the number of connections to telephone networks,
                                             they do this by assuming that any household whose willingness to

Given this, an actual teledensity
of 9.45 is fairly respectable. In
Tanzania, only households in the very top of the top income
quintile will be able to afford a telephone or own telephones in
their businesses. The issue with such an assumption is that stud-
ies also suggest that if given access to public telephones, poorer
people will spend one percent or more of their income on con-
nectivity. This suggests that achievable teledensity, given pro-
active efforts to install public telephones, should be higher than
present-day teledensities. If Tanzania was to raise the number
of payphones per inhabitant from 0.02 to China's level of 0.70,
for example, this would increase the country's overall teledensity
by nearly 25 percent (from 0.30 to 0.37).
      While the model overestimates actual telephone densities,
it allows us to estimate potential order of magnitude telephone
and Internet densities under the assumption of expanded pub-
lic access to telephones and the Internet. Perhaps the first (and
most obvious) thing to be noticed is that achievable teledensity
or netdensity is highly dependent on two factors - the wealth
of the community and the cost of telephone or Internet access.
Looking at telephone access to begin with, we can see that po-
tential density varies enormously between countries. If no ex-
penditure is assumed to be going to Internet connectivity,
countrywide potential teledensity varies between 18.38 in South
Africa to 2.12 in Tanzania. Potential teledensity also varies im-
mensely between income brackets - for the poorest quintile in
Sou th Africa, the potential number of telephones per 100 people
is little higher than the average for Tanzania, at 3.04.
      If we now look at potential Internet density, it is clear that,
if expenditure on Internet access substitutes for access to tele-
phones, increasing netdensity will have an impact on teledensity.
Because access to the Internet is so much more expensive than
access to a telephone, this will reduce average teledensity. To
take the Tanzanian case, if Internet access expenditures substi-
tute for 50 percent of expenditures that presently go toward tele-
phone access, teledensity will drop from a potential 2.12per100
                                                                                                              71

                                             phones attached to an Internet access point), while net density
                                             will reach only 0.01per100 people. In terms of average number
                                             of potential telephones and Internet access points per square km,
                                             the number of potential telephones would fall from one every
                                             one and a half km 2 to one every three km 2, while the number of
                                             Internet sites would reach one every 333 km2 •
                                                   Of course, the picture is not that bleak. First, because of the
                                             potential of the Internet, it is likely that expenditure on access
                                             would be as much additional as it was substitutive (especially
                                             for rich users). Second, potential teledensity at 50 percent ex-
                                             penditure on the Internet is still higher than actual teledensity
                                             achieved in Tanzania (1.06 compared to 0.30 per 100 people).
                                             This suggests that the problem of substitution expenditure on
                                             the Internet driving down teledensity is likely to be largely theo-
                                             retical.
                                                   It is clear, however, that the price of communication access,
                                             especially access to the Internet, is prohibitive for many. Even if
                                             50 percent of potential expenditure on communications access
                                             was harnessed to provide Internet access to the poorest 20 per-
                                             cent in Tanzania, the number of Internet access points that they
                                             could afford per head at present prices would be one for each
                                             25,000 of them, or one every 800 km2 at average population den-
                                             sities. Obviously, this is not a sustainable level of access.
                                                   Despite this, policy changes can be made to increase Inter-
                                             net access to a larger segment of the population. Tanzania's
                                             yearly Internet access costs (including equipment), at US$5,425,
                                             are more than five times the South African yearly Internet ac-
                                             cess costs of US$793. If Tanzania were to bring down the costs
                                             of Internet access to South African levels, potential Internet con-
                                             nectivity in the country would skyrocket. At a rate of 50 percent
                                             of potential communications expenditure being used for Inter-
                                             net access, average net density per 100 people would rise from
                                             0.01to0.07 (or one per 10,000 to one per 1,500). At average popu-
                                             lation density, this suggests that the maximum walk to the near-
                                             est Internet access point would drop from about three hours long
                                             to around one hour (10.5km to 3.9km).
                                             The primary reason for cheaper Internet service provision in
                                             South Africa is cheaper access to leased lines and the Internet
                                             backbone. South Africa Telkom has been able to afford this
                                             cheaper backbone access in part through rate rebalancing be-
                                             tween value added services and basic services. While greater
                                             efficiency undoubtedly plays a large role, it is also clear that
                                             South Africa's basic provision of telephone services is more ex-
                                             pensive than Tanzania's (a yearly cost of US$178.2, as compared
                                             to US$57.33). Perhaps, then, it is fairer to take the whole bundle
                                             of South African costs and apply them to Tanzania. As before,
                                             we see far higher Internet access (although a little lower than

72
the SA Internet prices, because of the extra telephone charges).
Yet, potential teledensity drops from 1.06 in the base case to 0.34
in the South African prices model. While overstating the case,
this raises an important policy issue. If the costs of Internet ser-
vice provision are reduced by lowering the costs of broadband
access, this will reduce a source of cross-subsidy for basic tele-
phone provision. In an environment of inefficiencies in public
telephone monopolies, where demand cannot be met for basic
telephone provision anyway, it should be possible to both re-
duce the costs ofinternational connectivity for Internet service
providers and continue provision of basic telephone services at
reasonably low cost. However, there might be at least short term
costs in terms of basic telephone service provision.

Annex Six:
the Internet Cost-Benefit Model


The first two pages of the model list the data required to esti-
mate the effects of Internet penetration on users, ISPs and tele-
communications companies (C5-C65 and E71 to E83). Much of
the data required is self-explanatory, but a few points should be
made, and information on sources given.

Phone charges

The cost of a three-minute call has been used for the sake of
convenience. It is the rate published by the ITU. When used as a
basis for calculating the cost of a 30-minute or longer call (which
is the more likely length of a connection to the Internet), it is
obviously going to produce inaccuracies, usually overpricing the
cost of a call of that length. In Ghana, for example, the price of a
three-minute local call is 200 cedis, the price of a 30-minute lo-
cal call is only 1,400 cedis.
     The cost of a regional call will have to be an average, if there
are many different regional call rates. Table A6.1 provides ap-
proximations from available data. The cost of an international
call would preferably be weighted based on international call
destinations. Here, we have taken estimates from available data.
We have chosen the U.K. or the U.S. accounting rates to act as
an estimate for the average accounting rate charged and received
by the African telecommunications company.

                                              Usage statistics

                                      In South Africa, the number of users is estimated at 700,000, while
                                      Zimbabwe is estimated to have 10,000 users. Information from
                                      UEM in Mozambique provides an estimate of approximately
                                      2,000 dial-up links for UEM and a total of 750 dial-up links for
                                      the other two ISPs. Because many dial-up links are accessed by
                                      more than one user, the total user-base in the country is esti-
                                      mated at 5,000 to 6,000 (up from zero in 1995). Estimates for
                                      Ghana are around 5,000 users (up from 60 in 1995). Ethiopia has
                                      approximately 1,600 users. In order to be consistent, however,

    The average user statistics ask for the average number of
    email sent and received. Looking at data from the CABECA          0-10                                 73
    survey for Uganda and Ethiopia, it is possible to estimate        11-20                                32
    the average number of email sent by each user. The data           21-30                                27

                                                                      51-60                                5
          The data suggest that users send somewhat more email
                                                                      60+                                  4
    than they receive, and (on average) send over one email a
    day. There are problems of selection bias with this data,
    however (it is likely to have excluded those with an ac-
    count which they do not use). CABECA also asked for node data
    on email usage which is likely to be more reliable. The two tables,
    A6.4 and A6.5, enumerate the number of outgoing email per
    subscriber from the node.
          The number of email sent over a month for all subscribers,
    suggests an average of 20 email per month, or about one each
    business day - a fair estimate for present African usage levels.
    Annually, this might amount to 240 email. As the number of in-
    coming email appears to be lower, we might estimate this at
    about 200. The average length of email in Mozambique can be
    estimated at about three and a half pages. 1
          Next, the model asks for the percentage of these email that
    are replacing telephone calls and faxes, excluding "new" email
    traffic. "New" email consists of email that contain information
    which otherwise would not have been sent by fax or phone. It is
    assumed that much email traffic will be new, because of the very
    low marginal cost of sending an email. However, empirical evi-
    dence suggests that there is also substitution occurring. In all of
    the countries of the CABECA survey, respondents reported
    that email had saved money on their communications bud-
    gets. The CABECA study in Uganda reveals that the method          Table A6.5

    1      This estimate is, admittedly, back of the envelope. UEM estimated
    that 60 percent of their outgoing traffic was emails. For the month of
    February, this amounted to 2.037 mb of emails. UEM has an estimated
    2,000 users, who send approximately one email per day, or a total of       <30                          143
    40,000 emails per month. The average length of an email is then 50.93      30-61                        16
    kb, or about three and a half pages. Senegal's average email length is     61-122                       20

    estimated the average length at just five kb, or under half a page.

                                             source of reductions in communication budgets brought on by
                                             email (also mentioned were savings on publications, courier and
                                             postal fees and travel). It is fair to assume, then, that 35 percent
                                             of email traffic is substituting for either phone or fax.
                                                   World wide, fax is estimated to account for 40 percent of
                                             international phone traffic. This is because fax is considered a
                                             more efficient means of communication, transferring informa-
                                             tion five times faster than voicer. Given that email is also a sub-
                                             stitute for fax, estimates from the CABECA study suggest that
                                             about 25 percent of email traffic is substituting for faxes and 10
                                             percent for voice calls. The remaining 65 percent substitutes for
                                             other forms of communication (primarily post) or is new traffic.
                                                   The statistics also ask for the destination of outgoing email.
                                             In a user survey conducted in Uganda during the CABECA study,
                                             80 percent of respondents had not yet used email for local ex-
                                             change of information, but had done so to communicate with
                                             partners abroad. Eighty-two percent of Ethiopian users said that
                                             less than 10 percent of email traffic they sent stayed in-country,
                                             although in the more Internet-dense country of Zambia the fig-
                                             ure was 26 percent. The CABECA study suggests that approxi-
                                             mately 56 percent of email from Uganda have destinations
                                             outside the continent, 27 percent have destinations in Africa but
                                             not within the country, and only 17 percent are for recipients
                                             within Uganda. Given that the great majority of users in Africa
                                             appear to reside in capital cities, this implies that the percent-
                                             age of email with a different region in the same country is very
                                             low indeed.
                                                   All of the above lead to the assumption that, per subscriber,
                                             email replaces about 68.9 minutes a year of outgoing interna-
                                             tional telephone calls (voice and fax), 4.1 minutes of regional
                                             calls, 12.2 minutes of local calls and 57.4 minutes per year of
                                             incoming international calls.

                                             PTT charges to ISPs

                                             We already know that licensing costs are a significant percent-
                                             age of revenues for ISPs in some countries. Another major charge
                                             is the cost of leased line or VSAT connection to the Internet. The
                                             yearly charge is the portion paid to the PTT (any portion paid to
                                             foreign telephone companies or other providers should be listed
                                             below at C63). In Mozambique, the PTT charges US$250 a month
                                             for a 64 kbs leased line to a satellite connection provided by the
                                             Leland initiative. Leland charges US$2,000 a month for a con-
                                             nection from there to the U.S. Internet backbone (this would be
                                             covered by "Internet Backbone connection" charges, C64, with
                                             no separate foreign telco charge for 64 kb VSAT /LL, line C61).
                                             The major Internet provider, the UEM, pays US$4,982 a month
                                             to Transtel, a South African company, for a leased line to South

Africa's Internet backbone plus a usage-based charge to UNINET
for access. They are willing to pay this premium for a more reli-
able service. Their costs will fall, however, if they are able to
negotiate a ~iirect connection to the U.S. provided by Lyman
Brothers for US$3,000 a month for 128 kbs. This suggests the
advances that scale, technology and competition can make in
cutting costs and increasing reliability for the Internet.
     On the spreadsheet, not all points to enter information are
necessarily relevant in all cases. In Mozambique, for example,
payments to the PTT (C55) cover only the local leased line. For
the international connection portion, the Leland Initiative link
covers all costs. The charge by Leland includes Internet back-
bone access, and so there is only one lump sum to count (thus
the zero charge for backbone access). Data for setup costs in-
clude leased line setup (C61), so, again, this is not counted as a
separate charge. If the local telecommunications company is not
providing the leased line service, as in Ghana, the cost to it of
provision (C55) should be zero.

PTT details

Estimations of the cost of a main line in Africa vary greatly be-
tween countries. The ITU has found that costs per line vary be-
tween US$1,000 and US$8,000 per subscriber line, with an
average of around US$4,250. This compares to a world average
cost of US$1,500. It should be pointed out that this high cost
will largely be the result of two factors: inefficiencies in African
telecommunications companies and difficulties due to subscriber
density and geography. A recent World Bank study has estimated
a reasonable capital cost per line of rural telephones to be
US$5,000 in Kenya, US$6,000 in Zimbabwe and US$8,000 in
Uganda. Fifty-nine percent, 51 percent and 71 percent of tele-
phones are in the largest cities in these countries, however. There-
fore, the average cost of a line should be much lower. Nonetheless,
in Mozambique, the average cost of a main line has been esti-
mated at US$4,500 (estimates for South Africa are closer to
US$1,000). The recurrent costs of a telephone line are estimated
at about US$600 for South Africa. The cost of installing a second
line is - at least on more modern lines - considerably below
that of installing the first. For Mozambique, it may be assumed
as one-sixth of the cost, or US$500. According to a World bank
study in Tanzania, exchange equipment amounted to about 25
percent of the cost of a line, suggesting a cost in Mozambique of
about US$1,125.
      The cost of providing the satellite and/ or leased line has to
be calculated on a yearly basis. The cost of leased line provision
to the PTT is likely to be significantly below the rates which it
charges. Mozambique is charging US$250 per month for local
                                                                       81

                                             vision. For example, last mile costs will be little different from
                                             those of telephone connections. A 1.2 meter ground station with
                                             64 kbs capacity costs US$10,000. Renting space on a satellite and
                                             a hub station costs about US$1,750 per month. Mike Jensen esti-
                                             mates a monthly cost of operating a 64 kbs VSAT at about
                                             US$4,000 to US$5,000 (of which about US$2,000 would go to the
                                             satellite company and hub station).
                                                  There are large economies of scale to international commu-

                                             This suggests that PTTs should be able to provide one half of a ,
                                             64 kbs satellite circuit at a cost to them of US$30,000 a year, with

                                             operation. A small sized ISP is estimated to require a US$12,835
                                             administrative computer with US$1,000 of associated costs
                                             (USAID estimates total computer costs for a larger system at
                                             US$55,000). Other setup costs are estimated at US$17,800. Con-
                                             nection charges to the Internet are mentioned above. Recurrent
                                             salary and maintenance are estimated by USAID to be US$21,000,
                                             and by Ruth to be US$11,000 for a smaller operation.

                                             Assumptions

                                             The first assumption is about the number of subscribers to each
                                             computer terminal. In the first part of the model, the assump-
                                             tion is that each user has his or her own computer. In the second
                                             part of the model, it is assumed that subscribers share comput-
                                             ers. Evidence from the CABECA study suggests between four to
                                             eight users per terminal (or around two to four subscribers). This
                                             reduces user cost of access to the Internet. Another assumption
                                             considers the amount of time it takes to access an email account
                                             (as opposed to using the Web). A three-minute link up every
                                             business day could theoretically transmit 91,000 pages of infor-
                                             mation each year. Thus, the model assumes that the length of
                                             time spent accessing email is determined not by the amount of
                                             data transferred, but by the number of times during the day the
                                             email account is accessed, and the amount of time taken each
                                             time to do so. The CABECA survey suggests that the average
                                             African user accesses his or her account at least once a day. The
                                             time taken will be brief; here we have assumed three minutes.

       As for the number of subscribers who are likely to obtain a
second line dedicated to web access (measured in terms of ter-
minals), in the U.S., this figure is as high as 40 percent of Inter-
net users. In Africa, with lower incomes and long waiting times
for installation, and between four to eight users per terminal,
this figure is likely to be far lower. We assume here that five
percent of subscribers manage to obtain a second line for Inter-
net access.
       It is assumed that an increased number of subscribers will
increase the number of telephone lines, computers, size of leased
line/VSAT connections and user support personnel required by
the ISP. UEM has five technicians working for an estimated 5,000
users. In Uganda, the charge to users for training is US$8 ini-
tially with access to free courses every week. This suggests an
annual per subscriber cost of perhaps US$10 to cover expenses.
In the U.S., ISPs tend to have one phone line for 10 to 15 sub-
scribers. NCS in Ghana has 100 dial-in lines for 2,500 subscrib-
ers. Here we have assumed one phone line for every 20
subscribers. USAID estimates suggest that a new computer will
be needed for 1,000 subscribers. UEM is just now considering
upgrading to a 128kbs link, at a level of approximately 2,000
subscribers, suggesting that at the moment 64kbs in Africa can
provide the minimally acceptable level of access for around 3,000
users. As the comfortable capacity of a 64kbs line is only about
10 active Internet users at any one time (and figures for
Mozambique already suggest that the average number of sub-
scribers on line at any one time must be about 15), providing
reasonably fast access even at this low level of usage will re-
quire greater bandwidth - perhaps 64kbs per 1,000 users.
       It is also assumed that new web subscribers put more pres-
sti.re on the telephone network, demanding extra switches. This
is a matter of some debate in the U.S.: we have high and low
estimates (0.1 and O) for the number of new switches required
per subscriber, and the figure is likely to be toward the low end
in Africa because of low levels of usage. Here we assume 0.01.
      Finally, there are assumptions about the real cost of capital
for telecommunications companies, ISPs and users, and depre-
ciation rates for telecommunications equipment, computers and
other items. In order to provide figures on savings and costs per
year which include capital expenditures and depreciation rates,
all capital expenditures and one-off payments on the debit side
and all one-off receipts on the credit side have been converted
into yearly costs using the formulae for perpetuities and annu-
ities. YRC (yearly return to capital) rates equal the cost of capi-
tal for goods with long lives (E82 to E83) and the annuitized
cost of capital for goods with shorter lives (calculated E84 to
E86)). The model assumes that telecommunications companies
have access to cheaper capital than ISPs and Internet users. It

                                                                       83

                                             also assumes differing replacement rates for telecommunica-
                                             tions, computer and other equipment. Based in part on USAID
                                             data, we have estimated a four-year replacement period for com-
                                             puter equipment and 10 years for other items, with a real cost of
                                             capital at 10 percent for telecommunications companies and 20
                                             percent for· ISPs (in nominal terms, NCS Ghana pays 25 to 45
                                             percent per year).

                                             Equations for the model

                                             Subscriber savings and telco revenues per page

                                             The first section of the model estimates the costs to the subscriber
                                             and revenue streams to the telephone company based on send-
                                             ing a number of pages of information by voice, fax, locally con-
                                             nected email and regionally connected email. Across the top of
                                             the section are the number of pages sent locally (G7 to J7), re-
                                             gionally (L7 to N7) and internationally (H26 to J26), down the
                                             side the different methods of sending information, and the rev-
                                             enues received from the user by the PTT. In the case of interna-
                                             tional communication, there is a further section (F42 to J47) on
                                             the amount of revenue received by the PTT from overseas users
                                             contacting the home user utilizing different forms of communi-
                                             cation (any telephone-based communication that is received from
                                             abroad is subject to accounting-rate charges by the home PTT).
                                                  The local section includes the fixed costs of operating dif-
                                             ferent communications systems (ignoring the rental and instal-
                                             lation charges for a telephone line, assumed already there), along
                                             with the extra costs associated with local calling charges. Under
                                             the 0 Pages sent/yr column (G9 to G20), the fixed costs of the
                                             various communications methods are calculated. For voice com-
                                             munication (G9), the additional fixed cost (above the rental and
                                             installation charges of the 'phone) is zero. For the fax (GlO), the
                                             additional cost per year (over the price of a basic phone connec-
                                             tion) is the cost of a fax spread over its depreciation period. For
                                             email (Gll and G12), the additional cost per year is the
                                             annuitized or perpetuitized sum of connection fees and com-
                                             puter and modem costs and the yearly web connection charge.
                                             Given that computers are useful for far more than the Internet,
                                             this can be argued to over-estimate the equipment costs that
                                             should be associated with user access to the Internet alone.
                                                  The additional cost per local page sent by phone (HlO to
                                             J10) is the fixed cost plus the number of pages sent multiplied
                                             by the time taken to 'speak' one page in turn multiplied by the
                                             unit cost of calling time. The additional cost per local page sent
                                             by fax (Hll to Jll) is the number of pages sent multiplied by the
                                             time taken to fax them in turn multiplied by the unit cost of
                                             calling time. The additional cost per local page sent by local email
84
 (H12 to Jl2) is fixed. It is the local phone call cost of the daily
 connection time times the number of business days in a year
 (260). The additional cost per local page sent by regional email
 (i.e. the user has to make a regional call to access his email) is
 calculated in the same way (H13 to Jl3), but substituting the
 cost of a regional call for the cost of a local call in the daily con-
 nection time.
       There is no additional cost to users for sending email to
 regional or international recipients (L19 to N20 and H31 to J32).
 For,voice and fax, the extra cost is calculated as above. For voice
 (L17 to N17 and H29 to J29), then, this is number of pages mul-
 tiplied by time taken to speak a page multiplied by the unit cost
 of a regional or international call. For fax (L18 to N18 and H30
 to J30), this is number of pages multiplied by time taken to speak
 (fax) a page multiplied by the unit cost of a regional or interna-
 tional call.
       The phone company receives no revenue from fixed costs
 of communication (beyond the installation and rental of the
 phone line, which is excluded from the calculation). Revenue
 from local (G17 to J17) and regional (L17 to M17) voice calls is
 based purely on the length of connection time and the charges
 for calls made. This is the same with local (G18 to J18) and re-
 gional (L18 to ¥18) faxes.
       In the case of international calls, the picture is complicated
 a little by accounting charges. The phone company has to pass
 on half of the accounting rate value of the call to the telco that
 provides the other half of the circuit. For voice (H29 to J29)and
 fax (H30 to J30), then, the calculation is the time taken to speak
 (fax) the number of pages multiplied by the unit cost of the call
 minus the time taken to speak (fax) the number of pages multi-
 plied by half of the accounting rate paid to the foreign telecom-
 munications company.
       The telecommunications company also receives accounting
 rate payments from foreign telecommunications companies
 originating incoming voice and fax communication with the
  home user. For voice (H45 to J45) and fax (H46 to J46), this
  amounts to the time taken to speak (send) the number of pages
  multiplied by one half of the accounting rate.
        For email, the amount that the telecommunications com-
  pany receives from the user is fixed, as we saw above. For local
  access email (H12 to J12), and regional access email (H13 to Jl3),
· the receipts equal the by minute cost of the call multiplied by
  the time taken each day to access email multiplied by the num-
  ber of business days in a year (260). This is the only incremental
  cost of email, whatever the destination or source of communi-
  cation. Therefore, the extra costs associated with regional or in-
  ternational emailing is zero (L19 to N20, H38 to J39 and H37 to
  J37).

Economic Toolkit for African Policy Makers
                                             Full impact on telecommunications companies,
                                             ISPs and subscribers

                                             The second part of the model looks at the detailed effects on
                                             telecommunications and ISP revenue and user costs and sav-
                                             ings of some fixed level of Internet usage. The ISP is assumed to
                                             be a monopoly provider, to simplify the model. This is a clear
                                             over-simplification. Already, much of Africa has multiple Inter-
                                             net service providers. The effect on the model of this simplifica-
                                             tion is to overestimate ISP profits and reduce telecommunications
                                             company revenue from ISPs (because of multiple leased lines,
                                             more phone lines and more licenses). This will also slightly over-
                                             estimate telecommunications company revenue from users, be-
                                             cause it is likely that, with more ISPs, a larger percentage of users
                                             can make a local call to connect to the Internet.
                                                   The section is divided in two. On the left (F49 to G93) is a
                                             static illustration of revenue gains and losses for Telecommuni-
                                             cations companies and ISPs and summed costs and savings for
                                             users, based on the number of Internet users entered at C24
                                             ("number of Internet users"). The second section is a model of
                                             the potential impact of the Internet on ISPs, telecommunications
                                             companies and users given different numbers of Internet users.

                                             Telecommunications company revenue gained

                                             Starting on the left, the first calculation is of telecommunica-
                                             tions revenue gained from the present number of Internet users.
                                             Telecommunications companies will gain revenue from second
                                             Internet user lines. This will be based on the number of new
                                             lines (number of users multiplied the percentage who are esti-
                                             mated to take second lines) multiplied by the revenue (rental
                                             and installation) that these lines provide (G51).
                                                  Telecommunications companies will also receive revenues
                                             from expanded Internet traffic. The (smaller) part of this will
                                             come from users accessing email. As above, this is assumed to
                                             be a fixed length call every day. The first part of the equation
                                             calculates the cost of calls for accessing email for local and then
                                             regional users based on the number of users, the amount of time
                                             taken to access email, the number of business days and the cost
                                             of a local (regional) call of the duration inputted in E71 ("Email
                                             is accessed every business day for X minutes"). The second part
                                             of the equation calculates the cost of calls involved in accessing
                                             the web - average number of hours users access the Web (in-
                                             putted in C30), multiplied by the cost of a local (regional) hour-
                                             long call.
                                                   Telecommunications companies are also assumed to make
                                             money from licensing ISPs. As the model assumes a monopoly
                                             provider, this equals the input from C44 ("License"). Telecom-

86
munications companies will also receive revenue from the rental
costs of phone lines into ISPs. This is based on the assumption
of the number of subscribers that can be handled per line (E75)
multiplied by the revenue (rental and installation) that these lines
provide (G55).
      It is assumed that the telecommunications company pro-
vides the ISP's international connection. No matter how many
web subscribers, it is assumed that email alone will not require
the provision of an expanded leased line. The theoretical maxi-
mum data that could be transmitted by a 64 kbps line over one
year is equivalent to 210 million minutes of voice communica-
tions (total outgoing telephone traffic from Mozambique totaled
16.4m minutes in 1995). This suggests that email (without the
web) does not require large capacity (further evidence is that
the NSFNET backbone in the US was only 56kbps as recently as
five years ago). It is the increasing use of the web that will drive
the need for ever-larger international Internet access capacity.
As above, the equation (G55) is based on the assumption of the
number of subscribers that can be handled per 64kbs of VSAT
or leased line connection (E77) multiplied by the charge for that
line. The model assumes a flat fee for each 64kbs of connection
to the backbone by the telecommunications company and for-
eign providers. This is an over-simplification - telecommuni-
cations companies will charge less for a 128kbs connection than
they would for two 64 connections.

Telecommunications company revenue lost

In calculating telecommunications revenue lost, we have as-
sumed that there is no substitution between WWW access and
phone or voice usage, the only substitution is via email. This is
an obvious oversimplification. Accessing websites provides an
alternative way of obtaining data, which might well substitute
for a voice or fax communication to find the information. How-
ever, it is very difficult to estimate what percentage of web us-
age time is substituting for voice or fax, and it is even more
difficult to calculate a "conversion rate" between Web down-
loads and fax or voice. It is, for example, questionable that a
Website that uses frames and moving graphics imparts far more
valuable information than a site created without these features.
The difference in terms of data transfer can be immense, how-
ever. The effect of ignoring Web substitution while fully account-
ing for Web use will be to underestimate the revenue losses on
telecommunications companies of Internet access.
      Looking first at substitution of outgoing international calls
(G60) this equation calculates the amount of international email
traffic that is substituting for international outgoing voice traf-
fic. First, the number of "pages" of email sent internationally in
                                                                       87

                                             place of a telephone call is calculated. This is equal to the sum of
                                             the proportion of email that replace phone calls multiplied by
                                             the proportion of email going to an international destination in
                                             turn multiplied by the average number of email sent per year,
                                             their average length and the number of users. This number of
                                             pages estimate is multiplied by the revenue generated by one
                                             "page" of an international voice call -the cost of a call long
                                             enough to "speak" a page minus the accounting rate payment.
                                                   The international faxes out (G61) calculation follows the
                                             same procedure as above, only substituting the percentage of
                                             information sent by fax for the percentage of information sent
                                             by telephone, and using the number of kb in a three minute fax
                                             (144 kb) for the amount of information in a three minute voice
                                             call. The international calls and faxes in (G62 to G63) calculates
                                             accounting rate losses, assuming that international email com-
                                             munication into a country has the same percentage substitution
                                             rate for fax and voice (which might be an over-simplification).
                                             This calculation is a repeat of the ones above, except that it cal-
                                             culates the accounting rate charges lost by the home telecom-
                                             munications company based on the amount of incoming email.
                                             The amount of incoming email is calculated by subtracting the
                                             average number of email sent locally and regionally from the
                                             average number of email received (each email sent locally or
                                             regionally must be received locally or regionally, so any residual
                                             from this calculation must be email received from abroad).
                                                   The rest of the equations follow the pattern set above, with
                                             the replacement of international data with regional and local
                                             data (C23 to G27 and G35 to G38) and the removal of the ac-

                                             Next, international ISP costs and revenues are calculated (G77).
                                             The first equation calculates equipment costs. This includes num-
                                             ber of computers and the size of the VSAT I leased line connec-
                                             tion required to service the number of users (G76 to G77). The
                                             cost of administrative computers, fixed other computer costs and
                                             setup costs for the VSAT /LL connection (C59-C61) is multiplied
                                             by the yearly return requirement for computer equipment while
                                             other setup costs (assumed fixed) are multiplied by the return
                                             requirement for other equipment.
                                                  Internet and telecom charges (G78) include the cost of the
                                             yearly license fee, the backbone connection, the charge for the
                                             number of phone lines the ISP needs, the home charge for the
                                             VSAT or leased line connection required and the foreign coun-
                                             try charge for the VSAT or leased line connection required. Sal-
                                             ary and maintenance charges (G79) includes recurrent costs and
                                             maintenance costs (C65) and a calculation of the cost for user

88
support multiplied by the number of users (E74 and C24).

User costs, savings

User costs and savings are calculated for the total user base.
Equipment costs (G87) amount to the yearly return cost value of
the amount spent on modems and computers. Internet access
(G88) paid to ISPs is thus the annualized cost of initial connec-
tion multiplied by the yearly fee. The charge for the "fixed costs"
of web access and accessing email (G89) include the installation
and rental of second lines and the calculation of regional and
local call charges for 260 days of email access, as above, multi-
plied by the number of users. Web telephone charges (G90)
amount to the cost of a local/ regional three minute call multi-
plied by twenty (to give an approximate cost of an hour-long
call) multiplied by the number of hours on line, calculated for
local and then regional users. For the user, telephone savings
equal the revenue lost to the telecommunications company ex-
cluding the calculations made for accounting charges (G60 to
G61 minus the accounting rate adjustment and G64 to G67).
      The final part of the model calculates hypothetical cost and
revenue streams from expanded Internet access (J51 to N75).
These calculations are largely based on those above. We have
assumed that future users will utilize the Internet as much as
the first users on whom email substitution rates and Web access
rates are based. Given that we would expect the first Internet
users to be those with the most to gain in communications sav-
ings and Web access, this is an oversimplification. Later users
will be those who make fewer international calls and have less
interest in accessing the Web. These estimates exaggerate ISP
equipment needs, telecom income losses from substitution and
new equipment needs, telecom gains from time spent on the Web
and user costs and benefits. Given the fixed costs of email, this
will mean that user benefits from substitution are overestimated.
As ISP revenues are (in this model) independent of usage, their
profits will be higher. The negative effect of email substitution
will be lower for telecommunications companies. The revenues
from web surfing will be somewhat lower as will the costs of
providing new equipment. Under usual circumstances, this sug-
gests that the model will overestimate the negative effects of an
expanded Internet on telecommunications companies.

                                             connection to the Internet backbone. As more users are added,
                                             costs go up (L53 to N53). New subscribers require more user
                                             support, more telephones, more computers and a larger VSAT /
                                             LL connection. ISP revenues (K54 to N54), as above, are a fixed
                                             connection fee and a fixed yearly fee multiplied by the number

                                             Telecommunications company income, revenue

                                             The telecommunications company revenue calculation (K62 to
                                             N62) is made as above ((G51 to G55), taking account of new
                                             phone lines installed at the ISP and by users, ISP licenses, VSAT I
                                             LL charges and user telephone call charges. The cost to telecom-
                                             munications companies (K63 to N63) is based on a new formula
                                             (above, we only calculated revenues). The calculation is based
                                             on the cost of installing and operating the telecommunications
                                             equipment involved in servicing ISPs and user. These costs in
                                             turn are: the cost of running the VSAT or leased line, the initial
                                             user line into the ISP, the cost of subsequent lines into the ISP
                                             and out of the users who order a second line, the cost of ex-
                                             panding VSAT connections or leased line connections and the

                                             the longer calls made to access the Internet. The total of present
                                             actual phone company revenue lost from users switching to
                                             email (K65 to N65) calculated is scaled up from the earlier rev-

                                             straight-line estimate of revenue lost to email substitution. This
                                             is an over-simplification - as the number of email users in the
                                             country increases, the percentage of email with a local destina-
                                             tion will increase. A straight-line estimate will thus over-esti-
                                             mate the scale of substitution losses to telecommunications
                                             companies.

Calculations

Assumptions

E82-83: To calculate the yearly return to capital required to pay
the cost of capital (for goods for which do not need to be re-
placed) and depreciation (for goods that will have to be re-
placed), the following equations were used: The formula for a
perpetuity is PV= C/ r, where PV is the present value, C the yearly
cash payment and r the real cost of capital. The yearly cash pay-
ment required to cover a present value expenditure is C= PV*r.
For one off payments for goods which have a very long life (for
example, telephone connection for the recipient) or one-off re-
ceipts (for example, the payment for initial telephone connec-
tion for the telephone company), this formula was used to
calculate the effective yearly cash cost or income of the present
payment or receipt. Thus, the YRC (yearly return to capital) rate
is equal to r, the cost of capital.
      E84 to E86: The formula for an annuity is PV= C[l Ir -1 I r(l
+ r)At], where PV is the present value, C the yearly cash pay-
ment, r the real cost of capital and t the number of years over
which the annuity is paid. The yearly cash payment required to
cover a present value expenditure for a good that will need to
be replaced int years is C= PV /[1/r - 1/r(l + r)At]. For one-off
purchases of goods that have a short life (for instance, comput-
ers), this formula was used to calculate the effective yearly cash
cost or income of the present purchase. Thus, the YRC (yearly
return to capital) rate is equal to [1 I cost of capital - 1 /(cost of
capital* ((1 + cost of capital) I\ number of years depreciation))]
