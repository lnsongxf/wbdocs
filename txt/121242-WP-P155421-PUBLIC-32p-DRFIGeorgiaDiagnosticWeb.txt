Preface
This Disaster Risk Financing Country Note is the first activity
of the World Bank’s support to the Government of Georgia on
financial protection against natural disasters. It takes stock of
existing mechanisms and instruments used to finance disaster
response in Georgia and lays the foundation for the development
of a comprehensive disaster risk financing strategy.


Consultations on the findings of this analysis and on the options
for next steps will be held in Tbilisi for relevant stakeholders from
the government.


This note was developed jointly by the World Bank’s Disaster Risk
Management Team for the Europe and Central Asia Region and the
Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) Program.The note
builds on the operational framework for Disaster Risk Finance,
which was developed by DRFIP drawing on collaboration with over
60 countries in strengthening their financial resilience to disasters
and climate risks.

The remainder of this report is organized as follows:
Chapter 2 summarizes the economic impacts of recent
disasters. Chapter 3 reviews the current institutional and
legal framework for disaster risk management and financing.
Chapter 4 gives an overview of the public financial
management of disasters in Georgia, including ex ante
and ex post disaster risk financing and insurance (DRFI)
instruments currently in use for budget mobilization, and
it looks at the Tbilisi floods of 2015 in some detail. The
chapter concludes with a summary of financial resources
available and a look at the potential resource gaps. Possible
options for a disaster risk financing strategy are given in the
final chapter.

In practice, when a natural disaster occurs, the affected
areas is visited by a commission made up of officials from
the municipality’s sectoral departments (i.e., agriculture,
construction, health), the line ministry, and the Emergency
Management Agency. Using current market prices, the
commission calculates an estimation of the losses. The
local self-government requests support from the national
government only if needed funds are higher than those
available in the local contingency reserve. The required
funding can be provided from the reserve funds of the
government or president, from the Fund for the Projects
Implemented in the Regions of Georgia (RegFund), or from
line ministry budgets, depending on the character of damage
sustained. Local reserve funds serve as a primary source
of liquidity for financing of response activities, given that
they can be mobilized immediately and that obtaining any
additional financing (via special transfers) from the national
level requires some time.

Georgia will likely continue to look to donor support in
the event of a major catastrophe. But it cannot expect
donor assistance in response to less severe but frequently
recurring events. In any case, donor financing is highly
unpredictable and does not allow the government to plan
financing for a fast disaster response. In addition, disaster

Recommendation 1: Establish policy priorities for DRFI

strategy. Furthermore, local governments could consider
preparing action plans for disaster risk finance, based on the
national DRFI policy documents.
