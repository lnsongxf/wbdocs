EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
    The mapping of the export supply chain of greenhouse crops1 has been im-
plemented within the framework of the IFC Armenia Investment Climate Reform
Project of the World Bank Group. The project aims to contribute to improving the
country’s investment climate and thereby to attract investments into branches of its
economy. One of the project’s aspects is to increase the investment attractiveness
of several agribusiness branches and to promote the export and competitiveness
of selected agricultural products by identifying issues in export supply chains and
targeting interventions directed at addressing those issues. The RA Ministry of
Economic Development and Investments has given priority to greenhouse crop
production, because of its great potential for export.
   The mapping of the export supply chain of greenhouse crops aims to:
1.	 Identify issues present in the greenhouse crop export supply chain, including
    market imperfections and, legal and regulatory obstacles;
2.	 Develop recommendations to resolve the problems or challenges so identified,
    to improve the business and investment environment and to increase produc-
    tivity and product competitiveness;
3.	 Contribute to enhancing the investment attractiveness of the greenhouse crop
    production sector.
   The mapping focuses on both government regulations and policy in the agri-
business supply chain as well as market imperfections and their impact on the
supply chain operation.
    For the mapping, the supply chain and its effectiveness are viewed from a busi-
ness perspective (including primary producers, exporters, retailers and wholesalers,
processors, transporters, and other relevant businesses involved in the supply chain).
In order to compile the necessary information, meetings and discussions were held
with supply chain participants, including public and private stakeholders. Meet-
ings were also held with international donor organizations active in the Armenian
agribusiness sector in an effort to learn from their valuable experiences and views.2
 The review used local and international information sources, official statistical
data, and local and international reviews and analytical materials pertaining to
greenhouse crop production.3


1	 In Armenia, two terms are used for greenhouse farms “ջերմոց” (greenhouse) and
   “ջերմատուն” (hothouse) or «ջերմատնային տնտեսություն» (greenhouse enter-
   prise or farm). The term “Ջերմոց” (greenhouse) refers to structures or farms that
   lack heating, while “ջերմատուն” (hothouse) refers to structures that are heated. In
   this paper, for the sake of brevity, the common “greenhouse” term is used to designate
   both notions.
2	 The meetings took place between December 2015 and July 2016.
3	 The list of used materials and sources is presented in Annex 3.

A.	MAIN ISSUES
   Greenhouse crop production in Armenia is an attractive for investors sector
with high growth potential in both production and export. It has demonstrated
a high growth rate and marked profitability, particularly during the recent four
years, when the total area of greenhouse farms increased by nearly 2.5 times, from
510 hectares in 2011 to 1220 hectares (2016). At the same time, the technological
sophistication of greenhouse farms has rapidly increased. Most newly built and
under-construction large greenhouses are equipped with and deploy modern tech-
nologies.
   Armenian greenhouse enterprises produce and export vegetables (tomato and
cucumber), mushrooms, berries (strawberry), and flowers (roses, gerberas, and
carnations). The main export destinations are markets in Russia and other CIS
countries.
    Promotion of greenhouse crop production and export is important in the
agenda of the Government of Armenia, as reflected in a number of its strategic
documents and programs aimed at sustainable development and enhancing inter-
national competitiveness of the sector (see “Government Programs and Policy”
section). To promote investments, the government exempted from VAT the import
of greenhouse complexes and of a number of resources used in greenhouse crop
production.
    Nevertheless, a number of challenges along the sector’s development path face
both the government and the private business entities. These are briefly introduced
below. It is important to note that there are differences between the challenges and
opportunities faced by small and medium greenhouse farms on the one hand, and
large greenhouse enterprises on the other hand. To simplify, the differences (if any)
due to sizes of greenhouses are indicated under each discussed issue, instead of
presenting them in separate sections.

Pre-production phase
1.	 Crops, varieties, and the quality of seeds and saplings (planting material):
    From the perspective of enhancing productivity and competitiveness, the selec-
    tion of high quality and appropriate crop varieties, as well as the use of qual-
    ity seeds and planting material are important. Small and medium greenhouse
    farms in Armenia lack sufficient knowledge in selection of high-quality crop
    varieties and seeds, as well as in their appropriate use.
   Furthermore, the selection of crop varieties responding to requirements of do-
   mestic and especially foreign markets is very important for both small and
   medium and large greenhouse farms. Greenhouse farmers can and need to in-
   troduce high-value crops enjoying demand in internal and external markets, in
   addition to tomatoes and cucumbers - traditionally produced main greenhouse
   crops in Armenia. Armenian producers face difficulties achieving competitive-

                                         2
   ness of tomatoes and cucumbers in domestic and international markets, espe-
   cially during the heating season.
2.	 Import procedures: Exemption of the import of greenhouse complexes from
    VAT since the beginning of 2015 is a positive development that will contribute
    to steering investments into the greenhouse sector. Reduction of the customs
    duty (from 10 percent to 5 percent) for planting material of flowers is antici-
    pated within the framework of Armenia’s accession to the Eurasian Economic
    Union (EEU). However, there are problematic issues in relation to customs and
    technical (phytosanitary) control procedures for imports, which do not allow
    businesses to utilize effectively the potential benefits of these exemptions. Due
    to these issues businesses incur extra costs and waste of time. This increases the
    market prices of those products and hinders attraction of investments into the
    sector. Particular problems include:
     Ambiguities and complexity of customs classification and formalities in re-
         lation to greenhouse complexes and systems and equipment (including their
         fittings and spare parts) used in greenhouse complexes;
     Complexity of customs formalities when importing greenhouse complexes
         in several batches;
     Problems associated with classification of drip irrigation systems;
     Levy of the customs duty and VAT at the border on import of saplings and
         seedlings;
     Increase of customs duty (tariff) rates in the framework of the EEU: In the
         framework of Armenia’s membership in the EEU, it is anticipated (after 3-5
         years transition period) to increase customs duty rates for import of a num-
         ber of important greenhouse inputs (for instance, greenhouses, vegetable
         seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides). In the medium- and long-term perspec-
         tives, this may lead to higher market prices of those products.
3.	 Selection of greenhouse structures: Most greenhouses in Armenia, especially
    small and medium ones, are equipped with outdated technologies; this re-
    sults in low productivity and high energy losses. With the increasing number
    of high-technology greenhouses introduced during the recent years, it is very
    important to make investments in such advanced greenhouses, which best fit
    the local conditions in Armenia. For example, according to expert opinion,
    greenhouses covered with high-quality plastic film (double-layer) may be more
    effective in Armenia than glass greenhouses. Note that plastic greenhouses re-
    quire at least 20–30 percent less investment than glass greenhouses. Current-
    ly, leading global greenhouse manufacturers offer high-technology plastic film
    covers both for small- and medium-size greenhouses.
4.	 Cadastral classification of greenhouse structures: Economic entities men-
    tion uncertainties about provisions related to classification of greenhouse
    structures. As a result, greenhouse farms face problems associated with tax


                                          3
   procedures, obtaining loans (in respect of collateral) and other dimensions of
   business operation.
5.	 Availability and accessibility of finance: Long-term loans (at least 4–7 years)
    are necessary for the establishment and operation of high-technology green-
    houses. In Armenia, businesses face difficulties in accessing long-term loans.
    The difficulty of accessing loans, high interest rates, and inflexible loan terms
    create serious impediments to attracting investments. Other financial resourc-
    es — such as leasing, funding of projects, credit lines, and so forth — also
    are inaccessible, This problem occurs both in small and medium and in large
    greenhouse enterprises.

Production phase
6.	 Energy efficiency issues: In Armenia, the majority of greenhouses of all sizes
    use natural gas for heating. In the previous four years, the increase of the nat-
    ural gas price has led to increased production costs of greenhouse farms and
    hence has weakened their price competitiveness. The recent reduction of the gas
    price in 2016 is expected to benefit greenhouse crop producers in term of cost
    reduction. Administrative problems in the gas supply and collection of charges
    (relationships between HayRusGazArd and economic entities) cause unneces-
    sary costs and encumbrances, including:
     Claim and collection of one-month advance payment in the beginning
        (sometimes also during) of the heating season, by HayRusGazArd;
     Gas supply cut off by HayRusGazArd (due to non-payment for gas supply),
        causing freezing and damage of harvest;
     Economic entities also mention poor quality of supplied gas (pressure, den-
        sity, composition), which increases the volume and thus cost of gas required
        for heating.
7.	 Import procedures: Procedures for the import of fertilizers and pesticides (in-
    secticides, fungicides, others) are complicated and will become even more com-
    plicated after Armenia’s accession into EEU membership; time is wasted and
    additional costs are incurred, ultimately increasing the existing market prices
    of goods. In particular:
     the technical control procedure for import of fertilizers and pesticides is
       complicated and includes repeated provision of permission (license) for
       each batch;
     phytosanitary certification procedure (requiring sampling and laboratory
       testing of each batch).
8.	 Application of fertilizers and pesticides: The frequency of ineffectiveness of
    applied fertilizers and pesticides in Armenia is high, which decreases the pro-
    ductivity (increases costs and decreases the yield). Possible causes of this in-
    clude unawareness of suppliers and users about proper practices of storing

                                         4
   and handling or usage of fertilizers and pesticides, some imperfections of the
   registration procedure of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as unfair competition
   practices in the market leading to import and trading of low quality, expired
   fertilizers and pesticides. This problem is particularly acute in small and medi-
   um greenhouses, though it exists in large greenhouses as well.
9.	 Safety and quality of agricultural products: For increasing product competi-
    tiveness and entering certain markets (in particular, the EU market where strict
    food quality and safety standards apply and, after the transition period, the
    Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) market,), there is a need to enhance produc-
    tivity and to improve product quality and safety indicators. In Armenian green-
    houses, especially in small and medium ones, internationally accepted good
    production and hygiene practices have not yet found widespread application,
    such as Global GAP (Good Agriculture Practice), particularly for greenhouse
    crop production, UNECE marketing standards for fruits and vegetables, fruit
    and vegetable marketing standards and requirements of the EU, and standards
    and requirements of Codex Alimentarius. In large greenhouses, production
    conditions and systems are of incomparably higher quality; however, GAP sys-
    tems have not yet found widespread application there as well. In small and
    medium greenhouse farms, the quality and competitiveness of products suffer
    also due to failure to place proper efforts in selecting effective crop varieties
    and insufficient focus on sorting and packaging of products.
10.	Productivity and production technologies: Armenian producers lag foreign
    competitors in price competitiveness — for example, in winter, tomatoes are
    imported to Armenia from Turkey at a much cheaper price, ousting the lo-
    cal agricultural produce. Nonetheless, in order to increase competitiveness and
    to enter foreign markets, the reduction of costs and the increase of productivity
    have become today’s imperatives. In parallel to increasing the productivity, it
    is critical to pay attention to marketing issues, for ensuring that the increased
    volume of produce has a market. To reduce costs and increase productivity, it is
    necessary to take the following measures:
    For enhancing productivity and quality, and ensuring organization of un-
      interrupted or shortly interrupted year-round production, it is necessary
      to introduce modern high-tech greenhouses and to educate businesses and
      relevant specialists.
    Simplify import procedures to the extent possible (as mentioned above),
      which is important for reduction of price, thereby reducing the costs of
      used raw materials, including seeds and planting materials, fertilizers and
      chemicals, irrigation and other systems and tools.
    Increase the productivity and reduce losses through application of appro-
      priate greenhouse management technologies or practices, for instance,
      through appropriate use of fertilizers and pesticides, accurate evaluation
      and planning of costs and production growth.

                                         5
    With regard to productivity, effective marketing is of high importance too.
       For example, parallel to reduction of costs, the productivity can be increased
       also through selection of crops; that is, select such crops and packages or
       otherwise introduce them in a way as to enable their trading at a high price
       in both internal and external markets.
   The space of sophisticated (particularly large) greenhouses is rapidly expanding
   in Armenia, yet it remains small so far (10 percent of the total space). The pro-
   ductivity is low in small and medium simple greenhouses (10–20 kg/m2), and
   production interruptions throughout a year are long (4–5 months), resulting
   in the decrease of total annual productivity of greenhouse space. Those inter-
   ruptions decrease also the competitiveness of greenhouse crop producers in the
   market, in terms of their inability to ensure uninterrupted supply.
11.	Human capacities: Shortage of specialists may become one of the most influ-
    ential factors limiting the further development of the greenhouse agriculture
    sector, unless it receives proper and prompt attention. This equally refers to
    greenhouses of all sizes. In the greenhouse industry, there is an acute need for
    the following specialists:
    Agronomist,
    Agricultural chemist,
    Hydroponics specialist, and
    Plant protection specialist.
   At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen human capacities for the
   application of GAP and other applicable good practices, systems, or standards.
   From the perspective of human capacity development, it is very important to
   increase the role of the state and make it more effective. At present, the public
   expenditure in agricultural extension (advisory) area is too small to ensure any
   significant outcomes (397.2 million Armenian dram (AMD), or approximately
   USD 831,000 in 2016). Extension services in Armenia are mainly provided by
   Regional Agricultural Support Centers, which need significant enhancement of
   capacities in order to be able to achieve their mission.
12.	Branch associations and cooperatives: Greenhouse Association of Armenia is
    an important organization functioning in the sector. Accelerated development
    of the greenhouse crop production has brought challenges with it. To face those
    challenges, the Greenhouse Association needs further strengthening of its ca-
    pacities; with its current capacities, the association will be unable to fulfill its
    tasks duly.
13.	Availability of cash and access to finance: Scarcity of accessible financial re-
    sources and small number of financial instruments seriously limit the devel-
    opment of greenhouse crop production. Economic entities, especial small and
    medium greenhouses, face problems in terms of ensuring both working capital
    and financing. In addition, a serious portion of other problems associated with

                                           6
   scarcity of financial resources or financing relates to poor financial management
   knowledge and capacities of economic entities. See also paragraph 5 above.

Marketing and export phase
14.	Export markets and products: As mentioned above, for entering new markets
    and enhancing competitiveness in the existing and new markets, the selection
    and packaging or otherwise introducing of appropriate crops is a priority.
    There is a need to invest in high-value crops enjoying demand in internal and
    international markets, based on studies of international markets.
   Focusing on a single market as large as the Russian market is dangerous. Im-
   portant developments occurring in the Russian market prove the hazardous-
   ness of such focus. The competition in the Russian market has drastically inten-
   sified, despite international economic sanctions against Russia and limitations
   applied by Russia lately on imports from Turkey. After lifting international
   economic sanctions against Iran last year, the country’s role in exporting veg-
   etables and fruits to the Russian market will probably grow; prices of Iranian
   vegetables are rather competitive. In parallel, competition from other countries
   intensifies as well. Under the conditions of depreciation of the national cur-
   rency of Russia, financial risks of Armenian exporters grow, and hence, their
   competitive positions weaken.
   Considering the limitation and saturation of the Armenian internal market of
   vegetables and flowers, in the present stage of the greenhouse sector develop-
   ment, prior to expansion of greenhouses, it is important to pay attention to
   ensuring export markets, as well as to crops and varieties that meet the existing
   demands of those markets.
15.	Human capacities: For further development of the sector, there is a need to
    strengthen the knowledge and capacities now, in such areas as external markets
    and marketing opportunities, as well as development of distribution channels.
   Simultaneously, for effective marketing, small and medium producers need to
   raise the knowledge level required for joint marketing, as well as for organiza-
   tion of trade and cargo shipment logistics (see paragraph 16 below):
16.	Joint marketing of the produce of small and medium greenhouses: To bene-
    fit from wide export opportunities effectively, small and medium greenhouses
    need to join their capacities both for acquisition of raw materials and inputs
    and for marketing of products. For effective joining of capacities, economic
    entities must improve their knowledge and skills in such areas as:
    Selection of marketable and transportable crop varieties, and uniform use
      of such varieties by economic entities;
    Organization of the regular supply of sufficient volume;
    Ensuring compliance with food safety requirements;


                                        7
     Ensuring stable and homogenous production — ensuring standard appear-
        ance and quality through classification and sorting of products, including
        by sizes, color, ripeness, and firmness or softness, and
     Ensuring standard packaging.
17.	Challenges and opportunities associated with the EEU membership: Since Jan-
    uary 1, 2015, Armenia has been a signatory to the Eurasian Economic Union
    (EEU), which along with an expected improvement in export opportunities has
    also brought some changes and uncertainty into export processes. As an exam-
    ple, businesses are often unaware of expected changes in procedures affecting
    the actual export flow to Russia or other EEU markets.
   After the one-year transition period, changes are expected in the EEU export
   procedures and in agricultural production requirements. In particular:
    Provision of certifications (at present, certificates are required for each
       batch of imported and exported products);
    In addition to phytosanitary certification, additional mandatory sanitary
       requirements for vegetables and flowers will be introduced (which implies
       corresponding documentation requirements as well);
    Stricter food safety requirements will be introduced for exported products,
       and particularly, a new mandatory requirement to introduce the HACCP
       system in production.
   Incorporating these changes will require greenhouse crop producers to intro-
   duce new or to improve existing production safety systems; and this, in turn,
   will require extra investment and staff training. This will be hard to implement
   especially for small and medium economic entities.
18.	Means of transportation: In Armenia, economic entities face difficulties due to
    shortage of trucks especially in the summer season, when open-field cultivated
    crops are harvested, and export volumes grow. In that season, cargo shipment
    prices grow too. The shortage of trucks is often filled by renting Russian or
    Georgian trucks.
19.	Export procedures: Economic entities incur additional costs and waste of time
    due to export procedures, which ultimately decreases their competitiveness in
    external markets. In particular:
    Border crossing and customs formality procedures at the Georgian-Russian
      Lars border crossing point are complicated and unpredictable (which also
      include informal “facilitation fees”);
    Some problematic procedures pertaining to applying the VAT on exported
      goods.

B. SHORT- TO MEDIUM-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS
Short-term (12 to 18 months)
1.	 It is necessary to analyze the problems associated with the gas supply (such
    as advance payment requirement by HayRusGazArd, and gas supply cut off
    during the cold season) and develop solutions to these problems. Recommend-
    ed solutions may be: (a) elimination of the advance payment requirement by
    HayRusGazArd in practice; (b) development of a flexible mechanism of mak-
    ing payments for the supplied gas, which will take into consideration the cycle
    (seasonality) of the greenhouse production, and (c) increase of effectiveness of
    gas quality control.
   In parallel, it is important to work towards the use of alternative energy sources
   at greenhouse farms and introduction of energy-saving technologies and prac-
   tices (for additional information, see also paragraph 9 in mid-term recommen-
   dations section below).
2.	 For further development of the branch, it is necessary to address the issue of
    shortage of specialists now. Considering that development of an academic ed-
    ucational program by Armenian National Agrarian University may take a long
    time, it is necessary to develop promptly professional training modules (jointly
    with respective professional organizations functioning in the sector) and to
    organize training of highly qualified technical professionals in the following
    specialties:
     Agronomist,
     Agricultural chemist,
     Hydroponics specialist, and
     Plant protection specialist.
3.	 To spur further development of the branch, it is necessary to enhance among
    economic entities (especially small and medium greenhouses) knowledge and
    skills in production technologies, export markets and export opportunities, and
    organization of distribution networks; in particular:
     Modern greenhouse complexes and systems and supplies used therein;
     Modern high performance technologies of greenhouse horticulture;
     Correct selection and use of fertilizers and pesticides;
     Correct selection of crops, crop varieties, and seeds;
     Product sorting, packaging, storage and transportation;
     Marketing and supply chain management;
     Food safety and quality management good practices (GAP).
4.	 There is a need for designing and utilizing investment and greenhouse produc-
    tion and export financing mechanisms such as: (a) availability of long-term
    loans (up to 7 years); (b) introduction of effective leasing mechanisms and

                                         9
   procedures; (c) funding of investment and other projects; (d) provision of credit
   lines, and (e) insurance of production and export.
   For boosting investments, it is very important to develop such flexible mech-
   anisms of financing and insurance coverage, which will take into account the
   greenhouse production cycle (seasonality) and other peculiarities.
   An effective tool of investment promotion policy in the greenhouse sector can
   be offering of tailor-made investment loans and grants for the establishment
   of high-tech greenhouses, introduction of energy-efficient technologies, as well
   as development of supporting facilities, such as cold storage facilities, sorting,
   packaging or other handling workshops.
   Within that framework, it is very important to provide due support to cooper-
   ation between economic entities (in a form of cooperatives or associations), di-
   rected at ensuring standard, high quality, and safe production that meets mar-
   ket (especially export market) requirements. In particular, providing assistance
   to the establishment of small and medium-size harvest collection and sorting
   facilities may be a good example of proposed support.
5.	 Clarification of relevant legal provisions is necessary with respect to definitions
    or classifications of greenhouse structures, greenhouse crop production, and
    related tax procedures.
   In order to enable economic entities to benefit effectively from privileges or spe-
   cial procedures defined by the government, it is necessary to carry out proper
   awareness raising and explanatory works among the economic entities about
   relevant policy measures. This relates, particularly, to customs and tax proce-
   dures granting privileges defined by RA Government decisions 1118-N, 1119-
   N and other resolutions; RA Law on the List of Goods Imported by Organi-
   zations and Private Entrepreneurs, Subject to a Zero Percent Rate of Customs
   Duties and Exempt from Excise Tax).
6.	 There is a need to carry out an additional study of details of import and export
    procedures, and simplify and facilitate of those procedures, in particular:
    Improvement and simplification of classification methods and procedures
      for greenhouses and structures, systems, devices and other commodities
      used in the greenhouse production;
    Development of a respective customs formality procedure for import of
      greenhouse complexes, taking into consideration specifics of the sector and
      the commodity;
    Clarification and simplification of VAT application procedures (taking into
      consideration problems related to the EEU membership, for example, it is
      necessary to review the procedures in a way that Armenian exporters will
      not suffer or be punished in cases when their Russian partners delay pay-
      ment of the VAT in Russia);


                                         10
     Simplification of phytosanitary control of fertilizers, pesticides and other
       substances, as well as procedures of issuing licenses or permissions;
7.	 Conducting studies for the purposes of making use of opportunities arising
    from the EEU membership, as well as diminishing potential uncertainty and
    problems due to procedures and requirements; ensuring awareness of repre-
    sentatives of the public and private sectors, particularly about the EEU market
    export and import customs and technical control procedures and related issues;
8.	 Capacity strengthening in organizations and cooperatives functioning in the
    greenhouse agriculture sector, enabling them to address effectively the require-
    ments arising from accelerated development of the greenhouse crop produc-
    tion. The Greenhouse Association of Armenia in particular needs capacity
    strengthening.
   Promotion of cooperation between economic entities engaged in the green-
   house sector is important particularly for defining and meeting product safety
   and quality standards, as well as for collecting and packaging of products for
   export.
9.	 For the purpose of diversification of export markets, conduct studies of other
    export markets besides Russian, in order to explore entry potentials and to take
    steps of entering those markets. In this respect, Armenian economic entities
    should pay attention to increasing competitiveness of their products, in terms
    of both cost reduction and product assortment and quality.
10.	From a perspective of human capacity development, it is very important to
    increase significantly the amount and effectiveness of the public expenditures
    and enhance the role of the government in the areas of provision of advice and
    propagation of knowledge.
11.	Include fruits and vegetables in the list of priority products enjoying export
    support from the Export Promotion Committee (defined by the RA Prime Min-
    ister’s Decision No 5-A of January 13, 2016).

Medium-term (18 months to 3 years)
12.	It is important to increase energy efficiency in greenhouse farms through appli-
    cation of modern technologies. Ensuring energy efficiency in the greenhouse
    enterprises is of vital importance for increasing the competitiveness of the Ar-
    menian greenhouse products. Potential measures of increasing energy efficiency
    include (among others):
    Besides natural gas, use of alternative energy sources, such as solar energy
      or geothermal energy, which may help to reduce heating costs;
    Use of high energy-efficient and energy-saving heating and cooling systems
      in the greenhouses;
    Use of high energy-saving greenhouses, such as double-layer and air-inflated


                                        11
      plastic greenhouses that ensure high energy saving, and
    Use of energy-saving lighting and other equipment in the greenhouses.
   Consideration of opportunities of introducing and using Combined Heat and
   Power (CHP) systems in the greenhouses may be justified from the energy-sav-
   ing perspective (especially in large, technologically sophisticated greenhouse
   enterprises).
   An effective tool of the policy of promoting introduction of alternative and
   energy saving technologies in the greenhouse sector may be offering of tailor
   made investment loans or grants on terms designed specifically for introduction
   of such technologies.
13.	The development and implementation of an investment promotion program
    in the greenhouse crop production sector would be required to attract invest-
    ments into establishment of both greenhouses and supporting infrastructures,
    such as cold storages facilities and warehouses.
14.	It is necessary to develop and introduce relevant educational programs at the
    Armenian National Agrarian University (or another educational institution),
    in order to train highly qualified professionals specialized in the greenhouse
    farming industry.
15.	It is important to ensure the establishment and development of centers for local
    production of planting materials and seeds.
16.	Measures shall be taken to simplify export procedures for EEU markets while
    expediting the smooth transition to new requirements and procedures. In par-
    ticular, this refers to:
    Measures directed at smooth transition while reducing or eliminating pos-
      sible difficulties associated with the new food safety and sanitary control
      requirements and procedures after the one-year transition period;
    Developing comprehensive and simple export procedure guidelines for
      businesses pertaining to EEU markets (Russia in particular);
    Continuing collaboration, and reaching agreements, with the relevant Rus-
      sian and Georgian authorities, on issues related to maintaining clarity and
      consistency of the procedure applied at the Lars border crossing point.
    Identifying alternative import and export transportation routes other than
      the route through Lars, making the arrangements necessary for effective
      utilization of those routes (for instance, the routes through Black sea ports).

GREENHOUSE CROPS EXPORT SUPPLY CHAIN
ANALYSIS
    The mapping considers the chain and its efficiency from the business perspec-
tive of producers and importers of seeds and other raw materials, greenhouse
farmers, exporters, retailers and wholesalers, processors, freight forwarders, and
others. Export chains include both pre-production phase, such as obtaining (or
importing) raw materials and relevant permits, and post-production phase, such
as product shipment, packaging, storing, and export-related procedures. See the
diagram of the greenhouse crops export chain in figure 8.

2. PRE-PRODUCTION PHASE
2.1 Land
   Currently, the area of land under greenhouses in Armenia is about 763.6 hect-
ares, marking a rapid expansion tendency.
   Land allocation, principles and procedures of land category determination, and
respective tax relations are of primary significance for greenhouse farming.
    To establish and operate a greenhouse in Armenia, no special permission for
land use or agricultural activity is required. In case of establishing a greenhouse,
the land under the greenhouse is classified as land for “Other production purpos-
es” (see box 1).

       Box 1.
    According to provisions of Article 6 of the RA Land Code, based on its intended
 purpose of land use (categories), the land in the Republic of Armenia is classified:
 1.	   Agricultural
 2.	   Settlement
 3.	   Industrial, for entrails-use and other production purposes
 4.	   Energetic, transport, communicational, public structural
 5.	   Specially protected areas
 6.	   Special importance
 7.	   Forestry
 8.	   Water
 9.	   Reserved land
     The calculated net income determined by the cadastral evaluation of the land
 shall be the object of taxation for agricultural lands. The value of the land according
 to the cadastral evaluation shall be the object of taxation of non-agricultural lands.
     The land tax rate for the agricultural lands (including land lots allotted for hous-
 ing in settlements, and garden-plots) shall be 15 percent of the calculated net income
 determined by their cadastral evaluation.
     For non-agricultural lands, the land tax rates are defined 1 percent — inside the
 settlements, and 0.5 percent — outside the settlements.
    Lands under greenhouses, according to the RA Land Code, are classified to
 “Other” land category as “Agricultural production objects”.
    The cadastral value of lands is determined in accordance with the procedure
 and based on the zoning defined by the RA Government Decision No 1746-N dated
 April 17, 2003 “On Approval of Regulation of Cadastral Valuation of the Land,
 Location Zoning Coefficients and Boundaries of RA settlements.”




                                           15
    To establish a greenhouse, the need to change the land category or the purpose
of land use often arises. In case of changing the land category from “agricultural”
to “industrial,” the cadastral value of the land and the land tax calculation method
and rate change as well.
    Until 2013, the procedures of land allocation and change of land category (for
instance, from “agricultural” to “industrial”) were very complex, time consuming
and expensive. They included seeking approvals of a large number of departmental
agencies, discussions at an ad hoc interdepartmental commission and final ap-
proval of the government, which often took long months. In addition, payments
charged from economic entities for the change of the land category were very high.
Thus, according to the previous procedure, economic entities were required to pay
to the community budget the difference between the cadastral values of the land
when changing its purpose from “agricultural” to “industrial,” which quite often
totaled to a large sum (possibly to millions of drams per hectare).
   The procedure of land allotment and changing the target purpose of the land
has been simplified essentially and reduced in costs since 2013.6 The previous com-
plex procedure is now replaced with the following:
 Larger powers are vested in municipal authorities; economic entities may re-
   solve issues directed with and by the consent of municipalities. Thus, the head
   of the community now has the right to change the target purpose of a land
   parcel and to issue a construction permit.
 Economic entities engaged in greenhouse and a number of other agricultural
   activities are not required to pay to the community budget “the difference of
   the cadastral values of land parcels existing at the time of changing the target
   purpose, if after the changing of target purpose of the land parcels its cadastral
   value is higher than before the change.”
   Nevertheless, for instance the law amendment regarding simplification of the
procedure and shortening of the duration fully facilities the process only in cases
when the master plan of the municipality envisages an “industrial” land in the
particular location. Otherwise, to change the category of the land, the head of the
municipality must initiate and process the same complex and long procedure with
respect to changing the master plan.

2.2. Greenhouse structures and complexes
   Greenhouses used in Armenia
   Operating greenhouses in Armenia may be grouped by their structure as fol-
lows:
 Film plastic (polyethylene) greenhouses designed for production of herbs, seed-

6	 Corresponding amendments were incorporated in Article 7 of the RA Land Code, as
   well as in the RA Law on Urban Development.

                                        16
   lings and small volume of vegetables (these greenhouses do not require large
   investment and construction works). In general, plastic greenhouses may occu-
   py rather large area and allow large-scale production.
 Metal or polymer framed heated greenhouses covered with glass, rough poly-
   mer material or membranous plastic film designed for larger scale (commercial
   production). Such greenhouses are not equipped with improved technologies
   (low technology greenhouses). For examples, they lack nutrition, cooling, mois-
   turizing, or shading systems, as well as computerized control systems.




Figure 2. Low technology glass greenhouse,     Figure 3. Simple plastic greenhouse

 Large plastic or glass greenhouses mainly installed on metal frame, equipped
   with advanced technologies (including improved technologies of plant irriga-
   tion and nutrition systems, heating and cooling, moisturizing, light and shade
   control, and computerized control systems). High-tech film manufacturing
   technologies permit constructing commercial-size large greenhouses, which are
   not inferior to glass greenhouses in any way.

    Moreover, there is an opinion among greenhouse specialists that the use of
high-tech film plastic greenhouses would be more effective in the climatic condi-
tions present in Armenia (high temperature and solar radiation, long sunny peri-
od). Nowadays, over 85 percent of greenhouses worldwide are plastic greenhous-
es. Plastic greenhouses have several advantages over glass greenhouses, such as:
 Improved sunlight penetration and dispersion properties;
 Higher energy saving, particularly the greenhouses covered with double-layer
    and gas-inflated plastic film (energy savings of 30 percent more than single-lay-
    er plastic film covered greenhouses);
 Improved air ventilation and moisture control properties, particularly through
    opening of the roof (while using insect-proof nets);
 Greater height (up to 16 meters) and larger volume of the greenhouse structure;
 Plastic greenhouses require relatively smaller amount of investments — 20–30
    percent less than corresponding glass greenhouses.
    One of the disadvantages of the plastic greenhouses is the need to change the
film every several years (3–5 year or more), depending of the solar radiation.
    Improved high-tech greenhouse complexes are imported (Dutch and French
complexes enjoy high reputation in the market). Nevertheless, to promote invest-
ments in the sector, it is important to ensure simple and easy import procedures
and requirements. Currently, there is a need for clarification of the relevant regu-
lations and laws with respect to definitions or classifications of greenhouse struc-
tures and greenhouse crop production activities, as well as related customs and tax
procedures. A number of important regulatory and procedural issues related to
import are discussed below.
   The import of greenhouses has been VAT exempt since 2015.7 It is an import-

7	 RA Law On Approving List of Goods Imported by Organizations and Private Entre-
   preneurs, Subject to a Zero Percent Rate of Customs Duties and Exempt from Excise
   Tax, adopted on February 26, 2015.

                                              18
ant change, which, if enforced effectively, may spur investments and positively
affect the sector’s development. Before this exemption, VAT was levied on import
of greenhouses and collected by customs at the border, and as businesses report,
the greenhouse import procedures before 2015 were complicated, lengthy and ex-
pensive.
    Economic entities report that during customs formalities of importing green-
house complexes, often the customs body requires to classify and clear the com-
plex part-by-part, rather than as a whole assembly. For example, first declare and
clear metal pipes, poles, or columns separately (by weight), then cooling, shading,
or nutrition supplying devices, and so forth. This approach results in changing
the customs classification code of the commodity and customs and tax regimes
applied to the commodity, leading to considerable increase of customs duties and
taxes due.
    There is another important peculiarity and circumstance concerning import of
greenhouse complexes: A modern greenhouse complex is a large and bulky com-
modity and, often, it may be impossible to manufacture and supply all of its assem-
bled components at the same time, in a single batch. In addition, an investor may
find expedient, from mere technical considerations, to import the complex part by
part, based on the sequence of building works. In other words, a greenhouse com-
plex (which is bulky enough to be transported in ten or more trucks), often may be
imported in several batches (shipment lots) rather than simultaneously, in a single
batch. In this case, to avoid unnecessary waste of money and time, it is important
to design customs and other formalities and procedures related to the import in a
way as to consider all those circumstances, where appropriate.
    Economic entities report that customs and other import formalities and proce-
dures often do not take into consideration the peculiarity of a greenhouse import;
the customs body requires declaring each batch as a separate independent import,
rather than a part of the complex. Nevertheless, if the importer wishes to declare it
as a “greenhouse complex,” then he should place the already arrived part(s) of the
complex in the customs warehouse and wait for the arrival of the next batch(es),
until the greenhouse complex is replenished. In that case, the importer incurs fines
for the delay of the customs formality and additional costs for storage.
   In this respect, after Armenia’s accession to membership in the Eurasian Eco-
nomic Union (EEU), an important change has occurred in the customs formality
procedure, which may help to resolve some of the problems associated with the
import of greenhouses. In particular, under the new procedures, economic entities
can apply for preliminary classification of a greenhouse complex, based on an
application submitted in advance. According to Article 64 of the RA Law on Cus-
toms Regulation, “A product which has not been assembled or has been disassem-
bled, including an incomplete or unaccomplished set, and is going to be imported
or exported by separate shipment lots within a period of time not exceeding the


                                        19
term defined by Article 170 of the Customs Code of the Customs Union, may
be declared with one classification code, being stated according the Commodity
Classification of Foreign Economic Activities, provided there is a customs body’s
decision on classification of the product.” The EEU Customs Code (Article 170)
prescribes a 2–4 month period for temporary storage of commodities.
     Enforcement of this change can ease the import of greenhouses, if economic en-
tities are provided with an opportunity of transporting the separate shipment lots
to its premises (rather than incur large costs for storage in the customs warehouse
until the arrival of the next batch).
    In order to enable economic entities to benefit effectively from privileges or
special procedures defined by the government, it is necessary to make clarifications
and amendments in relevant regulations, and awareness raising among the eco-
nomic entities (for example, in relation to customs and tax procedures granting
privileges, which are defined in the Customs Code of the EEU, in RA Government
decisions 1118-N, 1119-N and other resolutions; RA Law on Approval of List of
Goods Imported by Organizations and Private Entrepreneurs, Subject to a Zero
Percent Rate of Customs Duties and Exempt from Excise Tax).
    Another peculiarity of importing greenhouses is their measurement in kilo-
grams for customs purposes. Such situation, from an investment or economic per-
spective, in essence means that an investor acquires a high-tech greenhouse com-
plex by area (square meters) and by technological equipment (performance level),
yet declares it by weight, in tons (as scrap metal).
    In the framework of Armenia’s membership in the Eurasian Econom-
ic Union (EEU), the customs duty rate on import of greenhouses will be in-
creased up to 8.8 percent (instead of previously effective 0 percent) from 2019.8
 That change will also affect greenhouse prices, causing a price hike. It is anticipat-
ed, that the customs duty rate will remain unchanged (0 percent) until 2017 inclu-
sively; in 2018, it will increase to 2 percent, and reach to 8.8 percent starting from
2019. Additional details on the timeline of the customs duty (tariff) rates applied
to goods imported into Armenia from third countries within the EEU framework
are provided in Annex 1.
    Cadastral classification of the greenhouse structures is one of the important
issues of the greenhouse industry. Economic entities express concerns regarding

ambiguities of the legal provisions pertaining to the classification of greenhouse
structures, which lead to problems in taxation procedures and in other dimensions
of their business activity. This includes, for instance: (a) insufficient clarity of state
registration procedures of property rights for greenhouses, due to which business-
es face collateral difficulties when obtaining loans from banks; (b) limitations in
relation to allocating land for production purposes, including greenhouse crop
production, in a number of villages and towns. These issues are regulated by the
Law on State Registration of Property Right, the Government Decision No 498 of
11 May 20029, and other legal acts.

2.3 Greenhouse irrigation systems and other equipment
    The introduction of advanced irrigation systems, particularly drip irrigation
systems, is becoming widespread in the greenhouse operations. Drip irrigation sys-
tems are imported from different countries, such as Korea, EU countries, Israel,
and China.
   VAT on the import of drip systems is not calculated and collected at the border.
    As mentioned by business entities, tariff classification of goods is one of the
problems they encounter in the customs procedures when importing drip irrigation
systems. The customs body often requires filing of additional documents, in order
to classify a drip system as such, instead of an ordinary rubber or plastic pipe.
There are instances, when classification of the drip irrigation system as an ordinary
pipe leads to changing customs and tax regimes applied thereof (as a result, due
duty and tax amounts increase).

2.4 Seeds and planting material
    A large portion of vegetable seeds used for agricultural production in Armenia
is imported. The country produces less than 10 percent of about 24 tons of total
vegetable seeds used annually. The geographic scope of vegetable seed imports is
wide and diversified, including EU countries, Russia, the United States, and Turkey.
So is the assortment of imported seeds; producers have wide choices.
    The main local producer of seeds is the Scientific Center of Vegetable, Mel-
on and Industrial Crops (SCVIC), a state non-commercial organization (SNCO),
which produces 500–800 kg of seeds annually (tomato, cucumber, beans, and pep-
per). The SCVIC also produces 3 million seeds in open fields and 200,000 seedlings
in greenhouses annually.
    The shortage of treated (infection-resistant) planting material in Armenia is
a problem, which affects the productivity, as well as the choice of the crop to be
cultivated. For instance, according to the specialists (from SCVIC), the lack of the
9	 RA Government Decision No 498 of May 11, 2002, “On Restricting Construction
   of Residential, Public and Production Buildings and Structures on Agricultural Lands
   owned by Citizens and Legal Entities.”

                                           21
treated plant material was one the main reasons of the reduction of carnation pro-
duction in Armenia in recent years.
    Small greenhouse farmers often lack sufficient knowledge of selecting high
quality seeds and using them correctly. Their knowledge is insufficient also in se-
lection of competitive and marketable varieties. For example, selection of crop
varieties that have long durability and high transportability may increase compet-
itiveness of greenhouse crops in local and external markets.
    The import of planting materials of saplings, seedlings, and especially flowers
is subject to customs duty and collection of VAT at the border, which increas-
es their prices in the market. According to economic entities, the high price not
only increases the costs (and decreases the rate of return), but also decreases the
productivity. For example, the high price prompts the economic entities to use
the plants longer, in consideration of saving, as well as to organize independent-
ly, with no relevant knowledge, the reproduction of the planting material.10
 These practices reduce productivity and often result in origination and spreading
of plant diseases.
    Prior to Armenia’s accession to membership in the EEU, the customs duty rate
on import of seedlings and planting material (saplings) was 10 percent. In the frame-
work of the EEU membership, customs duty on seedlings and planting material (sap-
ling) will remain effective, yet at a lesser rate — 5 percent (no transition period).11
The customs duty rate of 9 percent applies to import of rose bushes. For details on
customs duty rates, see Annex 1.
    There were no major issues indicated by businesses in relation to importation
of seeds.

2.5 Availability of investment and financial resources
    Introduction of advanced technology greenhouses and expansion of green-
house crop production require significant financial investments. Meanwhile, such
investments often require long-term financing. For example, according to business
entities, the term of the loan for the establishment of up to 1 hectare of sophisti-
cated greenhouse should be at least 4 years, and up to 7 years, for several hectares
of greenhouse area.
    It is difficult for businesses to access long-term loans in Armenia. Difficult ac-
cess to loans is a serious hampering factor from a perspective of investment pro-
motion.
    Other financing resources too are not accessible, such as leasing, project financ-
ing, credit lines, and so forth.
10	 For instance, in Holland, the gerbera daisy plant is used 2–3 years, while Armenian
    producers use it up to 5–6 years.
11	 With the exception of grapevine sapling, where 0 percent EEU import tariff rate is
    applied.

3. PRODUCTION PHASE
   In 2015, greenhouse enterprises in Armenia covered 764 hectares of total
space. Segregated statistics (by crops) on greenhouse production are not collected
and maintained. The breakdown of greenhouse production, according to expert
valuations, is as follows:
 Vegetables — 60 percent (mainly tomato, cucumber, and less amount of pepper
   bean)
 Flowers and decorative plants — 35 percent (roses, gerbera, carnation)
 Berries — 5 percent (strawberry)
3.1 Some characteristics of the production in Armenia
    One of the advantages of the Armenian climate is the abundance of solar light
and large number of sunny days particularly in the sub-mountainous regions, such
as Kotayk, Aragatsotn, and Vayots Dzor. This important advantage may allow
attaining higher productivity and qualitative properties.

3.2 Water, heating and gas
   Greenhouse enterprises use mostly natural gas for heating. The share of gas
heating spending in the total costs is high, reaching to 40-50 percent of total pro-
duction costs.
    Due to the rise in gas prices in 2015, the costs of greenhouse operations have
increased and, accordingly, the rate of return has decreased. The gas prices have
increased by 20 percent in the last 3–4 years. The gas tariff for large consumers
(spending over 10,000 cubic meters monthly), such as greenhouses, is AMD equiv-
alent of USD 276,98 per 1,000 cubic meters (VAT included).12 Since July 2016, the
gas price for larger consumers reduced to USD 214.63, which will contribute to
cost reduction in greenhouse crop production. Considering the fact that the gas
tariff supplied to greenhouses is calculated in Armenian dram equivalent to USD,
greenhouse enterprises incur significant losses due to depreciation of the national
currency as well (as it happened in the yearend of 2014 and the beginning of
2015).13

12	 Source: RA Public Services Regulatory Commission: http://www.psrc.am/am/sectors/
    gas/tariffs (last visited on October 30, 2015). In Armenia, a two-layer tariff system is
    introduced, where different tariffs and calculation methods are applied to consumers
    spending (a) up to 10,000 cubic meters and (b) 10,000 and over cubic meters of gas.
    Thus, the gas tariff for consumers spending up to 10,000 cubic meters of gas (house-
    holds fall under this classification) is 156 Armenian dram; the calculation is made in
    AMD. Since July 1, 2016, the prices were reduced to USD 214.63 and 122.25 AMD,
    respectively.

    According to information provided by economic entities, one of the problems
associated with the gas supply is HayRusGazArd’s frequent claims to pay an ad-
vance payment under the threat of cutting off the gas in the beginning of the heat-
ing season. As a rule, advance payment is requested in the beginning of the heating
season, at the amount of one-month gas consumption charge. The requirement to
effect advance payment, in fact, is a violation of contractual provisions.

    Box 2. Exchange rate fluctuation and gas price
     Between October 2014 and February 2015, when comparatively large amount
 of gas is required for heating of greenhouses, the exchange rate of Armenian dram
 (AMD) to US dollar dropped by 17 percent, which in turn resulted in at least 17
 percent increase of gas spending.

   Another problem facing greenhouse farms relates to working capital flow,
which mainly becomes available after the harvest season, while economic entities
cannot accurately control the date and time of crop ripening. Therefore, some-
times greenhouse farms fail to pay bills for gas in time, due to mismatching of
working capital flow and payment periods. As reported, there were some cases
when representatives of the gas supplying company cut off the gas supply causing
destructions of greenhouse crops (especially in cold season).
    Economic entities also mention about the poor quality of supplied gas (pres-
sure, density, composition), which increases the volume of gas required for heating
and, consequently, spending. The energy efficiency can be increased by introducing
and using modern technologies in greenhouse farms. Ensuring energy efficiency in
the greenhouse enterprises is of vital importance for increasing the competitiveness
of the Armenian greenhouse products. Potential measures of increasing energy ef-
ficiency include (among others):
 Besides natural gas, use of alternative energy sources, such as solar energy or
   geothermal energy, which may help to reduce heating costs;
 Use of high energy-efficient and energy-saving heating and cooling systems in
   greenhouses;
 Use of high energy-saving greenhouses, such as greenhouses covered with dou-
   ble-layer and air-inflated plastic film that ensures high energy saving; and
 Use of energy-saving lighting and other equipment in the greenhouses.


                                        25
   Consideration of opportunities of introducing and using Combined Heat and
Power (CHP) systems in the greenhouses may be justified from an energy-saving
perspective (especially in large, sophisticated greenhouse enterprises).

3.3 Technologies and productivity
    Greenhouses
    Since 2011, the total area of greenhouse farms equipped with sophisticated
technologies has increased drastically. According to expert estimation, in 2011,
the total area of high-tech greenhouse operations was less than 5 hectares; in mid-
2016, that indicator reached to 100 hectares.
    In spite of the increase of high-tech greenhouses, its space still remains small,
constituting only 10 percent of the total greenhouse space. Most greenhouses
are not equipped with heating, cooling, moisturizing, shading, nutrition applying,
computer control and other modern improved systems.
    According to expert estimation, establishment of a high-tech glass greenhouse
installed on metal frame requires 150–200 USD investment per square meter — so
establishment of 1 hectare of sophisticated greenhouse farm requires an invest-
ment amount of $1.5–2M.
    There are also technologically equipped plastic greenhouse farms in the mar-
ket; the amount of investments required for establishment of a square meter of
greenhouse is $80–100 (or $0.8–1 million per ha).

    Production methods
    In Armenian greenhouses, crops are cultivated both by traditional (in soil) and
hydroponics (on substrates) planting methods (including vegetables, flowers, and
berries).
    Drip irrigation and nutrition-applying technologies have been used in green-
house production of Armenia for over a decade.
    About three-fourths of large greenhouses use improved-performance technolo-
gies, which, by their characteristics, may be classified in two groups:
 Saving technologies (labor saving, cost reducing)
 Economies of scale technologies (increase of scale and growth of productivity).
    The larger the greenhouse farm, the higher is the use of technologies that in-
crease productivity. 14
    To increase product competitiveness and to enter foreign markets (in particular,
the EU market where strict food quality and safety standard apply and, after the
transition period, the EEU market,), there is a need for improvements in produc-
tivity15 and product quality and safety.

14	 AmeriaGroup, “Industrial Agriculture in Armenia: Development Trends,” 2014.
15	 In parallel to a productivity increase, it is critical to pay due attention to ensuring that
    production is backed by actual market demand and access to that market.
                                              26
   This can be achieved through:
 The introduction and application of Global GAP (Good Agriculture Practice),
   in particular, for greenhouse agricultural crops16; UNECE17 marketing stan-
   dards for fruits and vegetables; fruit and vegetable marketing standards of the
   EU18; standards and requirements of Codex Alimentarius19; and other interna-
   tionally accepted practices, standards and systems, and
 Strengthening of human resource capacity to use GAP and other applicable
   practices and standards.

   Productivity
    Vegetables: The productivity of tomatoes and cucumbers is several times high-
er in sophisticated greenhouses than in simple technology greenhouses. In simple,
low technology greenhouses, the annual productivity of soil-grown tomatoes and
cucumbers per square meter ranges between 10 and 20 kilograms, while in high-
tech greenhouses using hydroponics method of cultivation the annual productivity
reaches 50–60 kg per square meter. The productivity in Armenian sophisticated
greenhouses is close to the international high productivity level.
   Flowers: The annual productivity of roses in sophisticated greenhouses is 120–
130 flowers per square meter.
   The annual productivity of gerbera reaches 300 flowers per square meter.
    In recent years, the cultivation of carnations has decreased, while the cultiva-
tion of roses has increased and marks a rapid growth trend. The planting material
of roses can be kept longer (3–5 years), as compared to planting materials of car-
nations and gerberas. The planting material of gerberas can be kept for 2–3 years.
Roses are less fastidious about temperature — they tolerate 8 to 22 degrees C.
    Knowledge gap around high performance technologies and practices is ob-
served in small and medium greenhouse farms. This refers to both agronomy and
plant protection practices, as well as to plant density and arrangement decisions.20

20	 For example, Armenian floriculturists often grow 2–3 times more gerbera bushes in
    one square meter than Dutch floriculturists; while Armenian flower growers do not
    pay due attention to keeping proper inter-bush distance. This affects both the produc-
    tivity and the quality of the flowers.

   Production cycle
    In Armenia, small and medium greenhouses deploying simple technologies face
difficulty in ensuring year-round uninterrupted production of vegetables (tomato,
cucumber, pepper). There, the production interrupts two times, in long intervals.
The majority of greenhouses do not have any harvest in the periods from January
through March and September to October. The map of production cycle of green-
houses is introduced in figures 9 and 10.
   Prices of greenhouse vegetables noticeably drop in the period when open-field
crops (tomatoes and cucumbers) are harvested and sold (September to October).
   The reasons of production interruptions include:
 The existing level of technologies does not allow organizing uninterrupted pro-
    duction in nearly 90 percent of lands under greenhouses. Furthermore, inter-
    ruptions are significantly longer in greenhouses deploying simple technologies.
 Most greenhouses (especially SMEs) are not engaged in export and sell their
    products at local markets. Accordingly, greenhouses plan their production load
    based on the characteristics of the local market demand. For example, green-
    house farms plan limited or no production in January, after the New Year hol-
    idays, when food (including vegetables) consumption (demand) declines after
    large holiday spending.
    Contrary to simple technology greenhouses, improved greenhouses (mostly
large enterprises) succeed in ensuring more flexibility in terms of production time
planning. For these greenhouses, the decline of local market demand is of lesser
concern, since they export the major portion of their products.

3.4 Fertilizers and pesticides
   Import and import procedures
    Armenian greenhouses use mostly imported fertilizers and pesticides. Green-
houses with drip irrigation system use water-soluble fertilizers. In general, the as-
sortment of imported fertilizers is wide, and the geography of imports is broad,
including the EU countries, USA, China, and Russia.
   Nearly a dozen importers offer their services in the Armenian market.
   Armenia allows import of state registered fertilizers and pesticides only. To
obtain state registration, substances undergo documentary analysis, chemical and
other types of testing and other procedures, to attest their safety and effectiveness.
The effective period of state registration is five years.
    Economic entities incur additional costs and spend extra time due to import
procedures of insecticides and other pesticides, which in turn ultimately results in
increasing effective market prices of the commodities.
    For the import of each batch of pesticides into Armenia, the importer should
obtain one-time import permission (license) from the Ministry of Agriculture, as
well as a certification from the RA State Service for Food Safety (Phytosanitary
Inspectorate) which includes sampling, laboratory testing, and issuance of a con-
clusion about conformity from the State Service for Food Safety. The procedures
include repeated actions of document collection and submission of such docu-
ments to bodies at the structure of the RA Ministry of Agriculture.
    The procedures of one-time license by the Ministry of Agriculture are set out
in the Order of the Ministry of Agriculture No 6 of January 15, 2015. Licenses are
issued for each consignment (batch), within three days after the application by the
importer.21 The legal basis for the testing and issuance of conformity conclusions
(certificates) for the imported pesticides and other agricultural chemicals includes:
 The Law on Phytosanitary
 The Law on State Control of Food Safety (Article 18)
 RA Government Decision No 1192-N of October 4, 200722

21	 This licensing requirement was adopted in compliance to Armenia’s commitments un-
    der the EEU (specifically, Decision No 134 of the Eurasian Economic Commission of
    August 16, 2012, “On Normative Legal Acts in the Field of Non-Tariff Regulations”).
    The Minister’s Order is based on the Government Decision No 1524-N of Decem-
    ber 25, 2014 “On Approving the List of Prohibited Products or Products Subject to
    Restrictions for Crossing the Territory of Armenia, Defining Authorized Agencies,
    and Approving the Framework Regulation for Issuing Licenses and Permissions for
    Import and/or Export.”
22	RA Government Decision No 1192-N of October 4, 2007, “On Approval of the
    Procedure of Carrying out Testing of Pesticides and Fertilizers and pesticides, and
    Defining the Forms of Conclusion on Import and Export of Pesticides and Fertilizers,
    and Declaring Invalid RA Decision No 1151, dated October 4, 2007.”

                                          30
    This conformity certification process, which in essence is a quality conformity
(rather than safety) control during the import of each batch, includes physical
examination, sample taking, and laboratory testing — time-consuming processes.
The importer must visit several times different subdivisions of the State Service for
Food Safety, while the cargo remains in the customs warehouse The cargo does not
undergo customs clearance until the completion of technical control procedures.
    The phytosanitary control of imports must be limited to the control of safety
requirements, in compliance with the best international practices and the princi-
ples adopted under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Considering the fact
that Armenia can import only those commodities that have obtained state registra-
tion, it is assumed that their safety indicators are already inspected and approved,
while the inspection of safety of registered substances is already conducted during
their state registration (for a five-year effective period).
    Prior to Armenia’s accession to the membership in the EEU, the customs duty
rate on the import of fertilizers was 0 percent. In the framework of the EEU mem-
bership, the customs duty rates on import of fertilizers must be increased up to 6.5
percent. This change will affect the price of fertilizer. For effecting the change of
customs duty rate on some fertilizers no transition period is established, where-
as for others, the rate will remain 0 percent until 2017 inclusively, increase to 2
percent in 2018 and to 4 percent from 2019; while the EEU 6.5 percent rate will
become effective since 2020.
   In the framework of the EEU membership, the customs duty rate on import
of pesticides must be increased up to 5 percent (instead of previously applied 0
percent). Additional details on the timeline of the customs duty rates applied to
goods imported into Armenia from third countries within the EEU framework are
provided in Annex 1.

   Selling at local market
   According to economic entities, meeting the government’s requirements to
trading of fertilizers and pesticides at the local market and to retailers engaged in
trading of those commodities is fully or partially infeasible in practice.23

   Pesticide application practices
   Interviews with economic entities show that the frequency of ineffectiveness
of using pesticides is high, which decreases the productivity (increases costs and
23	 Those requirements are defined in Order No 790 of the RA Minister of Health “On
    Approving Sanitary Norms and Standards for Storage, Transportation, Use and Trade
    of Fertilizers and Agrochemicals (Pesticides)” dated August 30, 2005. The Order, in
    particular, requires that “Retail organizations trading in fertilizers and agrochemicals
    (pesticides) should have 50 meters of sanitary protection zone,” “trade shop” (at least
    20 m2 space), storage area (at least 9 m2), dosage preparation station (at least 6 m2),
    and sanitary-hygienic facilities.” According to economic entities, requirements for
    premises are difficult to meet.

                                            31
decreases the yield). High frequency of ineffectiveness may be attributed to several
reasons or their combination. In particular:
 Abundance of fake and expired pesticides in the market;
 Unfair import competition, where there is a dominant importer in the market
   importing low quality or fake, but cheap pesticides (prompting agricultural
   producers to buy pesticides more frequently), while creating artificial adminis-
   trative and other difficulties for potential competitors, including artificial com-
   plication of import customs procedure;
 Knowledge gap among producers and, consequently, wrong diagnosis of plant
   diseases or incorrect use or application of pesticides, which results in the de-
   crease or neutralization of expected effect of pesticides;
 Knowledge gap or unfair practices at retail outlets engaged in trading of pesti-
   cides, which fail to provide accurate information to agricultural producers on
   the application of pesticides and to comply with storing requirement; and sell
   expired substances.

3.5 Human capacities
    The shortage of qualified specialists is one of the serious problems hindering
the development of greenhouse farming in Armenia. All economic entities engaged
in greenhouse farming observe this problem, though sometimes they fail to identify
specifically which specialists are needed. For example, businesses use the general
term “greenhouse specialist” without distinct reference to narrow specializations.
    For proper establishment and efficient exploitation of greenhouse farms, pro-
fessionals with relevant knowledge and skills are required, such as:
  Agronomist,
  Agricultural chemist,
  Hydroponics specialist, and
  Plant protection specialist.
    It is important that those specialists possess also skills of operating computer
software and management systems, so that they can work at high-tech greenhous-
es.
   The Armenian National Agrarian University has not yet designed academic
programs for greenhouse agricultural chemists and plant protection specialists.
Businesses think that knowledge and skills of the university alumni are far from
being satisfactory.
    Due to shortage of required specialists in the local labor market, greenhous-
es equipped with sophisticated technologies have to invite specialists from other
countries, who, as a rule, are very expensive and cannot stay in Armenian perma-
nently; they arrive in the country for a short stay and provide advice. However,
permanent presence of highly qualified specialists is very important for the effec-
tive organization of greenhouse operations.
                                         32
3.6 Greenhouse association
    The Greenhouse Association of Armenia (GAA) has worked in the greenhouse
sector since 1999; the Association has 23 members (with a total area of 12 hect-
ares). The greenhouse area operated by GAA members is anticipated to increase
by another 16 hectares. The association represents and protects interests of green-
house farmers, coordinates collaboration between them and provides services,
such as:
 Acquisition and supply of greenhouse inputs (seeds, planting materials, fertiliz-
   ers, and pesticides) and devices and equipment for association members;
 Practical advisory services and promotion of experience exchange (including
   training and seminars);
 Collaboration with public authorities, foreign and international structures, and
   addressing of problems or issues concerning the sector;
 Provision of assistance in issues related to greenhouse crop marketing and ex-
   port; and
 Conducting of analyses, studies, and research.
   The main funding source of the association is membership fees. At present, the
executive board of the GAA has four employees.
    Accelerated development of the greenhouse crop production has brought chal-
lenges with it. To face those challenges the Greenhouse Association needs further
strengthening of its capacities. With its current capacities, the association will be
unable to fulfill its tasks duly.

3.7 Sustainable development and environmental issues
   Development and expansion of high technology greenhouse farms may have a
positive effect on the efforts of facing global climate change and mitigating associ-
ated risks. At the same time, the development of greenhouse farms contributes to
more effective, profitable, and targeted use of lands.

3.8 Availability of investment and financial resources
    Scarcity of accessible financial resources and small assortment of financial in-
struments seriously limit the greenhouse sector development. Business entities face
problems in terms of ensuring both working capital and investment funds.

4. POST-PRODUCTION PHASE
4.1 Selling into the local market
   Medium and small producers of vegetables, as a rule, market their products via
two distribution channels: direct selling and selling through intermediaries (bro-
kers).
    Direct selling: The first channel implies direct selling of vegetables by produc-
ers to retail outlets or at the agricultural markets.

 Greenhouse farm                                    Retail Market            End users
Figure 11. Greenhouse vegetable marketing chain: direct selling of greenhouse vegetables

    Selling through intermediaries: Intermediaries (brokers) visit greenhouses with
their trucks and buy the products, to sell them later in the market.

                             wholesale buyer
Figure 12. Greenhouse vegetable marketing chain: selling through intermediaries

    At meetings with producers, it was observed that they avoid entering into trad-
ing transactions with large buyers, giving preference to small and medium sellers.
In this case, business relations of supplying and buying are often informal, not
regulated on a contractual basis.
    The reason for that, most likely, is the producers’ intention of reducing poten-
tial risks of non-payments or other problems. The logic of such approach is that
producers prefer dealing (or having potential problems) with several small bulk
buyers, rather than with a single large one. In addition, in order to work with
large buyers, agricultural producers must ensure regular supply of large volumes
of production, at stable quality, standard appearance and size, meeting food safety
requirements.
    For SME greenhouses, compliance with food safety requirements is associated
with some problems. In particular, to supply products of corresponding volume
and standard indicators, producers must collect (unite) and sort their production.
The practice of banding together in order to market greenhouse crops jointly, to
meet required volumes and standards, is not yet established in Armenia. Agricul-
tural producers’ unions and cooperatives may play an important role in that pro-
cess. For example, the Greenhouse Association of Armenia may coordinate and
unite capacities of its members.




                                             34
   Competing with imported vegetables
    In the winter months, the cost of imports (particularly, from Turkey) is lower
than the cost of locally produced vegetables; due to this, locally produced vegeta-
bles are not competitive in the market, in comparison with imports.

4.2 Export

   Exported products and volumes
    Statistical data on production and export of vegetables, flowers and berries are
not segregated by greenhouse and open-field productions. This means that no data
are available on greenhouse crop production and export volumes.24 Nevertheless,
below are data on volumes of vegetables, flowers, and berries exported from Ar-
menia.

   Vegetables (fresh)
    The assortment of exported vegetables (including greenhouse vegetables) in-
cludes tomatoes, cucumbers, beans and peppers, where cucumbers have the largest
export share. In 2014, 1,129 tons of fresh cucumbers were exported with a value
of $2.16M.

                              2014         Weight (kg)            Value ($)
                           Tomato           217,630               268,630
                         Cucumber          1,129,227             2,157,987
                            Pepper            68,837               70,436

   Berries (fresh)
   The assortment of exported berries includes strawberries, raspberries and
pomegranates, where strawberries have the largest export share. In 2014, 35.7
tons of fresh strawberries were exported with a value of about $108,000.

                             2014         Weight (kg)            Value ($)
                       Strawberry           35,675               107,788
                        Raspberry             723                  1,414
                     Pomegranate           284,981               482,427


24	 As cited in the Concept Paper on Promotion of Creation of Greenhouses in Farm-
    ing  Entities, according to the data of the RA NSS, 5,986 tons of vegetables were
    produced in 97 hectares of covered ground in 2011 and 12,346 tons in 173 hectares
    of covered ground (greenhouse) in 2012. However, data in the publication are in-
    troduced in one line, with no indication whether the hectares refer to hothouses or
    simple film covered greenhouses.

                                         35
   Flowers (cut)
   Taking into consideration the fact that flowers grown for commercial purposes
are mainly produced in greenhouses, we may assume that general information
regarding export of flowers refer to greenhouse flowers. Armenia mainly exports
roses (and small amount of gerberas and carnations).
   In 2014, Armenia exported over three million roses (3,174,000 cut roses) with
a value of $20,607.36.

   Mushrooms
   Since mushrooms grown for commercial purposes are mainly produced in
greenhouses, we may assume that general information regarding export of mush-

pignons.

    In the current stage of development, the selection of appropriate crop vari-
eties meeting internal and especially external market demands is very important
both for small and medium and for large greenhouse farms. In addition to main
greenhouse vegetables — tomatoes and cucumbers with which it is difficult for
Armenian producers to ensure competitiveness particularly in the heating season
— it is necessary to introduce high value crops enjoying high demand in internal
and external markets.

   Export markets
   The geography of export is focused: greenhouse crops are mainly exported to
Russia and, in small numbers, to Belarus and Georgia.
   Vegetables: tomato and cucumber — mostly to Russia
   Flowers — Russia, Georgia, and Belarus
   Berries (strawberry) — mostly to Russia

   Export expansion opportunity
    The demand for greenhouse crops (particularly, for Armenian crops) is grad-
ually increasing in the Russian market; this opens wide export opportunities for
Armenian economic entities (including small and medium greenhouses). To benefit
from export opportunities effectively, small and medium greenhouses need to join
their capacities. To achieve this target, they need to ensure:
 Selection of marketable and transportable crop varieties, as well as production
   of such varieties by all involved greenhouse producers;
 Regular supply of sufficient volume;

                                       36
 Compliance with food safety requirements;
 Stable standard appearance and quality of products, through classification and
    sorting of products by sizes, color, ripeness, firmness or softness; and
 Standard packaging.
    At the same time, there are important developments taking place in the Rus-
sian market. Particularly, competition in the Russian market drastically intensifies,
despite international economic sanctions against Russia and limitations applied by
Russia lately on imports from Turkey.
    After lifting international economic sanctions against Iran last year, Iran’s role
in exporting vegetables and fruits to the Russian market will probably grow. As
shown in tables below, prices offered by Iranian vegetable producers are rather
competitive. At the same time, competition from other countries grows as well.
Israel too, which has over 8,000 hectares under greenhouse crops, may play a se-
rious role in supplying certain crops, such as strawberries, to the Russian market.
    In addition, there is such factors as notable expansion of greenhouse areas and
developments in the Russian greenhouse sector, and Russian greenhouse producers
also are serious competitors.
    For comparison with international prices, the tables below introduce prices
(particularly, producer prices) of several crops.25 Such comparison is useful, though
prices introduced are not differentiated by greenhouse and open-field crops.

   Rapid expansion of greenhouse farms is also taking place in other countries of
the region. For comparison, the table below shows areas under greenhouses in a
number of countries.

                           Greenhouse space (ha), 2014
                                      Armenia           760
                                         Israel        8,000

                                   Netherlands        ~10,000

     With the depreciation of the national currency of Russia, financial risks of
Armenian exporters grow, and hence, their competitive positions weaken. In this
respect, Armenian businesses should pay attention to increasing competitiveness of
their products, in terms of both cost reduction and product assortment and qual-
ity. In parallel, efforts should be directed at exploring and entering other markets,
besides Russian.

   Product quality, sorting and packaging
    Large greenhouses, which deal with large buyers, apply advance technologies
of product sorting and packaging. However, improved technologies of product
sorting, ensuring stable quality and appearance, packaging, and marketing are not
yet widespread among SMEs in the greenhouse sector.
   As mentioned above, the practice of banding together in order to market green-


                                         38
house crops jointly has not yet been adopted in Armenia. Agricultural producers’
unions and cooperatives may play an important role in that process. For example,
the Greenhouse Association of Armenia may coordinate and unite capacities of
its members. In this context, several Russian organizations have already applied
to the Greenhouse Association of Armenia for arranging the export of vegetables;
currently, the association faces difficulties in terms of collecting and delivering suf-
ficient amount of vegetables.
   For uniting capacities of small and medium producers, it is also very important
to ensure the availability of cold storage facilities, where producers can collect,
sort, and package their products. With regard to export promotion, defining, and
enforcement of internationally compatible standards and technical requirements
among producers shall be highly prioritized. This equally refers to both greenhouse
and open-field agricultural production.
   At present, vegetables (cucumber, tomato) are transported and exported in
cardboard boxes with 7–8 kg carrying capacity. Business entities mention about
the difficulty of acquiring quality boxes and packages 2–3 years ago; but nowa-
days, local Armenian producers are capable of manufacturing and supplying card-
board boxes of high quality.

   Export permissions and procedures
    To export vegetables from Armenia, it is necessary to obtain a phytosanitary
certificate, which is issued by the Phytosanitary Inspectorate of the State Service
for Food Safety of the RA Ministry of Agriculture. Businesses have not reported
problems associated with obtaining phytosanitary certificates.

   Transportation routes and means
   Most of the vegetable exports are transported by road (trucks) and only a small
portion by air. Flowers are exported both by air and by trucks.
    Air transportation is fast, of course, which is a very important advantage es-
pecially for the export of flowers. Fresh flowers are delivered to the airport in
refrigerated trucks. According to businesses, average costs of shipment of flowers
via cargo airplanes from Armenia to Russia (Yerevan to Anapa) would amount to
$27,000.
    Export by passenger airplane is significantly cheaper, yet, it has limited devel-
opment opportunities, especially in terms of volume. Currently, there are 12 daily
flights from Yerevan to Moscow, which at best will provide an opportunity of ex-
porting 10–15 tons of products daily.26 The average cost of shipment by passenger
airplane per flower will amount to 60 AMD (USD 0.13).
    Export by trucks extends along a transit road through Georgia, entering Russia
at the Lars border crossing point. It is significantly slower than shipment by air

26	 According to businesses, 160 kg flowers are delivered in a cubic meter space.

                                          39
(taking several days to reach Moscow versus several hours by plane). The average
cost of transporting by a 20-ton truck is $2500–3000, plus unofficial payments per
each ton of goods.27
   Usually, refrigerated trucks are used for transportation of fresh vegetables.
    Business entities mention about shortage of trucks in the summer season, when
open field crops are harvested, and export volumes grow. In that case, Armenian
exporters use the services of ground cargo carriers from other countries, in partic-
ular, Russian or Georgian trucks.
    Shipment by ferry through Georgian seaports is not yet widespread for export
of vegetables; however, it could become an important route of exporting processed
products.
    Knowledge and capacity: For further development of the sector, there is a need
to enhance capacities and the knowledge of external markets and export opportu-
nities, as well as techniques of distribution channels development.

4.3 Export financing and insurance
   Insurance of export can be obtained in the market; however, business entities
face difficulties in receiving compensation for cargo loss or damage. It is difficult
and, often, impossible to receive compensation from insurance companies.
   In spite of the fact that risks at greenhouse farms are lower in comparison with
the entire agricultural sector, the insurance system fails to function in the green-
house sector as well, due to the high-risk level.




27	 According to businesses, unofficial payments may reach up to $0.2 per each kilogram.

5. SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURES AND
FACILITIES
5.1 Warehouses and storage
    To promote the development of the greenhouse sector and the production of
processed greenhouse products, Armenia will need adequate cold storage facilities
for collection, handling, and storing of fresh products, which in turn will require
(a) attraction of investment funds, and (b) training and development of specialists.
    The establishment of small and medium-scale crop collection, handling and
sorting enterprises will contribute to cooperation between economic entities (in
a form of cooperatives or associations), aimed at ensuring standard, high-quality,
and safe production meeting requirements dictated by the market, especially ex-
port markets.

5.2 Financing and financial institutions
    In general, the shortage of and the difficulty of accessing long-term and af-
fordable financial resources restricts the growth and development of businesses.
Interviews with businesses show that the application of sophisticated export and
investment finance instruments (such as working capital financing, funding of proj-
ects, trade finance instruments like credit lines, insurance, effective monitoring,
and so forth) needs to expand further, if it is to really fuel production and export
development, while integrating environment-friendly technologies and advanced
systems of food safety.

6. CONSIDERATIONS ON ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL PERORMANCE
    Investment requirements and economic and financial performance indicators
are critical for understanding the viability of greenhouse crop production, as well
as for making various business decisions. Below is a brief discussion about selected
economic and financial aspects of greenhouse crop production, to provide a gen-
eral picture about the business and its investment attractiveness.28 The analysis in
this section is for rough estimation purposes and is based on data collected from
businesses about market prices and investment and operational costs in the sector
in the given period, which may change over time and depending on the market and
be different from the figures presented below.

6.1 Investment requirements
   Based on the experience in the greenhouse sector in Armenia, the investment
cost of a greenhouse may vary in the range USD 80–200 per square meter of a
greenhouse area. This relates, particularly, to greenhouse systems often imported
by Armenian businesses from EU countries:
 Plastic greenhouse systems with heating, cooling and watering systems — USD
   80 per square meter, which is effective for establishing small greenhouses up to
   1 hectare, as well as large greenhouses. This includes transportation to Arme-
   nia, installation, and advice on operation of the greenhouse.
 Glass greenhouse systems, for hydroponic production, including sophisticated
   heating, cooling, and watering systems — USD 150–200 per square meter. This
   includes transportation to Armenia, installation, and advice on operation of
   the greenhouse.
   Note also that a simple, non-sophisticated greenhouse may cost around
USD40–50 per square meter.

6.2 Greenhouse operation
   For estimation of operation costs, the following three scenarios were consid-
ered.
1.	 Production of tomatoes in a plastic greenhouse of up to 1 hectare, with crop
    cultivation in soil.
2.	 Production of tomatoes in a glass greenhouse of 5 hectares, with hydroponic
    crop cultivation.
3.	 Production of flowers (carnations) in a plastic greenhouse of one hectares.
   Calculations of costs are based on practical information on annual average
costs and prices collected in the market and through interviews with businesses
28	 For simplicity, the calculations in this section are not very detailed; they do not in-
    clude depreciation of greenhouses and equipment. These details can be added.

involved in greenhouse crop production and marketing. The calculations in this
section are for demonstration purposes, and may differ from business to business,
depending on markets, the seasonality, exchange rate fluctuations, and other fac-
tors.

             Other costs               0.02                         0.009

       Break-even price                0.94                         0.512

    It can be seen from the table above that due to production efficiencies (higher
yield) the costs of producing 1 kilogram of produce much lower in case of large
hydroponic production. In Armenia, the yield per square meter of greenhouse area
is no more than 20 kg/m2 while the yield in a sophisticated hydroponic greenhouse
is 50–60 kg/ m2. As a result, the farm gate price of one kilogram of tomato is more
than 1.7 times lower in the large sophisticated greenhouse. Gas cost is a major cost
item, which affects the price competitiveness of greenhouse vegetables produced in
Armenia. In small greenhouses gas cost represent a higher proportion in the total
production costs (more than 58%), compared to the cost structure in large green-
houses with advanced technologies (around 49%).

   Sales price of one flower in the Russian market, for example, is about USD
0.50.

6.3 Profitability and return on investment
    Assuming that the producer is able to sell all its produce in the market, and
based on the figures presented above, the profitability and return on investment
figures for the tomato and flower (carnation) production will be as follows. As it
could be expected, a sophisticated greenhouse vegetable production provides much
higher return on investment and profitability. In comparison to tomato produc-
tion, in terms of profitability and return on investment, flower production provides
higher performance.

7. GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
     Promoting the production and export of greenhouse products is one of the
priority directions in the agenda of the RA government. In 2013, the government
adopted29 a Concept of Promotion of Creation of Greenhouses in RA Farming En-
tities. Based on Armenia’s current situation in greenhouse agriculture, the concept
designs measures directed at:
 Ensuring financial resources for construction and modernization of green-
   house,30
 Training of agronomist-specialists servicing greenhouses, and
 Statistical accounting of greenhouses by regions, and improvement of statistical
   data collection by the RA National Statistical Service.
   By 2018, the concept plans increasing the greenhouse areas by three times,
and import substitution of greenhouse vegetables in the winter months. Measures
planned under the concept are not implemented yet.
   For promoting the development of greenhouse agriculture and the introduction
and application of advanced technologies, the RA government has established a
VAT privilege for the import of greenhouse structures.
    At the same time, for promotion of investments, the government has defined
special procedures providing customs duty and tax (particularly, VAT) privileges
(for instance, relief from customs duty payment and postponement of VAT pay-
ment) under RA Government decisions No 1118-N and 1119-N.31 In order to
enable economic entities to benefit effectively from the opportunities provided by
these decisions, there is a need to raise awareness among businesses.

29	 RA Government Protocol Decision No 53 of December 26, 2013, “On Approving the
    Concept and the Timetable of Promotion of Creation of Greenhouses in RA Farming
    Entities.”
30	 The concept envisages conducting negotiations with the Greenhouse Association of
    Armenia regarding setting of a revolving fund. Financial resources accumulated in the
    revolving fund will be provided, in preferential terms, for construction, reconstruc-
    tion and modernization of greenhouses, acquisition of solar water heating collectors,
    thermal pumps, or for supporting the implementation of other similar works.
31	 RA Government Decision No 1118-N of September 17, 2015 “On Approving nec-
    essary conditions for enforcement of the relief from import duty on technological
    equipment, components and accessories thereof, raw material and substances im-
    ported within the frameworks of the investment program in priority sectors, and
    recognizing an authorized body.”
    RA Government Decision No 1119-N of August 4, 2011, “On approving the proce-
    dures of electing organizations and private entrepreneurs for the extension of periods
    of ’Temporary exportation’ applied to goods exported under the customs arrange-
    ment of ‘Temporary exportation’ and deadline delays, and electing organizations and
    private entrepreneurs for the payment delay of value added tax amount calculated by
    customs bodies in case of importation of goods, and on the revocation of RA Gov-
    ernment Decision No 600-N of April 30, 2009.”

                                           45
    For further development of the sector, taking targeted measures by the govern-
ment becomes high priority, in order to promote target investments. Such measures
imply development and encouragement of special loan and grant terms (a) to en-
courage investments in introduction of high (highly productive, energy-saving and
environmentally friendly) technologies, and (b) to establish and develop warehous-
es and cold storage facilities.
    There is a need for development, adoption, and enforcement of effective qual-
ity and safety standards to production and products, based on the requirements
dictated by markets, especially export markets. This can be promoted through
supporting establishment of small and medium-scale harvest collection, handling
and sorting facilities.
    In 2016, the Export Promotion Council was set by RA Prime Minister’s Deci-
sion No 5-A.32 The Council’s mission is to provide target assistance to economic
entities exporting goods from Armenia. Fresh fruits and vegetables are not includ-
ed in the list of priority products. The list of products defined as priorities in the
first half of 2016 includes:
   Wine
   Fruit spirits
   Canned goods
   Meat products
   Fish, fisheries

    tion of an Export Promotion Council for supporting exports, approving the working
    procedure of the Export Promotion Council, the procedures of submission and eval-
    uation of requests from RA resident economic entities to receive support, aproval of
