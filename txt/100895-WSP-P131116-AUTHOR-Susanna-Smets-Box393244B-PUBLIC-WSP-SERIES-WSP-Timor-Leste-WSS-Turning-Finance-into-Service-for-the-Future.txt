Timor-Leste
Turning Finance into
Services for the Future
This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies, and
Timor-Leste organizations. The National Directorate of Basic Sanitation, National Directorate for Water, Ministry of Health,
Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (formerly AusAID) BESIK Water Supply and Sanitation
Program, and Asian Development Bank have been key partners, together with the Water and Sanitation Program, in analyz-
ing the sector. The authors acknowledge the valuable contributions made by the World Bank Country Management Unit,
WaterAid, UNICEF, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Cruz Vermelha de Timor-Leste (Red Cross), and National De-
velopment Agency.

The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and the Pacific is Susanna Smets. The fol-
lowing World Bank staff and consultants have contributed to the service delivery assessment process and report: Isabel
Blackett, Penny Dutton, Sandra Giltner, Arlindo Marcal, Rosalyn Fernandes, Joao dos Martires, Maria Madeira, and Almud
Weitz. The report was reviewed by Alex Grumbley, Country Representative, WaterAid Timor-Leste and Keryn Clark, Program
Director, BESIK Water Supply and Sanitation Program Timor-Leste. The report was peer reviewed by the following World
Bank staff and sector colleagues: Michel Kerf, Sector Manager; Shyam KC, Disaster Risk Management Specialist; Lilian
Pena Pereira Weiss, Senior Water and Sanitation Specialist; Ansye Sopacua, Sanitation Advisor, BESIK Water Supply and
Sanitation Program; and Allison Woodruff, Urban Development Specialist, Asian Development Bank. Thanks go to Luis
Constantino, Timor-Leste Country Manager; Towfiqua Hoque, Senior Infrastructure Specialist; and Alexander Jett, Research
Analyst for providing comments to the report.

The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bank’s Wa­  ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This re-
gional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conduct­ ed in
more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.

An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to as­       sess the ad-
equacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service de­   livery pathways. SDA’s
contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for infrastructure
and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fi­   nance is effectively turned into accelerated
and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.

The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Group’s Water Global Practice, sup-
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSP’s donors
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nor-
way, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank.

  As much as 70% of Timor-Leste’s infrastructure—houses, schools, shops, offices, irrigation systems, water supplies, and nearly 100% of the country’s
electrical grid—were destroyed during the retaliatory withdrawal of the Indonesian military in late 1999. For water supply this included pumping stations,
transmission pipes, valves and tanks. Numerous sources describe the level of destruction, including: (1) The World Bank, Timor-Leste Overview, viewed 29

  According to the JMP, an improved drinking-water source is one that, by the nature of its construction, adequately protects the source from outside
contamination, particularly fecal matter eg. piped water into dwelling, piped water to yard/plot, public tap or standpipe, tubewell or borehole, protected dug
well, protected spring, rainwater. An improved sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact eg. flush toilet, piped
sewer system, septic tank, flush/pour flush to pit latrine, ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP), pit latrine with slab, composting toilet.

 Notes: Investments that do not expand coverage are not included. While there is NGO investment in water supply, it was not possible to determine comprehensively (many small NGOs
 operate “off budget”). Most NGO expenditure in sanitation, especially in rural sanitation, is non-capital spending, such as technical assistance and capacity development (“software”).
 The percentage of estimated requirement is calculated as anticipated government expenditure over total requirements (from Table 2.2). Annual surplus/deficit is the difference between
 the annual investment required (Table 2.2) and anticipated. Totals may not add up due to rounding. Source: SDA estimates based on information supplied by government, development
 partners, and NGOs.

      Priority actions for institutional framework
      •	 Increase autonomy, incentives and accountability of DNSA for improving urban water supply services
      •	 Clarify asset ownership and maintenance roles of rural water supply schemes
      •	 Strengthen service delivery at district and subdistrict levels including increasing human resources and technical capacity,
         and improving coordination
      •	 Continue awareness building on options for private sector involvement, and reviewing options appropriate for the stage
         of sector development to address capacity constraints
      •	 Increase Government commitment to meeting WASH human resource needs including taking responsibility for staff posi-
         tions currently funded by donors (if needed) and recruiting adequate numbers of urban and rural staff for DNSB
      •	 Clarify the responsibilities and improve coordination between Ministries of Public Works, State Administration, Health,
         Education, Tourism etc. in water supply, sanitation, hygiene, and water resources

 Capacity shortfall

 Timor-Leste in general has a shortfall of skilled personnel
 across many sectors, including WASH. Increased resources
 and capacity are needed in all subsectors of WASH. For
 example, DNSB has gone very rapidly from a department
 to a national directorate. Human resources are especially
 needed in rural water supply and rural sanitation if targets
 are to be met.58 Simply to meet the MDG targets, there is
 demand for an estimated 25 to 70 engineers and 120 to just
 over 300 technicians across all sectors. The biggest short-
 fall in positions (where the demand will not be met from
 annual output of qualified graduates alone) is for techni-
 cians (drillers, plumbers, carpenters, welders, electricians,

   PDD1 and PDD2 include funding for water supply in communities that are classified as “urban”. Despite their small populations, district capitals in Timor-
 Leste are generally classified as “urban” even though modes of water supply and sanitation delivery may more typically be “rural” (small piped systems, wells,
 onsite sanitation). The sanitation in these funds is typically public sanitation on the Indonesian MCK or MCK-plus model, but there seems to be some minor
 funding of household sanitation.

       •	 Provide implementation support and training to improve data quality and analytical use of the water, sanitation and hy-
          giene information system (SIBS).
       •	 Improve performance monitoring, and public disclosure for urban water supply to increase accountability.
       •	 Develop asset registers and asset management systems for all urban water supplies in preparation for O&M contracting.
       •	 Synchronize data and definitions from different sources in support of robust national country monitoring systems.
       •	 Set up subsector multi-stakeholder annual reviews to monitor past progress and agree corrective actions.

      Priority actions for rural water supply
      •	 Establish clear policies and define government and community responsibilities for O&M of rural water systems.
      •	 Ensure budget is available for technical support systems for O&M services of community-managed schemes.
      •	 Increase functionality of water supply schemes by a) improving the spare parts supply chain, b) increasing numbers and
         skills of technical staff in districts, and c) professionalizing management of rural water supply through contracting of
         NGOs and the private sector.
      •	 Make district budgets transparent to show water supply funding from DNSA, decentralized projects, development part-
         ners and NGOs.
      •	 Finalize community engagement processes to improve community involvement in water supply scheme development
         and operation, and harmonize approaches with decentralized projects.
      •	 Develop and enforce legislation that is sensitive to traditional customs in order to protect springs and other water re-
         sources from illegal use.

      •	 Strengthen sanitation markets and ensure supplies of sanitation materials and services in all 13 districts
      •	 Strengthen the targeting of sanitation subsidies as part of the vulnerable households program and ensure an appropriate
         delivery mechanism that does not undermine a market-based approach
      •	 Develop integrated national and district plans for increasing sanitation access; monitor and evaluate these plans

     Scorecard and Evidence for Scoring
     The following table presents the scores and evidence for each service delivery indicator. Each indicator can score 0, 0.5 or a maximum of 1. These scores are combined
     to form a total score for each of the nine service delivery building blocks — policy, planning, budget, expenditure, equity, output, maintenance, expansion, user outcome.
     The overall building block scores for each subsector are presented in the relevant subsector sections of the report. The scores were derived from a series of workshops
     with the participation of several stakeholders: DNSA, SAS district staff, DNSB, Ministry of Education, ADN, district administration staff (Manututo, Liquica, Baucau, Dili),
     Ministry of Health, Chief Cabinet office, BESIK program, ADB, WaterAid, Red Cross, UNICEF, HTL.

 Operations and Maintenance

 The estimates of operations and maintenance costs are de-
 rived from averaging a set percentage of existing technolo-
 gies and expected future technologies to get an average
 cost. These are assumed to be 3% of the capital cost for
 water supply piped onto premises or public taps, and 1.5%
 of the capital cost of other types of water supply technolo-
 gies. For sanitation, the estimate is 3% of the capital cost
 for networked sewerage and for pour flush/flush into tanks
 or pits, and 1.5% for other technologies. When estimating
 O&M costs, there is no distinction between urban and rural
 sanitation and water supply, however total O&M costs (in
 Table A2.6) are pro-rated according to the predicted tech-
 nology distribution for 2020.

 Table A.2.6 below presents annual estimates of O&M costs
 in 2011 and 2020, and the average.
