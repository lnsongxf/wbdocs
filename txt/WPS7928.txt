1. Introduction

       Over the past three decades, foreign direct investment (FDI)1 to Africa has increased by

approximately 1,325 percent, from $4 billion in 1980 to around $ 57 billion in 2013 (Figure 1). A

large proportion of these investments have been from the European Union (EU). However, after

the 2008 world financial crises, emerging economies consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China,

and South Africa (BRICS) have become a significant source of FDI to Africa. For example, the

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2013) estimated that in

2010, 41 percent of foreign capital flows to Africa came from the EU, 23 percent from North

America, 25 percent from BRICS, and 59 percent from advanced countries—in particular,

advanced (group 7, G7) countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and

the United States of America).

       Since the crisis, FDI from G7 countries (particularly from UK and France) to Africa has

been declining, and the BRICS’ FDI share (mainly China and India) has been increasing

(UNCTAD, 2015). For example, between 2007 and 2012, FDI stock from BRICS to African

countries increased by 204 percent and that from G7 countries by only 11 percent. This is in

contrast to the 2001-2006 period where G7 FDI stock in Africa increased by 90 percent while

that of BRICS declined by 26 percent. More recently, the shock to the Chinese market has had a

negative impact on FDI flows to Africa (Klasa, 2015), highlighting the increasing importance of

these flows for Africa. Given that FDI is the most dominant form of private capital for the

region, reversal in these flows could have detrimental effects on Africa’s financing needs,

investment, and growth.

     What is the likely impact of the continued surge of BRICS’ direct investment in Africa? Is

this surge supportive of labor productivity growth and employment? Interest in and debate on

these questions stem from the increased global influence of BRICS in recent years, including

from their direct investment in Africa. The BRICS’ increased investment in Africa has led to

increased competition for the continent’s natural resources and burgeoning consumer demand,

enabling Africa to increase and diversify its trade and improve its terms of trade (Clus-Rossouw,

Viviers and Loots, 2015; Mlachila and Takebe 2011). Increasing labor costs in BRICS (as their

economies become more industrialized), also present an opportunity for Africa to attract FDI that

promotes employment generating growth and economic diversification. In fact a number of case

studies document the growing trend of BRICS’ firms moving to establish themselves in Africa

for various reasons, namely to: position themselves to take advantage of the burgeoning

consumer demand; reduce production costs related to exporting raw material from Africa to their

home countries; take advantage of Africa’s regional and international trade agreements

(especially with the European Union and United States); and mitigate higher labor costs in their

home countries (Pigato and Tang 2015; Shen 2015; Chakrabarti and Ghosh 2013; Warmerdam

and van Dijk 2013). All these reasons are consistent with Dunning’s (2001) eclectic paradigm of

why firms engage in international production.2 These higher levels of investments would ideally

lead to higher employment and labor productivity.

     There are, however, challenges and critiques labeled against emerging economies (BRICS)

regarding lax attention to governance, labor standards and safety issues. These institutional


2
  Specifically, the eclectic paradigm cites three broad reasons: (i) ownership advantages which enable these firms to
compete in a foreign location because they possess certain ‘competitive’ or ‘monopolistic’ advantages that can
compensate for the additional costs associated with setting up and operating abroad; (ii) internalization or the
transferring of its ownership advantage within the firm across borders or direct investment abroad, rather than
licensing or franchising to a third party; (iii) location considerations that may include local factors endowment and
availability, geographical factors or legislation related to the production and licensing of technology, patent system,
tax and exchange rate policies that multinational enterprises may wish to either avoid or exploit.

factors have been found to have real long-run effects on macroeconomic fundamentals

(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005; Acemoglu and Robinson 2013; North 1990). As such,

if overlooked, the resulting negative consequences may undermine any positive impact of

BRICS’ direct investment on labor productivity and employment in Africa. In other instances, it

is feared that local firms could be disadvantaged by imports from BRICS (which may benefit

consumers, but result in undesirable consequences for Africa’s manufacturing sector, job

creation, and economic growth), particularly when intermediate inputs and factors of production

are not locally sourced (Pigato and Tang 2015).

    This paper contributes to the nascent empirical literature on the effect of emerging

economies’ direct investment on labor productivity growth and employment in low-income

countries. First, it takes Africa as a case study where there has been a dearth of evidence-based

rigorous studies on the topic despite the huge potential for FDI to generate significant growth

benefits. Second, it examines the differences in labor productivity growth and employment

effects between BRICS’ and the G7’s direct investment. A handful of empirical studies have

attempted to conduct a comparative analysis of emerging versus advanced countries’ direct

investment effects in Africa. One such study is Kabelwa (2004), which shows that technology

transfer from South African companies to Tanzania has a greater impact on productivity

compared to that from OECD companies. Third, this paper contributes to the broader empirical

literature on the increasing impact of BRICS trade and investment on developing countries.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides a review of the related

literature, and section 3 specifies the regression model. Section 4 describes the data used and

stylized facts about FDI in Africa. Section 5 is devoted to the analysis of estimated results, and

the final section concludes.

2. Has Africa benefited from foreign direct investment?

    There is considerable literature on the economic impacts of FDI on the host country,

including; growth effects, technology spillover effects, backward and forward linkage effects,

trade effects, and competition effects (Kim, Lee, and Lee 2015). Through FDI, domestic firms

get access to new knowledge, production systems, managerial skills, and technology, all of

which have the potential to increase productivity in the host country. The presence of foreign

firms also creates backward and forward linkage opportunities where domestic firms can develop

beneficial networks with foreign-owned firms. Backward linkages not only provide domestic

firms’ access to human, technology, and material resources but also tend to improve

competitiveness of these firms. Domestic firms can learn from foreign-invested firms by

observation or by establishing business relations with the latter or through labor turnover as

domestic employees move from foreign to domestic firms. An increase in FDI can induce more

investments in human capital, which in turn enhances the catch-up potential of the recipient

country (Liu, 2008).

     Much of the existing evidence, however, focuses on how FDI contributes to the host

country’s economic growth, with various studies yielding different results (ranging from

positive, negative, to inconclusive). For example, Borensztein et al. (1998), Li and Liu (2005),

and Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles (2003) found that FDI boosts economic growth; Khose, Prasad

and Terrones (2009), Akinlo (2004), Saltz (1992) on the contrary found negative effects; and

Khose, Prasad and Terrones (2009) and de Mello (1997) obtained mixed results. These variations

in results could be attributed to differences in the sampling periods, country coverage, whether or

not FDI is disaggregated by sector, the nature of control variables, and estimation methods.




                                                 6
    On the South-South FDI-growth enhancing effects, Busse, Erdogan, and Muhlen (2016) and

Fu and Buckley (2015) have concluded that Chinese FDI has an impressive impact on growth in

Africa. Similarly, Weisbrod and Whalley (2011) who evaluated the impact of Chinese FDI on

13 big economies in Africa found that FDI contributed about 0.5 percent to GDP growth over the

period 1990-2008. Fu and Buckley (2015) also arrived at a similar conclusion in which for every

10 percent increase in the share of Chinese FDI in total inward FDI to Africa, GDP per capita

increased by 0.09 percent. Given that Chinese direct investment share in total inward FDI to

Africa increased from 1.85 percent in 2004 to 6.85 at its peak in 2007, this suggests a

contribution of 0.045 percent to per capita income growth in Africa over 2004-2007.

    Sectoral growth effects of BRICS’ investment in Africa is another area that has attracted

scholars’ interest. Studies that have explored this route include Mlachila and Takebe (2011),

Chakrabartin and Ghosh (2014), Pigato and Tang (2015), and Shen (2013). They provide

evidence of BRICS’ direct investment contributing to rapid growth of the oil sector in South

Sudan, and helping to strengthen the country’s balance of payments (Mlachila and Takebe,

2011). Other sectors that have benefited from BRICS’ direct investment include manufacturing

and services sectors (Chakrabartin and Ghosh 2014; Pigato and Tang 2015; Shen 2015). For

example, BRICS have concentrated in agro-processing and garment manufacturing in Ghana

(Waldkirch 2010), and have contributed to increasing value added in both upstream and

downstream industries such as refineries in Nigeria and copper-wires processing in Zambia.

They have helped rehabilitate railway lines in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia,

Liberia and Guinea, which are necessary in facilitating trade within and across these countries.

All these activities have both direct and indirect (via spillovers) effects on growth, employment

creation, and labor productivity in these countries.



                                                 7
    Another strand of FDI literature is on the relationship between FDI and employment in the

host country, where evidence suggests that inward FDI creates jobs, particularly through

Greenfield investments (Javorcik 2015). A recent study by Coniglio, Prota and Seric (2015) uses

UNIDOs’ Africa Investor Survey (which is representative at the firm level) to show that FDI,

especially multinational enterprises (MNEs) from the South, have on average contributed 14.2

and 10.6 percent more employment than domestic firms and North MNEs, respectively. More

importantly, Chinese firms were found to have the largest labor demand followed by those from

South Africa and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Further, the study showed

that Chinese and South African firms tended to require less-skill intensive workers; while local

firms that were in joint partnership MNEs were associated with a higher skilled workforce.

    Notwithstanding the positive employment effects of FDI at the individual firm level,

indications from the literature are that FDI could lead to crowding-out effects on less competitive

domestic firms, eventually resulting in a net reduction in employment for the economy.

Attracting FDI that is capital-intensive could also impact employment negatively in labor surplus

economies such as those in Africa. A reduction in employment could also occur depending on

whether FDI takes the form of acquisitions or mergers, even if this leads to greater efficiency

(through streamlining the workforce) in the long-run.

3. Model specification

    In our quest to examine the labor productivity growth effects of emerging economies’

(BRICS’) versus advanced (G7) countries’ direct investment in Africa, we adopt a neoclassical

growth model (Solow 1956; 1957) as specified in equation 1 below:

Where, lpit is the annual growth rate of output per person employed in country i in year t, and ln

is the natural logarithm operator. Country-specific and time fixed effects are denoted by υi and

ηt, respectively. Direct investment from BRICS’ and G7 countries’ are the main variables of our

interest.

     The growth literature (Barro 1991; Levine and Renelt 1992; Sala-i-Martin et al. 2004)

guides us in selecting the core set of labor productivity growth determinants, however the

estimated model variables are constrained by data availability. The initial level of output per

worker (‫ݕ‬௜௧ିଵ ) is included to test for the presence of β-convergence. Control variables include:

Open, or openness which is measured as the share of trade volume in GDP; governance (Gov),

which is proxied by the Polity2 index; and human capital development (Edu) captured by gross

primary school enrollment.

     Further, we investigate effects of BRICS’ versus G7 countries’ direct investment on

employment in selected African countries using equation 2:

        Empi t  0 ln yi t 1  1 ln BRICS ' s Ii t   2 ln G7' s Ii t  3 ln Openi t   4Govi t  5 ln Edui t

     Where, Emp is employment to population ratio of people aged 15 years and older, ‫ݕ‬௜௧ିଵ is

growth rate of output (controlling for cyclical employment effects) in country i at time t-1, Tel is

the percentage of the population with access to fixed line telephone, which is used as a proxy for

the impact of infrastructure development. The remaining control variables are as defined in

equation 1.

     The models in equations 1 and 2 exhibit a number of methodological issues. Endogeneity

bias may arise due to the potential endogeneity of labor productivity growth and employment

determinants such as trade, human capital, FDI, and governance variables. On the other hand, it



                                                         9
is possible, for example, that low productivity growth may attract less investment and similarly

higher investment may lead to higher productivity growth; or both investment and productivity

growth may be jointly determined by a third variable. In such instances, the model will suffer

from reverse causality and simultaneity bias. Other biases that may affect the consistency of the

estimates include the heterogeneity (omitted variable) bias and measurement error (in the

independent variables).

    To minimize the above effects, we adopt the system generalized method of moments

(SGMM) approach of Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998). SGMM

controls for endogeneity bias, measurement bias, unobserved country fixed effects, and other

potentially omitted variables. Relative to difference GMM, SGMM is robust to weak instrument

bias. It uses suitable lagged levels and lagged first differences of the regressors as instruments.

Furthermore, we include time dummies to capture universal time-related shocks from errors

(Roodman 2009).


4. Hypotheses on BRICS’ versus G7 countries’ FDI in Africa

     The rise in BRICS’ direct investment to Africa has led to increasing debate over the

differential effects of BRICS’ versus G7 countries’ FDI. In our quest to empirically establish the

economic impact of BRICS’ versus G7 countries’ direct investment in Africa we formulate the

hypotheses below:

    First, BRICS investment is more likely to bring technologies that are better aligned to local

factor proportions and are readily adaptable to local conditions in Africa, thereby yielding greater

spillover effects. This could be attributed to the fact that some of the emerging markets’ firms

are still in the process of moving up the technology ladder relative to their developed countries’

counterparts. Thus, to the extent that emerging economies’ multinationals have greater


                                                 10
familiarity with technology and business practices suitable for developing-countries’ markets,

they may enjoy some advantages over firms from developed countries when investing in other

developing countries. Moreover, to the extent that a country’s absorptive capacity is greater with

a smaller technological gap between foreign and domestic firms, it implies that the smaller

South-South (BRICS-Africa) technological gap compared to that of the North-South (G7-Africa)

may be an advantage for Africa’s absorption of BRICS’ technology (Durham 2004). For

example, Goldstein (2003) notes that South African telecommunications company MTN was

able to tap into its in-house expertise to launch service packages in other African countries that

were better aligned to local demand than its competitor from Britain. Nunnenkamp and Spatz

(2004) find that technology transfer is facilitated by a smaller technology gap. Furthermore,

Takii (2011), Pfeiffer, Gorg and Perez-Villar (2010), Gorodnichenko, Svejnar and Terrel (2007)

show that the labor-intensive nature of emerging economies’ FDI results in greater productivity

and employment compared to that from developed countries.

    The second hypothesis holds that investment from emerging economies (BRICS) is more

poised to move into small and risky markets relative to that from developed (G7) countries.

Managing economic and political risks is an area where emerging countries’ multi-nationals may

have relative advantage due to the experience in dealing with such constraints in their home

countries. There is also evidence that developing countries’ firms may be more willing to

assume the risks of post-conflict and other politically difficult situations (Shen 2015). It is

important to note that these hypotheses do not necessarily imply that South–South investment is

more beneficial than North–South investment.

    5. Data and stylized facts on FDI in Africa

      5.1. Data

       The analysis is done on a sample of 163 African countries over the period 2001-2012.

Primary school enrollment4 (defined as the total enrollment in primary education, regardless of

age, expressed as a percentage of the population at the official primary education age), trade

openness (exports plus imports as a share of GDP), fixed line telephone subscription (per 100

people), and labor productivity (output per employed individuals, generated based on 2005

constant prices) are accessed from World Bank’s World Development Indicators (2016).

Bilateral FDI stock of BRICS and G7 countries are from UNCTAD statistics (2016). BRICS’

and G7 countries’ direct investment stock to an African country i at time t, is calculated as the

sum of FDI from individual BRICS and G7 countries at time t. Since the UNCTAD data does

not contain sector level bilateral FDI flows, data on Greenfield investments are used to examine

the recent trends in sectoral investments. The Polity2 governance index, which is reported on a

scale of -10 to +10, with -10 indicating strongly autocratic and +10 strongly democratic political

systems, is obtained from the Polity IV Project (Marshall and Jaggers 2011). Tables A.1 and A.2

of the appendix contain respectively, the sample of countries used in this study and summary

statistics for selected variables.




     5.2. Stylized facts on FDI in Africa

       To get a sense of the sectoral level flows, we exploit data on Greenfield FDI in Africa,

which has grown by almost five-fold since 2000. It increased from US$ 12.5 billion in 2000 to


3
 The availability of data on BRICS FDI restricts us to 16 African countries.

 Primary school gross enrollment ratio can exceed 100% due to the inclusion of over-aged and under-aged students
because of early or late school entrance and grade repetition

                                                      12
US$ 55.2 billion in 2015 and peaked at US$ 66.4 billion in 2008 (EY 2015). The majority of

this Greenfield FDI is from Western Europe and other African countries. At the country level,

the United States (US) ranks first among the top 10 Greenfield investors in Africa, followed by

United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa (tied at No. 2), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), France

and Germany. China and India rank 7 and 8 respectively (Table 1). In terms of job creation, out

of all firms that received Greenfield FDI in Africa, those that received it from UAE created the

most jobs (24 percent) in 2014, followed by firms that received Greenfield FDI from the US (7.2

percent) and France (6.6 percent). Firms that received Greenfield FDI from China and India on

the other hand, created 9.4 percent of jobs, with China creating 5.8 percent.

    At the sectoral level, technology, media and telecommunication topped the list of the most

attractive sectors for Greenfield FDI projects in Africa, receiving 19.6 percent of Africa’s FDI

                                                                                 13
projects in 2014. This was followed by financial services (18.1 percent) and consumer products

and retail (14.1 percent). The natural resource sector (coal, oil, and natural gas) ranked 9th and

accounted for only 3.5 percent of all Greenfield projects in Africa in 2014. As shown in Table 1

above, consumer products and retail (33.6 percent), and real estate, hospitality and construction

(33.6 percent) sectors are the biggest creators of Greenfield FDI-related jobs; yet, these sectors

are ranked 3rd and 4th on the list of attractive sectors for FDI in the region (based on fDi Market

surveys). The two most attractive sectors to foreign investors are technology, media, and

telecommunications, and financial services created only 6.4 and 2 percent respectively, of

Africa’s Greenfield FDI-related jobs in 2014. Overall, US, UK, and France’s direct Greenfield

investments tend to be concentrated in: technology, media and telecommunication, transport and

logistics, consumer products and retail, business services, and financial services sectors. Chinese

FDI is also predominantly in technology, media and telecommunications sector, where

approximately 33 percent of its projects in Africa were concentrated in 2014 (EY 2015).


    Many analysts have tended to assume that much of FDI to Africa is in the natural resource

sector. However, the preceding and recent evidence on Greenfield investments suggests that

there has been a change over time. In the past, foreign investors may have been attracted to

Africa solely because of its abundance of natural resources, especially in oil and ores. However,

recent evidence puts rising urbanization and an expanding consumer base as some of the major

determining factors for FDI to Africa. As a result, the large economies of the continent: South

Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, Morocco and recently, Ethiopia and Mozambique have

attracted the majority of the FDI, with South Africa leading the group.


    UNCTAD data (covering both Greenfield and non-Greenfield FDI) shows that a large

proportion of FDI is from Western Europe (which makes up the bulk of G7 countries) and at a

                                                 14
country level, most FDI to Africa comes from the U.S. Consequently, it is not surprising that G7

countries accounted for 72 percent of the combined BRICS’s and G7’s direct investment stock in

Africa between 2001 and 2012 (Table 2). The majority of BRICS’s direct investment went to

Tanzania, followed by Zimbabwe, Angola and Botswana. In contrast, G7 countries’ direct

investment was predominantly in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of Congo and

Tanzania. Moreover, G7 countries’ direct investment tends to dominate that of the BRICS in

most African countries with the exception of Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of

Congo and Botswana, where the proportion of BRICS’ direct investment is relatively higher than

that from G7 countries.

    Overall, a large proportion of BRICS’ direct investment in Africa is from South Africa,

China and India. Brazil and Russia have minimal investment activities in Africa with Brazil’s

presence noted only in Liberia and Angola, while investment from Russia goes to Botswana

only. In fact Russia has negative investment stock in Tanzania. China, on the other hand, has

investment activities in 75 percent of the 16 countries used in this study, while India and South

Africa are engaged in 63 and 43 percent of the countries, respectively (Table 3).


    Although this paper does not test for the investment motives of the BRICS versus G7

countries, a closer look at cross-country distributions of BRICS’ direct investment in Africa

shows some interesting patterns. In the case of South Africa, a large proportion of its direct

investment goes to countries within its geographical proximity or to countries where it has close

cultural affinities including Botswana (30 percent), Tanzania (29 percent), Uganda (21 percent)

and Kenya (15 percent). This suggests that proximity to the home country plays some role in

determining investment location for South Africa’s multinationals. Also, all the aforementioned

countries are English-speaking. These observations are consistent with findings in the FDI

literature on the factors that determine FDI location, which show that efficiency seeking

investors are influenced by geographical proximity to home country in order to minimize

transportation costs (Demesk et al 2005).


    For China and India, a combination of factors may be at play in regard to the sector and

country destination of their direct investment. In the case of India, 49 percent of its investment is

concentrated in Uganda (a relatively non-resource rich country), suggesting that factors such as

historical or cultural ties could be at play given the historical settlement of Indians in the country;

28 percent of Indian FDI is concentrated in Gabon and maybe resource seeking; and another 22

percent is concentrated in Tanzania where it could be argued that this is supported by historical

ties linked to a shared social ideology from 1960s coupled with a history of Indian settlement.

    China’s FDI spans a number of countries with the biggest recipients including (as shown in

Table 3): The Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Republic of Congo

Equatorial Guinea, Chad, and Côte d’Ivoire. Although many of these are resource rich, China’s

recent investments are increasingly going to the manufacturing and construction sectors (in both

resource and non-resource rich countries). Shen (2015) shows that 44 percent of Chinese FDI

(based on data from investment promotion agencies of 6 African countries in 2011, namely,

Nigeria, Ethiopia, Zambia, Liberia, Rwanda and Ghana) flows to the manufacturing sector in

                                                          17
these countries, followed by 26 percent going to the services sector. Energy and mining (7.4

percent), agriculture, forestry fishing (2.6 percent), account for a total of 10 percent of all

Chinese FDI projects. Chen et. al. (2015) also provides a more detailed case study of Ethiopia

which shows that recent flows of Chinese FDI has been focused in the manufacturing and

construction sectors.

    With reference to G7 countries’ direct investment; France, Italy and UK tend to have a large

presence in countries where they have political, cultural or social ties, especially, in their former

colonies or formerly occupied territories (Table 4). For example, Italy has a large presence in

Ethiopia, while France has a strong presence in Chad, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Côte

d’Ivoire and Cameroon. Japan and Canada have very limited involvement in Africa. On the

contrary, the US has investment in all 16 countries used in this study with the exception of Chad.

This implies that relative to other G7 countries, the United States is an equal opportunity

investor. Nonetheless, it has its favorite host countries, some of which are resource rich.


6. Estimation results

6.1. Labor productivity growth effects of BRICS’ versus G7 counties’ direct investment

   To determine the labor productivity growth effects of BRICS’ versus G7 countries’ direct

investment, we estimate equation 1 where both measures of FDI are included in the model.

Results reported in Table 5 show that while BRICS’s direct investment has productivity

enhancing effects in Africa; that of G7 countries retards productivity growth. For example, with

every 10 percent increase in FDI stock from BRICS, the growth in labor productivity of African

countries increases by 2.4-3.0 percent annually (columns 1-4). In contrast, a 10 percent increase

in FDI stock from G7 countries, decreases labor productivity by 1.5-1.6 percent (columns 1-2).

Moreover, the level of human capital appears to complement the effectiveness of both BRICS’s

and G7 countries’ FDI. In other words, when human capital is included, the level of significance

of BRICS’ FDI coefficient increases by between 1 and 10 percent. However, the magnitude of

the impact decreases from 0.3 to 0.24. In the case of G7 countries’ investment, controlling for

human capital boosts the impact from negative to positive, but the effects are insignificant. The

observed increase in the level of significance of the coefficient of BRICS’ FDI when human

capital is controlled for, suggests that human capital has played a crucial role in making FDI a

significant driver of labor productivity growth in these countries.

    To isolate the effects of BRICS’s direct investment from G7 countries’, we estimate two

variants of equation 1. In Table 6 we report results of the models containing only BRICS’ direct

investment. Similar to the results in Table 5, this investment continues to have robust effects on

labor productivity growth but only when the level of human capital is controlled for.

Specifically, for every 10 percent increase in direct investment stock from BRICS, labor

productivity in Africa grows by 2.5-2.6 percentage points.

    Table 7 presents results for a model in which G7 countries’ FDI is the only measure of

foreign investment impacts on labor productivity growth. In this case, FDI from G7 countries

induces productivity growth substantially only when human capital and openness are controlled

for. The magnitude of effect ranges between 1.5 and 1.6 percent for every 10 percent increase in

FDI stock (columns 3 and 4). However, the explanatory power is lower when the measure of

openness is included in the model (column 4), which is contrary to the findings in Table 6 for

BRICS’ FDI effects. This finding could be attributed to the possibility that both FDI and volume

of trade are proxies for a country’s level of openness or integration in the global economy.

Consequently, in addition to their direct effect on labor productivity growth, they both capture

the indirect openness effects. Moreover, a large proportion of Africa’s trade is with developed
                                                  21
countries, which comprises G7 countries. Thus, there is a possibility that the indirect openness

effects might also be working through the increased trade volume between G7 and African

countries. In comparison, Africa’s trade with BRICS as a group is very minimal, which explains

why the explanatory power of the coefficient of BRICS’ direct investment does not change with

trade as reported in Table 6 (columns 3 and 4).

    Consistent with growth literature, we observe β-convergence in all specifications reported in

Tables 6, 7, and 8. Moreover, human capital development and good governance positively

contribute to labor productivity growth, which is in line with related empirical studies on Africa


                                                  22
(Gyimah-Brempong, Paddison and Mitiku, 2005; Wamboye and Tockkov 2014). On the contrary,

an increase in trade openness hampers productivity growth. These negative effects are significant

in the models where G7 countries’ direct investment is the only measure of FDI effects (Table 6,

column 4). This could be attributed to the fact that most African countries are net importers rather

than net exporters, and a large proportion of these imports are from G7 countries.


6.2. Employment effects of BRICS’s versus G7 countries’ direct investment

    Recent study suggests that multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in Africa that

originate from emerging economies have roughly 11-14 percent more employees than domestic

firms and developed countries’ MNEs (Coniglio, Prota and Seric 2014). Our study evaluates

BRICS versus G7 countries’ direct investment impact on employment in Africa using equation 2.

Results summarized in Table 8 show that, indeed, BRICS’ direct investment increases the

employment rate in Africa while that from G7 countries decreases it. For every 10 percent

increase in FDI stock from BRICS, employment rate increases by 0.01-0.04 percent annually;

and for G7 countries employment rate decreases by 0.01 percent annually. Furthermore, similar

to what is observed in the growth equations; the impact of FDI from both BRICS and G7

countries is enhanced when the education level of the workforce is controlled for.

    Moreover, we estimate two variants of equation 2 where the effects of BRICS’ and G7

countries’ FDI on the employment rate are captured in separate equations. Results for the

BRICS’ direct investment are reported in Table 9 while those of G7 countries, in Table 10.

Consistent with the findings in Table 8, BRICS’ direct investment boosts employment in Africa

at a rate of 0.03 percent annually, for every 10 percent increase in FDI stock (Table 9). With

regards to G7 countries’ FDI, positive and significant effects are observed only when a measure

of infrastructure development, proxied by fixed-line telephone subscription, is included (Table

                                                23
10). Moreover, effects are 10 times smaller than those from BRICS’ FDI. For example, for

every 10 percent increase in FDI stock from G7 countries, employment rate increases by 0.003-

0.004 percent.

     The importance of infrastructure development in raising absorptive capacity of FDI, and in

turn leading to job creation in African countries is apparent, especially in the case of G7

countries’ FDI. As stated above, accounting for infrastructure development stimulates the

employment generating effects of G7 countries’ FDI. In fact, in models where infrastructure




                                                 24
development effects are not accounted for, the coefficient of G7 countries’ direct investment is

either negative (Table 10, column 1) or neutral (columns 2 and 3).

     The above results may be due to the hypotheses outlined in section 4 but it could also be

capturing the sector destination effects of FDI coming from G7 versus BRICS countries. For

example, Alfaro (2003), Wang (2009), and Aizenman and Sushko (2011) find that FDI to the

manufacturing sector yields higher growth effects compared to FDI to the primary sector.

Therefore, if the share of BRICS FDI going to the services and manufacturing sectors, is

relatively high compared to the share of G7 FDI going to these same sectors, this could

potentially lead to the type of results presented in this paper. Unfortunately, the data used in this

study does not allow us to examine this aspect in detail. An extension of this study could include

efforts to generate data on FDI by source and sector destination to each African country. This

would enable a closer examination of how the sector destination of FDI links with labor

productivity and employment.

7. Conclusion

    This paper has examined the labor productivity growth and employment effects of BRICS’

versus G7 countries’ direct investment in selected African countries over the period 2001-2012.

The results show that while BRICS’ FDI increases productivity growth across different model

specifications, G7 countries’ FDI has varying effects under different conditions. For example, in

the models where G7 effects are analyzed together with BRICS’ FDI and without control

variables (Table 5), G7 FDI has a significant and negative impact on labor productivity growth

and employment. In models that exclude BRICS’ FDI (Table 6), G7 countries’ direct investment

exerts labor productivity growth enhancing effects, which are significant only when a measure of

human capital (proxied by primary school enrollment), is included in the model. The results

point to the importance of an educated workforce in Africa in augmenting the impact of BRICS’

and G7 countries’ direct investment on labor productivity growth.

    With regard to employment, FDI from BRICS contributes to the employment rate among the

African countries included in this study relatively more compared to FDI from G7 countries; this

result holds across different model specifications. In contrast, the impact of G7 countries’ FDI

on employment varies depending on the model specification. For instance, in the models with

BRICS’ FDI, it reduces employment, while in those where BRICS’ investment is excluded and

where the impact of infrastructure development is accounted for, it enhances the employment

rate in Africa. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect of BRICS’ FDI on employment is 10 times

higher than that of G7 countries.

       An issue that African policy makers can glean from the forgoing analysis is that BRICS’

FDI appears to be a substitute for G7 countries’ FDI. For example, in models where BRICS’ FDI

is included alongside that of G7 countries, the effects of G7 countries’ FDI on labor productivity

                                                27
growth and employment are negative (Tables 6 and 9). In the absence of BRICS’ FDI, G7

countries’ direct investments have growth and employment enhancing effects when human and

physical (infrastructure) capital are controlled for. In other words, for G7 countries’ FDI to be

effective, certain levels of human and physical capital have to be present, and it should be in

sectors or projects where it does not face competition from BRICS’ FDI.

    Our results suggest a strategic approach to FDI policy for Africa that has both long- and

short-term implications. Over the long-term, the findings point to the need to invest in human

and physical capital, in addition to good governance. However, increasing the level of openness

to trade has to be strategic, possibly similar to an approach adopted by some Asian countries.

Over the short-term, the results highlight the importance of putting in place investment policies

to attract FDI that matches local factor proportions and that sources locally available inputs.
