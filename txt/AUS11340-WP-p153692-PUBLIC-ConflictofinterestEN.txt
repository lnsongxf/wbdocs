                                                    than that of the public servant group.

    BOX ii         Definition of conflict of interest in the OECD Guidelines

    Historically, defining the term conflict of                                     A “potential conflict of interest” arises where
    interest has been the subject of many and                                       a public official has private interests which are
    varying approaches. As all public officials have                                such that a conflict of interest would arise if the
    legitimate interests which arise out of their                                   official were to become involved in relevant (i.e.

    must be defined, identified, and managed. The                                   Where a private interest has in fact compromised
