Executive Summary

1.      This report seeks to contribute to the overall objective of improving the
design and implementation of state-budget-funded investment programs under
the MRDPA. The main focus is on the National Local Development Program
(PNDL), managed by the MRDPA as the largest state-budget-funded instrument for
investments in local infrastructure. Work under this Component includes first and
foremost a hands-on review of a sample of technical-economic documentation
submitted by local authorities from across Romania for PNDL financing and for the
MRDPA’s consideration. This practical exercise further serves two goals: (i) to
develop a comprehensive understanding of how the PNDL works in practice,
particularly in the early part of a project cycle – namely project preparation,
submission, evaluation, and selection for financing – including what works well and
what should be improved; and (ii) to assist the MRDPA with improving the process
of screening project proposals. Importantly however, the evaluation sheets filled
out by the World Bank experts did not serve as a basis for financing decisions
under the program, but were meant only to provide additional support and
guidance to the MRDPA specialized staff in charge of formal processing/evaluation
of PNDL applications.

2.        Based on the assessment of the PNDL portfolio of projects and of a select
sample of financing proposals, this analysis – along with the report on
“Prioritization Criteria for Local Infrastructure Development Projects” also under
Component 2 – provides guidance on how to improve projects’ technical
documentation. The aim is to ensure a higher quality of applications for EU funds
and for the PNDL over the 2014-2020 programming period. For example, on
projects for which the technical documentation may be incomplete or may include
outdated or irrelevant data/information, the applicant should be notified and
further informed about how the technical documentation should be improved to
make the project eligible for financing. Through similar notifications, the PNDL
team should also inform an applicant if the project could be eligible for funding (in
the opinion of the PNDL team) from any of the active EU Operational Programs.
Such notification should also underline that applicants should consult directly with
the respective Intermediate Bodies and the Managing Authorities of these
Operational Programs. In relation to the documentation submitted and eligible for
PNDL funding only, it will be the responsibility of the PNDL team in the MRDPA to
provide clear feedback and instructions for improvements in applications to limit
the risk of multiple rounds of clarifications and modifications, which translate into
project delays. For a program like the PNDL implemented on an annual basis, it is
critically important to ensure a smooth and speedy processing of financing
requests.




                                                                                  vi
3.      Of the 215 technical-economic documentations reviewed according to
the updated grids proposed under the project, 212 projects (98.6%) were
recommended for financing, while 39 projects (18.4%) were identified as the
ones, which could be financed from EU structural funds. This indicates that some
projects submitted to PNDL could actually be financed using other sources, in
particular EU structural instruments, which should also help increase the
absorption of these funds. As a matter of principle the PNDL should only target
projects that lack any other non-refundable option or have been initially
considered, accepted, but ultimately not financed under an EU program for
example because of lack of sufficient funding available.



4.       Throughout the assessment of a sample of 289 projects submitted to the
PNDL and based on the overall analysis of the application process, the team has
identified some areas of improvement , in particular some common conformity
and eligibility issues. Practically all of the identified issues are related to the
administrative compliance and quality of application documents needed for the
evaluation. This is to be expected. As this report describes in later chapters, the
current evaluation process is essentially entirely focused on checking for
administrative conformity and eligibility. In other words, the scope of the current
technical assistance and of its main recommendations is inherently limited by the
nature of the current PNDL evaluation process. Local/county authorities (program
applicants) can correct/complete/update their submitted documentation upon
receiving clear feedback and instructions from the MRDPA’s technical staff.


5.       The list below includes typical issues encountered, with the aim of
signaling to the MRDPA and to local authorities where typical g aps in the
documentation exist or where the quality needs to be improved. The issues
identified are described in more detail in the report and are mostly related to the
project preparation stage, as they are based on the analysis of applications
submitted by PNDL’s potential beneficiaries (i.e., county and local public
authorities). So key findings regarding the application preparation part of the
process and related technical documentation are the following :
       Issue #1: Lack of Supporting Documents/Technical Studies

       Issue #2: Inadequate/Insufficient Technical Documentation

       Issue #3: Incorrect Project Budget (Cost Breakdown)

       Issue #4: Insufficient Cost Breakdown for Main Works

       Issue #5: Lack of Main Drawings

       Issue #6: Noncompliance with Standard Costs




                                                                                vii
         Issue #7: Lack of Documents for Property/ Assets

         Issue #8: Missing/Expired/Incomplete Urban Certificate (UC)

         Issue #9: Local Council Decision Requiring Amendments

6.       These findings are discussed in more detail in the report. They augment
conclusions and recommendations resulting from a thorough review of PNDL ’s
role, strategy and the entire project cycle undertaken as part of the other
components of the current technical assistance. 1 It will provide the conditions for
an efficient program that delivers relevant, high-quality, and timely projects.

This report confirms also the following key findings regarding the whole PNDL
process formulated in other reports:

         Issue #1: Unclear methodology of budget allocation by county

         Issue #2: Unclear project selection model

         Issue #3: Overlap with other programs

         Issue #4: Dual project application system

         Issue #5: Timeframe for preparation incompatible with annual program

         Issue #6: Weak project implementation monitoring

         Issue #7: Lack of post-implementation monitoring

7.      Reports prepared as part of component 1 of this technical assistance
propose a comprehensive reform of PNDL, but since such reform may take time,
several improvements mentioned below are recommended in the short term. In
order to improve the quality of applications and the efficiency of PNDL, the
following policy measures seek to make positive changes to the current system,
even without a full overhaul of the PNDL – this may be called the “Status Quo+”
scenario. By contrast, the framework suggested in the other reports prepared as
part of component 1 and component 2 depart more significantly from the current
program structure. So, in case of difficulties in implementing quickly a
comprehensive PNDL reform, it is suggested that the MRDPA should consider the
recommendations described in the following paragraphs for the next PNDL in
2016. The key criterion to consider for whether to select the Status Quo+ scenario

                                                                                viii
or start immediately the full reform should be the capacity of the Ministry and of
local administrations to implement adjustments quickly and manage a significantly
revised program.

8.      The MRDPA should refocus PNDL’s scope and avoid overlaps with other
programs. The current analysis suggests that the PNDL should prioritize projects
that have no possibility of receiving other non-reimbursable funds, including in
particular EU funds. The maximum funding amount from PNDL should also be
specified for each type of project.

9.      The projects’ technical documentation should show improvement . A
major issue identified during the assessment of the applications was the low
quality of the technical documentation and often missing supporting
documentation. To make sure that the applications follow the requirements, it is
recommended that the MRDPA prepare and provide beneficiaries with an
Applicants Guide. This Guide would provide interested potential beneficiaries with
all the information needed to prepare the application. It would improve the
transparency of the entire PNDL process, provide a coherent and fair framework,
and include all standard documentation required for PNDL applications.

10.      The MRDPA should also promote measures for improving the local
capacity for project preparation and submission. Experience indicates that local
authorities need continuous technical assistance, especially during the project
preparation and application phase. A relatively easy way to deliver this kind of
assistance would be to set up a help-desk system, either at the central level
(MRDPA) or inside the intermediary bodies, if any will be designated depending on
the chosen institutional architecture of the PNDL management system (RDAs or
County Councils could be considered for serving in this role, each option having
both pros and cons). It is also necessary to increase the capacity of the respective
units in the MRDPA involved in projects appraisal. The current workload
significantly exceeds available resources, which can lead to lower-quality
evaluations, delays, and other issues discovered later on in the project cycle. A
systematic training program could be set-up in the MRDPA, so that the decisions
on project selection are consistent across all Ministry staff. Overall, project
appraisal skills must be developed across MRDPA in a coordinated fashion to make
sure that the new skills are applied in practice in decision-making.

11.     Awareness-raising campaigns for beneficiaries should be designed and
rolled out. The communication around the program and its financed projects is a
key condition for stimulating potential applicants to prepare and submit candidate
projects. This also helps inform the general public of the PNDL’s impact and can
boost the program’s overall transparency.




                                                                                 ix
12.      The MRDPA should consider enhancing the PNDL’s p roject selection
model. There are a number of ways to boost the efficiency and transparency of
project evaluation. As noted earlier, this report does not address project
prioritization issues, as they are discussed in another dedicated report prepared
under Component 2 of this technical assistance. A clear set of criteria for
prioritizing PNDL investments across key sectors has been proposed in that report.
The evaluation process for project proposals under PNDL should also be better
adapted to their specificity (small projects) by using a simpler set of the proposed
selection criteria, given the limited administrative capacity of the Ministry to
process a large number of projects.

13.     A standard application processing system should be created . According to
Article 11, item 7 of GEO 28/2013 governing the PNDL’s implementation, County
Councils are required to send the list of funding proposals within 15 days after the
planned budget has been agreed. This is circumvented in exceptional
circumstances, whereby applicants may send funding proposals directly to the
MRDPA. Since the Ministry makes budget allocations to PNDL for each County
Council, it is unclear how the projects received directly from applicants (and not
through the County Councils) are accounted for. The recommendation is
standardize the process so that either all applicants send funding proposals only
through their corresponding County Councils or all apply directly to the MRDPA.
This would create a non-discriminatory treatment of applicants and ensure project
financing based on clear priorities. In any scenario, the MRPDA should still have
the important task of ensuring continuous monitoring and control of how County
Councils are prioritizing projects and managing them.

14.      The MRDPA should promote the use of tendering procedures with
suspension clauses for technical documentation . On the basis of current
procedures for contracting, construction works for any new projects can
realistically begin no earlier than in November of a given calendar year. This
situation often causes technical problems during the winter time and often results
in postponing works. Hence the respective part of the budget expenditure
allocated for such projects needs to postponed to the following year. This results
in inefficiency in spending the PNDL funds allocated for the given year. Once
suspension clauses for technical documents are introduced and reflected in the
PNDL Applicant Guide, applicants should be able to start the tendering process
earlier, i.e. before signing financial contracts with MRDPA. The suspension clause
essentially warrants that the local/county authority would only allow the winning
bidder to start implementing the contract once the financing source is secured,
i.e., the PNDL application is approved and the respective financing contract with
the MRDPA is signed.




                                                                                  x
15.      The Ministry should also consider revising standard cost policies and the
eligible expenditures order. Implementation of cost standards for infrastructure is
imperfect and has posed challenges to beneficiaries. The intention of deploying
the cost standards was praiseworthy as a solution for keeping project costs under
control, as well as to help in planning. The problem is that current cost standards
are not sufficiently developed and, in some cases (i.e., wastewater systems), they
do not exist at all. They also do not reflect updated nominal values of unit prices
(i.e., values have not been adjusted for inflation since 2010), nor supply and
demand fluctuations. It is also unclear if comparisons between project estimates
and cost standards should be made in RON or EUR values and what exchange rates
should be used for such comparisons. It is recommended therefore that cost
standards should be updated or, if that is not feasible, they may be waived
completely. 2 In the latter scenario, the authorities could use instead a list of
reference prices preferably denominated in EUR to make sure that costs are kept
under control. In this case local databases with ranges for local prices for main
materials should be created and kept up to date. In addition, current standard
costs reflect only standard technical solutions, thus limiting room for
implementation of newer and often cheaper technical solutions. So the proposed
changes in standard cost policies should also result in technical solutions proposed
at the tendering stage being only indicative and designers/beneficiaries should be
properly informed and in some cases even encouraged to propose alternative
technical solutions that are of higher quality and cheaper in short/long-term.


16.      Clear project implementation monitoring and payment schedules should
be introduced into financing contracts . The current PNDL procedures provide no
mechanism for monitoring the implementation of the projects financed through
the PNDL. The monitoring is based on the reports sent by County Councils, which
are based on the data sent by the ultimate beneficiaries, but only in relation to the
three specific subprograms of PNDL (i.e., modernization of the Romanian village,
urban regeneration of municipalities and towns, and infrastructure at county
level). To achieve quicker progress in projects’ implementation and to avoid cash
flow problems, each financing contract should include: (i) advance payment (could
be up to 10% of the contract value) and (ii) clear terms and conditions for
subsequent disbursement tranches. Clear stipulations on penalties for both
contractual parties should be included in the financing contract along with
reporting requirements, including reporting process timelines and monitoring
report(s) templates.

17.      Post-implementation monitoring should also be introduced . The current
legal framework includes no details on requirements for the post-implementation
phase – i.e., the project’s results and evolution after completion. The system based
on the Methodological Norms should be enforced. It requires that once works are
finished, the beneficiary sends a copy of the completion report to the Ministry.
Additionally, if there is a warranty period in the works contract, the local authority
should send a copy of the formal hand-over documentation (“procesul verbal de
recepție final”) to the MRDPA upon the warranty expiry date. Beyond that, the two
key post-implementation functions related to any public sector investment
program – i.e., ex-post monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and knowledge sharing –
appear to be missing in the PNDL. Put differently, there is no formal process for
evaluating the impact of completed investments and there are no institutionalized
efforts for exchanging good practices among past, current, and future beneficiaries
of PNDL funds. While this may not be surprising for a relatively “young ” program
like the PNDL it is recommended that, going forward, ex-post mechanisms should
be set-up to ensure continuous improvement of the instrument. The final report
on component 3 discusses in more detail basic features and key advantages of
post-implementation monitoring and asset management systems.

Chapter I: Introduction

18.     In the context of Romania’s push toward sustainable and inclusive
development, the Government has asked the World Bank to su pport the
harmonization of public investments financed by the European Union and the
state budget. This work is a follow-up to the World Bank’s Regional Development
Program in Romania (November 2012-March 2014) and aims to encourage
synergies across public investments in local infrastructure, regardless of the
funding source, and deliver stronger impact overall. Four components were agreed
with the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA)
under the overall project focused on harmonizing local infrastructure projects:
      Component 1 – Assistance with the coordination of strategies and plans
       for EU and state-funded investments in infrastructure;
      Component 2 – Advisory services related to the existing portfolio of
       investment projects in MRDPA, including their optimal prioritization and
       preparation of potential EU-funded investments for the 2014-2020
       programming period;
      Component 3 – Assistance with improving the use of efficient designs and
       technologies in investments overseen by the MRDPA;
      Component 4 – Assistance with the design of a Housing and Infrastructure
       Development Strategy.

19.     The second aforementioned component (in italics ) focuses on the
existing portfolio of investment projects financed by the MRDPA and further
includes two sets of interrelated deliverables:
            a. Proposal of enhanced prioritization criteria for local infrastructure
               development projects, including clear performance and monitoring
               indicators, assessment of project implementation timelines, and
               guidelines on identifying viable financing sources per type of
               project;
            b. Assessment of a sample of projects, at the level of technical-
               economic documentation (i.e., feasibility studies and/or detailed
               technical designs), to identify potential opportunities to leverage
               EU instruments and/or funds from the state budget.

This final report covers the latter sub-component (in italics), including a diagnostic
of the current portfolio of technical-economic documentations of the Directorate
General for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI) in the MRDPA. DG
RDI designs, manages, and implements the National Program for Local
Development (PNDL), a key source of state-budget financing for local




                                                                                    1
infrastructure development. As such, the current report describes the PNDL’s
framework a nd project cycle and provides an overview of the program’s project
portfolio in 2014. It also draws a number of preliminary observations and proposes
some potential policy measures, based on a review of 289 technical-economic
documentations (in most cases feasibility studies) for new investments proposed
for PNDL financing in 2014. Out of the long list of projects screened (363 in total as
listed in Annex 6) 289 proposals were selected by the team for detailed review and
assessment and Annex 7 includes the detailed review sheets for these 289
proposals, as filled out by a team of World Bank evaluators. The aim is to
understand gaps and opportunities in the PNDL’s programming and
implementation, and also to help develop the MRDPA’s capacity for assessing
received proposals.
20.      This work is correlated with findings and recommendations from the
broader current engagement with the MRDPA. The assessment of the strategic
correlation of strategies, plans, and investment programs at different levels
(Component #1 described above) will define a filter for selecting local
interventions that contribute to higher-level plans and objectives.
Recommendations from the work related to innovative and efficient designs and
technologies (Component #3 described above) will assist in the engagement of
local authorities to improve technical proposals that promote the adoption of cost-
effective technical solutions. The current report has also informed the proposals
for prioritization and selection criteria for PNDL (also under Component 2).

21.     The primary sources of data and documents reviewed as part of this
analysis include the following:
       Legal framework for the PNDL’s implementation , including the text of the
        ordinance establishing the program, implementation norms, eligibility and
        selection criteria, and application templates. Other legislative provisions
        related to the implementation of EU and state-funded investment
        programs have been considered.
       Feasibility studies corresponding to projects in the PNDL’s pipeline.
        Observations are based on the results of a technical screening process of
        feasibility studies. It was carried out starting in July 2014 by a Bank team of
        technical and economic evaluators. The team focused on a sample of 289
        feasibility studies for roads, water supply, wastewater systems, and social
        infrastructure.
       Database of all projects financed under the 2014 PNDL , with an initial
        original budget of close to RON 1 billion for the current fiscal year. The
        database includes key data like: investment name, total project value and
        2014 allocation, ongoing/new investment, timeline, co-financing by the
        beneficiary, etc.




                                                                                     2
       Interviews with stakeholders at the local, regional, and national level. For
        the current report, the team has interviewed key stakeholders in the
        MRDPA’s Direct orate General for Regional Development and
        Infrastructure (DG RDI), at both managerial and technical levels. Between
        September 8 and 26, 2014, the team also successfully completed one
        round of field interviews at the local level, covering three county councils
        (Cluj, Bistrița Năsăud, and Sălaj) and 6 communes in the three
        aforementioned counties. Over the next phases of the engagement, the
        team has planned multiple rounds of field interviews across the entire
        country. To this end, it has provided the MRDPA a full list of potential
        locations and is waiting for the Ministry’s confirmation and support in
        finalizing the schedule (as of November 1, 2014).
       Other relevant World Bank analyses. Specifically, this work draws on the
        2011 Functional Review of the Ministry of Regional Development and
        Tourism – now the MRDPA – as well as on a series of reports produced
        under the 2012-2013 World Bank Regional Development Program,
        including “ROP 2.0.: MA-IB Collaboration and Support for Applicants and
        Beneficiaries of the Regional Operational Program, ” “Identification of
        Project Selection Models for the ROP 2014-2020,” and “Competitive Cities:
        Reshaping the Economic Geography of Romania.”

Objective and Scope
22.      This report seeks to contribute to the overall objective of improv ing the
design and implementation of state-budget-funded investment programs under
the MRDPA – primarily the PNDL. Work under this Component includes first and
foremost a hands-on review of a sample of technical-economic documentation
submitted for the DG RDI’s consideration by local authorities from across Romania.
This practical exercise further serves two goals: (i) to develop a comprehensive
understanding of how the PNDL works in practice, particularly in the early part of a
project cycle – namely project preparation, submission, evaluation, and selection
for financing – including what works well and what should be improved; and (ii) to
assist the MRDPA with improving the process of screening project proposals.
Importantly, the evaluation sheets filled out by the World Bank experts do not
serve as a basis for financing decisions under the program, but are meant to
provide guidance to the MRDPA’s own staff in charge of processing/evaluating
PNDL applications.

23.     One of the key issues that this technical assistance tries to address is
how to ensure that the existing technical documentation will eventually lead to
completed, impactful projects. Based on lessons of previous programs, not all
project proposals that have been developed by local authorities can/should
actually be pursued. As such, a first step in the evaluation of existing
documentation will require the triage of the projects that are financeable and




                                                                                  3
those that are not. A second step should involve a determination of those projects
that would be eligible for EU funding and should be directed to the respective
decision making stream. As a matter of principle, whenever possible, EU funding
should be sought, while state budget funds should be used only for activities that
are not eligible for EU funding or for investments that are expected to
complement or expand EU investments in areas that suffer from a funding gap.
The figure below summarizes this proposed framework.

Figure 1. Proposed scheme for the triage of projects submitted for PNDL financing

  Is the project recommended for financing?
         • Full pool of applications
         • Basic criteria applied for screening out projects that are not recommended for financing
         • Initial decision on whether a particular project proposal should move forward


                                                     YES                                  NO

  Could the project be financed from EU Funds?
        • Pool of “financeable” applications
                                                                                    Project is not recommended for financing (neither EU,
        • If a project fits the eligibility criteria of particular EU
                                                                                                       nor PNDL funds)
            programs, it is recommended to pursue financing
            through those instruments

  Which EU program could                      Could the project be financed through the state-funded PNDL?
  finance the intervention?                     • Conformity (technical documentation fulfills GD 28/2008 requirements)
  For example:                                  • Eligibility (project objectives/activities are aligned with PNDL requirements)

     • Roads that connect to TEN-
       T network  Regional                                                YES                              NO
       Operational Programme
                                              Is the project a priority?                          What adjustments would be (further)
     • Water supply/sewage                                                                        needed to the proposal to make it

                                                • Selection model applied (e.g.,                  “financeable” under the PNDL?
       between 2,000-10,000 
       National Rural                             scoring)                                          • Conformity (e.g., permits, etc.)
       Development Programme                                                                        • Eligibility (e.g., objectives, activities)
                                              *Note: Full prioritization model is                   • Technical aspects (e.g., omissions in
                                               presented in a separate chapter                        the design, etc.)


24.      Based on the assessment of the PNDL portfolio of projects and of a select
sample of proposals, this analysis – along with the report on “Prioritization
Criteria for Local Infrastructure Development Projects” also under Component 2
– provides guidance on how to improve projects’ technical documentation. The
aim is to ensure a higher quality of applications for EU funds and for the PNDL over
the 2014-2020 programming period. For some projects, the technical
documentation may be incomplete or it may include outdated or irrelevant
data/information. In this case, the applicant should be notified and further
informed about how the technical documentation should be improved to make it
eligible for financing. Through a similar notification, the PNDL team may inform an
applicant if her project is eligible (in the opinion of the PNDL team) for funding
from any of the EU Operational Programs. The notification should also underline




                                                                                                                      4
that applicants should consult directly with the Intermediate Bodies and the
Managing Authority of these operational programs. For the documentation
submitted and eligible for PNDL funding only, it will be the PNDL team’s
responsibility to provide clear feedback and instructions for improvement to limit
the risk of requiring multiple rounds of clarifications or modifications.

25.      With respect to its sectoral focus, this engagement focuses on
infrastructure investments overseen by the MRDPA, primarily in:
communal/county roads; water; wastewater; and social infrastructure. The
scope is primarily centered on PNDL projects approved for 2014 – particularly with
respect to the diagnostic of the status quo – given data made available through
this stage of the engagement. The analysis focuses on projects that are still in the
preparation/planning phase, leaving aside those investments for which
implementation on the ground has already begun, which involves legal
commitments to winning bidders and a host of other requirements. As such, this
work serves mainly as a tool for identifying, selecting, and prioritizing
infrastructure investments in the MRDPA portfolio for 2014 and beyond.

26.     In line with these objectives, this final report includes the following:
             a. Analysis of portfolio of technical-economic documentations of the
                 Directorate General for Regional Development and Infrastructure;
            b. Screening results for a sample of projects’ feasibility
               studies/detailed technical designs, selected based on project
               categories and on an agreed sampling methodology;
            c. Statistics on cost components for this sample of projects;
            d. Potential policy measures for improving the preparation and
               screening of projects at the local authorities and, respectively, the
               MRDPA level.
            d. Contribution to a coordinated screening process by local
               beneficiaries and on-the-job training of technical teams
               responsible for project screening;

Audience
27.      As for the other outputs under this engagement with the MRDPA, the
primary audience of the current report includes the staff of the Directorate
General for Regional Development and Infrastructure, which manages the PNDL.
The report provides these key stakeholders with a diagnostic of the program’s
portfolio, a list of common issues encountered with the technical-economic
documentation submitted by PNDL applicants, and proposals how to address
current gaps. Local authorities and Intercommunity Development Associations
(IDA), including technical staff within local governments responsible for working
with designers and other consultants, can also use current recommendations to




                                                                                  5
improve the quality of their applications for PNDL and EU financing. Other
stakeholders who would benefit from this assessment include ministries and
agencies in charge of planning and implementing state-budget and EU-funded
investment programs.

Report Structure
28.     The observations and conclusions of this final report are organized in the
following three chapters:
       Chapter II: PNDL Background and Portfolio Assessment
           o This chapter first describes the history, objectives, and legal
               framework of the PNDL, providing background information on the
               program.
           o Further, this chapter covers the main stages that a PNDL project
               goes through, from the pre-application phase through application,
               implementation, and post-implementation.
           o The final section provides an assessment of the PNDL project
               portfolio in 2014 by size, sector, implementation status,
               geographical coverage.

       Chapter III: Main challenges related to the quality of projects submitted for
        PNDL financing
           o This section describes the main deficiencies observed at each step
                in a project cycle, from the design phase through implementation.
           o This chapter also presents key findings emerging from the review
                of technical-economic documentations. These have included:
                feasibility studies for new works and documentation for approving
                interventions (DALIs) for rehabilitation projects; and proposes
                steps to be considered when assessing new projects’ viability and
                identifying appropriate sources for financing them. It also analyses
                the cost structure of the sample of projects assessed.

       Chapter IV: Preliminary observations and policy measures
        recommendations
            o This final chapter includes a set of ideas for addressing observed
               gaps and deficiencies. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list
               but a summary of the key recommendations.




                                                                                   6
Chapter II: PNDL Background and Portfolio Assessment

29.     This chapter provides an overview of the National Program for Local
Development (PNDL) and an assessment of the PNDL portfolio. The first part
reviews the PNDL program cycle, from strategic design to funding allocation,
project preparation, evaluation, financing, implementation, and post-
implementation. This information is also included in the other reports under this
engagement with the MRDPA, as critical background information on the
investment program, setting the stage for subsequent recommendations. The
second part of this chapter presents summary data on the 2014 PNDL portfolio,
which includes a total of 3,952 ongoing and new projects, though full information
is only available for 3,031. The table below provides more details of sector
composition of projects in the portfolio. Of these 3,952 projects, 2,530 were new
projects, while 1,422 were projects that were started in previous years and
received PNDL financing for 2014. Of the 1,422 started projects, 1,188 had a
completion rate of less than 1% - i.e. they could technically be considered new
projects. Less than 150 projects had a completion rate of 60%. In parallel, the
World Bank team is finalizing a proposal for a revamped prioritization process for
PNDL applications in the other report under Component 2 (“ Prioritization Criteria
for Local Infrastructure Development Projects”), which will be discussed with the
MRDPA for potential use in the evaluation of projects from January 2015 onward. 3

The PNDL Program Cycle
30.      The Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) 28/2013 legally
established the National Program for Local Development. Along with its formal
justification (“notă de fundamentare”) and the Methodological Norms for its
application (Ministry Order 1851/2013), this act sets the PNDL’s design and
implementation framework. At the time, the PNDL was an important expression of
the new cabinet’s commitment to the development of local infrastructure, as
reflected in the 2013-2016 Governing Program (as approved by Parliament
through decision 45/2012). For example, one of the key objectives for Romania’s
regional development is defined as the financing of a basic package of services for
rural areas, including roads, drinking water, sanitation, social infrastructure etc.,
“for achieving [at least] minimum standards of living.” 4 The same document
further emphasizes the need to prioritize public infrastructure projects to
contribute to Romania’s sustainable, balanced development. 5

31.      The GEO 28/2013 defines three sub-programs as components of the
PNDL: the modernization of Romanian villages; the urban regeneration of
municipalities and towns; and the development of county-level infrastructure.
Eligible beneficiaries vary across sub-programs: while the first one targets
communes (rural localities), the second one is aimed at cities and the latter at
counties. GEO 30/2014 and MRDPA Ministry Order 919/2014 included
Intercommunity Development Associations (IDAs) among the list of eligible
beneficiaries for PNDL funding. Article 7 in the GEO describes the list of
intervention areas (similar to “axes” of EU -funded programs):
      Water supply systems and drinking water treatment plant;
      Sewage systems (networks) and wastewater treatment plant;
      Education units (kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, high
         schools, etc.);
      Healthcare units in rural areas (clinics, pharmacies, etc.);
      Public roads (i.e., county roads, local interest roads, commune roads
         and/or public roads within localities);
      Bridges, culverts, and/or footbridges;
      Local cultural facilities, such as libraries, museums, multi-functional
         cultural centers, and theaters;
      Landfills;
      Public, commercial markets, fairs, cattle fairs, as applicable;
      Sports facilities; and

       Headquarters of local public authorities and other subordinated public
        institutions. 6
The types of eligible works include construction of new infrastructure, as well as
extension, rehabilitation, and upgrading of existing infrastructure. Essentially,
through such broad conditions, the PNDL is able to cover the MRDPA’s entire vast
portfolio of projects – both previously-financed interventions (at various stages of
completion) and brand new investments, by all types of local public beneficiaries
(from local councils in communes and cities to county councils).

32.    In addition to the overall objective of supporting Romania’s regional
development, the PNDL has sought to integrate three investment programs that
had operated independently in the past:
     The infrastructure program based on Government Decision (GD) 577/1997
       targeted the modernization of communal roads and connecting villages to
       water supply, sanitation systems, and electric and phone networks. Before
       its integration under PNDL, this program was managed by the MRDPA
       (formerly the MRDT) through the Public Works Directorate. County
       councils played a main role by centralizing funding requests from all
       potential beneficiaries in the county and communicating them to the
       MRDPA.
       The Rural Infrastructure Development Program, based on Government
        Ordinance (GO) 7/2006, also aimed at the “development and
        modernization of Romania’s rural areas, […] by connecting them to roads
        and water and wa stewater networks.”7 In its initial form, this program was
        managed by a Commission, presided by the Prime Minister and bringing
        together representatives of 6 ministries, the Prime Minister’s Chancellery,
        and the Association of Romanian Communes. The Ministry of Transport
        was responsible for monitoring the program’s implementation.
       Multiannual Priority Programs for Water and the Environment, based on
        GO 40/2006, defined specific intervention sectors in certain geographical
        areas (for example, “water and wastewater infrastructure for the Criș river
        basin, Vaslui County, and the municipality of Ploiești”). 8 Other projects
        targeted varied interventions, from increasing the safety of river dams to
        developing an integrated IT system for the environment sector and the
        sustainable development of the Danube Delta biosphere.

  The last category (i.e., headquarters of public institutions) was introduced through GEO
30/2014.

                                                                                        9
Moreover, GEO 28/2013 establishing the PNDL also dismantled the Program for
the Rehabilitation and Upgrade of 10,000km of County and Local Roads.” The
reason mentioned by the formal justification note is that the program had not
received funding and thus had not financed any investment projects since its
establishment in 2010.

33.     In essence, the PNDL brought under the same management and strategic
direction three different investment programs that had similar objectives. As
noted by the government, this change was intended “to enable a more efficient
use of public funds through an integrated implementation of infrastructure
development programs in rural and urban areas.” 9 Indeed, it makes sense that
central government programs with the same target intervention areas would be
merged under a single design and implementation unit – i.e., the MRDPA. As
emphasized publicly by the MRDPA, the PNDL was never meant as a successor to
the now-closed PNDI, which was based on a financing scheme whereby
contractors would finance the cost of the project and get reimbursed upon
completion. Still, PNDL norms make it possible that other projects previously
started receive financing to finish the required works, provided that such
investments are aligned with PNDL priorities and eligibility rules.

34.     On the downside, the legal framework, including the PNDL
implementation norms, lacks clear references to potential synergies and
coordination with other funds. The program fails to draw lines that would avoid
duplication and crowding out of EU-funded instruments, which come at much
lower cost for the Romanian government. As the next sub-section shows, the PNDL
is based on a relatively broad set of norms. On the one hand, this allows for
increased flexibility in financing projects. On the other hand, there may be room
for more specificity and rigor in the evaluation and selection of projects to increase
the transparency, objectivity, and potential impact of the program. These
arguments are further described in the following sections, which cover the key
steps involved in the PNDL’s implementation.

Allocation of PNDL Funds to Counties
35.      Based on the budget allocation among ministries, as agreed at the
government level and approved by Parliament, the MRDPA sets the PNDL’s total
annual budget. Next, the MRDPA allocates sums for each county, sub-program,
and specific areas of intervention, based on a Ministerial Order. The criteria for
allocating sums across counties are described in Annex 2 to the PNDL
Methodological Norms. 10 In short, the three main types of criteria that shape the

allocation of PNDL funds from the national to the county level are based on
ongoing (unfinished) projects (number and funding needs), demographic data
(county population and surface area), and financial capacity.

36.      While the PNDL norms include sensible indicators to decide on the
funding allocation for each county, the methodology shows room for
improvement. For one, the law is not clear which of the three main criteria are
factored into the funding allocation, merely noting that “at least one of [them]
should be considered.”11 Second, there are no defined weights for individual
criteria or for sub-criteria within the main categories (e.g., number of ongoing
projects vs. their funding needs). Third, it is unclear how certain indicators would
be measured in practice, particularly the administrative-territorial units’ capacity
to co-finance investment projects. One proxy that could be used would be non-
earmarked revenues as a share of total revenues, 12 in the absence of clear
commitments (e.g., local/county council decisions to co-finance particular
investments). Finally, other potentially relevant indicators are missing. For
example, the PNDL does not seem to take int o account a county’s development
level, measured as GDP per capita (as used for the Regional Operational Program
in deciding the split across Romania’s eight planning regions).

37.      It is worth highlighting that final decisions regarding the PNDL’s
allocation of funding belong entirely to the MRDPA. In this process, it is
presumed that the Ministry makes use of county-level data, provided either
directly by county/local authorities or by other central bodies (e.g., the Ministry of
Finance). Once it makes a decision on the anticipated funding allocation, the
MRDPA communicates it to county councils. Based on these expectations, county
councils further interact with local authorities to begin making a list of investments
that may be financed through the PNDL. Based on data available at this point, it is
unclear whether at this stage the MRDPA decides only on the funding allocation
per county or goes beyond that. Article 8 of GEO 28/2013 implies the latter:
specifically, “the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration shall
prepare and approve by order of the Minister of Regional Development and Public
Administration the distribution of the amounts intended to the Program, per
counties, per each sub-program, and per specific areas of intervention.”13 It is
equally unclear if the MRDPA pre-selects investment projects to be included in the
PNDL, as implied by Article 9 (3), as opposed to putting together the list of

              The number of ongoing investment projects for each county as a share of
                 total ongoing investments at the national level;

Preparation of Project Proposals and County-Level Prioritization
38.      Once the MRDPA decides on the indicative PNDL funding allocation for
each county, county councils put together the list of projects proposed at the
county and local level – both new and ongoing/unfinished investments. 14 To this
end, local authorities submit their proposals to county councils or, “in justified
circumstances,” directly to the MRDPA, as recently mandated by Article 3 of GEO
30/2014 and MRDPA Minister Order 919/2014. It is unclear what situation would
qualify as “justified,” though field interviews suggest that more and more local
authorities are bypassing County Councils. This puts even more pressure on the
limited DG RDI staff; this topic is discussed in depth in the final report on PNDL
prioritization criteria, submitted in parallel with the current assessment.

     See Article 9 (4)




                                                                                            12
39.      The PNDL Methodological Norms include a clear template for project
proposals, which applies to both new and ongoing investments . 15 This asks for:
the name of the project; the name of the applicant/local authority; the location of
the project; main physical characteristics; total value of the investment; total value
of eligible costs to be financed from the PNDL; data regarding the design contract
(contract ID number, value, etc.); and, for ongoing investments, the data regarding
the construction works, the percentage of the project completed to date, and the
deadline for project completion.

40.       County Councils have 15 days to send to the MRDPA the list of proposed
investments, based on Annex 3 of the PNDL Methodological Norms. Essentially,
this is a table listing the projects proposed for financing through the program in a
particular year, divided up by new and ongoing investments, and further by sub-
program (i.e., “the modernization of the Romanian village,” “urban regeneration of
municipalities and towns,” and “county-level infrastructure”). The list of proposed
investments has to be accompanied by a justification note explaining how each
county council decided to prioritize projects submitted by local authorities. The list
includes both proposals put forth by county councils themselves (typically for
county roads) and projects submitted by local authorities, which can span a wider
set of sectors.

41.      Under the current PNDL framework, County Councils prioritize project
proposals from local authorities within their jurisdiction based on four possible
criteria, out of which “at least one should be used” :
      Signing date of the goods/work/service contract, as applicable;
      Physical status (% complete);
      Population benefitting from the investment; and
      Local budget’s percentage of co-financing.

42.      As with the PNDL’s criteria for allocating funds between counties, the
current prioritization criteria for selecting interventions within counties are
broad and ambiguous. This means that county councils have significant leverage
to decide how to prioritize investments in their jurisdiction. In their current form,
the methodological norms do not require county councils to use all four criteria,
but merely to choose one out of the four listed above. This may mean that a
county could decide solely based on the number of beneficiaries, while another
could only look at the signing date of the contract. At the same time, it is unclear
how a particular criterion should be deployed: for example, would a project with
an older signing date take precedence over a newer one, or the other way around?
Also, how should a local authority measure the population benefitting from a
specific investment, say a local road that connects to a national road? It could be

                                                                                  13
just the population of a commune or the population of a much larger area (e.g.,
within 20, 40, or even 60 minutes of the locality). Additionally, there are no
defined weights among criteria.

Project Selection, Prioritization, and Contracting by the MRDPA
43.      Based on the lists received from county councils across Romania, the
MRDPA makes the final selection of projects that receive PNDL funding in a given
year. Once again, the methodological norms do not define a clear, transparent
selection process. The final selection is to be based on the proposals received from
county councils and directly from local authorities, as well as on “[the Ministry’s]
own data and specialized assessments.” 16 It is unclear what data are deployed in
such evaluations. The same document notes that the selection is done exclusively
by the MRDPA if county councils do not abide by the 15-day timeline or if they fail
to prioritize investments based on at least one of the four criteria specified in the
law. The finalized list of interventions is approved through the MRDPA’s Minister
Order, including an annex with the full set of projects (for each of them, the annex
simply notes the name of the administrative-territorial unit, the name of the
project, and the sum channeled from the state budget).

44.      There are slightly different requirements for applicants with ongoing vs.
new projects. For the former, local authorities need to send to the MRDPA the
documents that show the project’s current phase of completion, the updated
value of remaining expenses to be incurrent for the finalization of the intervention,
and public procurement contracts that have been signed previously, including
addenda, if any. Upon verification of such documents, the process can move
forward to the contracting phase. For new investment projects, beneficiaries are
required to submit to the MRDPA the corresponding technical documentation. In
most cases, this refers to feasibility studies for new interventions or the
documentation for approving interventions (DALI 17 ) for existing infrastructure.
Feasibility studies and DALIs are not eligible for reimbursement through the PNDL
and have to have been developed through the applicant’s own resources, in
accordance with the regulations set by GD 28/2008. GEO 28/2013 also notes that
the documentation must prove that the proposed projects abide by the applicable
cost standards. However, cost standards are provided only for county roads,
communal roads, and for water projects. No cost standards are provided for

                                                                                    14
wastewater projects, as these are considered to require quite different technical
solutions from case to case. 18

45.      Recently, changes were introduced to the PNDL’s methodological norms
to increase the efficiency of assessing and approving new project proposals. Until
June 2014, the technical documentation would be first assessed by DG RDI within
the MRDPA and then sent to the Ministry’s Technical -Economic Council (TEC).
Without the TEC’s formal approval, projects would not be eligible for financing.
Citing the low capacity of the TEC to assess proposals and the long delays incurred
in the process, the MRDPA eliminated this step through Ministry Order 1851/2013.
Currently, new projects pre-approved for financing through the PNDL only go
through an assessment by the technical unit of the DG RDI, which primarily
evaluates the following:
      whether the technical documentation is complete and in accordance with
         GD 28/2008;
      whether the applicant’s folder includes the local/county council’s decision
         for approving the project’s technical-economic indicators and for ensuring
         the required co-financing; and
      whether the expenditures are properly presented and do not exceed
         current cost standards.

46.     The technical staff of DG RDI evaluates applications received and, where
needed, asks applicants to provide clarifications or adjustments to submitted
documentation. Only those projects that respond to the requests satisfactorily
move on to the contracting phase, though sometimes this back-and-forth can last
for several months.

Implementation
47.      Once the contract between the MRDPA and local authorities is signed,
actual implementation can commence. The exact stages will depend on whether
the project is new or ongoing. In the former case, the beneficiary of PNDL funds
will have to organize public procurement procedures, in line with the applicable
legislation (OUG 34/2006). In some cases, these procedures take a long time – due
to challenges in court, lack of offers, or other reasons specific to each project –
which may aggravate the risk of not using up the funds allocated for a particular
year. This is because the PNDL is not a multi-annual program like an EU-funded
instrument, which creates inherent incentives for applicants to submit for
consideration smaller, easier projects that can be carried out in 1-2 years. If the

(through the PNDL or a different program), depending on a case-by-case basis, the
beneficiary may continue previous engagements with service providers.

48.     Particularly for new investments, the process required for commencing
works can be very challenging to accommodate in a single fiscal year, which is
the status-quo timeframe for the PNDL. The figure below depicts the steps and
time required to start a new investment.

49.      The straightforward insight of the scheme above is that for new
investments, financed by the PNDL in a given year, works may begin only toward
the end of that year. Indeed, after eventually signing contracts with the MRDPA,
beneficiaries launch public procurement procedures for design services (i.e., for
the detailed technical design), the works supervisor (“dirigintele de șantier”), the
contractor, etc. In parallel, beneficiaries also apply for construction permits. Based
on recent experience with Romania’s public procurement framework, these
procedures – even for relatively small projects as targeted by the PNDL – can take
a minimum of three months (under an optimistic scenario). That means that the
order to begin actual works can be issued by the beneficiary only in late fall/early
winter. November and December are typically cold months in Romania, leaving
little chance for making substantial progress with construction works. This
suggests that new projects financed under the PNDL will have a tough time in




                                                                                                                               16
actually using up the allocated funds within a single calendar year, but the
program is only tailored on an annual basis. In the absence of multi-annual budget
planning, PNDL beneficiaries have no guarantee that they would continue to
receive support in future years. This is partly why so many works are still ongoing
and are either stopped or advancing very slowly, while new project proposals keep
entering the PNDL pipeline.

50.      Additional critical factors for a smooth, successful implementation also
relate to processing reimbursement requests, once the project actually kicks off.
Based on the methodological norms (Articles 16-17), beneficiaries submit
reimbursement requests first to county councils, which then submit a consolidated
request for each county to the MRDPA. This system was then changed to allow
beneficiaries to request funds directly from the MRDPA, essentially simplifying the
process by eliminating a step. Some county councils report, however, that local
city halls sometimes fail to send them a copy of reimbursement requests sent to
the Ministry, thus requiring repeated requests to keep them in the loop. Once it
approves the requests received, the Ministry channels the funds – within the set
annual limits and based on the proofs/documents received (“situații de lucrări”) –
directly to beneficiaries. Finally, beneficiaries send back to the MRDPA the proof of
payment of service providers (i.e., showing that the funds received were used for
the intended purpose).

51.      In addition, beneficiaries are responsible for monitoring work progress
and reporting updates to county councils and the MRDPA. The flow of reports is
similar to the initial one presented above for financing requests: local beneficiaries
send all documents corresponding to PNDL investments to county councils; every
quarter, county councils send to the MRDPA a consolidated update on the
progress of construction works. Upon request, beneficiaries are required to send
to the MRDPA any document related to the financed project. For its part, the
MRDPA is responsible for the monitoring and controlling the program’s
implementation. In this capacity, the Ministry can appoint representatives who,
together with counterparts from the State Inspectorate for Constructions, verify
the accuracy of reported data and compare it to the reality on the ground.


Post-Implementation
52.      The current legal framework includes no details on requirements for the
post-implementation phase – i.e., tracking the project’s performance after
completion. At least based on the methodological norms, once the actual works
are finished, the beneficiary sends a copy of the completion report to the Ministry.
If and when the warranty period expires, the local authority again sends a copy of
the formula documentation (“procesul verbal de recepție final”) to the MRDPA.
Beyond that, the two key post-implementation functions for any investment
program – i.e., ex-post monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and knowledge sharing –
appear to be missing at this point in the PNDL’s evolution. Put differently, there is




                                                                                  17
no formal process for evaluating the impact of completed investments and there
are no institutionalized efforts for communicating good practices among past,
current, and future beneficiaries of PNDL funds.



PNDL 2014 Portfolio Assessment
53.     The PNDL budget allocation in 2014 was substantial, transforming the
program (established only recently, in early 2013) into the main state-budget-
financed source of investment for local infrastructure. The total budget of PNDL
in 2014 was RON 2.3 billion (or about EURO 530 million). For 2013, the program
was initially allocated RON 492.94 million. 19 The initial PNDL budget allocation for
2015 was at around RON 1.6 billion (similar to what was estimated by the Bank in
the report on Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects.)

54.      Moreover, it has not been uncommon to increase the original budget
allocation for PNDL over the course of one year, as savings are realized in other
parts of the national budget. This happened in 2013 and again in 2014. In fact, in
2014 there were 3 substantial supplementary PNDL allocations added to the
original base. The third one represented 43% of the total 2014 allocation, while
the initial one represented 32% of the final budget as per the end of 2014. These
figures indicate that most of the projects are not following the standard
application process via the county councils but are rather submitted directly to the
MRDPA all year long.

55.     Budget allocation may be affected by short term political considerations .
The third supplementary allocation corresponds indeed to an elections period. We
can wonder whether the political agenda is driving the program as a whole but
also the individual allocations.

By Size
56.     The PNDL, as the main state-budget-funded program managed by the
MRDPA finances primarily small and lower-middle-sized investments. Following
the methodology used in the 2014 World Bank report on “Project Selection
Models” and using the Ministry of Finance’s definition for large projects, PNDL
projects were sub-divided in the following categories: large projects (more than
RON 100 million); upper-middle-sized projects (RON 30 – 100 million);
small/lower-middle-sized projects (RON 1.5 – 30 million); and very small projects
(less than RON 1.5 million). Very small projects (less than RON 1.5 million)
constitute 2.5% of the PNDL portfolio, while small/lower-middle sized projects
represent the bulk of projects, with an average value of around RON 6 million
(~EUR 1.4 million). Both very small and lower-middle sized projects fall under the
category of “small projects” according to the GEO 88/2013, i.e., they are under the
threshold of RON 30 million.

*Note: Only those projects were considered for which a total project value was available in the
MRDPA database. The total number of projects under consideration by PNDL is 3,952 (as of 12/2014)


57.      In 2014, most PNDL projects received relatively small allocations – on
average, close to RON 600,000. 47% were allocated under RON 300,000 and very
few (4.5%) received above RON 2 million. This result highlights the large difference
in budgetary allocations for projects financed by the PNDL. The highest allocation
for an individual project was RON 15 million, which went to modernizing a county
road in Vrancea, DJ 205 D. MRDPA data show that this particular county road is at
the 35% completion level and has a very large total value (RON 165 million). At the
very other end of the spectrum, the Țepu Commune in Galați County received only
RON 2,436 to finish up the sewage system, which had been financed under PNDL

small last payment.

By Sector
58.     The MRDPA provided the World Bank team with a database comprising
the key characteristics of all projects included in the PNDL for fin ancing as of late
November 2014. Roads (county and communal) represent by far the largest sector
financed through PNDL in 2014, accounting for over 55% of the total program
budget, followed by water and wastewater (with over 22% and 16%, respectively).
The table and figure below summarize the PNDL ’s allocation by sector for 2014,
emphasizing that the core priorities have indeed been aligned to the broader
objective of the program – as also stated in the 2013-2016 Governing Program –
namely the creation of a package of basic infrastructure for localities around
Romania (primarily in terms of roads, water, and sanitation).

By Implementation Status (Ongoing vs. New Investments)
59.      Budgetary allocations among new and ongoing investments suggest that
the concerning tendency to begin numerous new works before completing
ongoing ones has continued in 2014. Indeed, the number of new projects is
slightly higher than the number of ongoing projects receiving PNDL allocations in
2014 (53% of the investments financed are new). Ongoing projects received only
65% of the budget allocation. This is relatively low given the typically large
financial requirements of projects during the implementation phase compared to
the startup phase, which usually includes financing the detailed technical design
and possibly a limited first stage of works. However, the pattern is not
homogenous across sectors as can be seen in the table below.

60.     This is indicative of one of the main issues with the current PNDL: in the
absence of clear and rigorous selection and prioritization criteria (not only for
new projects, but also for selection among ongoing and new projects), the
project portfolio has continued to expand. New projects enter the pipeline, while
ongoing investments continue to advance at a very slow pace due to lack of
resources, facing the risk of degradation and higher costs than initially estimated.
The MRDPA and county-level authorities have repeatedly stated that Romania
should prioritize the completion of ongoing works, as opposed to starting new
ones. The number and value of ongoing projects are supposed to factor into the
MRDPA’s funding allocation across counties, while the projects’ percentage
completion rate is among the four possible criteria for prioritizing projects within a
county (though as the previous section noted the application of such criteria
remains vague and subjective). In practice, however, the PNDL has continued to
finance new investments (over 2,100 projects have been started over the course of
2014), despite the very large portfolio of ongoing projects. This situation risks




                                                                                              23
creating an ever-growing backlog, and decision-makers must strongly consider
solutions for more impactful and efficient allocation of funding.

Figure 6. The PNDL has continued to fund numerous new projects across most sectors (number of
projects, 2014)




                         Data source: MRDPA database for PNDL 2014



61.      A simple calculation goes a long way to show that it is vital to apply
much more rigor in the management of the PNDL portfolio going forward.
Importantly, the total value of the 3,952 PNDL projects (both new and ongoing) is
roughly RON 22 billion (or EUR 5 billion). Assuming that the annual budget that
PNDL will have at its disposal is similar to the allocation received at the beginning
of 2014 (i.e., around RON 1.5 billion in total, including funds to pay for
expenditures incurred during the previous year), at least 15 years will be needed
to finish the nearly 4,000 projects with financing contracts under the PNDL (or
about 10 years if the 2014 budget including all supplementary allocations was
taken as a basis). Obviously, this is neither an efficient, nor a realistic
implementation timeline, yet there is no clear evidence that the Government
intends to “freeze” or at least slow down the financing of new investments.
Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that the 3,952 figure does not even
include all ongoing projects previously financed by the MRDPA, so the number of
ongoing investments is likely to be even higher.




                                                                                          24
62.     Moreover, of the on-going projects, at least 1,188 (those for which data
was available), had a completion rate of less than 1%. In essence, this means that
the large majority of on-going projects can also be considered to be de facto new
projects, because they had a very low completion rate. This can obviously create
huge backlogs further down the road.

By Geographic Location
63.      The 2014 PNDL allocation for counties averages RON 57 million (roughly
EUR 12.7 million), but there is variation across different areas of the country. The
maps below show such differences in terms of the number and, respectively, value
of projects by county. The smallest financial allocation went to Alba County (RON
32.6 million, or 1.39% of the total PNDL budget), while Olt County received the
highest allocation (RON 91 million, or 3.91% of the total PNDL budget), nearly
three times as high. It is true that Alba’s GDP/capita is 5,900 EUR/inhabitant,
compared to 3,700 EUR/inhabitant for Olt, though this in of itself does not justify
allocating three times as much in funds for Olt. Despite such extreme examples,
the vast majority of county allocations (73%) are between 2-3% of the total PNDL
allocation for each county in total (i.e., including both new and ongoing
investments).

64.     Interestingly, there are significant differences across counties in the
types of projects they decided to finance, with some clearly expressing a
preference for completing ongoing investments as a matter of good practice. For
instance, Vaslui County received RON 50.4 million, investing RON 48.6 million in
ongoing projects; similarly, Vâlcea County received RON 78.7 million, of which RON
75.4 million (96%) went to ongoing investments. By contrast, the counties with the
largest shares of funds spent on completely new proje cts include: Galați (75% of
total funds allocated to new projects), Caraș-Severin (68%), Alba (68%), Satu Mare
(66%), and Tulcea (59%).

65.     The report under Component 2, on Prioritization Criteria for Local
Infrastructure Development Projects proposes a number of criteria (such as
investment needs, level of development, financial sustainability, etc.) for allocating
PNDL funds.

Chapter III: Main Challenges related to the Quality of PNDL Projects

Overall Project Quality Issues in Romania
66.      The issue of poor project quality is well-known in Romania, and many
reports have highlighted the challenges that the country faces in this respect.
The consequences of this situation are also widely recognized and include low
absorption rates (particularly for EU-funded programs), delays in procurement and
implementation, sub-optimal technical solutions, large differences between design
and reality on the ground, etc. The following sections briefly review these issues,
which are also relevant for PNDL projects, drawing on previous assessments by:
national bodies in charge with the implementation of budget-funded investment
projects, including the MRDPA (for social housing; social, cultural and sports
infrastructure; water and wastewater; thermal insulation, etc. 20 ); the Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs) and the Managing Authorities for different 2007-
2013 Operational Programs (see the Annual Implementation Reports 21 ). In
particular, the 2014 World Bank report “ROP 2.0: Support for Applicants and
Beneficiaries of the Regional Operational Program 2014-2020” provides an in-
depth assessment of such issues and offers potential solutions.


Program Design and Management Deficiencies
67.      First, managing authorities of investment programs have not dedicated
sufficient attention to building the administrative capacity of potential
beneficiaries (particularly local authorities). Technical assistance services have
not been sufficiently targeted to technical staff, and sometimes capacity
development has occurred too late (e.g., public procurement workshops happened
too late after the approval of Government Emergency Ordinance 66/2011). This
has aggravated the issue of lack of program design and management competence
at the local administration level. For their part, local authorities note that they face
tough constraints in attracting qualified personnel because of low salary levels and
the hiring freeze that was only lifted recently.

68.      There have also been deficiencies in building the administrative capacity
of program authorities and intermediary bodies. These have often resulted in
inefficient communication flows with the beneficiaries, unclear and overly
bureaucratic procedures (including financial forms), significant delays in evaluating
and contracting projects, late and unpredictable reimbursements of expenses

                                                                                    27
incurred by local authorities, etc. In addition, the delays in elaborating program
documents, the eligible expenditures order (EEO), and the payment and
reimbursement procedures have contributed to the creation of an insufficient and
inequitable contractual framework with beneficiaries (for example, some of the
local authorities benefitted from higher pre-financing levels than others, and the
rules have changed repeatedly during the 2007-2013 programming period).

Project Design Challenges
69.      Technical-economic documentations for infrastructure projects have
been often inconsistent with current legislation and have shown clear gaps in
quality. Common issues include: lack of technical description for the different
specializations (e.g., architecture, resistance, piping, etc.), unrealistic quantitative
and value estimations that lack correlation with identified needs and with the
technical expertise, lack of property documents for land and buildings or
inconsistent information concerning property issues within the project
applications, etc. In addition, projects included unclear/incomplete project
objectives, activities, and specificities. The project objectives were not well defined
or easy to measure, 22 and hence beneficiaries face challenges in monitoring and
evaluating results and in proving that a particular investment had reached set
targets.

70.     At the same time, budgets and estimates for human and time resources
have often been unrealistic and have lacked sufficient detail. The resources
forecasted for the implementation phase were often underestimated or even
missing for some activities. For example, the omission of the 10% of the total
project budget for exceptional and unforeseen expenses in the general estimate
caused serious problems for many beneficiaries. This resulted in non-eligible
expenses, cash-flow problems, and financial losses for the beneficiaries. Repeated
addenda to the financing and construction works contracts have been common,
causing further delays and difficulties in implementing projects. Particularly in
2012-2013, many financial corrections were applied by various audit and control
authorities that have noted irregularities (later on, some of these were “forgiven”
by the national government, in cases where the beneficiary of EU funding was not
found to be at fault).


Public Procurement Challenges
71.      The tenders’ documentation was often incomplete or outdated and
inconsistent with the investments ’ status and requirements. In some cases, even
the different sections of the same tender documentation were contradictory. The



22
   A more commonly used descriptor for objectives is SMART (specific, measurable,
actionable, realistic, and time-bound).




                                                                                    28
lack of any provision allowing or even requiring the bidders to visit the project
location sometimes led to inadequate proposals put together without full
information. In a few serious cases, some public works contracts were not
consistent with the terms of references for the respective procedures (for
example, an offer would be submitted without subcontractors, but subcontracting
was still possible later on in the project according to the contractual terms). Such
deficiencies have further aggravated the risk of non-eligible expenditures (for
example, when the exceptional and the unforeseen expenses were not included in
the terms of references).

72.     Other issues have resulted from inadequate selection criteria and
procedures. The most commonly used option was the lowest price criterion, which
would attract bidders with very low offers just to win the contract. While this is
indeed an important criterion, in the absence of strong evidence regarding the
technical and financial capacity of the firms, this could result in lengthy and costly
delays. The time required to complete the works was often utilized as an
evaluation criteria in the bidding documents, but this also led to proposals lacking
realism and also leading to the potential exclusion of serious bidders. Moreover,
the supporting documents for the participation and good execution guarantees
were sometimes missing. The procurement procedures’ report did not always
clearly justify the selection of the winning bidder or the rejection of other
proposals. Thus, it has not been uncommon to select companies that were then
unable to carry out the works in accordance with their proposals and would end
up delaying the works and/or requesting more funds. If extra time was granted
and the new time period exceeded the proposal of the second-placed bidder, the
equal and nondiscriminatory treatment principle of public tendering was violated.

73.     Perhaps the biggest drawback of the procurement framework has been
the frequent delays in signing the public contracts due to numerous appeals from
the losing bidders, sometimes leading to repeated procedures. In some other
cases, there was even a need to select another contractor or apply different
technical solutions, thereby increasing project implementation risks. If additional
works and values are not the subject of the terms of reference or of an addendum,
the associated expenses can be considered non-eligible by programs’ managing
authorities.


Project Implementation Challenges
74.     In the implementation phase, the main challenges result from
inconsistencies between project documentation and the situation on the
ground. These result in further delays in the implementation schedule, compared
to the agreed project calendar. The lack of an efficient reporting system for the
works supervisor (“dirigintele de șantier”) and the poor quality of the feasibility
study and/or the detailed technical design have often resulted in the need to sign
addenda to the construction works contracts leading to increases in their value,




                                                                                  29
without fulfilling the legal requirements. Besides the poor quality of the works by
selected contractors or the purchase of products with inadequate features and
performance, such issues are further adding to the risk of non-eligible expenses
for the beneficiaries.

75.     As noted earlier, internal capacity issues are also responsible for some of
the challenges related to the project implementation phase. Most public
authorities face the lack or temporary unavailability of key technical personnel.
Staff may lack the required competences for the implementation of the project,
may demonstrate poor knowledge of legal requirements and of specific
investment programs, and may contribute to poor communication inside the
project team and overall lack of motivation.

Assessment of PNDL Applications
76.      Between July 2014 and April 2015, a World Bank team of technical
experts assessed a sample of a total of 289 applications (feasibility studies). All
documentation was provided by the MRDPA and sampled using the approach
proposed in the inception report corresponding to this Component (submitted on
July 25, 2014). 23 As for the actual process of screening those technical-
documentations, this was proposed in the intermediate and final reports on
prioritization criteria (also under Component 2). 24

77.     The figure above summarizes the main steps proposed for reviewing
projects submitted for consideration under PNDL. The full review grid is included
in Annex 3 and the next paragraphs provide brief descriptions of each proposed
step. It is important to note that, at this stage of the engagement with the
MRDPA, the World Bank team has focused only on the following questions:
       i. Is the project financeable?
      ii. Can the project be financed from EU funds and, if so, from which
          operational program?
     iii. Could the project be financed from the state-budget-funded PNDL (i.e.,
          does it fit the program’s conformity and eligibility requirements)? What
          adjustments are needed, if any, to ensure that a proposed project could be
          financed from the PNDL?
It is thus for the other reports to be submitted under Component 1 of this broader
engagement (in March and August 2015, for intermediate and final outputs,
respectively) to apply criteria and answer an additional critical question: is the
proposed project a priority?

Step 1: Should the Project Be Considered for Financing?
78.     First, the assessment process tries to determine the basic need for a
project, i.e., whether a project should be considered for financing at all. This
does not propose to set overly restrictive eligibility criteria. The purpose is rather




                                                                                                                                              31
to ensure that limited funds be directed to projects that can indeed help achieve a
number of set targets. For instance, the Regional Waster Master Plans indicate
that the focus should be on agglomerations or clusters of over 2,000 people
equivalent (p.e.) for wastewater projects and on localities of over 50 population
equivalent (p.e.) for water projects. In the case of county and communal roads,
rehabilitation and maintenance projects typically have significantly higher
economic returns than new investments. Consequently, the funding priority
should be rehabilitation. Investment in new projects, such as critical missing links,
if any, or bypasses on road safety grounds can be considered on the basis of their
socioeconomic returns.


Step 2: Is the Project Eligible for EU Financing?
79.      Second, the proposed framework seeks to determine whether the
project may be eligible for EU funding, which is typically preferable given the
more favorable financing conditions. Operational Programs are prepared in
coordination with the Government based on certain criteria. Only the Managing
Authority for the respective Operational Program can decide whether the project
is ultimately eligible or not, but applicants should be directed and encouraged to
take this route before applying for PNDL support.

80.      A number of basic criteria are taken into consideration to assess a
project’s fit with Operational Programs that are now in draft form for 2014-2020.
In the case of county roads, one major criterion of fit with the Regional
Operational Program 2014-2020 is whether the county road actually connects to
the TEN-T Network. In the case of communal roads, the target for PNDL would be
smaller projects (roads of less than 5km), with bigger projects recommended for
funding from the National Rural Development Program (PNDR). In the case of
water and wastewater projects, a first check is to determine whether they are on
the list of priority projects for OP Large Infrastructure 2014-2020. If so, they would
be recommended for funding under this Operational Program. If a project is
included in the Regional Water Master Plan, but is not on the list of priority
projects for OP Large Infrastructure 2014-2020, it can be recommended for
financing under the PNDR.

Step 3: Could the Project Be Financed from the PNDL?
81.     Only projects that are assessed as generally financeable and at the same
time are considered to be non-eligible for EU funding should make it to this
stage. Currently, the MRDPA only performs a basic conformity and eligibility check
on submitted proposals for PNDL financing, based on a form that is not available
to applicants. This checklist can be (i) improved to reflect all legal requirements
and the PNDL eligibility criteria and (ii) made publicly available so that applicants
start working on ensuring that their proposals are complete and in line with
current legal provisions.




                                                                                  32
82.       Annex 5 provides an updated checklist to help DG RDI improve the
eligibility and conformity verification process. The recommendations are not
aimed at improving the technical quality of documentation (e.g., choosing
better/cheaper technical solutions, etc.), but merely refer to good practices for
ensuring the full administrative conformity and eligibility of proposals submitted.


Step 4: Is the Project a Priority that Should Be Financed from the PNDL?
83.      The last step should be the project prioritization, i.e., confirming that the
project fulfills priority criteria, but this is not possible at this stage of the World
Bank project, as explained above. The Component 2 final report on “Improved
Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects, ” delivered to MRDPA in parallel with this
report, includes a first proposal for how to determine, for each main type of
investment (county/local roads, water, wastewater, and social infrastructure),
whether a particular project proposed should be financed as a priority in a given
year. The Component 1 intermediate and final reports on prioritization criteria
(due in March and August 2015, respectively) have further refined this proposal
based on feedback collected from the MRDPA at the national level, and from
regional/county/local actors.

Key Findings from the Screening of a Sample of PNDL Project Proposals
84.     The MRDPA provided the World Bank team of technical and financial
evaluators with a total sample of 289 projects from July 14, 2014 through April
30, 2015. As in the full portfolio of projects, roads represent the largest sector,
followed by water and wastewater investment proposals.

85.     As the screening process advanced, the verification grid was improved
several times, as additional information was collected or changes were made to




                                                                                    33
the PNDL’s design. 25 For the first 74 projects reviewed, the team relied on a
verification grid largely based on the one used by the MRDPA. Since during the
first round of evaluation no social infrastructure application was screened, the
first triage grid included only roads, water, and wastewater. Also, in July 2014, the
list of eligible PNDL investments was updated by the MRDPA to include works for
City Halls buildings, which were then also included in the verification grid.

86.     For all proposals screened from September to December 2014 (an
additional 215 as of December 18, 2014), the Bank team adapted and expanded
the verification grid. For water and wastewater works, the first step (eligibility for
funding) was refined in order to make the grid compliant with the provisions of
the regional Master Plans for Water and Wastewater (2007-2013 and 2014-2020
versions). Also, the first triage grid reflected only the threshold of 2,000 p.e. The
updated grid includes the possibility to finance from the PNDL extensions of
networks for localities with less than 2,000 p.e., as long as they do not include
building an additional new wastewater treatment plant. Projects for localities
below 2,000 p.e. should follow the provisions of the master plans (clusters) and
should be co-financed by EU funds whenever possible. 26 Finally, the terminology
was updated. The term “communal roads” has been replaced by “local interest
roads” to follow the official classification and avoid having eligible roads be
excluded from the process.

87.    Some applications received late December 2014 were only assessed
during January and February 2015 with an updated grid . The first step was split
into two. First it is verified it the project is eligible to PNDL according to the
government requirements. In addition, social infrastructure was split into different
types and investment caps for eligibility to PNDL financing were introduced.
Maximum amounts were:
            - County roads: 22.7 million Euro (100 million RON)
            - Local Roads : 1 million Euro
            - Education, Health: 500,000 Euro
            - Culture: 1 million Euro
            - Sport facilities: 665,720 Euro (according to HG 363/2010)

88.     Additional applications were received and assessed in 2015 . These are
not included in this analysis for two reasons; First, these projects are to be
financed under 2015 PNDL budget and this analysis focus on the 2014 portfolio,




25
   The verification grid is the main instrument used by the technical evaluators to establish
whether a proposal submitted for PNDL financing passes the criteria established for
administrative conformity and eligibility.
26
    It is assumed that these metrics (2,000 p.e) were developed on the basis of
socioeconomic criteria and are now used for simplicity.




                                                                                          34
and second, the vast majority of them were prepared by the same design
company and correspond to social infrastructure, what would create a bias in the
analysis.

89.     Of the 215 technical-economic documentations reviewed according to
the updated grids, 212 projects (98.6%) passed step 1 and were recommended
for financing. The complete triage results for these projects are attached in Annex
7. The few projects, which were not accepted for financing include:
      Two projects excluded because they involved developing sewerage
        networks (including wastewater treatment plants) for communities of less
        than 2,000 p.e.;
      One project was excluded because it was not eligible (i.e., it involved
        building a storm water channel and new road covering it).

90.     A total of 39 projects out of the 212 eligible (18.4%) were recommended
as candidates for EU funds. This indicates that some projects submitted to PNDL
could actually be financed using other sources, in particular EU structural
instruments, which would also help increase the absorption of these funds. The
PNDL should only target projects that lack any other non-refundable option or
have been considered, accepted, but not financed under an EU program (e.g.,
because of lack of funding). Projects recommended as candidates for EU funds
included:
       For roads, projects involving road works on segments exceeding 5 km,
        which may be better suited for financing from the ROP or from the PNDR,
        depending on specific eligibility criteria (e.g., local roads may be financed
        from the PNDR, while county roads can only be financed from the ROP if
        they connect to the TEN-T Network) and projects including road sections
        classified as part of TEN-T Network and crossing a settlement/locality.

       For water, projects included in the respective Master Plan for Water and
        Wastewater, in a cluster with other communes with a common
        wastewater treatment plant These projects should therefore follow the
        technical solution from the Master Plan and the local authority may
        coordinate with the Regional Operator for Water and Wastewater and
        attract EU funding. For wastewater, either the project was also part of the
        Master Plan and then eligible under EU funds or it supplied communities
        over 2,000 p.e.
       one project complying with requirements of ROP financing, but has been
        rejected by the MA-ROP and has been submitted instead for PNDL
        financing. The ROP application should be improved and resubmitted.
91.    Even the 39 projects that were recommended for EU funding were still
screened against basic compliance with PNDL standards for the technical
documentation. This was done keeping in mind that all projects – regardless of




                                                                                  35
where they eventually get funding from – need to abide by a set of legal
regulations (e.g., have certain permits, structure the feasibility study according to
Government Decision 28/2008, etc.). Indeed, of the 39 projects, only one
presented complete documentation (the one that had been previously submitted
to ROP, since ROP’s assessment is more rigorous).

Cost Analysis of the Assessed PNDL Project Proposals
92.      According to the sample projects that MDRAP made available for the
Bank, an evaluation of the price per km for road rehabilitation/modernization
was made. Thus, for the projects with complete data (88 projects), the average
value for road rehabilitation/modernization is RON 900,652 per km, with the
smallest amount of RON 400,601 per km, for 2.1 km of road rehabilitation in Cluj
county, and the highest amount of RON 2,612,894 per km, for 21.79 km of street
rehabilitation in Constanta county. The big gap from these two extreme values
might be due to the geographic position (roads in a plane area are cheaper than
those in a mountain area), due to the art works that could be needed, but also
due to different technical equipment that might be used. Unfortunately, the
provided database does not offer such details. We can see however that roughly
50% of the projects have average cost per km comprised between 600,000 and 1
million RON.

93.     The costs of the overall projects are different according to the field, but
also to the area and the complexity of the works needed to be done. In the
tables below, a short analysis of the costs of portfolio projects is done, according
to the chapters from the general estimate (given by GD28/2008), where data was
available.

96.      The costs of Chapter 1, for obtaining and improving the land, vary from
field to field. This happens mainly due to the works that are needed to be done
before building the main investment. For example for Education or Municipality, if
the actual building is not in a proper state, the costs for demolition or removal of
the current utilities are very high. Also, considering Water and Roads,
deforestation, deviations from the site utility networks, dewatering, and diversion
of watercourses, are expensive treatments which need to be done. The low costs
from Medical, Culture and Sport suggest that no costs are needed to aquire the
land, nor to improve it in anyways. The big gap between the minimum and the
maximum values, both in Roads, are due to the differences between locations,
their actual administration, but also due to the solutions that were proposed in
the feasibility study (for a rehabilitation of a road surface the costs from Chapter 1
are much smaller than in the case of a road modernisation, consisting of widening
the carriageway, which involves removal of current utilities, deforestation, and
others).
97.     Chapter 2 – Costs for utilities needed. It includes the necessary expenses
to ensure the optimal operation of the investment, such as water suply, sewerage,
gas, heating, electricity, telecommunications, access roads, industrial railways,
which are built on the site that is legally defined as belonging to the investment
objective, and costs associated with the connection to utility networks.

98.     The costs for the utilities needed, reach high values for Sewage, Tourism,
Water and Municipality. These four fields are the one with the highest needs
regarding the connection to utility networks. This is a major part of the
investments for these types of fields for current design solutions. Even though this
chapter should reach a higher value also for Education, Medical and Sport, this
aspect was not approached according to the Project Portfolio reviewed by the
Bank Team.
99.        Chapter 3 - Costs for design and technical assistance include:

                 authorizations;

               o 3.3. Design and engineering : includes expense for the elaboration
                 of all design phases (prefeasibility study, feasibility study, detailed
                 design), but also technical verification of the documentations,
                 elaboration of energy performance certificate for buildings and
                 energy audit, elaborations of the documentations to obtain the

100. Design and technical assistance are key project components. This can be
obeserved by the sample size. Indeed, the number of projects with available data
taken into consideration for Chapter 3 is almost four times higher than the
number of projects considered for Chapters 1 and 2, so more reliable results are
expected from the analysis of this chapter. With an average value from all fields of
Th. RON 193.0, the highest costs for design and technical assistance are for
Sewage, Roads and Tourism. These types of projects consist of a higher level of
difficulty, including many field studies. Also, the magnitude of the project counts,
for example the maximum value is from a road rehabilitation and modernization
project of 21.79 km in Constanta county. The design and technical assistance costs
for Culture, Education, Medical, and Sport projects are much lower.

101. Chapter 3 covers many activities, as can be noticed in the table above. In
order to propose the best solution, field studies are needed, especially for Roads,
Sewage and Water works. The next stage is to apply for permits and approvals of
the proposed solutions, which depends on the number of administrations
established through the Urbanism Certificate, emitted by the Local County. The
highest percentage of Chapter 3 is covered by the design phase, which includes
the Feasibility Study (or the DALI), and the Detailed Design. In this phase, the
technical solutions are proposed, analyzed, and described. After the design and
engineering phase is approved, the acquisition procedures should start, with an
average cost of Th. RON 7.5. The Consulting and Technical Assistance values are
established according to the needs of the Beneficiary and the difficulty level of the
project.

103. The costs for Chapter 4, main investment costs, are strongly related to
the costs from Chapter 3, consulting and engineering. The more complicated are
the projects, the highest the construction costs are. Thus, Roads, Sewage, and
Tourism are the most expensive investments, comparing to the ones from Culture,
Education, Medical and Sport, which have a lower grade of difficulty regarding
construction technologies, and the overall investment has a smaller scale. The big
gap between the minimum and the maximum values for this chapter are due to
the differences regarding the area where the investment is made (building in
mountain areas is more expensive than in plain areas), the magnitude of the
investment (the minimum value for roads is for an investment regarding the
rehabilitation of a small bridge, and the maximum value is for the rehabilitation
and modernization of 21.79 km of roads), and the different technologies that are
proposed in the design phase.
104.     Chapter 5 – Other costs include:
               o 5.1. Site management : includes basic site manangement
                 expenditures (works), such as lockers for workers, warehouses for
                 materials, foundations for cranes, lighting, and others;

               o 5.2. Fees, taxes, interest: financing bank fee, the tax towards the
                 State Inspectorate in Constructions (ISC) for quality control of
                 construction works, urban planning and authorizations of
                 construction works, and others;

               o 5.3. Contingencies : the estimation of these expenses is a
                 percentage of the previous chapters, according to the complexity
                 of the work; for new investments, or for major rehabilitations,
                 extensions, modernizations, a percentage up to 10% is applied; for
                 consolidations or works due to natural disasters, a percentage up
                 to 20% is applied; these costs have the purpose to cover the
                 possible changes of the technical solutions, additional charges,
                 and others;

105. Chapter 5 costs, for other expenses, represent a certain percentage from
the other chapters, established by the designer according to the types of works
foreseen for the investment. For roads for example, the site management is the
heart of the entire building process, as it houses workers, materials, and
machines, and it is obviously higher than in other types of investments. The costs
from this chapter are also very important when taking into consideration the
possibility of changing the designed solution, a common aspect in nowadays
projects.
106.     Chapter 6 – Technological tests include:
               o 6.1. Personnel trainings on the correct use of equipments or
                 technologies;

               o 6.2. Technological samples and tests : includes expenses with the
                 tests according to the detailed design, grinding, and others.

107. From 191 projects with available data for Chapters 3 and 4, only 23
projects had data on Chapter 6, on 5 fields out of 9. Thus, it is difficult to draw up
clear conclusions.
108. Different allocations in the General Estimate are given for the works of
the 9 fields, in the Project Portfolio. A summary of these allocations is provided in
the figure below, with a comparison of each chapter. As can be noticed, the
highest amount for all types of fields is allocated within Chapter 4 – Main
investments costs, with a rate of about 80% from the total cost. The following two
chapters from the perspective of costs are Chapter 3 – Consulting and
engineering, with an average of about 5%, and Chapter 5 – Other expenses, with
an average of about 7.5%. The other 3 chapters represent the difference of about
7.5%, just a small amount considering the main investment costs.
109. The overall cost distribution per chapter is given below. We can see that
the capital investments represent from 80 to 90% of the total costs. The second
highest post is ‘other costs’ covering site management, fees, taxes, interest and
contingencies. Follows then ‘ costs for design and technical assistance’
representing 5.6% of the total cost in average.

Main Issues Identified During the Assessment Process
110. The overall screening process of the sample of projects submitted to the
PNDL has revealed some common conformity and eligibility issues. All of the
following are aspects related to the administrative compliance of the evaluation
and, therefore, local authorities (program applicants) can correct/complete/
update the submitted documentation upon receiving clarification requests from
the MRDPA’s technical staff. The following sub-sections describe the typical issues
encountered, with the aim of signaling to the MRDPA and to local authorities
where gaps may exist in the documentation they submit or where the quality
needs to be improved.


Issue #1: Lack of Supporting Documents/Technical Studies
111. The field studies (the topographic study, the geotechnical study, etc.)
and the technical review/control are basic documentation required by
Government Decision 28/2008. Naturally, they are also required by the PNDL.
Legislation in this field includes the following:
       The Geotechnical Study’s elaboration is stipulated by the Normative
        regarding the geotechnical documentation for constructions (Indicative
        NP 074-2014). The verification/authentication must be done by a project
        verifier, certified for the Af field (i.e., “terrain resistance/solidity and
        stability of the setting for massive constructions”);
       According to the directive of the General Manager of ANCPI (the
        Romanian Office for Cadastre and Land Registration) No. 700/09.07.2014
        regarding the approval of the Regulations for approval, reception, and
        registration in Register, the topographic drawings of the feasibility studies
        must be approved by the relevant agency.
       Article 5, paragraph (3) from the Government Decision (GD) 28/2008
        warrants that the development of the technical review is a necessary
        phase in the design of construction works for intervention operations.




                                                                                  45
       The technical review/control is performed by a technical expert,
        authorized by the MRDPA and the designer must follow its
        recommendations.

112.    Lack of the technical support documentation can lead to the following:
       The proposed technical solution is not adequate for the investment;
       The estimated value of the investment from the feasibility
        study/documentation for approving intervention works (FS/DALI) phase
        changes during the detailed technical design phase (in most cases, this
        results from the underestimation of the investment value);
       Subsequent changes to the technical solutions proposed in the FS/DALI
        stage may be required (construction system, emplacement, etc.), which
        would breach Ordinance 863/2008 and lead to extra costs.
       There may be delays in the implementation of construction works;
       Construction works may be suspended for lack of proper documentation
        and sufficient financial resources.
Issue #2: Inadequate/Insufficient Technical Documentation
113. Two main issues are found under this category: the submission of the
DALI instead of the FS and the submission of the Detailed Technical Design
instead of the FS. The feasibility study (FS) includes technical and economic
documentation necessary for executing construction works for new investments,
while the DALI is required for intervention operations on existing infrastructure
(modernization, rehabilitation/consolidation, etc.). The framework content for the
FS or DALI is established through the provisions of Annex 2 and Annex 3 of GD
28/2008. Also, the required basic studies are mentioned for each type of
investment. For example, the technical review/control is required only for the
DALI, while the cost-benefit analysis is required only for the FS.

114. A related problem occurs when the project includes a mix of new works
(e.g., expansions/additions) and interventions on existing infrastructure. Many
applicants incorrectly submit the DALI as technical documentation, although
according to Article 5, paragraph (1) of GD 28/2008, expansions are treated as
equivalent to new investments. Also, according to the Order of the Minister MDRL
276/2009, which modified GD 28/2008, the necessary documentation, in the case
of mixed investments, is the technical review/control and the FS.

115. The Detailed Technical Design (in Romania, equivalent to the “Technical
Project” – TP) is not accepted as technical documentation for financing,
according to GEO 28/2013 that established the PNDL. According to Ordinance
863/2008, the TP is to be elaborated based on the FS/DALI, which sets the
technical and economic indicators as well as the main technical solutions for the
project. In the TP stage, a series of aspects that are not part of the previous stage



                                                                                  46
(FS/DALI) are no longer analyzed. In the TP, the technical and economic scenarios
for reaching the investment project’s objectives are not analyzed, and neither is
the legal status of the land, utility aspects, and the cost benefit analysis.
Therefore, in the absence of FS/DALI, key elements of the projec t’s approval are
unknown to the evaluators. In this situation, stage 3 of the triage grid cannot be
performed, so a request should be sent to the applicant, specifying the need of FS
or DALI to be provided.

Issue #3: Incorrect Project Budget (Cost Breakdown)
116. Errors in the calculation of the project budget were commonly noticed in
the screening process. In many cases, the sum of the budget chapters is not equal
with the General Total of the Budget because the applicants do not seem to be
using a spreadsheet. Also, the applicants apply a wrong percentage for the VAT:
19% (the quota before July 1, 2010) instead of 24%. Additional typical budget-
related errors include: (i) arithmetical errors; (ii) VAT applied to taxes; (iii) wrong
VAT amount; (iv) a format other than the one established through GD 28/2008; (v)
incorrect registration of amounts in budgetary chapters, typically as a way to
lower expenditures so that they abide by the set standard costs. Such mistakes
can lead to incorrect estimates of the value of investment (under/over estimation)
with a potentially major impact upon the funds’ allocation process. The projects
can be affected too if there is a gap in the available funding compared to the
needs on the ground. Another cause for underestimation of the budget is the lack
of correlation between the sum of the main works budgets and the total amount
foreseen in the cost breakdown (under chapter 4, as set in the GD 28/2008).

117. Indeed, errors in registering the amounts in the budgetary chapters can
“circumvent” the limits established by Annex 3 of GD 363/2010 on standard
costs. For example, some applicants register the costs related to the installation
works in chapter 2 where normally the costs with connecting to utilities are
included, therefore avoiding the application of the standard cost computation. In
such cases, applicants should be requested to make changes to their project’s
budget.

Issue #4: Insufficient Cost Breakdown for Main Works
118. According to Annex 4, article 8, paragraph (4) of GD 28/2008, “the
expenses for each construction item are to be assessed through the Estimate of
the Construction works.”28 Annex 6 of the same act states its breakdown
structure. Beyond the non-compliance with the legal demands, providing no or
insufficient details on the estimation of the main works in the budget makes it
impossible or very difficult for evaluators to verify whether the project abides by
the set standard costs. Another issue that results from insufficient detailing of the

                                                                                    47
budget for the main works is the lack of correlation between the technical
description and the budgetary estimation of the same items, and therefore can
lead to an incorrect assessment of the real project costs. Applicants should clarify/
address such aspects before their projects can be approved for PNDL financing.

Issue #5: Lack of Main Drawings
119. According to Annexes 2 and 3 of GD 28/2008, drawings from the FS/DALI
must include:
     The Site Plan (1:25000-1:5000);
       The General Layout (1:25000-1:5000);
       Plans and general cross sections of architecture, structure, installations,
        special plans, longitudinal or transversal profiles, on a case by case basis.

Lack of such drawings or their development without the topographic
documentation received from the Romanian Office for Cadastre and Land
Registration can lead to delays in obtaining the Construction Permit. For example,
if at the receipt of the execution plans for the Construction Permit differences are
noticed between the configuration and the surface of the measured property that
is the object of reception and the configuration and surface of the property
recorded in the Real Estate Register, the receipt is formally rejected and an
updated cadastral documentation will need to be resubmitted with the technical
information. Also, the lack of drawings (e.g., plans and general sections of
architecture, durability, structure, installations, etc.) can lead to approval of
technical solutions that are incomplete and may lead to incorrect evaluations of
the built surface, the volumetric analysis, etc. and directly affect the estimated
value of investment. In such cases, applicants are requested to provide the
missing drawings.

Issue #6: Noncompliance with Standard Costs
120. The maximum values for unit costs are established through Annex 3 of
GD 363/2010, modified through GD 250/2011. The provisions for some
investment types are, however, not very clear, which can lead to incorrect
interpretations by the applicants. The most frequent mistake in applying standard
cost has been noticed with road infrastructure projects where the MRDPA has
only included the “road shoulder , ” “causeway system, ” and “elements for
drainage” (i.e., only earth ditches). Most of the applicants understand, however,
that the standard costs cover all the costs of the budget, including the costs for
concrete ditches, for traffic safety, and other earthworks.

121. Noncompliance with standard costs was also a common issue in social
infrastructure investments such as education facilities.




                                                                                  48
Issue #7: Lack of Documents for Property/ Assets
122. Property documents are requested by GEO 28/2013 for approving the
PNDL and by MDRL Ordinance 839/2009 for obtaining the Construction Permit.
In practice, some applicants fail to include them, which can lead to erroneous
identification of the estate (built/land) in the studies’ area. In this case, lack of
property documents and estate drawings does not allow overlapping the cadastral
documentation with the topographic one, which could lead to an incorrect
location for the construction (including possible extensions), with negative effects
on the accuracy of the technical solution and estimated costs.

Issue #8: Missing/Expired/Incomplete Urban Certificate (UC)
123. According to Article 1 of the MDRL Ordinance 863/2008, in the FS/DALI
stage all approvals and principle agreements must be obtained. Approvals,
agreements, and studies related to the planning certificate can establish
preconditions for starting the investment, so it is vital to obtain these approvals
(permits) and agreements before the development of the FS, which needs to take
into account possible recommendations or constraints foreseen by these
documents. Lack of complete approvals/permits can lead to inadequate,
unfunded, or invalid technical solutions that are not in accordance with the type,
technical characteristics, and availability of existing utilities. This was a common
mistake in particular for social infrastructure for which permits and certificate of
urbanism were often missing.

Issue #9: Local Council Decision Requiring Amendments
124. There are multiple situations in which a local council decision concerning
a particular project submitted for PNDL financing may require amendment.
These include the following:

       The approved total amount of the investment is insufficient compared to
        the total budget amount ;
       The amount of the local authority’s own contribution is not explicitly
        mentioned;
       The amount of the own contribution does not cover all ineligible costs.
According to provisions of Annex 3 of GD 28/2008 and provisions of article 46,
paragraph (3) from Law 500/2002 regarding public finances, investment expenses
for feasibility studies and other studies associated to investments (e.g.,
intervention works) are to be approved by the main credit release authority.
According to provisions of article 36, paragraph (4) of Law 215/2001, the Local
Council “approves, upon the mayor’s request, technical-economic
documentations for local interest investment works, under current legal
conditions. ” Also, according to article 126 of Law 215/2001, “construction works
and repairs of public interest, financed through the local budgets, will be executed
only based on the technical and economic documentation, approved by the local
council. ”



                                                                                  49
125. Lack of all required permits can lead to suboptimal investment decisions
that do not have the lo cal council’s approval and/or do not have the allocated
financial resources from the local budget. Lack of financial resources associated
with the co-financing can lead to incorrect financial allocations by the MRDPA and
possibly to suspension of works for lack of financial resources.




                                                                               50
Chapter IV: Observations and Recommendations for Policy
Measures

126. Throughout the assessment of the 289 projects in the sample received
and based on the overall analysis of the application process, the team has
identified some areas of improvement . There are a number of ways to enhance
the efficiency and transparency of project evaluation. As noted earlier, this report
does not address project prioritization issues, as they are discussed in a dedicated
separate report. 29

127. The following policy measures seek to make positive improvements to
the current system, without a full overhaul of the PNDL – this may be called the
“Status Quo+” scenario. By contrast, the framework suggested in the report
dedicated to prioritization criteria departs more significantly from the current
program structure.

1) Refocus PNDL’s Scope and Avoid Overlaps with Other Programs
128. The PNDL finances a wide range of investments . These include: i)
modernization of villages; ii) urban regeneration of municipalities and towns; and
iii) county infrastructure. But investments in these sectors are also financed by
other programs (e.g., the Regional Operational Program, the National Rural
Development Program, etc.). Moreover, the PNDL finances projects across all
stages: i) projects meant to create new infrastructure; ii) projects for the
extension/rehabilitation/modernization of existing infrastructures; and iii) projects
that cover ongoing projects. The program description does not clearly indicate the
assessment methods specific to the three project types, as classified by stage.

129. The current analysis suggests that the PNDL should finance projects that
have no possibility of receiving non-reimbursable funds. The maximum funding
amount from PNDL should also be specified for each type of project.

2) Improve projects’ technical documentation
130. A major issue identified during the assessment of the applications was
the low quality of the technical documentation. To make sure that the
applications follow the requirements, it is recommended that the MRDPA prepare
and provide an Applicants Guide. This guide would provide interested potential




29
  See final report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects,” delivered with
the MRDPA together with this current output (on December 23, 2014)




                                                                                             51
beneficiaries with all the information needed to prepare the application, including
available funds, documentation required, and the type of projects to be prioritized
(which may change for different programming periods). The guide should detail
the filling-in manner, the eligibility conditions for the project and the applicant
(and for the partners, if applicable), and should cover compliance, assessment,
contracting, implementation, settlement, project completion and final payment,
the checklist of documents (Model Annex 5), the assessment grids (Model Annex
3), the financing contract template, the design, execution, supervision,
performance and audit contract templates.

131. The Applicant Guide would ensure complete transparency of the entire
PNDL process and provide a coherent and fair framework for all applications.
The ROP guide may be used as a basis for the preparation of the PNDL guide. The
documents and forms specified in the Applicants Guide shall bring rigor in drafting
the documentations for the requests for funding and would make the entire
process easier, including during the phases of implementation and upon the
project’s completion. The period for assessing the requests for funding is expected
to become shorter as a result of reducing the number of cases where clarifications
are needed during the assessment process.

3) Build capacity for effectiveness
132. The experience of the EU-funded programs in the 2007-2013
programming period indicates that local authorities need continuous technical
assistance, especially during the project preparation phase. A relative easy way
to deliver this kind of assistance is to set up a help-desk system, either at central
level (MRDPA) or inside the intermediary bodies, depending on the chosen
institutional architecture of the management system (for example RDAs or County
Councils).

133. Considering that most rural local authorities do not possess competent
personnel for evaluating the project design quality, an option would include the
extension of the help-desk services up to a pre-evaluation of the project proposal
at the intermediary body level, at least from the eligibility point of view. This step
would significantly reduce the workload of the evaluators that are confronted
with a big number of incomplete documentations (see the project sample
assessment).

134. It is also necessary to increase of capacity at MRDPA level to appraise
projects . A systematic training program could be set-up at the Ministerial level, so
that the decision on project selection is consistent across the Ministry. Overall,
project appraisal skills must be developed across in a coordinated fashion, so that
the new skills are actually applied in decision-making and not left to atrophy. An
example could be the approach pursued by Ireland’s Central Expenditure
Evaluation Unit. As a key component of strengthening the country’s public




                                                                                   52
investment management system, the unit has been promoting the delivery of
professional training in public investment management through the country’s Civil
Service and Development Centre. Even countries with long established public
investment management systems, like the UK, are giving renewed emphasis to
systematic training: the established UK Major Projects Authority intends to train
200–300 civil servants over the next five years through its Major Projects
Leadership Academy. Among transition economies, Slovenia’s public investment
management regulation reinforces the importance of developing and maintaining
capacities by mandating the finance ministry to define training requirements and
organize training.

4) Design and Roll Out Awareness-Raising Campaigns for Beneficiaries
135. Once the Applicant Guide will be available, a series of awareness-raising
campaigns are necessary to ensure the document has reached the potential
beneficiaries of the PNDL. At least one meeting with the local authorities should
be organized in each county, or a few meetings per region at the Regional
Development Agencies may also work well to promote the funding opportunity.

136. An improved website for the program is also necessary for quickly
providing all relevant documents and information for future and current
beneficiaries. PNDL is publicized on the official web page of MRDPA
(www.mdrt.ro/lucrari-publice/pndl), which includes Order 1851/ 2013, with all
annexes, and GEO 28/2013. No other key information about this program is
available.

137. The communication around the program and on the financed projects is
a key condition for stimulating potential applicants to prepare and submit
projects. The official page of the PNDL should publish the financial allocations per
county, the list of projects contracted for financing, including the related amounts,
and the projects’ implementation stage.

5) Enhance the Project Selection Model
138.    The requests for funding should be assessed in four phases:
       Phase I – Expression of Interest;
       Phase II – Eligibility and compliance verification (based on the updated
        grid included in Annex 3); and
       Phase III – Technical and financial evaluation;
       Phase IV (as needed) – Field assessment.

139. The documentation related to the request for funding should include, in
the first stage, an Expression of Interest (EoI presented in Model Annex 1) based
on which the MRDPA should assess whether it may grant the funding. The




                                                                                  53
documentation related to the EoI should also be drafted based on an Applicant
Guide containing a sample EoI and the annexes thereto, including the documents
to be submitted by applicants.

140. In addition, the requests for funding are currently assessed at the level
of the MRDPA only in terms of the extent to which the applicant and the
proposed project meet the eligibility conditions. This is not a technical
assessment based on an assessment grid with criteria and scores. The PNDL
should include a thorough technical and financial evaluation (TFE) of proposed
projects that are deemed to be eligible for funding and in full conformity with the
program’s administrative requirements. Projects that do not pass the conformity
and eligibility verification should not make it to the TFE phase. EU-funded
programs like the ROP and the PNDR provide good examples of what the TFE
should consist of (these were discussed in more detail in the PNDL Prioritization
criteria report that was delivered to the MRDPA in parallel with this report).
Verification/evaluation grids should be published along with Applicant Guides to
ensure that there is full transparency regarding how proposed projects are
reviewed. Importantly, this step in the process can be iterative: evaluators should
ask for clarifications and applicants – with the help of their consultants and
designers – should be allowed the opportunity to improve the submitted
documentation. A maximum number of clarification rounds can be set to two, as
is typical for the EU-funded programs.

141. The requests for funding must then be prioritized based on a set of
criteria. The current criteria for prioritizing ongoing and new investments under
the PNDL (the signing date of the supply/service/works contract, as applicable, the
project completion stage, the population served, the percentage of co-financing
from the local budget) cannot be implemented transparently. County Councils
may choose “at least one” of the four criteria (unclear which ones are chosen in
practice), there are no baselines (is it better to have an older signing date or a
more recent one?), and there are no weights.

142. The World Bank team has prepared, under Component 2 of this
technical assistance, a report proposing a clear set of criteria for prioritizing
PNDL investments. The evaluation process for project proposals under PNDL
should be adapted to their specificity (small projects) by using a relatively simple
set of selection criteria, given also the limited administrative capacity of the DG
RDI to process a large number of projects.

143. The requests for funding should be assessed according to the above two
phases, plus a Phase III for field visits, as needed . This may complement an online
processing system for applications; field visits would aim to verify all documents
submitted electronically and also check conditions on the ground for performing
the proposed projects. The implementation of assessment phase III will also
increase the success rate for the projects to be financed through PNDL.




                                                                                 54
6) Create a Standard Application System
144. According to Article 11, item 7 of GEO 28/2013, County Councils are
required to send the list of funding proposals within 15 days after the planned
budget has been transmitted. This is circumvented in exceptional circumstances,
whereby applicants may send funding proposals directly to MRDPA. Since MRDPA
makes budget allocations to PNDL for each County Council, it is unclear how the
projects received directly from applicants (and not through the County Councils)
are accounted for. The recommendation is to repeal item 7, so that all applicants
send funding proposals only through their corresponding County Council. This
would create a non-discriminatory treatment of applicants and ensure project
financing based on clear priorities. This is not to say that the MRPDA should not
play an active role; indeed, it would have the important task of ensuring
continuous monitoring and control of how County Councils are prioritizing
projects and managing them.

145. An option to be considered is for the MRDPA to delegate the evaluation,
technical assistance, contracting, and some monitoring tasks to intermediary
bodies (IBs) that are already experienced in these respects, such as the RDAs.
This option would also ensure a better communication between the beneficiaries
and the program authorities, considering that most local administration have
worked with RDAs for other programs (PHARE and the 2007-2013 ROP). County
Councils themselves may act as IBs (except for their own projects submitted for
financing, which would go straight to the MRDPA for evaluation). The next
iteration of this report will further explore the pros and cons of these various
institutional structures.

7) Introduce Tendering for Technical Documentation with Suspension
Clauses
146. On the basis of current procedures for contracting, actual construction
works for new projects can begin no earlier than November of a given calendar
year. This situation causes technical problems during the winter time or
postponement of the execution of the budget exercise for the future, which
means inefficiency in spending the funds allocated for the year in progress. Once
the Applicant Guide is provided for a given year, applicants should be able to start
the tendering process with suspension clauses for technical documents necessary
for financial contracts. The suspension clause essentially says that the local/county
authority would only allow the winning bidder to start implementing the contract
once the financing source is secured, i.e., the PNDL application is approved and
the contract with the MRDPA is signed.




                                                                                  55
8) Revise Standard Cost Policies and the Eligible Expenditures Order
147. Implementation of cost standards for infrastructure is imperfect and has
posed challenges to beneficiaries. The intention for deploying the cost standards
is praiseworthy as a solution for keeping project costs under control, as well as to
help in planning The problem is that current cost standards are not sufficiently
developed and, in some cases (i.e., wastewater systems), they do not exist at all. 30
They also do not reflect updated nominal values (i.e., values have not been
adjusted for inflation since 2010), or supply and demand fluctuations; and it is also
unclear if comparisons between project values and cost standards should reflect
RON or EUR values.

148. Although the technical solutions included in the legislation on standard
costs (particularly for the road infrastructure) are just a recommendation, they
are adopted by all applicants. Designers thus choose lower-quality, cheaper, less
efficient technologies, which may result in higher long-term costs. In this context,
it is challenging to adopt new/greener technologies that may come at a premium
cost upfront, but which may be cheaper over the long term (e.g., if one takes life-
cycle costing into consideration).

149. Cost standards should be updated or waived completely. In the latter
scenario, the authorities could use instead a list of reference prices denominated
in EUR to make sure that costs are kept under control. In this case databases with
ranges for local prices for the main materials should be created. In any case,
technical solutions proposed should be only indicative and designers/beneficiaries
should be properly informed that they may adopt alternative options that are
superior in terms of short/long-term costs and quality.

150. As for the Eligible Expenditures Order (EEO), because the PNDL is in its
entirety a state-budget-funded program, with money coming essentially from
the same source, there is no reason to over-regulate beyond GD 28/2008.
Currently, the methodological norms specify a list of non-eligible expenditures
(article 8 (3)), including feasibility studies, specialty studies, technical assistance,
taxes, etc. The list, as it stands, is arguably a better option than what was
deployed under the ROP 2007-2013, which defined what can be financed,
excluding by default anything that was not specifically mentioned in the Order of
Eligible Expenditures. In other words, it is nearly always better to define what
does not qualify for reimbursement, as currently under the PNDL. It may still be
worth it, however, to look at the list of non-eligible expenditures and decide
whether it would warrant an exception.




30
  The MRDPA currently uses instead a rule of thumb whereby cost standards for wastewater
systems are roughly 1.5 times the cost standards for water supply systems.




                                                                                     56
9) Introduce Project Implementation Monitoring
151. The current procedure provides no mechanism for monitoring the
implementation of the projects financed through PNDL. The monitoring is based
on the Reports sent by County Councils which are drafted by using the data sent
by the funding beneficiaries only, for each of the three subprograms of PNDL (i.e.,
modernization of the Romanian village, urban regeneration of municipalities and
towns, and infrastructure at county level).

152. To achieve a higher success rate of projects and avoid financial deadlock
situations, the financing contract should include : (i) advance payment (could be
up to 10% of the contract value), (ii) clear terms and conditions for disbursement
tranches (e.g., advance payments - 1 month after contract signing, interim
payments – a maximum of 3 tranches, and final payment – a maximum of 1 month
after contract completion). Also, stipulations related to penalties on both
contractual parties should be included in the financing contract. The financing
contract should also include template formats for monitoring and reporting
process.

153. Proper monitoring is needed to verify the reimbursement requests
submitted by beneficiaries. Beneficiaries now request funds directly from the
MRDPA, a simpler process than before, when they had to first send the requests to
county councils. County council staff interviewed, however, reports that they
would like to remain involved to be able to coordinate and monitor the
implementation process in their respective jurisdiction, as required by the PNDL
implementation norms. Once it approves the requests received, the Ministry
channels the funds – within the set annual limits and based on the
proofs/documents received (“situații de lucrări”) – directly to beneficiaries. Finally,
beneficiaries send back to the MRDPA the proof of payment of service providers
(i.e., showing that the funds received were used for the intended purpose).

154. The main monitoring mechanism is currently based on the role of the
engineer/work supervisor (“diriginte de șantier”), who has the full legal
responsibility to verify work progress. For EU-funded programs, this monitoring
function is also carried out by Intermediate Bodies (e.g., Regional Development
Agencies) and Managing Authorities and the National Audit Authority, on a
sampling basis. It is true, however, that PNDL projects are typically much smaller,
so caution is needed with respect to recommending a much more complicated
system than the current one. As for the PNDL, it is clear that the monitoring
function could not be accomplished solely by the MRDPA at the central level, for
the simple reason of lack of capacity and high costs of sending monitoring missions
throughout the country. At the most, the MRDPA can verify a carefully selected
sample of projects, focusing on the most complex and expensive investments. As
noted in the law, the Ministry can appoint representatives who, together with




                                                                                    57
counterparts from the State Inspectorate for Constructions, verify the accuracy of
reported data and compare it to the reality on the ground.

155. In addition, a solution for proper monitoring is to have specific units
within county councils that can carry out this function on a continuous basis. The
advantage would be that these authorities are close to the ground and can more
easily supervise work progress and also verify the accuracy of submitted expenses.
This step would precede the beneficiaries sending reimbursement requests to the
MRDPA. In other words, the chain of actions can be adjusted as follows: (i) a
beneficiary submits to the respective county council the report on the work
performed, including reimbursement requests, based on a simple, standard
template (the one currently defined through the PNDL methodological norms is
sufficiently clear); (ii) the county council verifies the accuracy of the reports and of
the expenses, approves/amends it with the local beneficiary; (iii) the MRDPA
receives the report and, based on the sampling methodology, can decide whether
to subject it to further verification or clear it for reimbursement. Of course, this
system would not apply in the case of county council projects (for obvious reasons
related to conflicts of interest); in those situations, the monitoring would have to
be done by the MRDPA.

156. An alternative, simpler solution is to hire independent auditors to assess
the expenses made and the accuracy of reimbursement requests. This has the
advantage of relying on neutral parties that are completely outside the decision-
making chain related to PNDL projects. It would also not require expanding the
government apparatus at the county council level. Also, EU-funded projects
employ such resources to help with certifying expenses, so it would not be a new
practice in Romania. As noted in the World Bank report on the Regional
Operational Program 2014-2020, the role and functions of auditors require several
improvements in the Romanian context: first, auditors should go beyond a simple
desk review of accounting documents, but thoroughly evaluate every
reimbursement request, including procurement procedures that have led to
particular expenses; equally important, in other countries, a best practice is to
require these actors to also perform technical audits, which would act as an
additional filter verifying the quality of the technical documentation and
construction works performed.

10) Introduce Post-Implementation Monitoring
157. The current legal framework includes no details on requirements for the
post-implementation phase – i.e., the project’s evolution upon completion. At
least based on the Methodological Norms, once the actual works are finished, the
beneficiary sends a copy of the completion report to the Ministry. If and when the
warranty period expires, the local authority again sends a copy of the formula
documentation (“procesul verbal de recepție final”) to the MRDPA. Beyond that,
the two key post-implementation functions for any investment program – i.e., ex-




                                                                                    58
post monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and knowledge sharing – appear to be
missing at this point in the PNDL’s evolution. Put differently, there is no formal
process for evaluating the impact of completed investments and there are no
institutionalized efforts for communicating good practices among past, current,
and future beneficiaries of PNDL funds. This is not surprising for a young program
like the PNDL; still, going forward, it would be important to set-up ex-post
mechanisms to ensure the continuous improvement of the instrument. The final
report on component 3 discusses the basic features and key advantages of post-
monitoring and asset management systems.
