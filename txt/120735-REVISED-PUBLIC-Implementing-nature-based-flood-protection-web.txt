    Introduction
            Floods are the most frequent and damaging of all natural
            hazards globally. Between 1994 and 2013, floods accounted
            for 43% of all recorded natural events, affecting nearly 2.5
            billion people1. During exceptional years such as 1998 and
            2010, total losses due to flooding have exceeded $40 billion.
            In the coming decades with climate change, urbanization,
            and demographic growth, the impact of coastal, fluvial, and
            pluvial flooding is expected to increase significantly. Effective
            flood risk management is critical to protect people and their
            livelihoods from flooding and to limit future losses. Nature-
            based measures and their ability to address flood risk are
            receiving increasing attention.

    Introduction
      A number of pilot projects and technical reports have
      recently been released on the implementation of nature-
      based solutions for flood risk management. Five basic
      principles to guide future nature-based project development
      have come out of these pilot projects—both during design,
      implementation, and maintenance—and reports on the
      topic. The main purpose of these principles is to promote
      best practices and prevent common pitfalls in the use of
      nature-based solutions. As such, these principles are meant
      as guidance for project development and initiation and not
      as a specific design manual. For more detailed information
      on design, existing technical guidelines (including the
      US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
      (NOAA)2, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)3, and
      Ecoshape4) and guidelines under development (USACE) can
      be consulted.

Principle 5: Adaptive management
Nature-based solutions for flood risk management need
adaptive management based on long-term monitoring.
This ensures their sustainable performance.

As nature-based solutions evolve over time, they
require continuous management and monitoring
of their effectiveness. The management of nature-
based solutions should strongly draw on knowledge
of ecosystem management, which requires a proper
understanding of ecosystem dynamics. One example of
an adaptive management strategy is the nourishment
of extra sediment, as sometimes practiced in beach
and dune systems. Another example is the exclusion of
grazers or predators if these limit ecosystem recovery.

     Step 1: Best practice example and additional resources

     Example project
     The Ecoshape consortium consists of engineering companies, contractors, research institutes, and
     NGOs. It implements a large-scale project on restoration of eroding mangrove coasts in Central Java,
     Indonesia. The project is conducted in joint operation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
     Food, and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. It entails a unique combination of engineering
     and water management knowledge with an intensive community-based approach. The objective of the
     project is to halt coastal erosion through the construction of permeable bamboo dams that mitigate
     wave energy and increase elevation by trapping sediment. These measures create suitable conditions
     for mangrove recovery. The project continues to work on rehabilitation of aquaculture ponds, including
     the creation of alternative income sources. Clear targets are defined for different coastal stretches in the
     design and engineering plan. Each year, a new design and implementation process begins. This is based
     on community consultation and on monitoring results from previous years. Before project initiation,
     commitment from local communities and governmental organizations on national and local level was
     sought.

     Step 2: Best practice example and additional resources

     Example project
     In 2000, The Nature Conservancy in collaboration with the U.S. Agency for International Development
     established a water fund. This fund directs money from water users to improve protection of the Condor
     Biosphere Reserve in Ecuador. In 2004 the fund managed $2.1 million, financed by the Quito Municipal
     Water and Sewage Agency, the Quito Electricity Company, and the Andina Beer Company. The project
     reports successes on both social and ecological fronts. The nearly $5 million raised for conservation
     action have been used to plant 3.5 million trees, hire nine new park guards that provide new jobs
     and increase enforcement, build local capacity for monitoring and conflict resolution, fund hydrologic
     modeling and monitoring, and provide environmental education to children. Financial support for
     conservation came from an appreciation of the role that healthy forests play in supplying and regulating
     the availability of clean water. A key to the success of this project may have been a long record of flow
     and sedimentation monitoring data collected during hydropower operations. This data provided a clear
     signal of a degrading ecosystem service before any catastrophic event.

     The European Commission and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) led a Coastal Partners
     project in Port Salut, Haiti. National and community baseline assessments were undertaken in local
     hilly, coastal, and sea environments. The objective was to identify exposed or vulnerable areas and
     select appropriate reforestation interventions to reduce the risk of floods, storms, and soil erosion.
     Through marine and terrestrial field surveys, remote sensing, and GIS modeling, detailed baseline maps
     were developed. Exposure under current and future ecosystem management scenarios was modeled.
     Interviews, multi-stakeholder focus group discussions, and participatory mapping also contributed to the
     baseline assessments.

Step 4: Best practice example and additional resources

Example project
UNEP’s project “Building Capacity for Coastal Ecosystem-based Adaptation in Small Island Developing
States” is being implemented in Grenada and the Seychelles. In Grenada, social and ecological
vulnerability impact assessments (VIAs) were conducted in three local sites (Lauriston Beach, Windward,
and Grand Anse Bay). The VIA process focused on modelling and analyzing the impacts of climate
change in terms of extreme events such as hurricanes and tropical storms. The focus was also on the
impact of sea level rise on coastal communities and coastal/marine habitats, highlighting the problem
of beach erosion in all three areas. Human activities such as building construction on beaches were also
examined. Various coastal adaptation options were proposed based on the identified vulnerabilities.
This included coral reef and mangrove restoration, locally managed marine areas, beach nourishment,
breakwaters and stone revetments, among others.




Coral reefs play an important role in protecting Small Island Developing States (SIDS) against impacts of climate change.

Step 6: Best practice example and additional resources

Example project
As part of the Mozambique Cities and Climate Change Project, the World Bank is creating urban parks
in the city of Beira. The objective is to increase the resilience of the city to floods by improving and
safeguarding the natural drainage capacity of the Chiveve River. The first phase of the project included
the rehabilitation of the riverbed, the construction of an outlet, the dredging of the fishing port, and
the planting of 2,200 mangrove trees with active flood mitigation function. The second phase, which
is being implemented at the time of writing, will focus on the further development of a multi-purpose
green infrastructure solution along the stretch of the Chiveve River in Beira. This solution will include
the creation of a large park along the river, public spaces, cycling paths, and overall green landscape
planning.

     Step 7: Best practice example and additional resources

     Example project
     A good example of a participatory design process is the storm water management system of the city of
     Malmö, Sweden. The city experienced socio-economic decline and floods from overflowing drainage.
     A collaborative solution aimed to retrofit the area with Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) as
     part of a broader regeneration project. The objective was to create a more sustainable neighborhood
     and to benefit biodiversity. An extensive and iterative process of stakeholder engagement was initiated
     during the design and execution of this project. The process involved a series of consultations with local
     residents, representatives from the local school, practitioners, city staff, and many others. The idea
     behind these consultations was to build awareness about the SUDS retrofit, its benefits and costs, and to
     obtain public perspectives on the desired design. This included regular meetings, community workshops,
     and informal gatherings. The approach became increasingly open and consultative, with approximately
     one-fifth of the tenants in the area having participated in dialogue meetings about the project. Amongst
     other topics, safety issues related to open water areas (e.g. retention pools) were discussed with residents
     as well as the potential loss of particular recreational opportunities in the area. In many cases, comments
     and concerns from stakeholders were taken into account and addressed in redesigned SUDS plans.

     New Zealand’s coastal parks have recently focused on restorative techniques focused on the use of
     indigenous sand-binding species, for example in the management of dune ecosystems in Christchurch.
     A collaborative and community-based vision for the area was established and management objectives
     were identified. These included a specific restoration plan for the dune system at the site, together with
     a monitoring plan. Other initiatives included the promotion of education on the area and the dune
     restoration initiative. A monitoring program was developed to measure the success of the key actions and
     provide useful information for future management decisions. The monitoring program has clearly shown
     changes in the dune system in response to the new management activities.
