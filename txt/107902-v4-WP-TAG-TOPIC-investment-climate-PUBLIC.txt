    Introduction

            In developing countries the capacity of the state to regulate and control food safety in a
            risk-based approach will usually need to be strengthened. Reforming the institutions with
            responsibilities for regulating and controlling food safety may be a necessary step.

            The role of governmental institutions that are responsible for controls on food safety
            (sometimes called “competent authorities”) will include making food safety policy and
            regulations, analysing evidence to implement a risk-based approach as well as carrying
            out the checks that the regulations are being implemented. Often the policy and rule
            making is carried out in one government institution (such as a ministry) and the checks
            on implementation of the rules are made by other institutions, such as inspectorates and
            laboratories.

    For the government to have an effective role in food        The FAO guidelines on strengthening national food
    safety requires one or more ministries or regulatory        control systems should be considered when looking at
    agencies to have the following responsibilities:            institutional reforms relating to food.2

    Regulatory agencies are usually linked with either the
    ministry in charge of health or the ministry in charge of
    agriculture, but in many countries both ministries share
    responsibilities in this area.

    Sometimes, ministries in charge of consumer affairs,
    or even economy or trade, participate in regulating
    and control of the food area, mostly dealing with food
    quality issues and prevention of fraud. Since agriculture
    and food production have an impact on the environ-
    ment, the ministry of the environment is often included
    in regulation of certain issues in connection with food
    safety (mostly in disposition of solid and liquid waste,
    but there are cases when this ministry regulates water
    to be processed into drinking water as well).

    Regulatory agencies should divide responsibilities for
    regulating certain areas. Issues that are of the common
    interest for various agencies should be regulated with
    the collaboration of all agencies concerned.
