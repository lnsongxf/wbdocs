I.       Executive Summary

This portfolio review provides an overview of what the World Bank has been doing in
support of school autonomy and accountability (SAA) over the past 11 years. It seeks to
identify overall trends and characteristics of Bank support in this area, with the aim of informing
future project preparation and analytical work. Based on the stock-taking and cataloguing of
SAA projects and analytical work between FY2003 and 2013, the paper presents trends in the
number of operations, areas of interventions, common activities, implementation challenges and
major findings from the analytical work, and provides a synthesis of lessons learned.

The portfolio review is comprehensive, but it does not cover everything. First, the portfolio
review captures the core group of SAA projects and studies to provide overall trends and
characteristics of Bank support for SAA, but it does not provide the complete universe of Bank-
supported SAA activities. Second, since it was impossible to estimate the amount spent on the
SAA supporting activities alone, the paper does not include an analysis of the investment volume
associated with SAA separated from other project activities. Third, the review was intended to
provide a quick snapshot of the Bank support for SAA and general lessons learned highlighting
country experiences and results of analytical work, therefore, an in-depth analysis on successful
and unsuccessful approaches was beyond the scope of the portfolio review.

Selection of Projects and Analytical Work

SAA projects are defined as those that promote SAA by supporting school-based management
reforms at the pre-primary, primary and secondary levels. SAA analytical work is defined as
studies that address SAA as a main subject and can include economic sector work (ESW),
research papers, and impact evaluations. These SAA projects and analytical work were identified
through keyword searches in the Bank’s EdStats database, the intranet portal, and Imagebank. A
desk review of each document was part of the analysis. A review of the selected documents
revealed the following:

        From FY03-13, 168 SAA operations, equivalent to approximately 17 percent of all
         education projects were identified as supporting SAA. South Asia has a relatively strong
         focus on SAA, with the largest proportion of SAA projects relative to its total number of
         education projects (31 percent). MENA has been less active in supporting SAA activities
         compared to other regions.

        While about 15 percent of the 168 projects were considered stand-alone or addressed
         SAA as a main topic, these projects accounted for about 26 percent in SAR, 24 percent in
         LAC, and 21 percent in EAP. In contrast, the majority of SAA projects in ECA, AFR,
         and MENA tend to support SAA activities at the component or sub-component level.

        Forty-eight pieces of analytical work were identified in the area of SAA including 14
         impact evaluations. The majority focused on Central America followed by East Asia and
         Africa. No analytical work on SAA was identified for the MENA region.

Mapping of Bank-supported SAA activities:

       The mapping and categorizing of SAA activities within the SABER-SAA1 framework2
        showed that some policy goals were supported more frequently compared to others. The
        role of the school council in school governance (Policy Goal 3) was most commonly
        supported by SAA projects, while autonomy in personnel management (Policy Goal 2)
        was least addressed. It is also important to note that most projects used a combination of
        SAA support, but they did not always provide a balance in support across autonomy in
        budget and management, assessment, and accountability.

       At the policy action level, increasing the school level’s autonomy over management of
        their operational budget and participation of the school council in school activities were
        two major interventions receiving Bank support. Across all the regions, the most typical
        activity carried out by SAA projects was to support the provision of school grants. School
        grants alone, however, do not constitute support to SAA.

       There were some regional variations in terms of the interventions. The Africa region had
        a high proportion of activities that supported community participation while less
        emphasis was placed on the area of accountability. In contrast, the Latin America and
        Caribbean region (LAC) has a relatively high proportion of activities in the area of
        accountability.

Implementation Challenges and Potential Mitigating Measures

       Some project implementation challenges were identified through the ICR reviews
        including: delays in the transfer of school grants; inactive or low participation of school
        councils; limited local capacity; user-unfriendly instruments; lack of data; poor timing of
        interventions; and lack of social accountability.

       In order to mitigate these challenges, some of the possible measures that a project may
        consider include: a streamlined grant distribution mechanism with clear guidelines and
        policy for the transfer of funds to the school level; providing training to local
        stakeholders and capacity development on school planning and financial management;
        awareness building, improving knowledge of SBM and providing manuals with clear
        roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder; easy-to-use and understand instruments to
        communicate with community; and training in the use of student/school results and what
        they mean.

  SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability (SAA) documents and analyzes school-based management policies
aimed at increasing autonomy and accountability at the school level and within the education system, in both
developing and developed countries. The framework consists of five Policy Goals including (1) Autonomy in the
planning and management of the school budget; (2) autonomy in personnel management; (3) role of the school
council and community in school governance; (4) school and student assessment; and (5) accountability of
stakeholders.

Highlights of findings from Analytical Work

      The Bank-supported SAA interventions have been generally making various positive
       impacts to improve education objectives as revealed by the findings of recent impact
       evaluations (eg. improvement in student performance, access, equity, retention, dropout,
       and student and teacher absenteeism). At the same time, results are highly dependent on
       context and the combination of SAA interventions is not always consistent in producing
       positive outcomes, for example in some contexts the impact on test scores were mixed.

      Enhancing accountability, particularly social accountability, was found to be a challenge
       in SAA as addressed in the majority of analytical works. Empowerment and participation
       of parents and community in school management was emphasized in many studies.

      As SAA reforms involve a wide range of stakeholders, local capacity building was a key
       policy recommendation in many studies, as well as consensus building among
       stakeholders, and the definition of clear roles and responsibilities for different levels.

Lessons Learned

Based on stocktaking of the Bank’s operational experiences and findings from analytical work
on SAA, the paper drew some lessons learned as follows:

      Impact of SAA interventions are highly contextual. It’s important that each country
       context be thoroughly assessed to customize the SAA interventions instead of simply
       applying the best practice from other country contexts.
      When designing an SAA intervention, it is important to pay attention to the political
       economy and the incentives of each stakeholder to perform. Having consensus on the
       clear objective in education and the rules and responsibilities for each stakeholder is
       crucial for successful reform.
      The enabling conditions (SAA policy, resources, and political will) are important for
       autonomy and community participation to work. Do not assume that SBM
       interventions will automatically increase community participation and improve education
       outcomes.
      Building local capacity is critical for implementing SAA activities. SAA
       interventions should entail training for capacity building of each stakeholder.
      Relevant information or data should be available for SAA system to work.
       Knowledge among stakeholders including parents on what SBM is and how it works is
       important to make the system work as is data on school outcomes and what it means.
      Structural changes require behavior changes of all stakeholders, which is a long-
       term proposition.
      SBM should be implemented with special attention to disadvantaged schools and
       communities. Some findings indicated that inequality could expand if the reform is not
       implemented in a way that considers the socio-economic variation among schools.
      Projects design should keep in mind a balance among the interventions supporting
       school autonomy (budget, management, and personnel), community participation,
       assessment and accountability.

II.      Introduction

The role of the school, its autonomy and accountability in delivering education services have
been a subject of policy debate and research for a long time. As education coverage expanded
and the role of education became a critical element for economic success, these issues have
become even more important as key variables to improving the quality of learning.

A main argument for school autonomy3 and accountability4 is that together they can better ensure
education quality. The transfer of core managerial responsibilities to schools is considered to
promote local accountability; help reflect local priorities, values, and needs; and give teachers
the opportunity to establish a personal commitment to students and their parents. The progression
in school autonomy has led to the conceptualization of School-Based Management (SBM) as a
form of decentralization in which the school is in charge of most managerial decisions but with
the participation of parents and the community through school councils5. SBM reforms have
become increasingly popular in many countries over the last few decades.

This area has not been fully explored and there is some empirical evidence but it is still early to
establish a causal relationship between SBM reforms and learning outcomes. Some critics say
that the impact of this type of reform could vary significantly particularly between developed and
developing countries. The effect of school autonomy in decision-making is positive in
developed countries, while it can be negative in developing countries because of different local
capacities (Hanushek, et al., 2013).

In the World Bank, decentralization, school autonomy and community empowerment have been
at the center of the education policy discussions, particularly in line with the support to the post
1989 education reforms in the transition economies. These were reflected in regional and Bank-
wide documents in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Education Sector Strategies from
1995 and 1999 as well as the World Development Report 2004 “Making service work for poor
people” which provided a stronger conceptual framework for the empowerment of communities.
The report highlighted the significance of a direct or short route of accountability that runs
directly from users (e.g. communities) to front-line service providers (e.g. schools) in addition to
an indirect or long route of accountability where users hold service providers accountable
through the state. Thus “school-based management” has been referred to as an effective way to
achieve the short route of accountability in the education sector.

  School autonomy is a form of school management in which schools are given decision-making authority over their
operations, including the hiring and firing of personnel, budget management, and the assessment of teachers and
pedagogical practices.
4
  Accountability is generally defined as the acceptance of responsibility and being answerable for one’s actions. In
school management, accountability may take other additional meanings: (i) the act of compliance with the rules and
regulations of school governance; (ii) reporting to those with oversight authority over the school; and (iii) linking
rewards and sanctions to expected results (Heim 1996; Rechebei 2010).
5
  The term “School Council” is synonymous with several other terms used in different parts of the world, such as
school management committee, parent council, school committee, etc. For consistency, this paper will use the term
school council.

As education management and administration was placed among the core of the development
agenda at the Bank, there have been efforts to accumulate evidence and knowledge in the area of
school-based management6. These include early impact evaluations in the late 1990s and 2000s7,
as well as a review of the education portfolio in the area of school-based management for fiscal
years 2000-06.8

In the 2011 publication, “Making Schools Work: New Evidence on Accountability Reforms,”
theories and evidence on school based management were combined with those for accountability
that deal with use of information to hold stakeholders accountable. As information for
accountability was a missing piece in the past discussions of school-based management, this
book links school autonomy with accountability through effective community participation. This
idea was conceptualized to be a model for ensuring accountability and better performance in the
education system, and has influenced the formation of the “School Autonomy and
Accountability (SAA)9” domain in the “System Approach for Better Education Results
(SABER)10, which is a flagship initiative to support the World Bank Education Sector Strategy
2020.

With these previous studies and project experience in school-based management in the Bank in
mind, this paper intends to provide information on the Bank’s support to SAA activities over the
last 11 years. SAA is a complex area for operations due to its nature that requires various
stakeholders’ involvement in school management. The mapping and analysis of operations and
analytical work on SAA across the education portfolio allow for better planning of SAA-related
projects. It also helps to identify overall trends and provides implications for future Bank
assistance in the area of SAA.

This paper consists of five parts. Following this introduction is Section 2 which briefly explains
the methodology used in this portfolio review. Section 3 presents the major findings from the
portfolio review which covers operations and analytical work including Economic Sector Work
(ESW) and Impact Evaluations (IEs) from Fiscal Years 2003-2013. It is divided into three parts:
(i) the overview of SAA portfolio in FY03-13, (ii) operational work with a focus on project
design, outcome, and implementation challenges; and (iii) analytical work including impact
evaluations, ESWs and research. In Section 3, the paper devotes some effort to reviewing the
Bank’s SAA support through the lens of the SABER-SAA conceptual framework, recently
developed by the Bank under the SABER initiative. Section 4 provides lessons learned based on
the findings and Section 5 offers some concluding thoughts.

This portfolio review covers eleven years spanning fiscal years 2003–2013. It includes the
review of Bank operations and analytical work and was conducted via desk review of project
documents and studies.

Definition of scope. This portfolio review defines SAA supporting activities as follows. For
World Bank projects this means, operations that promote school autonomy and accountability by
supporting school-based management reforms. More specifically, these projects entail: (i)
delegation of the managerial authority for decision-making to the school level (budget, personnel,
etc.); (ii) school council and parent/community participation in school operations and activities11;
(iii) school-level monitoring and use of information to hold stakeholders accountable for their
role in school and student outcomes; (iv) school and student assessment; and (v) oversight
mechanisms. For analytical work, they were defined as those that address school autonomy and
accountability issues including at least one or more areas identified above.

The portfolio review focuses on SAA projects and analytical work at the pre-primary, primary
and secondary levels. Vocational and technical education, tertiary education, and non-formal
education were excluded from the review. The review covers both closed and active projects and
analytical works, which were approved between FY03 and FY13. Projects include IBRD/IDA
lending and trust-funded operations. Analytical work includes: (i) Economic Sector Work (ESW),
(ii) publications and research including impact evaluations, and (iii) Technical Assistance (TA).

                          Figure 1. Selection of SAA Supporting Activities




Selection of SAA supporting activities. The first set of activities was selected based on the
keyword search (“school-based management”) in the World Bank Operations Portal and EdStats.
Additional keyword searches (“school-based management” and “school autonomy and
accountability”) were conducted in Imagebank and the Impact Evaluation Portal to identify
analytical work that focused on these areas. After eliminating the projects and analytical work

11
  The CDD type of projects that support community subprojects and may possibly include activities to support
schools are not included in this review unless they specifically state that they support school activities.

outside the scope of this portfolio review, a more detailed review of project documents and
studies was conducted to refine the selection and to collect data of the SAA projects and
analytical work. For projects, the information was mostly drawn from the Project Appraisal
Documents (PADs), Program Documents (PDs), and Implementation Completion and Results
Reports (ICRs).

Data compilation and analysis. The project document review was conducted for the identified
projects to carry out a comprehensive stock-taking and cataloguing of SAA projects (basic
project data, PDOs, components/sub-components, etc.). Data was organized by region and the
types of SAA-related activities and analyzed to find out the trends of the Bank support for SAA.
The SABER-SAA policy framework was utilized as an analytical tool for SAA interventions to
identify the main areas of support. In addition, information was compiled for the SAA analytical
work (e.g. basic data, findings and policy recommendations) to identify the trend, major findings,
and key messages.

Limitation of analysis. The analysis is limited by the portfolio selection, methodology, and data.
First, this portfolio review does not provide the complete list of the Bank’s SAA supported
activities. The keyword search of these databases does not capture all the projects and studies
with an SAA element, since the project documents and articles do not always include the exact
key terms used in the search. Second, it does not include an analysis of the investment volume
of SAA activities. Many of the identified projects have SAA-related elements under one or
multiple sub-components, and often their investment amounts are not specified or disaggregated
in the project documents. Likewise, the project documents do not provide all the details about
project implementation, which limit the detailed analysis of project interventions. Therefore, this
review should be seen as only a selective assessment of the Bank support in the area of SAA. It
rather captures the core group of SAA projects and studies to provide overall trends and
characteristics of Bank support for SAA.


IV.        Findings

A. SAA Portfolio Overview
1.      Overview of SAA Projects

In FY03-13, a total of 168 lending projects were identified in support of SAA, equivalent to
approximately 17 percent of all education projects (Table 1). Africa (AFR) has the largest
number of SAA projects at 46, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and South
Asia (SAR) both at 34. However, the proportion of SAA projects out of all the education projects
in AFR remains below the average at 13 percent, as well as East Asia and Pacific (EAP), while
SAR has the largest proportion of SAA projects relative to its total number of education projects
(31 percent). Nearly a third of the education projects in SAR have SAA supporting activities,
significantly higher than other regions. The SAA projects approved in FY03-13 cover 80
countries worldwide, a little more than half of the developing countries.12

The SAA projects account for about twenty percent of each IBRD and IDA education projects,
and eight percent of Recipient Executed Trust Fund (RETF) projects, the majority of which are
Global Partnership for Education (GPE) projects (Table 2). About 63 percent of the lending
projects are Specific Investment Loans, followed by Adaptable Program Loans (16 percent),
Development Policy Loans (11 percent) and Emergency Recovery Loans (6 percent), Sector
Adjustment Loans (3 percent).

The following describes regional trends in SAA lending projects.

AFR is increasing its share in the number of SAA projects. AFR is the only region which
showed an increase, albeit small, from the period covering the first six years (2003-2008) to the
period covering the second five years (2009-2013) in the proportion of SAA projects in all
education projects (from 12 to 15 percent). AFR also maintained the number of approved
projects (23) supporting SAA in the latter half of the period, while all other regions showed a
decline. As a result, AFR’s relative share of the number of SAA projects increased from 23
percent in the first half of the period to 33 percent in the latter half of the period (Figure 2).

                       Figure 2. Trends in Support to SAA Over Time




SAR, LAC, and EAP have high proportion of the projects with a strong focus on SAA.
While approximately 15 percent of all identified SAA projects are overall considered stand-alone
or address SAA as a main topic, these projects accounted for about 26 percent in SAR, 24
percent in LAC, and 21 percent in EAP. In contrast, the majority of SAA projects in ECA, AFR
and MNA tend to support SAA activities at the component or sub-component levels rather than
as dedicated SAA projects. ECA has many projects at the component level, but only two projects
were identified as stand-alone, equivalent to 10 percent of the SAA projects in the region. AFR
also has only two stand-alone projects, accounting for 4 percent of its SAA projects, with a
majority addressing it at sub-component level. MNA also has most of its SAA projects at sub-
component level, and no stand-alone project was identified between FY03 and FY13.


2.   Overview of SAA Analytical Work

In FY03-13, there were 48 SAA related pieces of analytical work including 36 country
specific, 6 regional, and 6 global studies (Table 3). These included Economic Sector Work
(Public Expenditure Review, Education Sector Review, Social Analysis, etc.), Research
(Working Paper, Policy Note,) and Publications. Impact evaluations were conducted under these
product lines. LAC carried out the most non-lending SAA activities, followed by EAP and AFR.
Most of the analytical work in LAC was carried out before 2008, while the majority of EAP
analytical work was conducted after 2010. No analytical work on SAA was identified in MNA.
There are 14 impact evaluations delivered in FY03-13, of which six are from Central America.
No impact evaluations examining SAA were found in ECA and MNA.

3.    Regional Overview of SAA-Supported Activities

Descriptions for SAA projects as well as analytical works in each region are as follows:

Africa: A total of 46 operations were identified as SAA projects, of which nine were trust
funded projects. These projects cover 27 countries, or 57 percent of all countries in the region.
They are spread across the region although relatively few are from southern Africa. Nine
analytical works were mostly from East Africa. Of all countries, Nigeria has the largest number
of operations (4) with a relatively strong focus on SAA. The Bank has been supporting its SBM
reform throughout the period of FY03-13, and the most recently approved project (the State
Education Program Investment Project13) was designed based on the evidence and diagnostics of
several SABER domain analyses one of which was SABER-SAA. Ethiopia and Uganda are other
major countries where the Bank provided support for SAA, through both operations and
analytical work.

East Asia and Pacific: Between FY03-13, the Bank carried out 19 operations in 8 countries in
support of SAA. Although the number of SAA operations and the countries covered are
relatively small, the region has the largest-scale stand-alone SAA project. This project, the
Bantuan Operasional Sekolah (BOS - School Operational Assistance) Knowledge Improvement
for Transparency and Accountability Project, P107661,14 was implemented with an investment
of US$6.4 billion of which US$1.1 billion was IBRD financed (see Annex 3 case study). In
addition to operations, about half of nine analytical works in the region also focused on the SBM
reforms in Indonesia, including one impact evaluation. The Bank also provided major support to
the Philippines through two operations and two impact evaluations.

   The State Education Program Investment Project (P122124) was approved on March 26, 2013 and became
effective on August 27, 2013.

   This project was approved on October 7, 2008 and became effective on November 11, 2008.

                                                                      14
                                 Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013



Europe and Central Asia: During FY03-13, twenty-one operations in the region supported
SAA-related activities in 13 countries, about 60 percent of the developing countries in the region.
Bulgaria has taken forward its SBM reform by decentralizing budget allocation and devolving
autonomy to the school level based on a phased approach with three DPLs - Social Sectors
Institutional Reform Development Policy Loan15 (see Annex 3 case study). An ESW was also
conducted to assess this reform in Bulgaria. Albania is another country in which the Bank
provided operational support for SAA activities as well as analytical support on social
accountability. Many of the SAA projects in the region have a relatively strong focus on SAA
with more than half of them addressing SAA at the component level. However, no impact
evaluation on SAA conducted by the Bank was found during the period.

Latin America and the Caribbean: The Central American countries were pioneers in the area
of SAA, and so many of the analytical works identified focused on SAA (10 out of 12). At the
same time, Bank operations supported SAA region-wide during FY03-13 (five countries in
Central America, six in South America, and five in the Caribbean). With operations and
analytical work together, Mexico has the largest number of projects with five operations and four
analytical works. These included two stand-alone SAA operations16 that supported the
government’s Quality Schools Program (PEC) totaling approximately US$700million (IBRD
US$460million) and two impact evaluations. The Bank has also provided extensive support to
Brazil, which has the largest number of SAA operations (7) under various product lines (SILs,
DPLs and APLs) and sector boards (Education, Agriculture and Rural Development, Health,
Nutrition and Population).

Middle East and North Africa: Overall, MNA’s SAA Portfolio in FY03-13 indicates that the
region has been relatively less active in supporting SAA compared to other regions. While there
are 14 projects in support of SAA in MNA, slightly over the average across the regions, the vast
majority of them support SAA activities at the sub-component level and there was no stand-alone
SAA project. MNA was also the only region with no analytical work on SAA identified during
FY03-13. Nevertheless, the Bank provided support to promote SAA in about 60 percent of the
developing countries in the region. Jordan, for instance, has been taking a school- and
community-based approach to the delivery of education through the Education Reform for
Knowledge Economy Program I and II17 since 2003. Similar effort has also been made in Yemen
and Morocco through three operations in each country.

South Asia: Throughout the period of FY03-13, South Asia has been implementing SAA
projects in all eight countries. 12 out of 34 projects are from Pakistan, including a series of
operational support for the state of Punjab and Sindh. These two states have large-scale
investments in support of SAA, including the recently approved Second Punjab Education Sector
Project (US$4.4billion, of which US$350million from IDA) and Second Sindh Education Sector

Project (US$2.7billion, of which US$400million from IDA)18. Also, the Bank has been
providing consistent support to Nepal, which has been pushing forward SBM reforms since the
early 2000s. It supported three major SAA operations19 which address SAA as a main theme, and
one ESW. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka are also supported through both operations
and analytical works.


B. SAA Operations

This section focuses on SAA project design and the type of SAA interventions the Bank has been
supporting through operations. It first looks at the project design using the SABER-SAA
framework to identify trends in the types of interventions. Then it examines what activities have
been implemented under these areas of intervention and provides some analysis on the regional
trends.

1.   Project Design

SAA Interventions and SABER-SAA policy goals

The SABER-SAA policy framework identifies key policy goals that are important for
establishing an enabling environment for the successful implementation of SAA interventions.
Mapping the Bank’s SAA project interventions within the SABER-SAA policy framework helps
to gauge the distribution of Bank support across these key policy areas and identify its overall
trend and or gaps.

The SABER-SAA policy framework consists of five Policy Goals: (1) Autonomy in the Planning
and Management of the School Budget; (2) Autonomy in Personnel Management; (3) Role of the
School Council and Community in School Governance, (4) School and Student Assessment, and
(5) Accountability to Stakeholders. Each of these policy goals can be composed into a set of
policy actions that provide further detail and understanding of the policy goals (Table 4).

Based on a rough equivalency between the intervention areas of project activities and the
SABER-SAA policy framework, project activities were mapped to the policy actions. This
mapping exercise was done based on the types of SAA activities being supported by the projects,
and thus one project often has multiple SAA activities which are mapped to their corresponding
policy goals.

Note that we are limited in this mapping exercise to information provided in the project
documents. In other words, the absence of interventions corresponding to policy goals does not
necessarily mean that the country’s education system is not supporting those SAA areas. It may
just be outside the project scope. Also, having interventions corresponding to several policy
goals does not necessarily mean that they are interconnected and support each other well. Except
for stand-alone projects, project documents do not allow us to investigate the linkage due to lack

of detailed descriptions. While there is a limitation to capture the level of autonomy,
participation and accountability in each operation based on the project documents, this analysis
provides some hint to identify overall trends in the design of Bank supported-SAA projects.

Policy Goal 3, Role of school council in school governance was the most common area of
intervention in projects supporting SAA. As shown in Figure 3, over 250 activities were
identified which were mapped to any of the six policy actions under Policy Goal 3. In contrast,
there were very few projects that supported activities which entailed devolving autonomy in
personnel management to the school level (Policy Goal 2).



                                                                   17

Policy Action (1A), increasing autonomy over management of the operational budget and
(3D) participation of the school councils in school activities were two major interventions
receiving Bank support. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the project activities mapped to the
policy actions. There are 118 activities that were mapped to budget autonomy (1A: such as
provision of school grants) and 120 activities mapped to participation of the school councils in
school activities (3D: such as development of school improvement plan). While many projects
supported increasing school autonomy in managing non-salary operational budget (1A), very few
supported devolving authority to schools over the management of salary (1B and1C); this
resulted in the relatively less number of activities mapped under Policy Goal 1.

In the area of school and student assessment (PG4), relatively fewer projects articulated the
use of the school and student assessment to make adjustments at school level. The activities
that supported the use of school or student assessment data for pedagogical, operational, and
personnel adjustments in school management (4B and 4D) accounted for less than half of the
activities that supported the existence and frequency of school or student assessments (4A and
4C). In many cases, project documents indicated that the assessment results are to be used for
evidence-based policy making at the central level, but did not mention adjustment at the school
level.

          Figure 6. SAA interventions and SABER-SAA policy sub-areas by Region




While many projects have common interventions across the regions, there are some
regional varieties in focus areas. Figure 5 and 6 shows the regional comparison of the SAA
interventions by SABER-SAA policy goals and policy actions. All regions supported
considerable number of activities to increase autonomy over management of the operational
budget (1A) and participation of the school councils in school activities (3D) except for ECA
which shows relatively lower number of activities under 3D.

AFR has very high proportion of activities in the area of the role of school council in school
governance (Policy Goal 3). More than 80 percent of SAA projects in the region support the
activities to promote setting up of school council and capacity building. On the other hand,
relatively less emphasis was on accountability in finance, school operations and learning (Policy
Goal 5). This reflects the trend in AFR that the activities supporting community participation
were often limited in the area of construction or rehabilitation of school facilities, instead of fully
engaging themselves in planning activities to improve teaching and learning, for which parents
and community members hold schools accountable to them.

LAC has the most activities in the area of accountability (Policy Goal 5) among the regions.
Overall, many projects seem to address quality and accountability issues, reflected in a high
proportion of activities under Policy Goal 4 and 5. LAC was notable for its emphasis on the use
of student assessment to improve teaching (4D). This may be due to the fact that LAC region,
particularly Central America, has a longer history of implementing SBM since late 1990s, and is

                                                  20
                                   Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


now focusing more on achieving SBM’s longer-term goals: improving learning outcomes. In
fact, Central American countries have been reviewing their SBM models in recent years, and
seem to put more emphasis on improving governance system and accountability. For example,
Education Quality Improvement Project20 in El Salvador supports the revision of the
conventional SBM model, given that EDUCO has contributed to the expansion of access of basic
education, but could not properly address the problems of quality, high repetition and drop-out.
Honduras is also implementing consolidation and institutionalization of the school management
system for traditional schools, PROHECO, PROHECO-IBE and Educational Networks.21

ECA has relatively strong focus on assessment (Policy Goal 4). In particular, many addressed
strengthening student assessment system and improving the capacities of the education system to
collect, analyze and disseminate information related to the system’s inputs, processes, outputs
and other performance, including students’ achievement. However, the policies on sharing and
use of information to hold schools accountable and make improvements (4B, 4D, 5A) are weak.
As mentioned, relatively less emphasis was on role of school councils in school governance
(PG3) compared to other regions.


2. SAA Project Activities

While the previous section analyzed SAA project interventions based on the policy goals of the
SABER-SAA framework, this section takes a closer look at the project activities to identify what
kind of activities have been carried out under these policy goals. SAA involves a wide variety of
activities. Table 5 shows the major Bank-supported SAA activities mapped under each SABER-
SAA Policy Goal.

  While education systems in Central America had a high level of school autonomy including autonomy in
personnel management at the school level, the revision of the SBM model in the mid-2000s scaled it down to some
extent. This partly explains the limited number of project activities supporting the Policy Goal 2 in the region.

Autonomy in the Planning and Management of School Budget. In all regions, the most
typical activity carried out by the Bank projects under this Policy Goal was to support the
provision of school grants, one of the most common schemes to increase budgetary autonomy.
This is reflected in the significantly higher number of activities mapped to 1A (legal authority
over operational budget) across the regions. Under this scheme, central government or local
government transfers the fund directly to schools, and schools manage the fund based on their
needs. In some cases, funds are provided to communities to manage and implement school
improvement projects. School grant schemes varied among the projects based on its purpose,
scope and funding method. Some used the grant as a tool to mainly expand access to education
by substituting school fees, constructing school buildings, and providing bursaries for poor
students. Others focused on improving quality of education by purchasing teaching and learning
materials, conducting quality-improving activities, and in a few cases, teacher salaries. The
amount of the grant is often determined based on the factors such as school size, number of
students, geographic location, school improvement plan or subprojects. In most cases, the Bank
provided budgetary support for the school grants and technical assistance for establishing grant
guidelines.

Other activities supporting this goal included the introduction and expansion of formula based,
per-capita financing system, which was most commonly found in ECA. In order to improve the
capacity to manage these grants, many projects also supported training for school personnel in
financial management and budget planning.

Autonomy in Personnel Management. As mentioned earlier, very few activities were found
across the regions to directly support this Policy Goal: only 10 activities supporting 2A (Legal
authority over teacher appointment/deployment) and 1 supporting 2C (Legal authority over
school principal appointment/deployment). All activities for 2A, four from Nepal, three from
Central America, one from Mozambique, Yemen, and Pakistan, supported community schools
where communities or parents have authority over teacher appointment and deployment decision.
For example, in Nepal, the Bank and other donors provided support to the EFA program based
on a sector-wide approach, which supported a community school scheme including salary grants
for schools to recruit community teachers. The Bank also supported the processes, procedures,
criteria and norms for teaching staff managed by school councils in Honduras. Balochistan
Education Support Project in Pakistan established community schools and supported Parent
Education Committees (PECs), which arrange for and employ local qualified teachers and
manage funds for teacher salary and other recurrent costs of the schools. Similarly, ECD teachers
were recruited at the community level in Mozambique’s Education Sector Support Project. In
Yemen Second Basic Education Development Project, the selection, testing and the contracting
of female teachers was done jointly by the school principal, MOE staff, and representatives of
the Fathers' and Mothers' Councils. One activity mapped to 2C is Brazil’s DPL (Development
Policies for the State of Sergipe Project), which supported establishing a new management
system for the state-run schools that defines a merit-based and participatory/democratic selection
process for school directors.

Role of School Council in School Governance. As previously mentioned, most SAA activities
were mapped to this goal among all Policy Goals. This goal included a wide range of activities
and the levels and approaches of community participation mostly through a school council or
equivalent organization and varied considerably among the projects. Some of the most common
activities include the following: First, many projects supported the activities to establish or
strengthen School Councils, as well as Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs), and parental
organizations. School councils are considered to be effective tools to promote community
participation in school management because they are the representatives of parents and students
as clients for schools. It usually consists of representatives from parents or the community
leaders, and the school principals. Their roles and responsibilities varied in each case, ranging
from budgeting, preparing of school improvement plans, oversight of school activities, to hiring
and firing teachers, to curriculum design. In many cases, support included the training to enhance
capacity of the members to be able to take these roles.

Second, another common activity in this area was to support School Improvement Plans (SIPs).
SIPs are the action plans developed at the school level. Through the SIP, the school defines its
own values, mission and goals, diagnose their problems and outlines strategies to address those
problems and set the educational targets and responsibilities. The plans are often developed with
the participation of the community, and this process calls for parents to play a more direct role in
school management decisions affecting their children. It is the most common tool to encourage
parents and community members to participate in school management.

Third, the activities directly supporting the communities included grant support for community
sub-projects for increasing access and quality of education, or school construction and

                                                 23
                              Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


maintenance by communities. The latter approach is often seen as a first step in involving school
councils in school management and oversight. Parent involvement in construction or
maintenance of the school building was a common feature in SAA activities supported under the
Africa region. Also, training or media campaigns to sensitize communities to promote their
participation were often included in project activities. In some cases Bank projects supported
community-based service delivery model, in which the schools are managed by communities or
NGOs. This was often the case for pre-primary and early childhood education projects identified
as supporting SAA in various regions.

School and Student Assessment. As indicated by the considerable number of activities mapped
to 4C, the most common activity carried out under this goal was to establish and strengthen
standardized student assessments. The Bank funded technical assistance for the design of the
assessments, the implementation of the assessments, and in some cases, training for school
personnel or other stakeholders to enhance capacity to utilize the assessment results (4D) but less
emphasis was placed here. Regarding school assessment, Bank projects often provided support
for introducing reporting or evaluation tools such as school report cards, and school self-
evaluations (4A). Many projects also supported school inspections to monitor school
performance, through training of inspectors, or financing school visits. Again, less support was
provided for use of results for making school adjustments (4B) in pedagogy, operations, or
personnel. The Bank also supported the dissemination of student learning outcomes and school
performance through publications.

Accountability to Stakeholders. Some projects supported the development or measurement of
a minimum school quality or operational standard, in order to ensure that schools are able to
provide satisfactory conditions for student learning. Other activities under this goal included the
training for Ministry personnel and other stakeholders to enhance capacity to monitor and
analyze the outcome of the assessment. The Bank also supported workshops, and meetings to
disseminate student learning outcomes and school performance. Many Bank projects also
supported the establishment and strengthening of Education Management Information System
(EMIS). It is often focusing on collecting the school-level data for the sake of evidence-based
policy making at the central level, but not well aligned with SBM reform to improve
accountability at the school level. SIPs, while it is mainly mapped to Policy Goal 3, can be also
mapped under this goal (5D), when used as a monitoring/evaluation tool for holding schools
accountable to parents and community members for their performance and school operations.

Regional Trends in SAA Activities: School Grants, School Councils, and School Improvement
Plans

As shown above, the Bank’s SAA-supported interventions entailed a wide variety of activities.
In order to identify any trend in SAA activities, three key activities were selected for regional
comparison: supporting school grant schemes, establishing/strengthening school councils, and
development of school improvement plans and use as a monitoring tool.

Throughout the regions, school grants were most supported among the three activities. As
shown in Table 6, Bank projects most often include grant schemes (75 percent), followed by
establishment, capacity building and participation of school councils (61 percent). About half (52

                                                 24
                                Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


percent) of the selected SAA projects include interventions to support school improvement plans.
In many cases, these interventions were implemented as a package: set up and training of school
council, school council develops the school improvement plans, school grant is provided to
implement the school improvement plans, and the school council manages or supervises the use
of the grant. This combines several key elements of SAA if done in an integrated and supportive
way with clear goals that can be measured and monitored to improve learning and provide
information back to the school in order to make adjustments as they go. It is difficult to know
from the desk reviews if the project interventions supported by the Bank were designed to do this.

Breaking down these key interventions by region reveals some variation among the regions.
For example, approximately 74 percent of SAA projects in AFR support provision of school
grants, while only about 40 percent support school improvement plans. In fact, many of the
school grants are not provided against the school improvement plans, but provided for: (i)
specific purposes such as construction or rehabilitation of facilities, textbook purchases, bursary
for poor students, setting up of SMC, etc.; (ii) the eligible items based on the Grant Agreement
with Ministry; and (iii) community-driven sub-projects based on their applications. Overall,
considerable number of the SAA projects in the region support school grant programs with the
aim of expanding access to education, particularly for the poor and the marginalized population,
by reducing financial burden for these populations. Sometimes, if the intention of school grant is
to reduce financial burdens for household and promote access to education, there might be less
emphasis on SIP, which takes time and efforts to develop. In these cases, school grants alone are
not good examples of SAA interventions.

In contrast, LAC has relatively less proportion of the projects that supported school grants (68
percent) compared to other regions, but has a relatively high proportion of projects supporting
school improvement plans (62 percent). One reason for the relatively low level of support for
school grants could be that school grant programs have already been in place and
institutionalized in these countries, and thus not included in Bank support. The relatively high
proportion of SIPs could be because the activities in the region now tend to focus on quality and
accountability aspects since SIPs are often considered effective tools to increase autonomy and
accountability. LAC mainstreamed school grant program but capacity building of school-level
stakeholders in the development of SIP still take time and need effort to support.

                              Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


South Asia has a highest proportion of the projects with school grants and support to school
councils, with more than 80 percent supporting these interventions. However, the proportion
dropped significantly as to supporting SIPs, with only about 60 percent. This may be because
this region has a relatively high portion of SAA projects using DPL instruments as well as some
SWAP programs, which tend to focus on the macro level policies, and the detailed activities such
as SIPs are not articulated in the project documents. As in AFR, in many cases, school grants
have been used in this region as an effective tool to increase access to education.
ECA shows the lowest proportion of projects that supported School Councils (48 percent) among
all regions. This could be due to the fact that, as in many former Soviet Union countries,
decision-making power was quickly decentralized to school principals but not much attention
has been paid to involvement of the wider community in school governance or participation and
it is not common to find school councils or parents involved in management.


3. Outcomes of SAA project activities

As explained above, SAA activities have been implemented across the regions with different
emphases and policy goals as reflected on their project design. This section looks into the
outcomes of these activities to examine the effectiveness of these SAA activities.

With only 15 percent of projects in the portfolio having a main emphasis or PDO directly
focused on school autonomy and accountability, we can make the inference that SAA usually is
not the main goal per se, but it is a means to assist in achieving higher educational goals such as
expanding access, improving quality, increasing equity, and improving efficiency in education
sector management, and ultimately to achieve better learning outcomes. The majority of the
SAA projects addressed multiple or in a few projects all of these objectives as articulated in
PDOs. SAA activities were usually dispersed under different components linking to these
objectives.

Although there have been numerous studies of SBM reforms that have improved learning and
other education indicators, assessing the outcomes of the SAA activities in Bank projects is not
straightforward. Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) of SAA-oriented
projects generally do not provide sufficient assessments of the SAA-related interventions, since
they tend to focus on the overall outcomes at the PDO level. Rarely does a project have a PDO
that is only about SAA. The ICR reflections may provide outputs of the SAA activities, and
others provide outcomes but mostly limited to anecdotal evidence. In addition, SBM reforms
usually need about five years before any fundamental changes occur at the school level and only
after eight years of operation can changes be seen in such indicators as student test scores.22
Therefore, this portfolio review mostly utilizes the information from Impact Evaluations
delivered during the study period, in addition to the project ICRs.

The Bank-supported SAA interventions have been generally making various positive
impacts to improve education outcomes. They are often combined and implemented in many
different ways based on country context. See Annex 2 for a mapping of the different
combination of interventions and their outcomes.

Budget autonomy through budget planning and management of school grants seem to have
been effective in expanding access and increasing equity. While we know that school grants
alone do not constitute SAA, the school grant programs that were designed to expand access by
reducing school fees showed positive impact in a relatively short time during the project period.
In addition, the evidence shows that it is also useful tool to increase equity. The Ghana Education
Sector Project (P050620), for instance, was successful in increasing enrollment rates and gender
parity through a capitation grant program. The grants were used to support SIPs for enrollment
drives and support needy pupils among others activities. EMIS data shows that districts which
received grants saw a proportionally higher increase in gross enrollment rates when compared to
the ones without the scheme. The Nepal Community School Support Project (P082646) also
made significant improvement in access to education for out-of-school children. Indonesia BOS
program also increased enrollment rates significantly, particularly for the poorest quintile (see
case study in Annex 3). The Brazil Pernambuco Integrated Development Education Quality
Improvement Project (P069934) was successful in achieving its inclusion objectives by
protecting the resources allocated for activities and schools targeted to indigenous and disabled
students.

SAA interventions show mixed results particularly for improving quality. The empirical
evidence of SBM reforms from Central America showed that they have been successful in
increasing enrollment but do not necessarily lead to improving the quality of learning.23 As the
literature states, this may be because SBM models developed in Central America had a strong
focus on financial and administrative aspects and less so on the pedagogical provision to improve
school quality.24 The findings from this portfolio review also shows mixed results particularly for
the quality objective, although his may be also due to the fact that learning outcome is a long-
term proposition and not achievable in many cases within the project period. Nevertheless, the
variety of interventions combined and implemented under the quality objective indicates the
complexity and challenges of achieving this objective.

The same combination of SAA interventions does not always lead to the same outcome. For
example, increased student performance was reported in the ICR for Yemen Basic Education
Development Program (P076185) and in the impact evaluation of Cambodia Education Quality
Improvement Project (EQIP) (P059971) as a result of implementing school grants, establishing
school councils and developing SIPs. However, the ICR for Paraguay Education Reform Project
(P073526) that had implemented the same combination of activities found no systematic and
documented evidence, beyond some anecdotal ones, to prove that participating schools improve
their quality and efficiency-related performance. The impact evaluation on Mexico Quality
School Program (PEC)25 which implemented school grants and SIPs had a statistically
significant impact on dropout and repetition rates, but found no measurable impact on outcomes

in indigenous schools, while there were positive impacts in other cases such as the decreased
dropouts in indigenous schools in Brazil Pernambuco Integrated Development Education Quality
Improvement Project (P069934). This implies that the context matters in implementing SAA
interventions and those context appropriate interventions should be selected carefully to
reinforce each other in achieving balance among autonomy, assessment, and accountability.
Otherwise the activities are just a list of tasks without any real connection to supporting SAA and
ultimately improved learning outcomes.

The Bank-supported SAA interventions have also contributed to making a difference at the
intermediate outcome level. While achieving higher quality outcomes may be a challenge and
take time, anecdotal evidence shows that there have been many positive intermediate outcomes
at the school level based on these SAA activities. They included:

          Improved school and learning environment. Interventions such as school grants, SIPs,
           and school inspection, have had immediate impacts on the school and learning
           environment, evidenced by: the increases in teaching and learning resources in
           classrooms, school facility improvements. Some also reported the change in teaching
           methods with increased autonomy at school level. For example, the report on the BOS
           program in Indonesia stated, “[t]eachers mentioned a variety of changes they made in
           their teaching methods including shifting from lecturing to engaging students in their own
           active learning, using groupings of students, better relating content with the practical
           experience of students, and bringing more variety into their teaching.” Some of these
           changes, it says, related to an increase in motivation.”

          Increased satisfaction among school community members. A better learning
           environment resulting from SAA activities increased satisfaction of students, teachers
           and the broader school community. In one project in Moldova, for instance, where the
           principals were given high level of autonomy in school management, assessment of
           school directors' job satisfaction and sense of empowerment showed noticeable
           differences in between the pilot and non-pilot rayons26.

          Stronger linkages among community, school and district office. Interventions to
           strengthen participation increased community involvement in school planning, which led
           to their increased sense of ownership and interest in the overall management of a school.
           The SAA activities increased interactions between schools and parents and strengthened
           communication among parents. The Nepal Community School Support Project is a good
           example to show the importance of the increased sense of the ownership of school
           management by communities. In its ICRs, the social audit, which was conducted by a
           committee comprised of the chairperson of the PTA and two other parents, was seen as a
           robust mechanism for providing feedback to the School Management Committee
           (SMC)27 by the community. The SMC used this feedback for improving school
           management. It was also reported that the direct support to schools through grant and
           inspection also created stronger linkages between district offices and communities.

4. Implementation Challenges and Risk Mitigating Measures

The mixed results of SAA interventions aimed at improving learning outcomes suggest that there
are many variables affecting them. There are two main reasons that could hinder the
effectiveness of SAA interventions in reaching their outcomes: (a) activities were not well
interconnected (balance among autonomy, assessment and accountability) and thus did not
improve performance as a system; (b) activities were not implemented as expected. The former
point is very critical in SAA interventions. Unless SAA activities (autonomy, participation,
assessment, and accountability) are balanced and aligned with each other, they are just a
collection of isolated interventions. For example, budgetary autonomy should be executed based
on a solid school improvement plans with parent/community participation, and thus should be
balanced with regulations and mechanism that hold schools accountable for financial and school
operation matters to higher authorities as well as parents and community members. This requires
rigorous assessment of each case, and is beyond the scope of this portfolio review. Therefore,
this section focuses on the latter point, which shows the failure to implement activities as
expected, and shed light on some major implementation challenges and possible mitigation
measures based on the Bank operational experience. Table 7 presents the summary of the
implementation challenges and mitigating measures:

C. SAA Analytical Work


The previous section examined the Bank’s operational support to SAA based on the project
design, activities, outcome, and challenges. The paper now turns to the analytical work that the
Bank supported in FY03-13. The Bank contributed to expanding the knowledge base on SAA
through Impact Evaluations as well as other Economic Sector Work (ESW) and research. This
section outlines the Bank’s analytical support in the area of SAA and presents the findings.

1.    Impact Evaluations

For FY03-13, a total of fourteen studies were identified as impact evaluations on SAA conducted
with the support of the Bank. They were published in different formats such as ESWs, working
papers, and journal articles. These studies assessed the impact of the following
programs/projects on educational outcomes:

A majority of IEs came from Central America, which were mostly conducted in the mid-2000s
for the programs that had started during the 1990s. The IEs from other regions including East
Asia and Pacific, South Asia, and Africa were carried out more recently for the programs
implemented in the mid-/late 2000s. No impact evaluations were identified in MNA and ECA.
The major findings from the IEs include the following:

Overall, the majority of IEs found some positive impacts of the SBM interventions. They
showed that the SBM interventions such as school grants, school improvement plans, community
participation could positively impact educational outcomes.

Student Performance. The IEs from both the Philippines and Kenya, for example, found that
SBM was associated with better student performance as measured by student test scores. The
same result was derived in the Sri Lanka IE, which found that the schools that had implemented
SBM showed higher cognitive achievement levels of their primary school students possibly due
to better teacher and parental involvement with children both at school and at home.

Internal efficiency. The IEs from Mexico showed the correlations between SBM interventions
and the decrease of dropout, failure and repetition rates, and the El Salvador IE also indicated
their correlations with the decrease of repetition.

Access and equity. Furthermore, devolving management responsibility to communities was
found to have a significant impact on certain schooling outcomes related to access and equity in
the Nepal IE. This included a significantly reduced number of out-of-school children,
disadvantaged castes performed better in reducing attrition rate from grade 1 to 2, and the
treatment group got a higher average on TIMSS science. The Gambia IE found that the SBM
interventions led to positive behavior change that reduced student and teacher absenteeism. The
cases from Central America also showed an expansion of access, as well as other positive
outcomes including overall better management indicated in the Nicaragua IE.

However, results were not always consistent and can be mixed particularly for student
performance (test scores). As mentioned above, several studies found the SBM interventions
effective in improving student performance. At the same time, some other studies or aspects of
the same studies found limited effects of an SAA intervention on student outcomes. Sri Lanka’s
IE found that the Program on School Improvement improved the cognitive abilities of primary
school children, but the School Report Card program showed no impact on student performance.
In the Nicaragua IE, the differences in financial incentives to teachers, resources, and
professional development between autonomous schools and centralized schools showed no clear
link to student outcomes. There is a positive and significant autonomy effect on 3rd grade math
scores of almost 4 points, but not for 6th grade math scores which were lower. Onsite
professional development by the school director appears to be one important variable, as does the
availability of curriculum resources, but the study could not draw a neat line between the process
of decentralization, teacher change, and student achievement. The Gambia’s IE, while reducing
absenteeism found no effect of the SBM intervention on the results of a comprehensive test in
mathematics and English. The results from Indonesia showed that the SBM interventions led to

                                                32
                                   Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


improving test scores only under certain conditions (explained further below). The IE from
Nepal showed no effect on learning outcome.

It should be noted that these mixed results may not necessarily mean that SAA interventions aree
not working. For example, one possible reason for no impact on learning outcomes could be due
to the timing of IEs. Evidence shows that it takes at least five years to produce some impacts on
learning outcomes (Borman et al, 2003), and the IEs were conducted too soon to see the full
results of the intervention. In addition, many IEs were conducted retrospectively, which made
the evaluations extremely difficult. There are more and more projects incorporating IEs into
their design these days, but many of the existing IEs had to rely on retrospective analysis. Also,
there was a case, such as Sri Lanka’s School Report Card program, which showed no impact on
student performance most likely because the government officials gave relatively less emphasis
to the program.

Some cases also showed mixed results for the impact on equity. The past research has shown
that decentralization could increase inequality. The results from these IEs were mixed on this
aspect. For example, the IE from Mexico did suggest that the SBM interventions could increase
inequality, showing their positive impact on non-indigenous schools but not on indigenous
schools. Similarly, the IE from the Philippines found that inequality in resources across districts
seemed to have increased over the years during the SBM interventions. On the other hand, the
results from Nepal’s IE showed the improvement in equity, with more reduction in proportion of
out-of-school children from disadvantaged groups than regular groups. 28

Such mixed results led to different policy implications in some cases. While Mexico’s IE
suggested that local management can produce small improvements in school outcomes, perhaps
not in the most troubled school systems. The IE from Madagascar indicated that the changes
resulting from SBM interventions would probably be most relevant in dysfunctional schools.

Some factors were found important to produce positive outcomes. The mixed results of IEs
on learning outcome could be partly due to the fact that it takes a long time for SBM
interventions to take effect on school quality (greater than five years). Nevertheless, these results
also indicate that the context or other variables critically matter in order to produce desired
outcomes. Some IEs assessed what factors were likely to contribute to positive impacts. Based
on the findings, the following were identified as some of the key variables for effective SBM
interventions:

     Linkage between school committee and village council: The IE from Indonesia evaluated
      the effect of four randomized interventions aimed at strengthening school committees (a
      grant plus one or a combination of three interventions: training for school committee
      members, a democratic election of school committee members, or facilitated collaboration
      between the school committee and the village council, also called linkage). The study
      found significant effects on test scores with linkage, or even stronger impact with linkage
      plus election, which had led to greater engagement by education stakeholders and in turn to
      learning. This Indonesian case suggests that broader stakeholder participation may be a

28
  At the same time, this Nepal IE found the regional variation in outcomes of community schools, with more
pronounced impact in hilly and mountain districts and negative or insignificant impact in the Terai district.

                                                         33
                              Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


     critical factor for advances in learning. Collaboration between school committee and
     village council may be a cost-effective, key variable in improving learning outcome.

    Principal’s leadership skill: While there has been substantial research evidence that the
     leadership of the school head is critical for school quality, the IE from the Philippines
     further strengthened this statement by investigating the association between Principal
     Leadership, SBM implementation and student achievement. While conscientiousness
     stands out among major personality traces as the main differentiator for performance,
     leadership skills were found important for effective implementation for SBM, particularly
     networking skills.

    Direct intervention at school level: The IE from Madagascar showed that the interventions
     had changed behavior only when targeting the entire chain of service delivery, with schools
     (teachers and school principals) benefiting directly from the interventions and indirectly
     through the interventions at the sub-district and district levels. A laissez-faire and less
     costly version of the interventions, targeting only the sub-district and district administrators
     so that they would in turn disseminate and supervise implementation of the interventions to
     improve workflow processes at the school level, proved largely ineffective.

    Local capability and simplicity of design: The IE from the Gambia indicated that there was
     little to no evidence that a comprehensive SBM intervention such as the Whole School
     Development could help improve learning outcomes, except when baseline capacity was
     sufficiently high. In fact, it suggested that the intervention could potentially be
     counterproductive for places where local capacity is low. For the Gambia, the gap between
     capacity at the central level and the local level was a key determinant of the success of
     SBM policies. In countries where this gap is small, regardless of the levels, a decentralized
     policy would be superior because of the added value of localized information. However, if
     the gap is sufficiently high in favor of the central government, then the localized
     information play less of a role because the communities are not well equipped to act on
     them. Additionally, a simpler design and easy to master guidelines for school councils
     would have been more suitable for the context.


The results of the analytical work reinforces that we have to continue to explore which aspects of
SAA contribute to positive student outcomes. However, this is not an easy task since SAA can
take many forms, is implemented in different ways and in a variety of contexts.

2. Other Economic and Sector Works & Research

In addition to impact evaluations, the Bank supported various ESWs and research work on SAA.
These analytical works included (a) country studies that assessed the effect of the SBM reforms
or decentralization of social service delivery, and (b) global and regional studies that provided
best practices, theoretical framework, or general guidance on implementation of SBM reforms or
methodologies to monitor their impacts.

Majority of studies addressed accountability at the center of their discussions. The most
notable trend of the ESWs and research on SAA across the regions was the strong focus on

                                                34
                              Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


accountability issues. This could be related to the fact that the World Development Report 2004
“Making Services Work for Poor People” highlighted the accountability framework. Many
reiterated the importance of enhancing accountability to improve the quality of education service
delivery, often referred to this accountability framework. In this context, parental involvement in
school management and the School Council was also a major focus in many studies.

There were some regional variations in context and emphasis of higher objectives of SAA.
While there were no particular differences among regions regarding the topics, findings, and
policy recommendations, there seemed to be some regional variations regarding the context in
which SAA was addressed or the expected outcomes of SAA interventions. In the studies from
Africa, for example, SBM reforms or community participation were often addressed to meet the
increased demands to access secondary education and quality of education. The studies from
Europe and Central Asia highlighted significant demographic change and the decline of school-
age population in the region, and thus addressed SAA to improve efficiency and quality of
service delivery. Likewise, in East Asia and Pacific, SAA seemed to be addressed as a part of
overall decentralization of governance and participation seemed to be relatively in focus. Most of
the studies from Latin America and Caribbean focused on the assessment of SBM reforms with
particular attention to quality improvement.

While the findings of country studies are inevitably context specific, some of the key messages
derived from the findings of ESWs and research include the following:

Community participation and parental involvement are effective measures to improve
education quality. While this is a key assumption of SBM and has been confirmed by numerous
studies, the findings from ESWs and research further strengthened this statement. They showed
that parental involvement in management and monitoring under the right contextual conditions
would (i) help providing the incentives for effective service delivery (Central America) (ii)
reduce repetition and dropout rate (Mexico), (iii) show a robust, significant relationship with
student achievement in math (Albania), and (iv) reduce teacher absenteeism (Bangladesh).

Yet, enhancing social accountability was found to be challenging. Many of the country
studies which assessed the SBM reforms found that the participation of parents and communities
in school management and monitoring had not been effective as expected, and thus limited social
accountability or downward accountability. They identified the following factors that hindered
the effective participation:

     Lack of knowledge about what SBM required of stakeholders, the role of School
      Councils, school management and governance (Indonesia, Mongolia)
     Information constraints and weak institutions that allow undemocratic election of parent
      representatives. (Albania)
     Inadequate information flow to parents and low parental awareness of the need to hold
      school accountable (Indonesia)
     Lack of essential school records and direct authority (Sudan)
     Societal context that don’t challenge authority (Mongolia)
     Lack of involvement of school council members (Poland)
     Involvement of principals in school councils (Bulgaria)

                                                35
                                   Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


      Difficulty in achieving the appropriate balance between community involvement through
       the school boards and stability in the management of schools (Mongolia)

Empowerment of parents and community is important. If SBM is offered as a solution to
pressing educational problems, school councils must be empowered to make meaningful
improvements in schools and must be capable of doing so. It is also important that school
councils truly represent parents and community members. The findings from several studies
(Central America and Bulgaria) suggested that principals should probably not be a part of the
school councils, or, if they are part, then their relative responsibilities be very clearly specified,
to prevent communities from not being truly empowered in administrative matters.

Local capacity building was a key policy recommendation in many studies. Limited
capacity of stakeholders was most commonly identified as a key constraint for the successful
implementation of SBM reforms. In many cases, the ability of stakeholders to fully exercise
either their authority or oversight duties remained elusive because of their limited capacity or
information. This include the capacity of (i) parents to participate and hold schools accountable;
(ii) teachers to manage classrooms to improve learning (iii) principals to manage overall school
operations; and (iv) district officers to monitor and supervise schools. Therefore, local capacity
building was frequently emphasized in the policy recommendations.

Clear roles and responsibilities for different levels are crucial. The SBM reforms entail
significant changes in roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder.29 The importance of
defining clear roles and responsibilities for different stakeholders (e.g. schools, parents,
inspectors, district offices, central ministries) were echoed in multiple studies. It was noted that
management processes must clearly follow from educational objectives and specified lines of
authority to help to avoid overlaps in responsibility and gaps in information. Furthermore, these
roles and responsibilities should accompany necessary resources, training and information to
effectively carry them out. It was also noted that management reforms may want to avoid placing
large amounts of power in the hands of any one stakeholder.

Consensus building as a key to successful implementation and institutionalization. SBM
reforms involve a wide range of stakeholders and its success hinges on their political economy.
The analyses from Central America highlighted the importance of consensus building among
stakeholders, as consensual reforms are more likely to be conducive to achieving positive
outcomes.30 It was noted that the SBM models should have a network of key people ready to act
and main political forces should know the program’s goals and its achievements. The case study
from El Salvador demonstrated that consensus building efforts were essential to the successful
implementation of the EDUCO program (Box 1).




29
  The Study “School management and the changing role for school directors” demonstrated how role of school
principals changed in SBM reforms in Bulgaria and Romania.
30 The study from Mexico shows the importance of good relations between states and unions (Patrinos 2008).
Similarly, the study on Central America also emphasized the importance to include teachers and teachers’ unions in
the reform process (Di Gropello 2006). .

                                                        36

                Box 1. Political economy and successful project implementation:
                                 El Salvador’s EDUCO program

 The World Bank, along with other multilateral organizations, supported El Salvador’s Education with
 Community Participation Program (EDUCO) from 1995 to 2007. The program supported
 community-administered schools which were originally established by local communities to provide
 basic education in areas where the government service was unavailable after the civil war (1980-1992)
 and later institutionalized by the government. Under the program, local school-based parent
 associations were granted control over the administration of schools and given necessary training to
 improve literacy and financial management.

 Despite the enabling political environment in which the political system shifted from an authoritarian
 military regime to a more democratic one after the war, there was considerable risk to the education
 reform efforts due to the political economy. Initially, the reform faced opposition from various groups
 including the teachers’ unions and guerrilla groups who saw EDUCO as a move to privatize education
 and a threat to the job stability of teachers. The lack of communication led to public misconception of
 the reforms and prevented stakeholders from developing a sense of ownership.

 In order to build consensus, a communication strategy was considered essential to inform
 communities and improve support for complex reforms. The ministry set out to establish better
 channels of communication among the communities by creating an active communication campaign
 that would increase public awareness and support for the basic education reforms. The communication
 interventions made an impact on stakeholder relations, including those originally opposed to EDUCO.

 Lessons learned from consensus building efforts and the communication campaign:
        • Engage stakeholders early in the process;
        • Enable strong ownership of reforms;
        • Ensure negotiation and dialogue as key elements of consensus building efforts;
        • Strategically highlight key aspects of a program into succinct messages; and
        • Establish key messengers who can work as spokespersons for a campaign (teachers in this
            case).

 It is important for the projects to use caution when introducing reforms. Bank-supported projects have
 a tendency to be ambitious and try to introduce various components all at once. It is more important to
 approach reform efforts step-by-step.

 In their approach to these decentralization efforts, the three principles that this project followed were
 the following: (1) be specific in the definition of roles - the roles and responsibilities of each actor
 were clearly defined; (2) make sure that all the resources are in place; and (3) incorporate technical
 assistance at all levels. Many parents were illiterate and relied on the teachers, so a great deal of
 capacity building had to take place. The ministry also had to undergo this capacity building.

Accountability vs. Equity in school financing. The findings from various studies revealed a
challenge in balancing between accountability and equity in school financing. In other words,
getting “right” criteria of allocation formula to ensure adequate funding for good quality
education for all students would be challenging. In order to ensure financial transparency and

                                                        37
                                Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


accountability, the funding formula should be simple and easy to understand e.g. based on the
number of students. Yet, the evidence from various countries showed that there were substantial
resource gaps among schools between rural and urban areas as the availability of discretionary
resources differed greatly across schools. Geographic locations of schools and other factors such
as student characteristics, special education needs, level and type of school also created
differences in school operating costs, which need to be taken into account to ensure equity of
expenditures.

Community participation in school construction is highly cost-effective. The study from
Africa showed clear evidence that community based approaches that empower local
communities to implement school projects resulted in lower costs. To meet the high demand of
expanding access in Africa, this approach was found highly effective in scaling up to meet the
volume required.


V.       Lessons Learned

As previously mentioned, it is beyond the scope of this portfolio review to draw general
conclusions on what factors and conditions are necessary for the SAA interventions to work.
Nevertheless, the findings of analytical work and operational experiences can generate some
lessons learned as follows:

        Impact of SAA intervention is highly contextual. The policy context surrounding the
         reform is bound to affect its impact, as reflected on the mixed outcomes of the operations
         and the results of IEs. Key variables identified in one context may not necessarily be
         critical in another, and stakeholder dynamics are different from one country to another.
         At the same time, there are quite a number of variables that affect the impact of the
         interventions. These include political, cultural, social factors such as political economy,
         history, institutional setup, heterogeneity and characteristics of the population, etc., which
         makes this type of intervention highly complex. Even within the country, the impact
         could vary based on characteristics and geographical location of schools. Therefore, it is
         important that each country context be thoroughly assessed to customize the interventions
         instead of simply applying the best practice from other country contexts. As part of this
         assessment, risks associated with changes in incentives, accountability mechanisms, and
         institutional mandates should also be clearly spelled out and mitigation measures adopted.

        Pay attention to the political economy and the incentives of each stakeholder to
         perform. As mentioned above, understanding the political economy is particularly
         important for SAA reform as it involves a whole spectrum of stakeholders --- parents,
         students, communities, teachers, principals, district officers and central ministries --- and
         changes in their roles and responsibilities. Having consensus on the clear objective in
         education and the roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder is crucial for successful
         reform. Including incentive scheme such as performance-linked grant may be effective in
         achieving desired outcomes.




                                                  38
                           Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


   Pay attention to enabling conditions for autonomy and community participation to
    work. Implementation challenges and lessons from the operations and analytical work
    show that it should not be assumed that the SBM interventions would automatically
    increase community participation and improve educational outcomes.

   Building local capacity is critical in implementing SAA activities. Effectiveness of
    SBM will depend to a large extent on the capacity of local stakeholders to take advantage
    of opportunities and effectively manage schools. The gap between local capacity at the
    central level and the local level is a key determinant of the success of this kind of policies.
    SAA interventions should entail training for capacity building for each stakeholder. For
    example, the measurement of leadership skills and leadership training for school heads
    could be incorporated as an important part of their professional development as
    differences in leadership skills do matter for school performance.

   Relevant information or data should be available for SAA system to work. In many
    cases, one of the biggest challenges of achieving social accountability was a lack of
    information. The knowledge among stakeholders including parents on what SBM is and
    how it works is important to make the system work. Also, some operations noted lack of
    data was another implementation challenge, which included lack of essential school
    records to assess the school performance, or population data required to implement per
    capita financing.

   Structural changes require behavior changes of all stakeholders, which is a long-
    term proposition. Areas where progress tends to be slower would be those that involved
    significant organizational change (decentralization, institutionalization of strategic
    planning) and those that require a change in behavior of teachers, administrators, parents
    (e.g. new pedagogy and classroom practices, new management roles, monitoring of
    school operations). It is easier to bring about changes to documents, procedures and
    policies than it is to transform organizational structures or human behavior.

   Continuous, longitudinal assessment should be conducted to make necessary
    adjustments to SBM reforms. Even though the SAA reform was implemented
    successfully, the same model may not remain effective if the context changes. It is
    important to acknowledge that changes to the financing system, degree of autonomy
    granted and accountability structure is a continuous process and will require constant
    adjustments. Also, the impact may differ between short-term and long-term. Constant
    monitoring and update of knowledge is important.

   SBM should be implemented with special attention to disadvantaged schools and
    communities. Some studies indicated that the impact of SAA interventions can be
    different for disadvantaged schools and communities such as those with a high proportion
    of ethnic minorities. Also, literacy levels can matter for effective community
    participation. The result of SAA interventions were mixed in terms of equity, and some
    findings from the analytical work indicated that inequality could expand if the reform is
    not implemented in a way that considers the socio-economic variation among the schools.

VI.    Conclusion

This paper reviewed World Bank support for SAA from FY03-13. It provided an overview on
what the Bank has been doing in the area of SAA for both operational and analytical work.

Given that decentralization and improving education service delivery through school autonomy
and accountability has been part of the core education policy discussions at the Bank, the share
of Bank operational support to SAA at 17 percent of the total education portfolio over 11 years
could be construed as on the low side. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the Bank
should further push the SAA agenda in all countries, as the impact of SAA interventions are
highly contextual and it requires careful assessment of the country context to get the right
combination of activities and capacity building in place to achieve better learning outcomes.
Projects that have taken a more balanced approach to supporting school autonomy, assessment
and accountability seem to do better.

Among the 168 SAA projects, the mapping of activities to SABER-SAA policy goals revealed
that while projects use a combination of approaches, the majority concentrate on supporting
school grants and community participation in school activities. Relatively less focus was given
to the area of accountability and the use of data or information of assessment results to hold
schools and systems accountable for student learning. Since a balance and alignment of key
elements of SAA (autonomy, participation, assessment, and accountability) are considered
crucial for improving the education system as a whole, accountability could be the area where
future Bank support could focus more in order to improve education management and
administration. At the same time, many analytical studies addressed accountability as a main
research topic and reflected that establishing an accountability mechanism is also a challenging
one.

Available evidence from the ICR reviews and IEs show that the Bank has been making
significant contributions to improving various education outcomes, including access, quality,
efficiency, and equity through SAA interventions. However, there were also some projects that
did not make an impact, particularly on learning outcomes as measured through test scores.
Based on this finding, more rigorous analysis of the Bank’s operational experiences – including
results, project design, implementation, and political economy - through detailed case studies
would be desired to help further identify what works and what does not to improve quality of
learning through SAA interventions.

As mentioned, the success of SAA reform highly depends on the context. It entails the designing
of institutional model that involves all levels of stakeholders. This perhaps accounts for the
regional variation of Bank support for SAA in objectives and interventions found in this paper,
the South Asia Region having the highest share of projects and the LAC region with the most
analytical work. What type of SAA model works in what context would be a key future subject
of research, which will further help provide concrete guidance on successful approaches to SAA.

VIII. Annexes
Annex 1. Description of Document Sources
This Annex was prepared with information from: 1) The World Bank Operations Manual – Last
revised in March 2012; 2) Independent Evaluation Group – Annual Report, 2012; 3) OPCS
Guidelines for Implementation Completion and Results Report – Last updated in May 2011; and
4) “How the Project Cycle Works” at:
http://intranet.worldbank.org/WBSITE/INTRANET/INTCOUNTRIES/INTLAC/0,,menuPK:257
867~pagePK:64089870~piPK:64089874~theSitePK:257804,00.html (Last visited on January 25,
2013).

Project Appraisal Documents (PADs): The PAD follows a standardized structure and provides
a detailed description of the lending operation. In a general sense it presents: i) the country
context and rationale; ii) a detailed description of objectives, components, indicators and lessons
learned during project preparation; iii) implementation arrangements, sustainability
considerations and risks, iv) a results framework, and v) financial and disbursement
arrangements.

Implementation Status Reports (ISRs): The results framework presented in the PAD is used
as a basis for implementation monitoring and project supervision. Findings regarding progress
towards meeting targets, implementation challenges and potential solutions are documented in
ISRs on a regular basis during the life of the project.

Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs): Approximately six months after the project has
been completed, the ICR presents an assessment of the project’s degree of success in meeting its
development objective and provides a rating of the overall project performance. It summarizes
other significant outcomes, problems encountered during project implementation, lessons learned,
and the knowledge gained from undertaking the operation. It also presents ratings on the
performance of the Bank and the Borrower.

IEG’s Reviews: The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reviews and validates each ICR
through evaluative notes. These notes are desk-based and aim to independently assess the project
experience as well as the quality of the Bank’s self-evaluation contained in the ICR. IEG also
conducts Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) for about 25 percent of closed
projects each year. PPARs aim to assess the achievements of operations, rate projects for
accountability purposes, and point to lessons from project experience. They involve field visits
and interviews of multiple stakeholders and are often the evidence base for larger evaluations.

Economic and Sector Work (ESW) provides a foundation for: carrying out policy dialogue
with external clients; building clients’ analytic capacity; helping clients to formulate effective
financing programs (including borrowing); and influencing the development community. To
qualify as an ESW, an activity must: involve original analytical effort; be undertaken with the
intent of influencing an external client’s policies or programs; and be “owned” by a specific
Bank unit (i.e., the output represents the views of the Bank rather than be attributed to individual
authors).

Technical Assistance (non-lending) (TA) are services to assist clients to implement a policy or
program, develop or strengthen institutions, or to facilitate knowledge exchange. To qualify as
TA, an activity must: have the primary intent of enabling an external client to implement reform
(i.e. “how to”) and/or strengthen institutions; be linked to a World Bank unit with clear
accountability for the service provided.
Impact evaluation (IE) rigorously measures the impact that a project has on beneficiaries. It
typically does this by comparing outcomes between beneficiaries and a control group, both
before and after a project has been implemented. It is important to do IE rigorously and
accurately in order to arrive at a true picture of the best way of achieving desired results for
clients. IE establishes the causal link between the change in outcomes and specific policy actions.
By measuring cause-effect relationships, IE helps guide whether a policy action should be
maintained and scaled up or not.

Annex 2. Different Combinations of Interventions and Their Outcomes
This table (read across by single row) shows that projects may select the same types of
interventions to support School Autonomy and Accountability to address a certain education
objective such as improving quality, efficiency, access, or equity, but the results (outcomes) may
be different. It also shows that by objective there are several different combinations of SAA
interventions that have been supported and this is usually reflective of the country context and
policy environment.
In this table the interventions are grouped by SABER policy goal area (PG1) autonomy in budget
and management at the school level; (PG2) autonomy in personnel management; (PG3)
community participation/role of the school council in governance; (PG4) student and school
assessment; and (PG5) accountability.

CB – capacity building
SC – school council
SG – school grant
SIP – school improvement plan
SMC – School Management Committee

Background:   In 2005, the Indonesian government introduced the School Operational Assistance
(Bantuan Operasional Sekolah - BOS) Program, a school grant program for all basic education
schools. The main objectives of BOS Program were to reduce the financial burden for students,
improve access to and raise the quality of basic education, and to further support school based
management reforms that had started in 2003. Schools were given authority to manage their
operations independently according to student needs and were asked to engage the local
community to improve the quality of education. It was Indonesia’s most significant policy
reform in education financing in two important aspects: (i) block grants to schools are based on a
per-pupil formula, which provides incentives for headmasters and teachers to focus on
maintaining and increasing enrollment; and (ii) funds are directly channeled to the schools,
which empowers school managers by allowing them to choose how to best allocate the BOS
grants. In 2007, the Government took another step in cementing SBM and parental involvement
with regulations, which further enhanced the role of school committees (SCs). The SCs were
assigned a central role in the management and use of school grants. At each step of the process,
they were required to participate in school planning and provide oversight on expenditure plans
and reports.

Bank’s support: The Bank provided support to the BOS program through multiple projects: BOS-
Knowledge Improvement for Transparency and Accountability (BOS-KITA) project was
implemented in 2008-2012, providing direct budgetary support and adding value to the BOS
program. There was a parallel Basic Education Capacity Trust Fund Project (BEC-TF) as well as
the Dutch Education Support Program (DESP) that provided technical assistance and capacity
building in support of BOS-KITA, financing a set of studies, evaluations, training, study visits
and workshops. A number of other complementary Development Partner projects were also
supporting the BOS program.

Project Development Objectives: The PDO of the BOS-KITA project was “to improve access to
quality education in Indonesia for all children of ages 7 to 15 by strengthening school-based
management and community participation, improving existing fiduciary arrangements for greater
transparency and accountability of the BOS program and, consequently bringing about better
utilization of BOS funds.”

Components: The BOS-KITA project had a single component named the “BOS Operation
Assistance School Grants.” The project reimbursed a portion of the Government’s BOS grants
made to public and private primary and junior secondary schools under the auspices of MoNE.

Target Goals: The project expected to increase the net enrollment rates and transition rates, and
reduce drop-out rates with the quality enhancing measures with the BOS grant. Improvements in
student outcomes were not included in the project indicators given the short project period. In
addition, the project aimed at improving management of BOS Funds, increasing public
information and dissemination regarding BOS, and improving monitoring and evaluation. These
were measured by the indicators such as: the increase of schools receiving funds on time, based
on student numbers; the percentage of SCs that approve annual budget plans and receive
expenditure reports; the percentage of schools that disclose BOS expenditures by category on the
notice board; the percentage of parents knowledgeable about BOS, its uses, and school budgets
and plans.

Outcomes: SBM reforms were significantly strengthened when BOS grants were introduced in
2005. Grants under the program provided a predictable and reliable source of funding that could
be used in ways that the school itself thought would best to improve education outcomes. With
the Bank projects’ support, the BOS program was strengthened with the increased transparency
and accountability. Bank technical assistance and guidance on the BOS Operations Manual had
greatest impact on improved existing fiduciary arrangements, funds flow, school-based
management and increased community participation in BOS activities throughout Indonesia. The
effects of the BOS program were seen to be generally positive. BOS-KITA ICR noted that
provincial and district SBM was strengthened with an increased number of schools involving the
SCs, parents and the community in school planning, budgeting and monitoring. Some positive
changes reported by stakeholders included more interactions with parents, change in teaching
methods, and school facility improvements.

At the higher outcome level, the BOS program contributed to expanding access particularly to
poor and disadvantaged children. Since the introduction of BOS program and throughout the
project period, there has been a significant increase in net enrollment rates at both primary and
junior secondary level, with the largest increase within the poorest income quintile (from 53.03
percent in 2007 to 63.54 percent in 2012). Reductions in dropout rates and improvements in
transition rates are also observed over the 2007-11 period.31 However, the BOS program is yet to
be found effective in improving student learning without strong evidence of the link between the
SBM measures and students’ test scores.32

Lessons learned: Although there has been considerable progress in SBM in the country, the
assessment of the SBM reform in Indonesia indicates that the implementation of SBM has not
resulted in significant enough changes in school practices to have an influence on student
learning. The several studies revealed some challenges to the effective SBM33: First, despite their
central role in Indonesian SBM as the vehicles of parental and community participation in school
governance and management, SCs functioned less effectively due to lack of capacity and low
level of participation. The actual role of school committees is still limited, while the school
principal, together with teachers, is empowered to assert professional control of the school. The
level of parental participation and voice in school management is still quite low with inadequate
information flow to parents, as well as seemingly low parental awareness of holding schools

accountable. Second, schools have yet to take advantage of the flexibility provided to them with
a limited capacity to make managerial and instructional changes to enhance student performance.
As a result, districts continue to maintain control over school practices. In order to take forward
the SBM reform to improve quality of education, the roles and responsibilities of each
stakeholder could be clarified and the capacity at school level should be further enhanced to
manage SBM. This includes the capacity of SCs to oversee the school activities and with a
stronger link with community,34 as well as the capacity of principals and teachers to conduct
quality enhancing activities.

  The result of an impact evaluation study indicates that the SC could make a positive impact on student academic
performance if it has a strong link with community and better represents the community (with democratic election).

Background: Bulgaria launched decentralization of financial decision-making to the school in
1998, with a pilot of Delegated School Budget System (DSBS) through which schools receive
lump-sum budgets for maintenance costs through a formula-based funding. The impact was
limited, however, due to a limited authority of principals over personnel management, and a lack
of accountability measures. The government further implemented a comprehensive fiscal
decentralization and municipal finance reform in 2001, which increased transparency in the
calculation and allocation of subsidies across municipalities. However, it was not until 2007 that
the substantial decentralization of the education system took place to promote greater school
autonomy and more efficient spending.

The 2007 reform was in response to the critical needs to improve quality and efficiency. As in
other countries in the region, Bulgaria had been experiencing the considerable decrease in the
school age population resulted from migration and low birth rates. The education system faced
diminishing demand and an urgent need to implement structural changes in order to remain
efficient. In addition, low student achievement had been a serious challenge with less than a half
of Bulgarian students reaching the OECD critical threshold of reading literacy and math
competency. This was especially an issue as Bulgaria was joining in EU in 2007.

In order to tackle these challenges, the government adopted a comprehensive strategy “The
National Program for Development of School Education (2006-2015)” in 2006 to address the
long neglected aspects of efficiency, quality and accountability in education. The reform
included: decentralization and optimization of the school network via a capitation funding reform
to municipalities; decentralization of school management including human resources and budgets
to school principals; and mitigating measures to prevent an increase in drop-outs during the
reform transition.

Bank’s support: The Bank supported this fiscal decentralization reform as part of three DPLs: Social
Sectors Institutional Reform Development Policy Loan (SIR DPL) I, II, and III. The reform was
supported under the objective of improving the efficiency of the health, education, and social
protection systems to maintain a fiscally sustainable expenditure framework and improve access to
basic social services.

For the first DPL, the government approved: (i) a new financing formula (unified per student cost
standard), for allocating funds to municipalities for their school networks; (ii) the plan for a phased
introduction of the new financing formula; and (iii) a package of measures and incentives to support
the introduction of the unified standard and school consolidation. For the second DPL, the

                                                  50
                               Portfolio Review of SAA Operations and Analytical Work, FY2003-2013


government maintained unified standard and per student financing and DSBS as a national policy.
For the third DPL, the government strengthened school-based management, through providing school
principals with increased discretion over school budgeting, including over staff salaries, and over
staffing for the budget year of 2009.

Outcomes: The payment reform has been rolled out successfully to all schools, and the education
system has been decentralized financially and operationally. Per-student financing, delegated budget
and the rationalization of school networks led to a wave of school closures and consolidation, leading
to larger schools with opportunities to pool education resources, and thus produced impressive
efficiency gains. Teacher and school productivity increased as shown by an increase in
student/teacher ratios and average school size. The reform increased transparency for resource
allocation by ensuring that the unified standard is passed on to the schools. SBM with a considerable
degree of decision making power of the principals set the foundation for better adjustment to local
education needs. There is yet no conclusive evidence that reforms improved the learning outcomes.
However, PISA results shows that Bulgaria’s 2009 mean score in reading rose by 27 points over the
2006 level, being among the top improvers worldwide.

Lessons learned: Bulgaria’s decentralization reform was based on administrative-control model
where authority is mostly devolved to the school principals. It increased the fiscal accountability
to local or central authorities and empowered schools in decision-making. At the same time, the
reform lacked social accountability mechanisms and the empowerment of school did not entail the
increased level of participation of parents and the community. Parents have few avenues open to
them to participate in the school decision-making process and lack the formal ability to hold
principals accountable for school expenditures and results in learning outcomes. The relationships of
accountability between stakeholders could be strengthened to promote more effective SBM reform.

In addition, while the reform has drastically improved the efficiency in school financing system,
there were some suggestions that this reform expanded inequality. Linguistic minority students
(Roma students) seem to have been more negatively affected by school closures. The majority of
school consolidations occurred in rural small schools, including locations where the Roma were
overrepresented. Evidence suggests that school consolidations may have discouraged Roma students’
attendance and lowered their performance in these schools, due to their problems integrating with
other pupils and distance to schools. Also, they tend to perform better in small schools than in
larger schools. Given the different impact among the populations from different social and
ethnic backgrounds, the reform could entail some measures to mitigate these differences to
improve sustainability and equity.
