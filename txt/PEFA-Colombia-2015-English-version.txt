Introduction

The objective of the 2015 Colombia Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment is to have an updated diagnosis of the performance of the public financial management
(PFM) system in the country so as to (i) determine the progress made with the reforms
implemented in recent years by the Government of Colombia (GoC), (ii) understand the impacts
of these reforms, (iii) establish the tools and next steps necessary to consolidate the progress made,
and (iv) promote long-term economic stability and sustainability.

This assessment was conducted, at the request of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
(MFPC), by the World Bank (WB). The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of the
Swiss Confederation and the Delegation of the European Union in Colombia (EU) collaborated
throughout the process.

The assessment is performed using the 2016 PEFA methodology officially presented on February
1, 2016. The use of the PEFA methodology for this purpose records the progress made by the
country’s public financial management from the PEFA Colombia 2009 assessment, and establishes
a new baseline for future measurement of progress to be made, for example, regarding public
investment, public asset management, fiscal strategy, and results-oriented information, which
promise to be particularly useful for the reform agenda that the GoC is interested in promoting.

The scope of the PEFA Colombia 2015 exercise covers the Central Government and the
assessment analysis period are the last three completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014), at the
time of the assessment (December 2015). The field mission took place in Bogota between
November 12 and December 18, 2015, and this report was prepared between January 4 and August
17, 2016, incorporating comments from the Government of Colombia and guest reviewers.

Country Background

Colombia is located in northwestern South America, and has an estimated population of 48.2
million in 2015. It is the fourth-largest economy of South America, after those of Brazil, Argentina
and Chile. Colombia has a substantial domestic market, a wealth of natural resources, and an
average annual economic rate growth rate from 2005 through 2014 of 4.8 percent, underpinned by
a strong macroeconomic framework.

PFM in Colombia has important strengths, primarily associated with the development of
instruments that have allowed prudent fiscal management—such as the recent introduction of
fiscal rules—that have supported major development initiatives. However, there are still some
weaknesses related to the strategic allocation of resources, accountability, and efficient delivery of
public services—areas where reform efforts are being made that are not yet fully reflected in the
assessment. Among the most important of these ongoing efforts are (i) the inclusion in the budget
of performance information, linking resource planning in the most appropriate manner; (ii) the
convergence of national accounting to international accounting standards for the public sector,
allowing consistency between the accounting and budgetary classifications; (iii) the strengthening



                                                  ii
of the Office of the Comptroller General by improving the quality and efficiency of control
measures; and (iv) promoting the transparency of information of public finances and citizen
participation.

PEFA Methodology

The measurement of the PFM system is performed from the valuation of 31 high level performance
indicators (PIs) grouped in seven pillars of interest:

    I.          Reliability of the budget (PI-1 to PI-3)
    II.         Transparency of public finances (PI-4 to PI-9)
    III.        Management of assets and liabilities (PI-10 to PI-13)
    IV.         Policy-based fiscal strategy and budgeting (PI-14 to PI-18)
    V.          Predictability and control in budgeting execution (PI-19 to PI-26)
    VI.         Accounting and reporting (PI-27 to PI-29)
    VII.        Scrutiny and external audit (PI-30 to PI-31)

The 31 performance indicators are scored on an ordinal scale of seven points, A, B+, B, C+, C,
D+, and D, according to the objective evidence obtained during the assessment process and report
preparation. An “A” score states that national practice, as assessed by the PEFA methodology is
compatible with international best practices; a score of “D” shows that national practice is far from
best practice (or there is insufficient information or evidence to score).

show that 24 of the 31 indicators (77.4 percent) scored between ‘A’ and ‘C+.’ The remaining
indicators (22.6 percent) received scores between ‘C’ and ‘D,’ which suggests opportunities for
strengthening PFM practices in the country.
The pillars that obtained the best scores are Pillar I “budget reliability” (PI-1 to PI-3), Pillar III
“management of assets and liabilities” (PI-10 to PI-13), and Pillar IV “policy-based fiscal strategy
and budgeting” (PI-14 to PI-18). In these cases, the great majority of the scores of the relevant
indicators are located in the range of “A” and “B,” highlighting them as strengths of the PFM
system in Colombia.

Particularly noteworthy is the positive performance of indicators PI-14 and PI-15, which measure
the overall institutional capacity to establish a credible fiscal strategy and comply with it. These
two indicators have recently been added to the latest revision of the PEFA methodology, precisely
to reflect progress in this regard within international best practice. Colombia exhibits significant
progress in this area. The same can be said of indicators PI-11 “management of public investment”
and PI-12 indicators “management of public assets,” and where Colombia displays compatibility
with international standards.

The PI-1 to PI-3 indicators as a whole measure whether the annual program of revenues and
expenses included in the budget approved by the Congress continues without major variations
during the implementation phase, both at overall and disaggregated categories of sectoral,
functional, and economic classifications. In the case of Colombia, these indicators obtained scores
between “B+” and “C+,” a suggesting that the General Budget of the Nation (GBN) is a reliable
instrument that effectively guides the allocation of public resources to the priorities identified in
national policy.

For Pillars II “transparency of public finances” (PI-4 to PI-9), and V “predictability and control in
budget execution” (PI-19 to PI-26), performance was more mixed. Indicators on fiscal
transparency are generally aligned with international best practices, except for those scoring the
budget classification (PI-4) and the inclusion of performance information in the budget allocated
to the direct delivery of public services to the population (PI-8). The scores of these two indicators
confirm the decision of the GoC to focus a substantial part of the reform effort in these areas.

Pillar indicators on “predictability and control in budget execution” have practices adjusted to
international standards in Treasury Management (PI-21) and Internal Control Management (PI-
25), in contrast with indicators that scored between “C” and “D+,” primarily Payroll controls (PI-
23) and Procurement (PI-24). The GoC has also initiated actions to strengthen the instruments
required to foster improvements in these processes, with an aim to consolidating over the medium
term.

Among the pillars there is less robust performance. Pillars VI and VII, “accounting and reporting”
and “external scrutiny and audit,” respectively, indicate opportunities for improvement (i.e., all
indicators that make up these two pillars [PI-27 to PI-31] have scores between “D+” and “C+,”
which suggest the existence of gaps in relation to international best practices). If pursued diligently
the ongoing reforms, especially those aimed at strengthening the consolidation of government



                                                  iv
financial information on the National Balance Sheet and inter-agency coordination of regulators
and oversight agencies, may reverse these shortcomings over the medium term.

Effects on the Main Objectives of Public Finances

The potential impact of these overall strengths and specific opportunities for improvement is
discussed with respect to aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and efficient
service delivery.

Aggregate Fiscal Discipline. The following system components contribute to achieving aggregate
fiscal discipline: (i) a clearly defined fiscal strategy, along with monitoring and assessment of its
results; (ii) the capabilities for the preparation of robust projections of macroeconomic and fiscal
performance; (iii) budget reliability, particularly the scant variation reflecting the expenditures
executed globally and as disaggregated by administrative, functional, and economic categories;
(iv) good forecast of aggregate annual revenue, which does not suffer significant deviations during
budget execution; (v) the proper reporting of revenue and expenditure operations that are outside
the GBN; (vi) the management of fiscal and non-fiscal revenues; (vii) the relevant administration
of public assets and liabilities; (viii) the predictability of resources to commit expenditures during
budget execution; and (ix) the effective management of internal controls.

These positive factors are partially offset by the few weaknesses that are still prevalent in the PFM
system, especially (i) the reduced capacity of fiscal risk oversight generated by public sector
agencies as a whole; (ii) late payments; (iii) the difficulties remaining in the scheduling of medium-
term expenditures; (vi) the weak link between investment expenditures and the future recurring
expenditures they generate; and (vii) limitations in coverage and comparability

Strategic Allocation of Resources. The strengths of the Colombia’s PFM system with respect to
the strategic allocation of resources are (i) the existence of budgeting guidelines that assign
credible budgeting ceilings, over the short and medium term; (ii) the timely submission of the draft
budget for consideration by Congress; (iii) the delivery of complete and relevant information to
Congress for analysis of the draft budget information; (iv) regular and timely approval of the
budget law before the effective date of the corresponding fiscal year; (v) the preparation and
adoption of a National Development Plan (NDP) every four years that focuses on priorities in the
allocation of public funds among institutions; (vi) monitoring and assessment of performance
information in the NDP; and (vii) assessment and regular monitoring that is performed on public
investment projects.
However, the following weaknesses were found: (i) the difficulty of aligning planning and
budgeting, as well as ensuring consistency of expenditures with budgetary ceilings over the
medium term; (ii) budgeting classification that cannot be compared with international standards;
(iii) the absence of performance information in the budget as a whole; (iv) the mechanisms of
investment project costing; (v) the budget execution reports; (vi) preparation of financial and
budgeting statements; (vii) monitoring performed on the external control recommendations; and
(viii) the overall assessment of the results of fiscal management by Congress.

Efficient Service Delivery. Efficient (and effective) delivery of public services to the populace is
an important PFM objective. The components of the PFM system in Colombia that favor this goal
in satisfactory manner are (i) proper budgeting of revenue and fiscal impact analysis of economic


                                                  v
and social policies; (ii) the availability of funds for commitment to expenditures, facilitated by the
use of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system; (iii) the transfer of tax collections to the TSA
without undue delay; and (iv) the transparency of key budgeting and fiscal information.

In 2015, however, there are weaknesses affecting the capability of the system to efficiently deliver
public services, the most notable being the difficulties for integrated management on the one hand,
and payroll on the other, and the purchasing and public procurement system. The internal auditing
and monitoring that is performed on budgeting reports on the expenditures incurred by the frontline
service delivery units are also important weaknesses.

Comparative Annex

Finally, for purposes of demonstrating the evolution of the PFM system in the country, the PEFA
Colombia 2015 exercise prepared an annex that compares the results obtained in the 2009 PEFA
assessment with the results of the exercise performed in 2015, using the PEFA methodology in its
2011 version. Applying the same methodology at two different times can generate direct
comparability between the indicators and ensures a clearer reading of the progress made during
the period.1

The results that are reflected in the Comparative Annex (see Annex 7) to this report show
comparable overall performance between 2009 and 2015. The indicators exhibiting significant
improvements are linked to the control of budgeting execution, as well as the management of
public debt, of late payments and legislative scrutiny of the budget. However, other results show
performance drops, of which the most notable are the indicators linked to valuing the budgeting
classification, the management of fiscal process and procedures, the integrity of financial
reporting, and external control.

  The 2016 PEFA methodology and the 2005/2011 PEFA methodology are not comparable; hence it is also necessary
to apply the 2005/2011 methodology to the 2012, 2013, and 2014 periods.

                                         1. INTRODUCTION

This section of the final report provides an account of the objectives, management, and
methodology used in the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) performance
assessment of the public financial management (PFM) system conducted in Colombia in late 2015.

1.1    Background and Purpose of the Assessment

The performance of the PEFA Colombia 2015 Assessment was agreed in mid-2015 between the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC), representing the Government of the Republic of
Colombia (GoC), the World Bank (WB), and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)
of the Swiss Confederation, in collaboration with representatives of the European Union in
Colombia.

The objective of the 2015 Colombia Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment is to have an updated diagnosis of the performance of Colombia’s PFM system so as
to (i) determine the progress made with the GoC reforms implemented in recent years,
(ii) understand the impacts of these reforms, (iii) establish the tools and next steps necessary to
consolidate the progress made, and (iv) promote long-term economic stability and sustainability.
The exercise highlights the progress made by the country with respect to PFM issues since the
2009 PEFA Colombia assessment, and establishes a baseline for future measurement of subsequent
advances. In particular, the updated PEFA methodology has five new indicators: performance
information for service delivery (PI-8), public investment management (PI-11), public asset
management (PI-12), macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting (PI-14), and fiscal strategy (PI-15),
which are particularly useful for the reform agenda that the GoC is interested in strengthening in
the coming years.

1.2    Assessment Management and Quality Control

Teams from the General Vice Ministry of the MFPC, SECO, and the WB, supported by the PEFA
Secretariat, worked on the organization and overall coordination of the exercise; this was the basis
for the preparation of the Assessment’s Concept Note, which outlined the execution of the PEFA
exercise in Colombia. The Concept Note was shared with the PEFA Secretariat for its review and
comments were invited and received from peer reviewers.1 The final version was approved,
incorporating these observations, on October 10, 2015.

The preparation of the Concept Note resulted in the creation of a Monitoring Committee for the
PEFA Colombia 2015 exercise, chaired by the Technical Deputy Minister of MFPC, and
composed of representatives from the Office of the Director General of the National Public Budget
(DGNPB), Office of the Director General for Public Credit and National Treasury (DGPCTN), the
National Planning Department (NPD), the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Office of the
Comptroller General of Colombia (CGC), and WB officials. The Monitoring Committee met on

 In compliance with the requirements of the PEFA CHECK (the seal granted by the PEFA Secretariat for assessment
processes that comply with established best practices), officials designated by the World Bank, the State Secretariat
for Economic Affairs of Switzerland/SECO, the Delegation of the European Union in Colombia/EU, and the Inter-
American Development Bank/IDB were invited to serve as peer reviewers.

October 17, 2015 for the launch of the PEFA Colombia 2015 assessment, and on December 11 of
the same year, at the formal close of the field mission in Bogota.

The Concept Note also provides for the creation of an Operational Monitoring Committee,
composed of designated officials from MFPC, WB, and SECO, with the goal of (i) monitoring the
progress of the field mission, (ii) coordinating the various activities conducted during this mission,
including the training workshop, (iii) ensuring that the required information was presented in
timely fashion to the assessment teams; and (iv) organizing and participating in meetings with
authorities and officials of the public institutions relevant to the PEFA exercise. In short, the
Monitoring Committee ensured that the assessment was conducted in a satisfactory manner and in
compliance with the Concept Note and the PEFA methodology.

The PEFA Colombia 2015 field mission was held in the city of Bogota, and began on November
12, 2015.

The Training Workshop on the PEFA methodology was held on November 23 and 24, 2015.2 Some
60 people participated in the workshop, including officials from all the directorates of MFPC
connected with the PEFA exercise, as well as representatives from other public institutions, such
as CGC, the Central Bank, NPD, the National Public Procurement Agency (NPPA), and the
ministries of Education, Health and Social Protection, and Transport, among others.

The work of collecting basic information/evidence necessary for the PEFA assessment was
performed between November 25 and December 18, 2015. Meetings with authorities and
designated officials of the most relevant institutions for the exercise were organized around the
schedule agreed between the assessment team and the Operational Monitoring Committee. At the
close of the field mission, the PEFA team had achieved substantive meetings with all public
institutions scheduled, including civil society organizations.

On December 11, 2015, an Operational Monitoring Committee meeting was held to review the
preliminary results of the PEFA Colombia 2015 assessment. This meeting, which was led by the
technical deputy minister of MFPC, Andres Escobar Arango, reviewed each of the proposed scores
for all the PEFA Performance Indicators (PIs) and discussed these on the basis of the evidence
collected. This presentation also assessed the performance changes that occurred since the PEFA
assessment conducted in 2009.

The preparation of this report was carried out in several stages, between January and August 2016.
A first draft of this document was submitted for the consideration of the peer reviewers on April
14, 2016 (see Table 1.1); on the basis of the comments submitted by the representatives of the
institutions involved in this process, including the PEFA Secretariat, WB, SECO, EU, and IDB,
the preparation the Draft Report was begun on May 16, 2016; the draft report was formally
submitted to the GoC on June 22, 2016. GoC comments, received between July 29 and August 9,
2016, were included in the present report. The Final Assessment Report was sent to the guest
reviewers on September 26, 2016, and the responses of all the comments made by all guest

1.3     Assessment Methodology

This Colombia PFM assessment was prepared with two versions of the PEFA methodology. The
field mission, training workshop, and initial formulation of this report, in line with the
Government’s request, as evidenced in the Concept Note, was conducted using the 2015 PEFA
methodology, in its trial version updated to January 2015.3 However, since the final version of the
new PEFA methodology was approved and published by the PEFA Secretariat as of February 1,
2016, a decision was made to prepare this report with this new version, known now as the 2016
PEFA methodology.4

The intention behind the decision to prepare the report using the 2015 PEFA methodology was to
have a PFM diagnosis as current as possible, up to the latest systematization of the standards
(benchmarks) established by international best practices. The 2016 version of the new PEFA
methodology provides this possibility and, although it does not differ substantively from the trial
version (2015), it requires special adjustments and additional evidence for the treatment of various
indicators. These settings are presented in detail in the document “Aligning the trial version wit h
the 2015 PEFA methodology.”5

Likewise, considering that this new version of the PEFA methodology, whether in its test version
(2015) or in its official version (2016), is not directly comparable to the methodology with which
the PEFA Colombia 2009 was performed, this assessment report, in agreement with the MFPC,

also includes an annotated annex (Annex 7), which compares the results achieved in 2009 with the
current performance, applying for both moments the 2011 version of the PEFA methodology.6

There was broad-ranging contact and exchange of views with the PEFA Secretariat in the
implementation of the 2016 PEFA methodology and alignment of the report to it.

Periods of analysis
This PEFA assessment was conducted in November and December of 2015, which is the cut-off
date for the assessment (see Table 1.2 for the periods of analysis used in accordance with the
methodological requirements defined for each indicator).

Materiality and relevance
The materiality and relevance of certain PFM performance aspects are important considerations in
many dimensions of the PEFA methodology. Except as otherwise provided, what follows are the
standard definitions that have been applied throughout the indicator set with respect to materiality
and relevance:

     • All refers to 90 percent or more (by value).
     • Most refers to 75 percent or more (by value).
     • Majority refers to 50 percent or more (by value).
     • Some refers to 25 percent or more (by value).
     • A few refers to less than 25 percent and more than 10 percent (by value).

Sources of information
Before starting the field mission, a general request was sent three weeks in advance for statistical
information and documentation necessary for the assessment of the 30 indicators of the PEFA
2015 testing methodology. This information was gradually collected during the field mission in
the work meetings that were scheduled with officials of the main national government entities
relevant to the PEFA Colombia 2015 exercise. Additional information for adapting the PEFA
Colombia 2015 report to the 2016 methodology was obtained at a later stage with the support of
the MFPC.

The work meetings during the field mission included visits to the three sector ministries that have
the greatest impact on the budget and are important to achieving the public policy objectives of
the current government: the Ministry of National Education (MED), the Ministry of Health and
Social Protection (MHSP), and the Ministry of Transportation (MT). The assessment team also
made a special effort to meet with civil society institutions that bring together the private sector
(e.g., Bogota Chamber of Commerce), so as to triangulate information on transparency and public
access to key fiscal information. A list of all those interviewed is presented in Annex 1.

                          2. BACKGROUND ON COLOMBIA

This section is descriptive in character and provides social and economic information on Colombia
and the fundamental characteristics of its PFM system. The aim is to provide context and facilitate
understanding of the PEFA assessment and progress of the ongoing reforms. The information was
collected from various publications and an analysis of current legislation describing the
institutional structure of the public sector and its relationship with Colombia’s PFM system.

2.1   Economic and Social Context

Colombia is located in northwestern South America, and has an estimated 2015 population of 48.2
million. It is the fourth-largest economy of South America, after those of Brazil, Argentina, and
Chile. Colombia has a substantial domestic market, a wealth of natural resources, and an average
annual economic rate growth from 2005 through 2014 of 4.8 percent, underpinned by a strong
macroeconomic framework (a scheme of inflation targeting, flexible exchange rate, fiscal
structural rule, and strong financial regulation) that has generated confidence in consumers and
investors, and that was also enhanced in recent years with advances in public safety and in peace
negotiations. The most dynamic sectors in this period were mining, construction, and financial
services.

Economic growth in 2015 was 3.1 percent, below the performance achieved in the previous three
years (4.4 percent in 2014, 4.9 percent in 2013, and 4.0 percent in 2012). This decline is mainly a
function of the adverse international context and a fall in the prices of major Colombian export
products, among them oil. Despite the strong adverse impacts of this situation on tax revenues, the
distribution of resources to local authorities, and the delivery of public services to the population,
the IMF judges it is unlikely that Colombia will be thrown into crisis given that the institutional
factors for growth (responsible fiscal policy, credible institutions, a healthy financial sector, and
favorable borrowing conditions) remain unchanged.7

Economic growth in recent years has been accompanied by a reduction in poverty. Monetary
poverty was reduced from 45 percent in 2005 to 29.5 percent of the population in 2014, moving
through 32.7 percent in 2012 and 30.6 percent in 2013. The incidence of extreme poverty also
experienced a decline from 10.4 percent in 2012 to 9.1 percent in 2013 and 8.1 percent in 2014.
These results, however, do not hide important differences at the territorial level and between rural
and urban areas. Poverty levels range from 65.9 percent of the population in the department of
Choco to 10.1 percent in the capital district of Bogota.

For a country with per capita GDP of about US$8,000, poverty levels remain relatively high. In
part, this is explained by the unequal distribution of income, as reflected in the Gini coefficient,
which is one of the highest in the world. Between 2005 and 2014 the Gini coefficient fell from
0.557 to 0.539; this value remained unchanged from 2012 through 2014.

The level of inflation in the country has remained within the target range (2-4 percent) established
by Central Bank (Banco de la Republica) in the three years of the analysis period, with 2.44 percent

in 2012, 1.94 percent in 2013, and 3.66 percent in 2014. However, toward the end of 2015, inflation
levels accelerated, reaching 6.77 percent at year’s end. The inflationary expectations have been
affected by the close to 60 percent appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Colombian peso
over the past two years. The deceleration of economic activity, resulting from the adverse
international situation, and the significant increase in inflation have had an adverse impact on fiscal
revenue collections, which consequent upon the application of fiscal rules,led to a reduction in
public spending between 2014 and 2015.

Colombia is not highly dependent on the production and export of oil, but its macroeconomic and
fiscal situation is not exempt from the effects of the changes in hydrocarbon prices that are
occurring; in 2015, Colombian exports declined 34.9 percent, mainly as a function of the 47.1
percent reduction in external sales of fuels and products from extractive industries.8 Highlighted
as a product of the change in oil prices is the reduction of foreign direct investment (FDI) generated
by lower foreign capital contributions targeted at mining and energy activity. In relation to
revenues for the national government, the effect of declining prices has affected income tax
revenues (including the ‘income tax for equality’ paid by companies in the sector), as well as
dividends paid to GoC by the state-owned enterprise Ecopetrol.

The sharp drop in oil prices has also generated adverse effects in terms of the current account
balance of payments and a reduction in the surplus on the capital account and the expected potential
growth in national income. These effects as a whole will test existing fiscal tools in the country
and are a complex challenge for the CoG in the immediate future and over the medium term, given
that resources will be required to meet the needs in social investment and infrastructure;
additionally, there will be a need to comply with structural deficit targets set out in the fiscal rule.

The fiscal results show a stable deficit between 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent of GDP in the three
years of the analysis period. These values are consistent with the fiscal rule established in
Colombia in 2011,9 which mandates a declining trend goal in the structural deficit for the Central
Government, from 2.3 percent to 1.9 percent or less for 2018, and 1.0 percent of GDP or less for
2022.

In these years, the deficit was financed incrementally by external debt, which increased its share
in total public debt from 0.1 percent of GDP to 0.8 percent, unlike domestic debt, whose share of
GDP declined from 2.2 percent to 1.6 percent between 2012 and 2014. Revenues also increased,
from 16.1 percent in 2012 to 16.6 percent in 2014; however, this is still below the increase in
public spending, which rose from 18.4 percent to 19.1 percent of GDP in the same period.

As indicated, 60 percent of the budget executed (total expenditure) in the three last years has been
allocated to three sectors: health, social protection, and labor; defense and police; and education.
The first group received almost 25 percent of the total budget executed, while the other two sectors
have remained slightly below 20 percent. An additional 20 percent of the budget is distributed
among the Treasury; social inclusion and reconciliation; and transportation, with the remaining 20
percent for the other sectors into which the public administration is organized.

The main components of the budget executed in Colombia are the transfers from the General
Budget of the Nation (GBN) to other entities, primarily to territorial entities but also to the
autonomous and decentralized institutions at the national level. (The reach of the GBN, and the
other budgetary entities and funding sources at the national level in Colombia, are discussed in
Section 2.3.) Transfers account for about 40 percent of GBN expenditures. The resources allocated
to public investment projects represent just over 20 percent of the budget executed, while the public
debt service, both internally and externally, takes a similar percentage. The wage bill has grown
steadily, reaching 12 percent in 2014, while spending on goods, services, and materials has
remained at about 4 percent of total expenditure.

level is composed of the Offices of Departmental Governors, Offices of Municipal Mayors, and
Special Districts, plus a number of decentralized territorial level state-owned institutions and
companies. The territorial organization, except for transfers to subnational governments (PI-7), is
not the subject of analysis of this assessment.
The national public sector consists of the central sector, the decentralized sector, and the
independent sector. The central sector is organized into five groups of institutions: (i) the
institutions of the legislative branch, which are the Senate and House of Representatives (together
forming the Congress of the Republic), (ii) the institutions of the executive branch, (iii) the
institutions of the judiciary, (iv) the oversight agencies, among which is the Office of the
Comptroller General of Colombia (CGC), and (v) electoral institutions.

The executive branch is centrally comprised of the Office of the President of the Republic, Sector
Ministries, Administrative Departments, Superintendence (i.e., oversight entities), Special
Administrative Units (which lack legal autonomy), Superior Administrative Councils, the National
Council for Economic and Social Policy (NCESP); the decentralized sector at the national level is
composed of state-owned industrial and commercial companies, Special Administrative Units
(which have legal autonomy), scientific institutes, and state health entities that are part of the social
security system.

Finally, there is an independent sector at the central level composed of entities under a special
regime granted by the Constitution, among which are the Central Bank, the autonomous university
entities, regional autonomous corporations, and the National Television Commission.

Colombia has a unitary government and is organized in territories, in 32 Departments, and 1,123
Municipalities. Departments are governed by elected governors, while municipalities have mayors
and municipal councils that are elected by popular vote. The country’s geographical diversity and
the historical process by which it has been populated has resulted in the formation of six regions
that, although not representing official jurisdictions, are recognized in the National Development
Plan 2014-2018: Caribbean, Plains, Pacific, Central-East, Central-South Amazonia, and Coffee
and Antioquia. Municipalities and departments in each region share common characteristics in
terms of climate, culture, and resources.

As noted, the Public Budget in Colombia is disaggregated in the General Budget of the Nation as
the budget of the State-Owned Enterprises and Mixed-Economy Partnerships; that of territorial
entities comprised of Governorships and Municipalities; and a special biennial budget for the
General Royalties System (GSRS). In Colombia, public investment has three sources of funding:
(i) the GBN, (ii) the General Royalties System, and (iii) the General Participation System
(GPS).
The General Budget of the Nation (GBN), under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and
Public Credit (MFPC), covers all central sector institutions and decentralized public
establishments at the national level. State-owned industrial and commercial companies at national
level, including those of a mixed economy (i.e., in which the Government owns a partial share of
the entity), have a separate budget, but which is also managed by the MFPC. The remaining public
institutions at the national and territorial levels manage their budgets individually and
independently, in the terms defined by law, with or without transfers from the Central Government.


                                                   13
The National Planning Department (NPD) is responsible for formulating and monitoring the
budget relating to public investments; the MFPC is responsible for establishing budgetary ceilings
for investments.

The main sectoral ministries in order of precedence are:

    (i)      Ministry of Interior and Justice
    (ii)     Ministry of Foreign Affairs
    (iii)    Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
    (iv)     National Ministry of Defense
    (v)      Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
    (vi)     Ministry of Social Protection
    (vii)    Ministry of Mining and Energy
    (viii)   Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism
    (ix)     National Ministry of Education
    (x)      Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development
    (xi)     Ministry of Communications
    (xii)    Ministry of Transportation
    (xiii)   Ministry of Culture

The administrative departments of greatest relevance are:

    (i)      Administrative Department of the Presidency of the Republic
    (ii)     National Planning Department (NPD)
    (iii)    Civil Service Administration Department (CSAD)
    (iv)     National Statistics Department (NSD)
    (v)      Administrative Department for Solidarity Economy (i.e., cooperatives).

The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is the governing body of the public finances
and is responsible for the dialogue with the Congress of the Republic with respect to all
programming, formulation, implementation, monitoring, and assessment of the budget. The
National Planning Department shares responsibility with the MFPC in programming, monitoring,
and assessment of the public investment budget, while the rest of the institutions that are part of
GBN are also key players in the budgeting process.

       •   Developing the quality and efficiency of internal control under the terms provided in
           the Constitution and the law.

2.4   PFM Legal Framework

The regulatory framework of the Colombian Economic Planning and Budgeting System is
determined and defined by constitutional and organizational rules. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 (Articles
332-364) of Title XII corresponding to the 1991 Constitution’s economic and public finance
regime, establishes the provisions regarding planning, budgets, and the distribution of resources
and responsibilities between the Nation and territorial entities. The following items are among the
main provisions:

       •   Article 334 charges the State with the general management of the economy within a
           framework of fiscal sustainability in which priority is given to social expenditures
       •   Article 338, together with item 12 of Article 150 and Articles 300 and 313, establishes
           that authority for the creation of taxes of territorial entities is exclusively limited to
           Congress


                                                 17
       •   Article 339 establishes the obligation that National Development Plan, as a planning
           instrument, must contain the social and economic programs that each Government
           intends to carry out during the period for which it was elected, and links these to
           medium- and long-term public investment budgetary scheduling within a framework
           that ensures fiscal sustainability
       •   Articles 345 to 355 set the rules for the formulation and submission of the budget
       •   Articles 356 to 364 establish by the GPS and the powers of local authorities.
In the performance of the aforementioned constitutional provisions a number of rules were
enacted, such as Law 179 of 1994 which introduced amendments to the Organizational Budget
Law 38 of 1989 to adapt it to procedures and rules on the budget contained in the Constitution;
Law 152 of 1994 (Organizational Law for the Development Plan), which regulates the content and
procedures for the adoption of Development Plans; and Law 225 of 1995, by which provisions
controlling budgetary reserves and payroll contributions, among others, were adjusted.

Law 225 grants the Government authority to compile budgetary regulations, from which Decree
111 of 1996, known as the Organization Budget Statute (OBS) was established, to prepare, submit,
approve, modify, and perform tracking, assessment, and implementation of the Budget. Its scope
covers the General Budget of the Nation, comprised of the national budget and budgets of public
institutions at the national level; setting financial goals of the entire public sector, and the
distribution of surplus funds of State-Owned Industrial and Commercial Enterprises.

Subsequently, regulations such as Law 617 of 2000, were enacted, which introduced rules that
limit operating expenditures to achieve fiscal recovery and rationalize the expenditures of
territorial entities affected at the time by the fiscal crisis; and Law 715 of 2001, which established
provisions to organize the delivery of education and health services, and which establishes rules
for allocating resources of the General Share Interest System and the powers of local authorities
for the use thereof.

In addition to these standards and under a broader concept of budget systems, Law 819 of 2003
(Transparency and Fiscal Responsibility) framed the budgeting process within the context of wider
macroeconomic variables (monetary, exchange, and credit policies), and introduced the rule by
which the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework was incorporated in the legal framework and fiscal
surplus and debt sustainability goals were set. Following this policy change, the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was included by means of Decree 4730 of 2005; this exercise
defines each sector’s expenditure limits for four years, within which an institutional space is
created to articulate the programming process in line with public policy and macroeconomic and
fiscal planning, with a results-oriented approach.

Complementing these rules, a fiscal rule was adopted for Colombia through Law 1473 of 2011,
which, as noted earlier, mandates a declining path in the structural deficit for the National
Government, to reach 1.0 percent of GDP or less by 2022. This fiscal rule is implemented through
the MTFF and operates as an automatic stabilizer to maintain levels of public expenditure that are
in line with long-term revenue levels. For the application of this rule, the law created a Fiscal
Committee that is independent and technical in character, composed of representatives from
universities, members of research centers, respected experts and consultants, and the presidents of
the Congressional Economic Affairs committees. The Fiscal Committee provides an opinion on


                                                 18
the methodology and basic parameters used for the operation of the fiscal rule, and on the detailed
report on compliance with the fiscal rule for the year immediately preceding, which the
Government must deliver in June of each year to the Congress’s Economic Affairs committees.

Law 1508 of 2012 was also enacted, establishing the legal regime for Public-Private Partnerships.
This rule seeks to facilitate collaboration between private business and the State for the execution
of public investments. Similarly, Law 1530 of 2012 established rules for the use of fiscal resources
from the exploitation of nonrenewable natural resources between local authorities—that is, the
GRS

Internal Control Framework
The legal framework in Colombia includes a wide range of rules related to the structure and
functioning of government internal control, which are not fully consistent with the international
best practice established by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(INTOSAI) and the pertinent document of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)
of the Treadway Commission.12 Internal Control in Colombia includes a regulatory framework
characterized by the Internal Control Law,13 the National Internal Control System,14 and the
Standard Internal Control Model (SICM).15

The Internal Control Law states that the integrated system is constituted by the organizational
scheme and all the plans, methods, principles, rules, procedures, and mechanisms of verification
and assessment adopted by an organization, for the purpose of seeking that all activities,
operations, and actions, and the administration of information and resources, are conducted in

   Law 87 of 1993 Internal Control Law, with partial modifications in 2000, 2002 and 2011.
14
   Law 489 of 1998, which in Chapter VI establishes the National System of Internal Control, and Decree 2145 of
1999, whereby rules are enacted for the National System of Internal Control of the agencies and entities of the Public
Administration at the national and territorial levels, replaced by Single Regulatory Decree of the Civil Service sector
1083 of 2015, Title 21 - Internal Control System.

accordance with the constitutional and legal rules in force within the policies set by the office of
the director and in consideration of the goals or objectives provided.

The Law includes the obligation to maintain and operate an Institutional Internal Control System
(IICS) as follows:

     “The establishment and development of the Internal Control System in organizations and
public bodies will be the responsibility of the Legal Representative or the corresponding highest-
ranking manager. However, the application of methods and procedures as well as the quality,
efficiency and effectiveness of internal control, shall also be the responsibility of the heads of each
of the various departments of entities and agencies.”
In technical terms, and to support the implementation of the law, in 2005 the SICM was issued,16
which was updated17 in 2014. The MECI is structured with (i) two modules: Planning and
Management Control, and Assessment and Monitoring Control, (ii) six components, (iii) 13
elements, and (iv) a cross-cutting axis focused on information and communication. This structure
does not conform to the COSO/INTOSAI best practices (as discussed in greater detail below in
Section 4.2).

In accordance with the existing legal and technical framework, Table 2.6 summarizes the
institutional structures established as part of the internal control framework, including their
respective roles and/or responsibilities.

                        3. ASSESMENT OF PFM PERFORMANCE

This section presents the results of the assessment of the main elements of the PFM system in
Colombia that are essential for its proper operation, as reflected in the indicators defined by the
PEFA methodology (2016 version). The results are shown indicator-by-indicator and are grouped
into the seven pillars that are used to report an assessment at the level of the Central Government.

3.1    Budget Reliability

This paragraph discusses the indicators PI-1 to PI-3 of the PEFA methodology that jointly assess
whether the budget prepared in Colombia at the Central Government level is executed as has been
programmed.

PI-1 Aggregate expenditure outturn

This indicator assesses whether the General Budget of the Nation (GBN),18 approved by the
Congress of the Republic of Colombia to finance the provision of public services and the
development of investment projects, undergoes changes or substantial deviations during the
implementation phase of these resources. The assessment is performed by comparing the budget
originally approved by Congress19—at the global or aggregate level—against the results of the
actual budget execution (accrual or obligations)20 at the end of the years 2012, 2013, and 2014, the
last three completed fiscal years.

The information used for the preparation of this indicator was provided by the Office of the
Director General, National Public Budget (DGNPB), through the Office of Deputy Director of
Budgetary Analysis and Consolidation, using data collected from the Integrated Financial
Information System (IFIS). The data received on total aggregate expenditure—programmed and
executed—were duly reconciled with the budget laws approved by Congress of the Republic for
the years of the analysis period, and with the Budget Execution Reports of the GBN submitted by
the Central Government.

1.1 Aggregate expenditure outturn

International best practice provides that the difference between planned expenditures and
expenditures effectively executed at the end of the fiscal effort should not be greater than 5 percent;
to the extent that there are extraordinary events that are not predictable, the methodology states
that the difference between the expenditure scheduled and executed can be more than 5 percent
established in one of the three years covered by the analysis period.


18
   In Colombia there are also public funds derived from the exploitation of non-renewable natural resources that are
allocated to the Central Government through a biennial budget, known as the General Royalties System (GSRS).
These resources are not considered in this assessment (and are small compared to the GBN).
19
   This budget refers to the budget approved in law by Congress prior to the start of the corresponding fiscal year. This
budget does not include any amendments that Congress might have incorporated during its execution.
20
   PEFA Methodology requires that Budget execution that budgeting execution is calculated from data from accrued
expense (i.e., obligations in the case of Colombia).


                                                          23
Table 3.1 shows the difference between aggregate expenditure outturn and executed for GBN for
the years 2012, 2013, and 2014, as a percentage of expenditure originally approved.

                         Table 3.1. Expenditure of the General Budget of the Nation,
                                    Programmed vs. Execution, 2012-2014

                                      Approved (A)        Executed (B)           B/A
                          2012           165,276,318          157,112,383         95.1%
                          2013           185,524,634          173,658,619         93.6%
                          2014           203,000,000          183,535,452         90.4%
                              Source: Internally compiled with data provided by DGNPB-MFPC, 2015.

As can be seen, in two of the three years, the deviation is greater than the critical threshold of 5
percent; however, in no case is the deviation greater than 10 percent.

The sub-execution of the budget is associated, in the first instance, with efforts to contain MFPC
expenditures that have emerged in the last two years of the analysis period to cope with the
slowdown in global growth and declining public revenue-generating activities in the country (see
PI-21.4). Similarly, consideration should also be given to the fact that in management of the
budget, expenditure commitments legally established during the fiscal period that fail to accrue
until December 31 of the same fiscal period, are recorded and transferred as reserves to the budget
for the next fiscal period and charged to the budget of the previous period (i.e., charged to the
budget that originated them).21

                                                            the analysis period.


PI-2 Expenditure composition outturn

This indicator assesses the extent to which public policy priorities, as reflected in the allocation of
expenditures by institutional, sectoral, functional, and economic categories in the GBN approved
by the Congress, are respected in the budgeting execution phase. It is also important in this
assessment to evaluate the use of the contingencies item to modify these priorities.
The assessment period covers the years 2012, 2013, and 2014, the last three completed fiscal
efforts. Statistical information for the assessment was provided by DGNPB of the MFPC and

derives from IFIS. These data are reported in Annex 2 in the format required by the 2016 PEFA
methodology.

2.1 Expenditure composition outturn by function

This dimension assesses the extent to which expenditure allocations between different public
policy priorities at the time of approval of the budget are respected during the implementation
phase. International best practice provides that the overall variation between the programmed
distribution and distribution effectively executed, reflected in the allocations of expense categories
and items of functional or programmatic administrative classification (sector), and should not
exceed 5 percent in total. To accommodate unforeseen events, the methodology requires that this
percentage is not exceeded in two of three years covered by the analysis period.

To apply the methodology to the case of Colombia, the institutional/sectoral classification was
used as reference for allocation of expenditures. The variance calculated for the years 2012, 2013,
and 2014 is presented in Table 3.2.

         Table 3.2. Total Change in the Composition of Programmed and Executed Expenditures
                            by Institutional/Sectoral Classification, 2012-2014

                                                           Deviation
                                      2012                       6.1%
                                      2013                       5.6%
                                      2014                      14.2%
                           Source: Internally compiled with data provided by DGNPB-MFPC, 2015.



Global deviations in the composition of institutional/sectoral expenditures exceed 5 percent in the
three years evaluated, but in two of these years the variance does not exceed 10 percent. This
indicates that the relative priorities of Central Government institutions reflected in the
appropriations originally approved in the budget suffer some significant changes in the
implementation phase, but remain within acceptable limits at the level of international practice.

The main element of distortion in all years assessed has been the sub-execution of the resources
originally allocated to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC); this is largely a function
of the programming of expenditure items that are incorporated into the institutional budget to be
transferred to other institutions only if conditions are appropriate to expand public expenditures.

2.2 Expenditure composition outturn by economic classification

The methodology also requires that the overall change in the composition of expenditure does not
exceed 5 percent between programmed and executed at the level of categories of economic
classification. The data calculated for the three years of the analysis period is presented in Table
3.3.

                                   by Economic Classification, 2012-2014
                                           Year                Global
                                                           Deviation
                                       2012                     4.4%
                                       2013                     7.6%
                                       2014                     3.8%
                              Source: Internally compiled with data provided by DGNPB-MFPC, 2015.



The calculation of the variance in the composition of spending by categories of economic
classification does not exceed the threshold of 5 percent set by international best practices in two
of the three years of the analysis period, showing a commitment commensurate with the objectives
of public policy as adopted in the original budget. Deviations between categories of economic
classification are generally small and no single item stands out in particular.

2.3 Expenditure from contingency reserves

Finally, international best practice recognizes that although it is prudent to include resources in the
budget to meet expenses arising from unforeseen events in the form of a line item for
“contingencies” or “non-earmarked,” their amount should not affect the credibility of the overall
budget, and the amounts charged against these items must be transferred explicitly to specific line
items that generate the required expenditure. That is to say, the expenditure should not be charged
directly to the contingency line item or, where applicable, it must not exceed 3 percent of the
original budget.

In the case of Colombia, the GBN does not show a contingency line item in any of the three years
of the analysis period.

PI-3 Revenue outturn

This indicator assesses the practice that exists in Colombia for incorporating revenue in the GBN,
and whether these provisions are adequate or require revisions/substantive amendments during the
implementation phase. The information used for the assessment of this indicator is that existing
for the past three years with completed tax efforts: 2012, 2013, and 2014. The information on
revenue programmed and executed in the budget comes from IFIS and was provided by the
DGNPB of the MFPC; it has been verified against the respective budget laws and budget execution
report (see Annex 2).

3.1 Aggregate revenue outturn

International best practice establishes that accurate revenue forecasts are a key input to the
preparation of a credible budget. In this sense, the methodology states that the provision
(programming) of revenue included in the budget should not be underrun by more than 3 percent
or overrun by more than 6 percent. The asymmetry in these values is explained by the fact that the
government becomes more committed by including optimistic forecasts of revenue that cannot be
achieved in the year and that subsequently result in spending cuts or increased government debt.
Also, as in previous cases, the methodology recognizes the possibility that the observed deviations
are not linked to the quality of the projections, but to unforeseen events. For this reason, the
assessment can exclude an unusual year, taking into account only two of the three years of the
analysis period.

Table 3.4 shows revenue projections included in the GBN for the three years of the analysis period,
compared with the results actually executed.

The data show that deviations between programming and execution of budgeting revenues in two
of the three years exceed the limit of 3 percent set by international best practice for revenue
underruns. In two of these years, however, the underrun is maintained below 6 percent.

3.2 Revenue composition outturn

The methodology also requires that the overall change in the composition of revenue does not
exceed 5 percent between programmed and executed, using a broad enough disaggregation of
revenues to establish the existing institutional capacity in the Government to plan properly the

calculated using this information for the three years of the analysis period is presented in Table

The calculation of the variance in the composition of revenue exceeds 10 percent in the three years
of the analysis period, but is less than 15 percent in two of the three years. These results show a
reduced institutional capacity to forecast revenues and/or raise them according to plan. The
changes introduced in this period to the national tax system partly explain these deviations.

3.2   Transparency of Public Finances

This section discusses the indicators PI-4 to PI-9, which jointly evaluate whether public finances
are universal in scope, are consistent, and whether the public has access to key information.

PI-4 Budget classification

This indicator assesses the extent to which the budget classifications used for formulation,
execution, and reporting, as well as the catalogue of the chart of accounts, are consistent with
international standards. Its scope is the Central Government budget and the period taken as a
reference is the last fiscal year ended (FY14).

4.1 Budget classification

International best practices establish that the formulation, execution, and reporting of the budget
should be organized based on each level of administrative, economic, and functional




                                                           28
classifications,22 and by programs with a disaggregation to the sub-functional level.23 Similarly,
budget classifications and accounting should be applied in a reliable and consistent manner, to
ensure that financial information and all transactions can be reported reliably across any of the
classifications.

In Colombia, the existing system of classifiers exhibits some conceptual differences with
international standards, and functional and economic classifications are used for programming and
budget formulation stage, but not for the execution phase. Nor are they used for submission of
budget reports. The following classifiers are currently used.

Institutional Classifier:24 The institutional classification is limited to expenses and is presented
separately for the budgets corresponding to the judicial branch, the legislative branch, the Attorney
General’s Office, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Ombudsman, the Office of the Comptroller
General of Colombia, the National Civil Registry (which includes the National Electoral Council,
each of the ministries, administrative departments, and public institutions), the National Police,
and the servicing of public debt.25

This classification uses a non-sectored list of public entities that is inconsistent with the
classification of the Central Government established in the 2014 Public Finance Statistics
Manual.PFSM)

Economic classifier:26 The economic classification is subdivided into five components: revenues
and capital resources, expenditures and capital investments, financing sources, applications, and
budgetary outcomes.

The revenue component for classification considers the permanence character of revenues,
categorizing them as occasional or permanent, and also the condition of destination, which can be
free or restricted. Capital resources include revenues derived from the sale of goods and capital
contributions and capital transfers without consideration. With respect to expenditures, these are
divided into current expenditures, property expenditures, financial expenditures, commercial and
industrial operational expenditures, subsidies, and current transfers.

The capital investments category is divided into acquisition, construction or improvement of real
nonfinancial assets, and capital transfers. The funding application category records amortizations
of internal and external public debt, placements of financial instruments, and granting of loans.

This classifier is used only at the stage of formulation and programming of the budget.27 It neither
accounts for execution nor is used for reporting.



22
   Classification of Government Functions (CGF)—10 main functions at the highest level and 69 functions at the
second level (sub-functional), United Nations.
23
   To be accepted as a best practice, it needs to be applied with a level of detail at least corresponding to the sub-
functional classification.

Functional Classifier:28 This classification is divided into 12 functions in its main categories,
which do not fully follow the Classification of Government Functions Classifier (CFG), given that
it modifies, for example, the category of economic affairs, which for the Colombian case has been
divided into (i) promotion and regulation of economic development, and (ii) basic infrastructure,
production, and delivery of financial services. Other differences, also seen at the sub-functional
level, modify certain items in part of the functional categories.

The use of the functional classifier is limited to the formulation and budget programming phases
and is not used in that of execution or for reporting. A table of equivalence is employed against
the other classifiers for their use.

Classifier by object of expenditure: This classifier is the basis of the information system and is
one of the main inputs to generate other aggregate classifications. It is divided into operating
expenditures, which in turn is divided into staff expenditures, overheads, current transfers, capital
transfers, and marketing and production expenditures; and servicing of debt, which is divided into
servicing of domestic debt and servicing of foreign debt.

Classifier of revenues by line item:29 Under this classification, revenues are divided into current
revenue, capital resources, payroll taxes, and special funds. Current revenue is classified under
fiscal (i.e., subdivided into direct and indirect taxes) and non-fiscal (i.e., fees and fines) rubrics.
Capital resources comprise balance resources, the resources of internal and external credit,
financial returns, the exchange rate differential, donations, financial surplus, decentralized entities,
and profits of the Central Bank. Payroll contributions30 are classified separately, as are special
funds.31

Under this classifier, the revenues and resources of Colombia’s public sector entities are classified
separately and are divided into own revenues, current revenue, and capital resources.

Classifier of Investment expenditures:32 Investment expenditures are disaggregated at the level
of programs and sub-programs in the annual budget law and to project or sub-project levels in the
settlement decree. It is noteworthy that the concept of investment in Colombia is not limited to
spending on infrastructure and equipment, but may in certain circumstances include social
investments, operating costs, or current related projects, such as salaries of relevant personnel or
maintenance of facilities.33

Information on expenditures of investment projects is not disaggregated by object of expenditure,
which limits the ability to generate consistent information for other classifiers.

Other classifiers: There is a regional investment classifier that identifies the departments where
each project funded by the Nation is located and a sectoral classifier which groups public entities
in 18 sectors and subsectors. The source of financing of expenditures and the type of resource

(current, capital, special fund, donation, parafiscal rents, etc.) is identified, as is the origin of the
source between revenues of the Nation or own resources of public sector entities of the Nation.

The General Chart of Accounts34 in force has an accounts structure that is different from that
developed in the Public Finance Statistics Manual (2014), and there is neither an economic
classification that can be aligned with the accounting system, nor a full correspondence with the
budget classifiers used in the implementation stage, such as the object of the expenditure, the
investment, or the revenue classifier by line item. This lack of relationship affects the generation
and reliability of financial reporting, as it requires many manual adjustments with a high risk of
error and complexity in the process.

A feature of the budgetary process in Colombia that affects classifications is the peculiarity of
existing institutional arrangements, with a different governing body for each phase of the budget
process, which generates standards and processes that are not yet fully integrated. These are the
National Planning Department (NPD), the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC), the
General Accounting Office (GAO), and the Office of the Comptroller General of Colombia (CGC).

Although a table of equivalence between budget classifiers is used to generate information
organized by economic and functional classifications, conceptual differences arise, such as that
existing in the investment budget, which not only covers infrastructure expenditures and
equipment, but also includes current expenditures such as salaries of the personnel concerned or
maintenance of facilities.

In addition, there is a limitation in the data, as investment projects currently are not disaggregated
by object of expenditure to enable equivalency in a fully consistent manner.35

Other important differences between the methodology of fiscal statistics in Colombia and
international standards are the studies and assessments made on the budget classifications,
including those that are mentioned in (i) the time of registration; (ii) the coverage and institutional
classification; (iii) coverage, line items, and classification of accounts; (iv) the definitions of
economic line items; (v) the analytical framework and the corresponding income items; and (vi) a
reconciliation of flows and balances.36

PI-5 Budget documentation

This indicator assesses whether the budgeting documentation (i.e., the draft annual budget and
supporting documentation, as presented to Congress) contains all the information necessary for
proper review, scrutiny, and approval. The assessment is made on the basis of the draft budget for
fiscal 2016 (prepared and submitted during 2015).

The Organizational Budget Statute in Title VII, “From the presentation of the draft budget to
Congress,” provides that the Government shall deliver to the Legislature each year during the first
week of April, the draft annual budget of revenues and expenditures, the final version of which is
to be submitted on July 20 of the corresponding year. This presentation is the responsibility of the
MFPC and shall contain the draft revenues, expenses, and taxable income. The draft revenue
budget bill should also include an annex accompanying the presidential message, with details of
its composition.37

In compliance with these provisions, the draft budget contains, on the revenue side, the estimation
of (i) current revenue, (ii) payroll contributions administered by an entity of the budget, (iii) special
funds, (iv) capital resources, and (v) revenue of public entities at the national level. On the
expenditure side, appropriations are listed for public national entities, distinguishing between
operating expenditures, servicing of public debt, and investment expenditures. Finally, the general
provisions intended to guide the proper performance of the GBN are also presented.

In conjunction with the text of the budget, they are included as annexes with (i) details of the
composition of income and capital resources, and (ii) a disaggregation of social expenditures. The
Presidential Message completes the set of documents submitted to Congress for consideration of
the draft budget bill. The content of the presidential message must, according to the rule,38 include
the following:

The submission of the draft budget bill for fiscal 2016 strictly complies with all these legal
requirements. However, to comply with international best practices established in the assessment
methodology it must also meet the following criteria, divided between basic and additional.39

5.1 Budget documentation

The methodology establishes that to achieve international best practices, the Government must
submit to the Legislature for consideration of the draft budget bill all the documentation described
in the section “basic elements” and at least six of the additional elements. The budgeting process
in Colombia complies with this standard.

PI-6 Central Government Operations not included in financial reports

This indicator assesses whether the revenue and expenditure operations of the Central Government
that are not included in the GBN and that are also not reported regularly in ex-post financial reports
are significant compared to the total budget expenditure. These revenue and expenditure operations
recorded in the GBN are normally executed through extra-budgetary entities that are defined as
those that drive government policy and therefore respond to the government, but which by law
have their own budget, their own income (including specific central government transfers),
management autonomy, and discretion over the volume and composition of their expenditures.40

The assessment of this indicator is scoped to the Central Government and the assessment is made
on the basis of the information available in 2014, the most recent completed fiscal year. The data

on revenue and extra-budgetary expenditures were provided by the General Accounting Office
(GAO) and from the work done in conjunction with the MFPC to prepare the Annual Survey of
Government Finance Statistics (ASGFS), a document that reports to IMF in line with the
provisions of the Public Finance Statistics Manual (2014). The report identifies 103 entities that
have revenue or expenses that are not recorded partially or fully in the GBN (see Annex 3 for a
list of extra-budgetary entities).

Best PFM practices stipulate that all revenue and expenditures that support government operations
should be recorded in the budget, but otherwise these extra-budgetary operations must, at least, be
reported in the financial reports prepared by the Central Government to account for the use and
allocation of public funds. The international standard used to measure performance in this matter
establishes that income and expenditure not included in financial reports must be less than 1
percent of total budget expenditures. In addition, these operations must be reported in financial
reports submitted to the Central Government in a regular and timely manner.

6.1 Expenditure outside financial reports

Expenditure operations conducted by the 103 extra-budgetary units within the Central Government
are presented in Table 3.6.

The 103 extra-budgetary entities reported 3.3 percent of their expenditures accumulated over
budget and 96.7 percent is executed outside the GBN. Consequently, the budget spending accounts
for 9.7 percent of total expenditure executed in 2014 at the Central Government level. However,
of the 103 extra-budgetary entities identified, only two do not report their expenses to the CG, one
because it legally has no obligation to do so and the second by default. The calculation made by
the GAO shows that this omission equates to about 0.002 percent of total expenditure executed by
the Central Government.

The 103 extra-budgetary entities receive 60.6 percent of their revenue through GBN transfers,
while 39.4 percent are own revenues that are not recorded in the budget. This implies that extra-
budgetary revenue represents only 5.1 percent of income executed by the Central Government in
2014. Of this total, the GAO estimated that less than 0.002 percent is not included on regular
financial reports.

6.3 Financial reports of extrabudgetary units

With the exception of two entities, whose participation is insignificant in the total revenue and
extra-budgetary expenditure, the remaining group of entities submits to the GAO, at least annually,
detailed financial reports within three months of the end of the relevant fiscal year.

PI-7 Transfers to subnational governments

This indicator assesses the extent to which fiscal relations between the Central Government and
the entities into which the territory of Colombia is distributed administratively—32 Departmental
Governments, 1,123 Municipal Governments, 4 Special Districts (such as the capital district of
Bogota), and established indigenous territories—are transparent and executed in a predictable and
timely fashion. The assessment is made based on information available for the fiscal year 2014,
the most recent completed year at the time of the assessment.

Fiscal relations between the Central Government and local authorities are defined in the
Constitution of Colombia, especially the Articles on the distribution of powers and resources
between levels of government.41 From these constitutional provisions, the law provides for two
types of transfers of resources from the Central Government to local authorities: (i) the transfer of
current revenues of the Nation, which is done through a mechanism named the GPS,42 and (ii) the
transfer of resources from royalties from the exploitation of non-renewable natural resources,
called General Royalties System (GSRS).43 A third source of intergovernmental transfer resources
is co-financed investment projects, which must be enrolled in the GBN and harmonized in national
and regional development plans.

The participation of the GPS, the GGSR, and co-financed investment projects in transfers from the
Central Government to local authorities in 2014 is depicted in Table 3.8.

The main transfer of the Central Government to territorial entities in Colombia is the GPS. In 2014
the total amount of these transfers was CoP 28.7 billion; equivalent to 26 percent of current
revenues of the Nation and 71.8 percent of all transfers made. The GGSR allocated for 2013-2014
is CoP 17.7 billion, an amount that has been split in half to estimate the allocation in 2014. This

amount represents 22.0 percent of total transfers. Finally, the amount of co-financing of investment
projects is CoP 2.5 billion or 6.2 percent of total transfers.

     7.1 Transfer allocation system

International best practices on the transfer of resources from the Central Government to
subnational governments do not establish specific criteria on the total amounts transferred that
should be made available to the latter (vertical allocation), but they determine that the distribution
between the different subnational governments (horizontal allocation) should be clearly normed
and defined by rules or formulas with relevant and easy to use calculation variables to ensure
transparency and predictability over the medium term. In the opinion of the methodology, at least
90 percent of the funds transfer must meet this requirement.

In the case of Colombia, the transfers made to territorial entities, both within the GPS framework
and that of the GSR are clearly normed and established from known rules of allocation and relevant
and measurable calculation variables. The transfers in respect to co-financing of public investment
projects in the territories, despite having Congressional approval, do not meet this specific
requirement. However, to the extent that the participation of the GPS and GSR exceed 90 percent
of the total transfers made to territorial entities in 2014, national practice is in line with
international best practice.

The resources allocated to departments, municipalities, and districts under the GPS are destined
for the provision of services in four areas: (i) education (receiving 58.5 percent of the total
available resources), (ii) health (24.5 percent), (iii) drinking water and basic sanitation (5.4
percent), and (iv) general purpose (11.6 percent). The allocation criteria among territorial entities
are indexes that combine variables of population served, coverage gaps, incidence of poverty, and
administrative and tax efficiency in each of these sectors. Annually, the National Council for
Economic and Social Policy (NCESP) approves and publishes the distribution of GPS resources
among territorial entities prepared by the NPD.44

Distribution formulas of GSR resources are set in the biennial budget laws for GSR.45

Tax revenue from the exploitation of non-renewable natural resources are distributed directly to
territorial entities that produce them (direct allocations), and indirectly to the rest of the
Departments, Municipalities, and Districts, through the following funds: (i) Pension Savings of
Territorial Entities, (ii) Science, Technology and Innovation Fund, (iii) Regional Development
Fund, and (iv) Regional Compensation Fund. The resources available to each of these funds are
established in the regulations of the GSR, but the distribution of resources among different
territorial entities is calculated on the basis of criteria of population and unmet basic needs (NBI).46

    7.2 Timeliness of information on transfers

International best practices provide that transfers to subnational governments should be made as
early as possible under the regular budget calendar and at least four to six weeks prior to the date
when these entities must complete their budget preparation.

In Colombia there is a regulatory framework and clear instructions outlining the criteria for
territorial entities to project with considerable certainty and prior to the preparation and approval
of their budgets, transfers receivable from the Central Government. However, the allocation of
transfer resources is not managed under the regular budget calendar, and territorial entities do not
have the exact and total transfer amounts at least four to six weeks prior to the date of approval of
the budget.

PI-8 Performance information for service delivery

The purpose of this indicator is to assess the nature and use made of the annual performance
information included in the budget in their supporting documents, and in regular reports of budget
execution. Performance information that is valued are the “products” that are delivered and/or the
“results” obtained in or with the provision of public services, as well as the existence of instruments
for monitoring and/or assessment available to verify compliance with the proposed goals. The
analysis considers the Central Government and the available information is evaluated for 2014,
the most recent completed fiscal year.

The 2014-18National Development Plan (NDP) “Todos por un Nuevo País”, (All for a New
Country) establishes objectives, strategies, and goals (and in some cases, products) to advance to
the achievement of peace, equity, and education in Colombia. The cross-cutting strategies
proposed to underpin these achievements are (i) competitiveness and strategic infrastructure,
(ii) social mobility, (iii) transformation of the rural areas, (iv) security, justice, and democracy for
the construction of peace, and (v) good governance. Targets and indicators are clearly defined for
each of the strategic objectives and such products as have been identified. Monitoring of indicators




                                                    40
and targets, associated strategic objectives, as well as progress reporting are done on a regular
basis, both to the Executive Branch and Congress.

However, the objectives, goals and results of NPD are not yet articulated with the GBN because
the budget is built in an institutional fashion and is not disaggregated by functions47 or programs
that reflect or establish production targets and/or expected results for this institutional production
in line with established development objectives. In recent years, the lack of coordination between
planning and the budget has been partly addressed by the addition of programs and projects to the
public investment budget, which are better aligned with the objectives of the NDP and represent
21 percent of total public spending in 2014. It is also important to note that during the field mission
it was found that both the NPD and the MFPC are working in coordinated fashion to improve
plan/budget articulation.

8.1 Performance for service delivery

The PEFA methodology provides that information on expected performance in the provision of
public services, including key “product” indicators, as well as “outcome” indicators, disaggregated
by programs or functions, should be available in the budget (or supporting documents) that all
sector ministries that are providers of public services must submit.

To the extent that the GBN in Colombia is not prepared on the basis of functional and/or
programmatic structures, none of the ministries, including sector ministries providing public
services, include information on targets and indicators of outputs or outcomes in the programming
and submission of their institutional budgets, except in the case of public investment projects.

8.2 Performance achieved for service delivery

International best practices also require that sector ministries that provide public services publish
annual information on the number of outputs produced and the results achieved in budgeting
documents that are compatible with the formats in which the programming of the performance
indicators was presented.

The budget execution reports do not report performance information for any of the ministries, nor
for products or for results. The only documents containing performance data are prepared by the
NPD to report the progress made by public institutions in achieving the objectives of the National
Development Plan, but these are not articulated with the GBN, even though they are part of the
investment budget.

8.3 Resources received by service delivery units

International best practice suggests that the governing agencies or heads of units providing front-
line services (e.g., schools or health centers) should collect information on a regular basis and at



47
  The GBN is grouped and reported by functional classification for submission to Congress for informational
purposes.


                                                    41
least once a year on the resources effectively received by them, disaggregated by the source of this
funding. This information must be compiled and published annually.

The assessment performed in Colombia was unable to find evidence that this information is
collected or has been collected systematically over the last three years (2012, 2013, and 2014) for
any of the ministries queried (Ministry of Health and Social Protection, and National Ministry of
Education). This information, with the mandated characteristics, could not be collected from the
Treasury or the Public Information Consolidator (CHIP).

8.4 Performance assessments for service delivery

Independent assessments on the efficiency and effectiveness of public services should be
performed and published, in accordance with international best practice, at least once every three
years in all the most significant or relevant ministries.

In Colombia, performance assessments have been performed since 2006 through an annual
schedule of assessments approved by the NPD. The assessments are of four types:
(i) institutional (legal), (ii) operational, (iii) on results, and (iv) on impact. They are conducted by
specialized external consultants hired through competitive processes. Between 2012 and 2014, 53
independent assessments were produced covering almost all the ministries responsible for the
provision of public services. The assessment reports are published48 and their recommendations
are managed with the competent authorities (through a recommendations management matrix).

PI-9 Public access to fiscal information

This indicator assesses the ease of access that the population has to key fiscal information
generated by the Central Government. Transparency of information is assessed on the basis of
availability and ease of access to relevant documentation by the population49 and on the timeliness
with which it is published. The assessment data come from information available for tax efforts in
2014 (most recent completed fiscal year) and 2015 (current budgeting year in force).

The legal and regulatory framework for public access to information generated by the State is
given in Colombia by Law 1712 on transparency and the right of access to public information,
which has formally been in force since September 6, 2014. The objective of this law is to regulate
the right of access to public information, the procedures for the exercise and guarantee of this right,
and the exceptions to the disclosure of information.50 The law is comprehensive in terms of its
objective, scope, mandatory minimum information that state agencies must make available to the
public, the means through which information is to be publicized, direct consultation procedures,
penalties for noncompliance, and exceptions to public access to information.




49
   Unless specifically justified in national law, public access to key fiscal information will be defined as the publication
in the official computer portals of relevant institutions. Access to the information on these sites will not be restricted,
no registration shall be required nor will it entail cost.

3.3    Management of Assets and Liabilities

The PI-10 to PI-13 indicators jointly assess the effective management of public assets and
liabilities. That is, these indicators seek to establish that there is an optimal use of the resources
available to the State, through more efficient public investments, financial investments that
generate adequate returns, disposal of fixed assets following clear rules, contracting of debt that
minimizes the costs associated with its service, and proper monitoring of existing tax risks in order
to take appropriate mitigation measures promptly.

PI-10 Fiscal risk reporting

This indicator measures the extent to which fiscal risks affecting the Central Government (CG) are
reported or disclosed. Fiscal risks can arise from adverse macroeconomic situations, financial
positions of subnational governments (SNGs), or state-owned companies or corporations (SOEs),52
and contingent liabilities from the CG’s own programs and activities, including extra-budgetary
units. They may also be related to other external and implicit risks, such as market failures and
natural disasters. For this assessment, the year 2014 is taken as the critical period.

The information used for the preparation of this indicator was provided mainly by (i) the Office of
the Director General for Fiscal Support, (ii) the Office of Deputy Director, Risk and the Office of
Deputy Director for Investment Banking of the Office of the Director General of Public Credit and
the National Treasury, (iii) the General Accounting Office (GAO), and (iv) the opinion of the
Office of the Comptroller General of Colombia (CGC) with respect to fiscal management for the
year 2014.

  The public corporations subsector consists of “all resident Corporations controlled by general government units or
other public corporations”; see page 412 of the Fiscal Statistics Manual 2014 of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).

10.1 Monitoring of state-owned companies or corporations

International best practice provides that the annual audited Financial Statements (FS) of all SOEs
must be published within six months after the end of the relevant fiscal year. Likewise, the CG
annually publishes a consolidated report on the financial performance of such corporations.

SOEs in Colombia are composed of Regional Autonomous Corporations, the Central Bank and
other financial institutions under majority control of the Government, Autonomous University
Entities, Single Nature Entities, National Civil Service Commission and National Television
Authority, State-Owned Social Enterprises, State-Owned Public Utilities, State-Owned Industrial
and Commercial Companies, and Mixed-Economy Partnerships.

In Colombia there is no rule that each SOE publish its audited FSFS, except for a limited number
such as those required by the nature of their operations, those of the financial sector, or specific
regimes, utilities, and other companies that are registered in the Chambers of Commerce as
commercial companies. In fact, there is no standard or requirement that generalizes the obligation
of the SOE to publish its audited FS and therefore no specific deadlines for doing so.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the majority of entities send their FS for consolidation by the GAO,
and their accounting data are available in the Treasury and Public Information Consolidator
(CHIP) systems, but not in a consolidated FS format as originally authorized by each entity’s
representative mandated to sign off on the financial statement.

Where appropriate, the Office of Deputy Director of the Office of the Director General for Public
Credit and National Treasury has the responsibility to track the financial situation of the SOEs that
are partially owned by the GoC.53 Public Sector Consolidated FSs are produced annually by the
GAO, but not a specific consolidated report on the financial performance of the SOE.

10.2 Monitoring of subnational governments

By law, the Central Government must annually submit to Congress, and the public in general,
reports on the fiscal viability of the departments and the fiscal performance of municipalities.
These reports are published by the MFPC and the National Planning Department (NPD) on their
websites. Similarly, a quarterly monitoring of fiscal performance of territorial finance is
undertaken through the Office of the Directorate General for Fiscal Support (DGFS). The result of
this monitoring is discussed within the MFPC as inputs for coordinating macro-financial
programming, which the Central Government regularly conducts in coordination with the Central
Bank as mandated by Law 31 of 1992.

DGFS biannually publishes Fiscal Viability Reports of the departments, capital municipalities, and
a sample of other municipalities (not departmental capitals) under fiscal disencumbrance
programs. The NPD publishes an annual ranking of fiscal performance for the universe of
territorial entities, as well as evaluating overall performance for all municipalities. Sectoral
ministries and the NPD also publish annually a categorization of risk in the use of GPS resources
and public hospitals. Also, quarterly, the Central Bank and the Office of the Director General for
Macroeconomic Policy perform the calculation of the fiscal balance of the sector known as
53
     Article 39 of Decree 4712 of 2008, by which the TSA is partially regulated.


                                                           47
“regional and local,” which can be found in the Consolidated Public Sector closing documents,
employing the methodology called “below the line” or financing (change in net financial assets).

The fiscal risks that SNGs can generate to the CG have largely been controlled by a set of rules on
fiscal accountability (transparency, accountability, and sustainability), public debt, and
commitments for future fiscal periods and for handling insolvencies for territories. The SNGs are
legally authorized to undertake public credit operations, under the parameters of specific rules.
The decrees regulating these rules, along with departmental and municipal regime codes and rules
of prudential financial regulation (basic legal, accounting, and financial circulars of the Financial
Superintendence) form a legal framework regulating the contracting of public debt in SNGs and
their decentralized entities for services.

The CG cannot guarantee domestic debt operations of territorial entities, unless a national law so
provides. At present there is no law that gives such powers. The Central Government may grant to
territorial entities guarantees to contract external debt, but must do so complying with a rigorous
approval process. Additionally, they must make a technical justification of the investment project
to be financed with those resources. In this justification they must demonstrate the expected effects
of each project on the economic development of their jurisdictions, in line with their Development
Plan.

It has been verified that all the SNGs published their unaudited FSs through the CHIP portal
http://www.chip.gov.co/schip_rt/index.jsf, but individual audit reports are not published for the
majority of SNGs.

10.3 Contingent liabilities and other fiscal risks

Best practice requires that the CG publish an annual report that quantifies and consolidates
information on significant contingent liabilities and other risks.

In accordance with the rules in force noted in the discussion of the 10.2 dimension, state agencies
identify their risks and assess the respective contingent liabilities. In this context, the National
Council for Economic and Social Policy defines the State’s Contractual Risk Policy. The Office
of the Director General for Public Credit and National Treasury (DGPCNT) of MFPC approve the
evaluations of contingent liabilities and conducts periodic monitoring of the evolution of the risks
covered by the Contingency Fund. In addition, the DGPCNT, and in particular the Office of
Deputy Director, Risk has specific functions related to contingent liabilities. Monitoring of
contingent liabilities of government programs is performed through specialized technical guides,
including quantitative analysis.54

For the consolidation and issuance of reports on contingencies, where the risks of government
projects are recorded, the Office of Deputy Director, Risk complies with the task of evaluating
contingent liabilities with a view to drafting the approvals for the DGPCNT, particularly in areas
such as public-private partnerships contracts and public credit operations.

In the case of natural disasters, in accordance with the National Development Plan “Prosperity for
All 2010-2014,” the “Public financial management policy strategy in the face of risk of natural
disasters,” targeted reducing contingent liabilities related to risk of disaster from natural
phenomena and the management of the resulting fiscal risk for these events.

The report on the evaluations of contingent liabilities for infrastructure contracts, public credit
operations, sentences, reconciliations, and for callable capital are made publicly available5538
(Chapter 7, inexplicit and contingent liabilities).

The CGC in its report on the audit of the 2014 Public Treasury General Balance, included
objections to tax assessments related to the Pension Liability and Public Debt, especially those that
have been reiterative during the audit processes of the Central Level General Balance for the last
three fiscal years, as part of their exercise of ex-post control of providing an opinion on the
financial statements. Concerns were expressed on issues of pension liability, especially on
updating, disclosure, and amortization of pension liabilities, and the value of other accounts
affected by accounting uncertainties that give rise to concerns about the reliability or completeness
of the methods and reports used for contingencies arising from significant CG operations.

PI-11 Public investment management

The indicator evaluates the economic assessment, selection, costing, and monitoring of public
investment projects of the government, with emphasis on the largest and most important projects.
The scope is the Central Government and the critical period is the last completed fiscal year (i.e.,
2014). For purposes of this indicator’s evaluations, the 10 largest projects by nominal cost for each
of the sectors’ projects were used as points of reference.

In Colombia there are two Government-administered project databanks: one for the resources of
the General Royalties System (which given the scope of the PEFA methodology will not be
considered, given that the resources are from sources other than those of the General Budget of
the Nation), and the other for GBN, which will be the subject of assessment across its projects,
methodologies, and tracking system.

11.1 Economic analysis of investment proposals

Best practices with which this dimension is assessed state that in formulating projects economic
analysis is conducted as set forth in national guidelines, and the projects and their results are
published for major investments. It is also stated that the analyses are reviewed by an entity that is
distinct from that promoting the project.

Investment projects nationwide use the Adjusted General Methodology (MGA), which consists of
a computer tool comprised of four modules that facilitate and help record the most relevant
information of the investment project at the time of its formulation and during the performance of
identification, preparation, assessment, and programming processes. By using this tool, project
reports include such critical elements as cash flows, economic flows, financial assessments,
economic and social assessments, and the Basic Investment Statistics file—from all of which a
project summary report is generated.

During the pre-investment stage, entities that formulate projects conduct an ex-ante assessment
(applies to all projects), which includes the result of the analysis performed from the information
on the alternative solutions proposed for the problem identified. This analysis includes financial,56
economic,57 and social58 assessments, which will have greater or lesser relevance depending on the
nature of the alternative and the project objectives. Profitability indicators (net present value,
internal rate of return, and cost/benefit ratio), cost efficiency (cost per unit of capacity or cost per
unit of benefit), and minimum cost, which, collectively, constitute the basis for making decisions
about the best alternative. For projects to which the indicators mentioned do not apply, as in the
case of science and technology, multiple criteria matrices are used.

After selecting the best alternative, product and management indicators are formulated, and the
budget classification and the association to the NDP are performed; subsequently, the project along

56
   Identifies revenue and outlays attributable to the implementation of the alternative, and consequently its profitability.
57
   Identifies the contribution the alternative makes to socioeconomic well-being, regardless of its effect on income
distribution.
58
   Analyzes the net contribution of the alternative to socioeconomic well-being. Weighs the imAMCPAMCPts of the
alternative that modify the distribution of wealth.


                                                            50
with more information is presented to the project bank for review by quality filters. There are three
controls: formulation control, under the charge of the planning office of the entity responsible for
the project; feasibility control, led by the planning office of the ministry heading the sector; and
control of the sectoral technical direction of the NPD. An opinion is issued in each of these filters.

The results of economic and social assessments that are made in the formulation of investment
projects are known only to the people involved in the process of making projects viable (i.e., those
assessing the quality filters of the information). However, some information on the percentages of
physical and financial progress and a summary the project59 is published on the Investment Projects
Tracking System (IPTS) (https://spi.dnp.gov.co/). It is noteworthy that there is no obligation to
update the information contained in the project assessments.

11.2 Investment project selection

Best practices for this dimension provide that before inclusion in the budget, all major investment
projects are prioritized by a central entity, based on standard criteria published for the selection of
projects.

Prior to the selection of investment projects, a review procedure applies in three instances: the
planning offices of the entity responsible for the project, the sector, and the sectoral area of the
NPD. Once reviews are completed, and to enable the selection of projects (including major
projects) to be included in the budget, a centralized prioritization is performed based on criteria
defined in the NPD law and other laws relative to social spending, victims, and other standards
that are public knowledge. This prioritization is ratified by sending notices to the various sectors
informing them about the selected priorities with respect to the priorities considered. The sample
of large projects assessed is included in Annex 10.

11.3 Determination of costs of investment projects

Best practice establishes that budgeting documents should include forecasts for each year for at
least the next three fiscal years, of the capital and recurring costs generated during the life cycle of
large investment projects.

The formulation of each project contains an estimate of the investment and operation costs, the
latter understood as those generated by the operation and maintenance common to the project
within the time horizon; however, the documents that are part of the budgeting system, such as the
financial plan, the annual investments operating plan, the MTEF, and GBN, do not disaggregate
the medium-term information (for three years) of recurring and capital costs of investment
projects, and only include (as mentioned in the PI-16 discussion for the MTEF) an estimate of total
expenditures disaggregated by recurrent or investment expenditures and by sectors. Similarly, the
MTFF presents aggregate estimates that do not differentiate capital and recurring costs of
investment projects with future fiscal periods, and the Financial Plan presents only aggregate
forecasts of current, investment, and loan expenditures.


59
  Includes the identification of problems, products, objectives, and alternative solution with targets, indicators, costs,
benefits and beneficiaries, financial scheme, activities, and the Basic Investment Statistics record.


                                                           51
11.4 Investment project monitoring

Best practices ensure that the total cost and the physical progress of major investment projects are
monitored during implementation by the government unit responsible, there is a high degree of
compliance with the procedures and provisions for implementation of projects that have been
launched, and there is information on the execution of major investment projects that is published
in the budget documents or other annual reports.

Processes and procedures for formulation, execution, and arrangements for the implementation of
major projects are generally applicable for all entities. Project costs, as well as physical, financial,
and management progress, are monitored by the NPD with support from IPTS and through the
Office of Deputy Director of Projects and Information for Public Investment. Monthly, quarterly,
and annual management reports are produced that account for the financial, physical progress, and
management of investment projects in progress, including major projects.

PI-12 Public asset management

This indicator assesses the management and monitoring of government assets and transparency in
the disposal of such assets. For this assessment, fiscal year 2014, the most recent completed fiscal
year, is taken as the critical period.

12.1 Financial asset monitoring

Best practices indicate that the government should keep a record of its Financial Assets (FA),
which are recognized at market value, consistent with international accounting standards.
Similarly, information is published each year on the performance of such assets.

In general, other FA, such as debtors, accounts receivable, and other marketable short-term assets
are administered by each public entity under regulations of the MFPC and PAF; except for highly
liquid financial assets, which are administered by the National Treasury of the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit and the Central Bank (reserves and other securities of the issuing bank),
including the administration of the Treasury Single Account;60 the supporting documentation and
the associated accounting records are filed with the concerned entities. In accounting standards
and the accounting system established by law, the criteria for recognition and disclosure of these
assets are specifically defined, at cost or market value, whichever is less, for which provisions
disclosed in the financial statements are recorded.

The DGPCNT and the GAO do not submit a specific report on the performance of the FA. The
Report of the Financial Position and Results at the National Level, produced by GAO, reveals
within specific notes the revenue derived from interest, dividends, and revaluations, as well as
expenditures for loss in equity produced by divestitures, and that which is related to the issuer’s
risk (provisions). However, the notes to the financial statements (FS) are not sufficient evidence
of a comprehensive accountability report on the annual performance of the FA.

FA accounts, especially debtors, investments, and derivatives and cash instruments, were
challenged by CGC in the annual opinion available on the FS for 2014, for understatements and
overstatements in records that CGC considered sufficiently important to issue caveats.

12.2 Monitoring of non-financial assets

Best practice mandates that the Central Government keep a record of it fixed assets, land, and,
where relevant, of subsoil assets, including information about its use and age profiles, which
should be published at least annually.

In Colombia there is no single consolidated record of fixed assets that constitute the most important
line item among Non-Financial Assets (NFA). Each entity manages its inventory of NFA in
customized information systems, which serve as a backup of accounting information reported to
GBN. Information on physical quantities is maintained by each entity in its own database, where

each asset is identified. Annually, the notes to the consolidation of public sector FS revealed the
general aspects of NFA.

For accounting and registration of the NFA, there is a unified accounting procedure for recognition
and disclosure of the transfer of national-level public entity assets. There is no evidence in hand
on the publication of an integrated annual report on the detail of Fixed Assets, in which information
on their use and age is disclosed.

In relation to the quality and monitoring of the NFA, the CGC expressed reservations on the FS to
December 31, 2014 with respect to overestimates of NFA accounts of more than CoP 69 billion.
This circumstance underscores uncertainty about the reliability of records and reconciliations, both
of which values are incorporated in the consolidation, and which include important differences
between IFIS and the module of the Treasury and Public Information Consolidator (CHIP);61 CGC
also expressed concerns on the reconciliation of such registries with physically verifiable NFA.
Moreover, no evidence is in hand regarding the existence of statistical reports or integrated
management of the NFAs.

12.3 Transparency of asset disposal

Under best practice, procedures should be established for the competitive and transparent sale,
transfer, or assignment of financial and non-financial assets, including material to be presented to
the Legislature for information and approval. Information on transfers and disposal is to be
included in budget documents, financial reports, and other reports.

Public Asset Management is a state policy, formulated and developed in economic policy
documents,62 whose purpose is to maximize the economic and social return of tax assets. In
Colombia, the disposition and sale of assets is primarily regulated in the General Contracting
Statute, Law 80 of 1993, and its amendments, specifically in the regulations of the procurement
and contracting system.63

In this legal framework, the sale of both FA and NFA are regulated, and the sales method
established is that of abbreviated selection, which involves open bidding to make offers and close
sales/purchases of State property in general. Typically, the divestiture of State property does not
have to be submitted to the Legislature for prior approval or subsequently to inform on the
execution and returns on such sales. Only in the case of a state entity equity sale is the Government
legally required to submit for the advice of Congress64 during the first 60 days of the year through
a general annual divestitures plan, including preliminary assessments. An undetermined
percentage of such operations are recorded and made public in the Electronic Procurement System.

The sale and disposal of assets has traditionally been managed by each public entity. However,
since 2007 an attempt has been made to centralize the process of selling of fixed public sector
assets. For this purpose, the Central Government entrusted the Central de Inversiones S.A. (CISA),
a national-level mixed-economy trading company linked to the MFPC, with the duties of Collector
of Public Assets and Coordinator of Government Real Estate Management. Basically, these
functions consist in intermediation of the NFA sales process, especially with respect to fixed
assets. This policy has been updated in National Development Plans,65 which direct the National-
Level Public Entities (except for State-Owned Industrial and Commercial Companies, Mixed-
Economy Partnerships, State-Owned Financial Institutions, and Entities in Liquidation) to sell
their portfolio (debtors) greater than 180 days in arrears to CISA.

For registration and control of the sale of fixed assets, the Asset Management Information System
was implemented with real-time information of the inventory of properties for sale. Currently, the
system report corresponds to 10 percent of public entities that have transferred or used CISA as an
intermediary for the sale of its assets. Similarly, the properties reported are approximately 10

The Central Government is committed to expanding this fixed assets sales system, which to date,
as noted, does not cover all sales of public sector assets. Information on transfers and disposals at
the individual or detailed level is included in budget documents, financial reports, and other reports

PI-13 Debt management

This indicator assesses the management of Central Government debt (domestic and foreign) and
guarantees. It seeks to identify whether there are satisfactory management practices and whether
the records and controls of the debt ensure efficient and effective management. The critical period
for dimension 13.1 is at the time of the assessment (November and December 2015). For



                                                  56
dimension 13.2 it is the last completed fiscal year (2014). For dimension 13.3 it is the time of
assessment, with reference to the last three completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014).

13.1 Recording and preparation of debt and guarantee reports

International best practice states that records on domestic and foreign debt and/or their guarantees
must be complete, accurate, current, and reconciled on a monthly basis. Statistical reports on debt
service, capital, and operations should be produced and reported at least quarterly.

In Colombia, it is legally established that public credit operations should be included in a single
database under the charge of the DGPCNT of the MFPC. Similarly, to keep credit operation
information up to date, it is established that state entities are required to report on the balances and
movements of public credit operations in a monthly fashion and within the first 10 calendar days
of the month.

Organizationally the DGPCNT through the Offices of Deputy Director of External Financing,
Domestic Financing,66 and Funding from Multilateral Agencies and Governments, supports the
preparation, negotiation, execution, and effectiveness of credit operations under its responsibility,
as well as the registration, execution, and monitoring of loan agreements. In addition to this
department, the Office of Deputy Director of Other Entities, Settlement and Receivables, is
responsible for processing and follow-up of requests for credit authorization requiring procurement
of a sovereign guarantee.

For records of all public credit operations (internal and external) a proprietary system is used, in
which entries are made from the preparation and negotiation phase, to registration or coding
(lifecycle) of the operation, and the initial financial conditions to be agreed. At a later stage, when
the operation is authorized by the NCESP and the contract is signed, data is entered, including
amount, destination, timing for payment of principal and interest, interest rate, collateral,
percentage of payment schedules, and programming of commissions. For the implementation
phase, information about disbursements, payments of principal, interest payments, commission
payments, balances, and movements and subsequent amendments, is directly updated by entities
controlled by the Offices of Deputy Director of the DGPCNT, depending on their powers and
coordination with the Office of Deputy Director of Operations.

In addition, the Office of Deputy Director of Operations of the DGPCNT performs daily
monitoring of transactions related to public credit of state agencies, and in the case of
inconsistencies in this information mandates that entities make corrections within a specific
deadline. A daily reconciliation is also performed on debt servicing of unsecured and secured credit
operations, controlling that accounts receivable correspond to the book value of the loan, that the
payment is made, and that it is received by the lender.

The Office of Deputy Director of Other Entities, Settlement and Receivables follows up on the
fulfillment of the obligations of entities with sovereign guarantee operations; and the Office of

Deputy Director of Funding from Multilateral Agencies and Governments performs quarterly
reconciliations against the system logs of the Central Bank.

Quarterly reports are made of internal and external credit operations that account for the amounts
disbursed, amortization, the balance of the debt, the composition of internal and external debt, its
composition by currency, type of instrument, and interest rate (fixed and variable). Statistics are
also presented on the maturity profile of debt, the service profile, and placements in foreign and
domestic capital markets.



13.2 Approval of debt and guarantees

The best practice for this dimension establishes the existence of legislation that grants
authorization to contract loans, issue new debt, and issue loan guarantees on behalf of the Central
Government to a single responsible debt management entity. It also establishes the existence of
written policies and procedures that provide guidance to this single debt management entity and
approval of annual debt levels by the Government or the Legislature.

The authorization process for a credit transaction, whether it is from an external or internal loan of
the Nation or a government bond of the Nation, and the granting of guarantees of the Nation, are
public knowledge and they are properly regulated by Decree 2681 of 1993, the standard regulating
Article 42 of the Public Procurement Act.67 These provisions provide that to sign the contract and
grant credit guarantees (when applicable) requires the authorization of the MFPC, after favorable
opinions of NCESP, the DNP, or other agencies as appropriate. The requirements for each type of
operation are shown in Annex 4.

With respect to the level of indebtedness, this is analyzed through MTEF when submitting the
draft budget law and debt law. The latter law establishes the maximum amount and the general
purpose of the external and internal debt operations, the maximum amount of guarantees that can
be granted or contracted, and the maximum amount of balance due for the issuance of letters of
Treasury bills.

13.3 Debt management strategy

Best practice states that the Central Government publishes a debt management strategy, covering
existing debt and that projected to the medium term with a horizon of at least three years. The
strategy should include targets for certain indicators, such as interest rates, refinancing, and risks
associated with exchange rates; annual reports must be submitted to the Legislature to enable
comparison of the objectives of debt management with its results, and the annual plan for
contracting government loans should be consistent with the approved debt strategy.

The Risk Department of the DGPCNT prepared in 2013 a public document on Management
Strategy for Medium-Term Debt, which operates as a guide or framework to be followed for the
purposes of debt composition in terms of currency, interest rate, and maturity profile (deadlines).

                                                 58
Under the strategic framework, each year goals and targets are established for the next and the
subsequent five years, and tracking is performed biannually and is included in internal reports on
the results. Part of the results, such as borrowing for the next year of the Nation and the expected
composition of debt in dollars and pesos, and the results regarding the previous year’s financial
plan, are incorporated into the month of June each year in the MTEF document that is delivered to
Congress.

Currently, the DGPCNT implements capacity-building activities strengthen the Medium-Term
Debt Management Strategy, so as to (i) better link the strategy with the timelines and review of
the annual Financial Plan; (ii) establish groups responsible for monitoring the Medium-Term Debt
Management Strategy; and (iii) design management reports for internal and external use.

3.4   Policy-Based Fiscal Strategy and Budgeting

Government at the global and sectoral levels.




                                                   59
PI-14 Macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting

This indicator measures the country’s ability to develop sound macroeconomic and fiscal
projections as a basis for the formulation of a predictable and sustainable fiscal strategy. It also
assesses the government’s capacity to estimate the fiscal impact of potential changes in economic
circumstances. The scope for methodology focuses on the total economy in dimension 14.1 and
the Central Government for dimensions 14.2 and 14.3. The critical period builds on the information
from the last three completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014).

14.1 Macroeconomic forecasts

Best practices state that the government must have the capacity to prepare, in the budgeting
financial year and the next two fiscal years, integral projections based on assumptions and
macroeconomic indicators that undergo a review by a distinct entity from the one that prepared
them and that are under consideration by the Legislature in the process of approval of the annual
budget.

Since 2003, there exists in Colombia the obligation to prepare and submit with the draft annual
budget the MTFF for a recursive period of 10 years, including the following budgeting financial
year. This instrument guides the preparation of annual budgets and the preparation of other
instruments, such as the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, the Investments Plan of the Draft
Bill of the National Development Plan, the annual Financial Plan, and Annual Investments
Operating Plan (AIOP).

The content of the MTFF is legally regulated and includes an analysis of macroeconomic and fiscal
results observed in the previous fiscal period and a forecast of what is expected to be the future
behavior of the main economic variables and fiscal performance over the medium term.68 It also
contains an analysis of the international macroeconomic context and the effects on national
economic activity and the fiscal situation, and a description of the fiscal strategy together with a
quantification of tax results.69

From 2012, through Law 1473 of 2011, as noted earlier, a fiscal rule was adopted that mandated a
declining goal in the structural deficit for the Central Government to reach 1.0 percent of GDP or
less for 2022. This fiscal rule is expressed through the MTFF and operates as an automatic
stabilizer to maintain levels of public expenditure that are in line with long-term revenue levels.70

For the application of the fiscal rule, the law provides for the creation of a committee of an
independent technical nature composed of representatives from universities, members of research
centers, experts, and consultants of recognized experience and expertise, and chairmen of the
committees on economic affairs of the Congress. Among its roles are determining the methodology
and basic parameters used for the operation of the fiscal rule, and the detailed report on compliance
with the fiscal rule of the previous year that the Central Government provides in June each year to

   Established on the basis of assumptions of exogenous and macroeconomic variables, such as oil prices, the growth
potential of the economy, the exchange rate, the current account, trade balance, and real growth of the economy.

the Economic Committees of Congress. The methodology, estimates, technical details of the
design of the fiscal rule, as well as its changes, are published along with its technical justification.

The assumptions used in the projections defined by the MFPC and revised within the framework
of the institutions created around the fiscal rule are presented to the Central Bank and the DNP;
however, at present there is no review process and unification, as each entity generates its own
growth estimates and assumptions with different methodologies.

GoC’s comprehensive projections on macroeconomic assumptions, methodologies, and
parameters are reviewed by the Advisory Committee on the Fiscal Rule, but not by a fully
independent entity that had no part in preparing the projections. The assumptions are submitted to
the Congress as part of the discussion and approval of the draft General Budget of the Nation.

14.2 Fiscal forecasts

International best practice states that the government prepares the forecasts of the main fiscal
indicators, including income (by type), aggregates of expenditure, and the budgeting balance for
the fiscal year and the next two fiscal years. These forecasts, together with the underlying
assumptions and an explanation of the main differences from the forecasts made in the previous
year’s budget, are included in the budget documentation submitted to the Legislature.

As mentioned in the previous dimension of this indicator, in Colombia a new MTFF is prepared
every year for a period of 10 years and is submitted together with the draft budget to the Economic
Committees of Congress. In this instrument the main results of the close of the previous year,
based on the goals that were set for achieving sustainability and fiscal discipline of the Central
Government, are described and the observed variations in revenues (fiscal, non-fiscal, and other)
in expenditures (current and for investment), in the structural balance, and in financing are noted.
The changes observed are taken into account when reviewing the fiscal targets and the financial
plan for the following year.

The fiscal strategy is drawn for a 10-year horizon and revenues, expenditures, and deficits are
forecast, and should be consistent with the declining trend of the medium-term structural deficit.
Projections are designed under scenarios that primarily reflect GDP growth assumptions, imports,
and oil prices and production.

For the preparation of the projection of tax revenue, the Office of the Director, Macroeconomic
Policy of the MFPC, and the Coordination Office of Economic Studies of the Office of Deputy
Director of Operational Analysis of the Office of Deputy Director of National Taxes and Customs,
establish procedures and assumptions explained in working documents for internal use, as well as
in the MTFF and in the annex to the presidential message accompanying the draft budget. Among
the variables considered are macroeconomic assumptions of real and nominal GDP, domestic
inflation at the end of the period, the average exchange rate and that at the end of the period, the
growth of imports, and the behavior of prices of export products (oil and coal). Variables are also
considered for each tax, among which are the effects of assessed contributions and advances for
the different types of taxpayers, the analysis of the impact of tax regulations, the collection
expected as a product of management control of evasion and delinquency, and the estimate of the
effect of returns used to arrive at a net value of cash or cash expected to be collected.


                                                  61
Monitoring of compliance is performed throughout the year with the estimated annual revenue
target based on daily information; at the end of the year the figure is reconciled against information
produced by the Office of Deputy Director, Collections and Recovery of the DNTC on returns and
payments received. Also during each year, medium-term projections are reviewed and adjusted
when preparing a new MTFF.

14.3 Macrofiscal sensitivity analysis

International best practice requires the government to prepare a number of scenarios for alternative
fiscal forecasts based on macroeconomic assumptions; these scenarios are published along with
the central forecast.

For the formulation of medium-term projections no core or alternative scenarios are presented;
instead, two basic growth assumptions are utilized: the potential GDP and observed GDP. The
difference between the two represents the output gap that indicates when the observed GDP is
below potential GDP, that the economy is not using the most productive factors for maximizing
production, or otherwise the economy is producing above its potential with the use of all factors.
Also within the MTFF, debt sustainability analysis is performed, where a core scenario and
alternative scenarios are defined based on different assumptions of economic growth.

To calculate potential GDP there is an independent technical team and a methodology approved
since 2012 and a process of review and adjustment of forecasts through the Fiscal Rule Advisory
Committee. As part of the methodology for estimation there are forecasts for long-term oil prices,
in which different assumptions and alternative scenarios are used.

PI-15 Fiscal strategy

This indicator assesses the ability of the Government to develop and implement a clear fiscal
strategy. It also measures the ability to develop and evaluate the fiscal impact of proposed revenue
and expenditure policies that support the achievement of the fiscal targets of the government. The
scope for methodology focuses on the Central Government and the critical period is the three most
recently completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014).



15.1 Fiscal impact of public policy proposals

Best practices state that the Central Government should prepare estimates of the fiscal impact of
all changes in revenue and expenditure for the budgeting fiscal year that was submitted to the
Legislature and in the following two fiscal years.

In Colombia, the Law on Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency71 provides that within the MTFF
two types of forecasts should be included with respect to the fiscal impacts of regulatory changes:
(i) quantifying the fiscal cost of the laws enacted in the previous fiscal year, and
(ii) estimates of the fiscal cost of exemptions, deductions, or tax discounts available.

With respect to the former, laws enacted involving expenditure authority are evaluated according
to their fiscal impact and the impact they have I fiscal targets. Similarly, during its passage the
sources of funding resources are determined and sustainability is queried with reference to the
MTFF. In practice these assessments were included in the MTFF that was presented to Congress
in 2012, 2013, and 2014. The methodology for estimating the cost of the enacted legislation
identifies all those laws mandating a new expenditure or an increase in existing expenditures and
separates those which are transient or with a specific implementation period and those that have
an indefinite or permanent period. The estimates are developed by the Office of the Director
 54 Law 819 National
General,    of 2003.
                     Public Budget of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit.

With respect to the latter type of forecast, each year forecasts are determined for fiscal expenditures
or fiscal costs of tax benefits present in fiscal legislation involving a decline in tax payable by
taxpayers and hence lower collections by the State. These preferential treatments may be
deductions, exemptions, or special tax treatment. A methodology and assumptions for each benefit
are available for the estimate and these are described in the MTFF. The preparation of the estimates
is the responsibility of the Office of Coordinator of Economic Studies, Office of Deputy Director,
Operations Management, DNTC.

Given the above it can be concluded that standards, instruments, forecasts, and methodologies with
assumptions and institutional capacity are in hand to identify annually all the regulations that have
a fiscal impact on expenditures or revenue, and which analyze the effects these may have on fiscal
sustainability goals.

15.2 Fiscal strategy adoption

References to best practices in this dimension state that the government adopts, submits to
Congress, and publishes a fiscal strategy, including quantitative targets and fiscal targets, together
with qualitative targets for at least the next budgeting fiscal year and the following two fiscal years.

In compliance with the stipulations of the Law on Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency, the
Central Government prepares and publishes the fiscal strategy within the MTFF. This instrument
reflects and describes fiscal results that are consistent with the expected behavior of exogenous
and macroeconomic variables for the next 10 years, actions to strengthen revenues in the short and
medium term, and control measures for expenditures and debt.

15.3 Submission of fiscal outcomes reports

Best practices establish that the Government submits to the Legislature, and publishes together
with the annual budget describing progress on the fiscal strategy and provides an explanation of
the reasons for any deviation from the objectives and targets previously set. The report should also
include the actions planned by the Government to address any deviation, as prescribed by law.
Advances in the results of the fiscal strategy as well as explanations on its implementation, are
submitted to Congress in compliance with legal obligations under the fiscal responsibility law and
the law of the fiscal rule. Within the MTFF submitted before June 15 of each fiscal year, a report
is submitted on macroeconomic and fiscal performance for the previous fiscal year and in the event
of breach of the targets of the previous year, an explanation is included regarding the deviations
and the necessary measures to correct them. In addition to the information contained in the MTFF,
in June of each year, the Government supplies a detailed report to the Economic Committees of
Congress, on the implementation of the fiscal rule of the previous year’s report.

PI-16 Medium-term perspective in expenditure budgeting

Expenditure policy decisions have multiyear implications and should be aligned with the
availability of resources in the medium term. In this sense, this indicator examines the extent to
which expenditure budgets and medium-term budgeting expenditure ceilings are produced. It also
examines the extent to which the annual budgets are derived from the medium-term forecasts and
the degree of alignment between the budget estimates and medium-term strategic plans. The scope
of the methodology focuses on the Central Government budget and the critical period takes as
reference the last budget submitted to Congress.

The critical period for dimensions 16.1, 16.2, and 16.3 is the last budget submitted to the
Legislature and completed (i.e., 2014); for dimension 16.4 it is the current medium-term budget.

16.1 Medium-term expenditure estimates

Best practices for this dimension establish that the annual budget presents estimates of expenditure
for the fiscal year and the two following fiscal years, organized according to the administrative,
economic, and program (or functional) classification.

Since 2006, pursuant to Decree 4730 of 2005, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC),
in coordination with the National Planning Department (NPD), prepare, prior to July 15 of each
fiscal year, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), an instrument that has a four-year
perspective and is organized under a sectoral scheme. Approval is rendered at a meeting of the
National Council for Economic and Social Policy (NCESP), which is attended by all Cabinet
ministers.

The estimates in the MTEF take as a reference point to identify the limit of allocable resources at
the sectoral level, the area of spending that is set each year in the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
(MTFF) and which is consistent within the context of sustainability of public finances with the
fiscal rule. Sectoral technical committees are formed for the process of discussion and criteria, and
procedures and instructions are established to be followed by the bodies that form the General
Budget of the Nation during the budget programming process.

Allocations provided under the first year of the MTEF are consistent with the draft GBN, but
estimates defined for subsequent years are subject to change in the tax or sector policy, and also
to changes in economic conditions or adjustments in the calculation parameters. MTEF allocations
for a period of four years, including the proposed budget, include total expenditure aggregated



                                                 65
information, operation, and investment and expenditure by sector. No information is presented by
economic or administrative classification, or by program or functional rubrics, except that which
is included for the following financial year in additional Annexes to the draft GBN.

16.2 Medium-term expenditure ceilings

Best practice requires that aggregate expenditure ceilings and those at the ministerial level for the
budget year and the following two fiscal years are approved by the government before the first
budget circular is issued.

For programming of the draft budget entities have, from July of the previous year, operating
expenditure and investment ceilings by sector contained in the MTEF approved by ministers in a
session with NCESP for a period of four years. Preparation of the annual budget starts in February,
when a circular is forwarded to GBN entities outlining the goals, policies, and criteria for program
staff costs, overheads, transfers, servicing of debt, investment, and other information necessary for
the preparation of the preliminary draft budget and the Medium-Term Budget Proposal.

Programming of revenue and expenditure of the draft bill is undertaken by entities directly in IFIS,
once the ceilings for each entity are established in the MTEF and budget lines are available within
the proposals to be developed by the entities, as well as deadlines for the entities to prepare and
submit their formal proposals. Once this process is completed, the drafts are consolidated and sent
to the economic committees of the Senate and House in the first week of April, so that they can
consider the information that the draft budget may contain.

After the delivery of the draft budget by entities, the provisional programming is revised, and based
on the expenditure space that is specified in the new MTFF, a new MTEF is drafted with the final
ceilings for the first year and indications for the following three, to be used for programming the
draft budget. In the event of changes in tax or sectoral policy, or in the economic climate or even
in the calculation parameters, the ceiling initially allocated can change at this stage of the
programming of the draft budget.

16.3 Alignment of strategic plans and medium-term budgets

The reference best practice for this dimension establishes the preparation and publication of
medium-term strategic plans for most ministries, and an alignment between most expenditure
policy proposals in the medium term with budgetary estimates of strategic plans.

The Organic Law of the Development Plan72 states that public entities should prepare, based on the
National Development Plan and their functions, a four-year reference plan with annual action plans
which will allow further assessment of results. The methodology for the implementation of the
Integrated Planning and Management Model73 formulated by the Civil Service Administration
Department (CSAD), articulates the following three planning instruments: the Sector Strategic
Plan, the Institutional Strategic Plan, and the Annual Action Plan. These plans must collect the

72
  Article 26 and 29 of Law 152 of 1994.
73
   Decree 2482 of 2012, whereby the general guidelines for the integration of planning and management are
established.


                                                   66
policies, strategies, and initiatives of sector ministries and serve as inputs for annual budget
programming.

An example of the preparation of such plans was evident in the Ministry of Transport; this entity
took as its essential inputs the NDP, the Institutional Strategic Plan, and previous Sector Strategic
Plans and the estimate of the budget allocated to the entity, to align Government policies to the
budget and the constraints of the resources allocated in the MTEF. Strategic issues were linked in
their formulation and the objectives to be achieved by the ministry for a period of four years, along
with the goals, projects, and budget resources needed for execution (to be adjusted every year
through the Institutional Action Plans).

In practice, most of the ministries comply with the preparation of the Institutional Strategic Plan,
and Sector Strategic Plan, although their submissions lack a standardized format and only some of
them signal the resources needed to achieve medium- and long-term goals and the products and
results planned74 (see Annex 5). It should be noted that in Colombia planning and budgeting
exercises are complemented by the MTEF, with which strategic planning, policy design, and
macroeconomic and fiscal planning are linked over the medium term and with annual budgeting
programming. Moreover, entities during preparation estimate the shortfall of resources to meet the
demands and costs for recursive cycles of four years, both for recurring costs (operation) as well
as capital, and provide for the effects on sources of funding and resources available.

16.4 Consistency of budgets with previous year’s estimates

Good practice states that in the budget documents an explanation of all changes to the estimates of
expenditure between the last medium-term budgeting financial year and the current medium-term
budget at the ministry level should be provided.

In MTEF documents explanations are included about the prospects of the Colombian economy
and its main sectors, changes in macroeconomic projections, fiscal medium-term goals, and some
variations in expenses that arise at the sectoral level over four years (although in some social
programs, this applies for only one year). A detailed explanation of the changes at the ministry
level of expenditures allows revealing and reconciling the differences that may arise between a
new exercise and its predecessor, or between the second year of the previous fiscal year with the
first year of the new MTEF. It should be noted that in the application of the MTEF, the ceilings
fixed for four years at the sectoral level do not contain information disaggregated by ministry
designed to reveal and analyze variations that may arise.

PI-17 Budget preparation process beginning

The degree of participation of other ministries, public entities, and political authorities in annual
budget formulation affects the extent to which the budget reflects macroeconomic, fiscal, and
sectoral policies. Ensuring full participation requires an integrated budget process involving all
relevant parties in an orderly and timely manner, in accordance with a predetermined budget
formulation calendar.

The assessment of this indicator with respect to dimensions 17.1 and 17.2 takes into account the
most recent budget approved by Congress (2015); that for dimension 17.3, the last three completed
budgets (2013, 2014, 2015).

17.1 Budget calendar

Best practice for this dimension draws on the existence of a clear annual budget calendar, which
is observed in general and which grants ministries and public entities at least six weeks from the
date of receipt of the budgeting circular (which establishes provisional budgeting ceilings) to
complete their detailed estimates.




                                                 68
The regulatory framework governing economic planning and the Colombian budgeting system is
established in constitutional provisions (Articles 151 and 342), organizational laws,75 ordinary laws
(such as the Fiscal Rule Law),76 decrees,77 and the compilation decree of the laws that compose the
organizational statute for the budget.78 This framework integrates tools such as the MTFF and its
financial plan, the MTEF, and the Annual Investments Operating Plan (AIOP); once these are
approved by the appropriate bodies, they converge to shape the General Budget bill. The main
dates and rules which define the budget programming are set out in the aforementioned regulations,
and are in Table 3.11.

Although the calendar is clear and the established dates are generally observed, and despite having
been informed from July of the previous year (in the MTEF 2014-2017), about the proposed
ceilings corresponding to fiscal 2015, this information is supplied only for reference; the definitive
ceilings are communicated in the new MTFF for the 2015-2018 period, after establishing in June
2014 the fiscal constraints contained in the MTFF of 2014-2024, in accordance with the fiscal rule
provided in law.79 These ceilings were communicated to the relevant entities on July 8, 2014 (i.e.,
only three weeks before the deadline for submitting the draft budget to Congress)

It should be noted that the reference ceilings that were reported in the 2014-2017 MTEF for the
year 2015, which the entities used when preparing their draft budgets, suffered substantial
adjustments, notably rising in the agricultural and recreation/sports sectors (by 115 percent and 58
percent, respectively) and declining for the Registry (-48 percent), presidency (-30 percent), and
statistical information entities (-17 percent). These changes undermined the utility of the detailed
schedules contained in the drafts (see Annex 6).

Thus, it was determined that the entities had less than four weeks from the moment that the final
ceiling was communicated to them to complete or adjust the detailed budget scheduling.

17.2 Guidance on budget preparation

Best practice establishes that one or more complete and clear circulars should be forwarded to
ministries and public entities, covering all budgetary expenditures for the full year, and reflecting
the maximum ceilings approved by the Council of Ministers or equivalent body.

Since 2006 the budget scheduling process in Colombia has incorporated an MTEF,80 a public
financial scheduling instrument that seeks to strengthen the medium- and long-term expenditure
vision within a context of discipline and fiscal responsibility. This instrument helps coordinate
policy design and macroeconomic and fiscal planning over the medium term and in annual
programming of the budget.81

In the process of drafting the MTEF, technical meetings with the Budget Sectoral Committees are
scheduled, attended by the Director General of the National Public Budget, the Investment and
Public Finance Directorate of the National Planning Department, and the heads of the agency
budgeting divisions of the respective sectors,82 to discuss sectoral allocations, which are then
approved with the issuance of the MTEF in a NCESP session attended by all Cabinet Ministers.

During the budgeting planning process pertinent to fiscal 2015, the following circulars were
issued:

           •   Circular dated July 9, 2013. Informs the reference ceilings for the 2014-2017 period.
               The second year was used as basis for the preparation of the draft budget for fiscal
               2015.
           •   External Circular 06 of February 21, 2014. By which guidelines and criteria were
               identified for the scheduling process of the draft budget of the agencies that are part of
               GBN.
           •   Circular dated July 8, 2014. Communicated the final ceilings for 2015, which were used
               as the basis of the draft budget and as reference ceilings until 2018.
In addition to these circulars, in the Ministry of Transportation amendments were communicated
in January 2015 to the budget ceilings set out in the MTEF 2014-2017, and for the investment
component of the NPD, communications were sent informing the investment quota as a basis for
the technical discussions of budget sectoral committees.

During the budgeting scheduling process several circulars are issued in which ceilings are set. A
reference ceiling is reported initially in the MTEF for the prior year, which is used to prepare the
draft budget; subsequently the final ceiling is communicated corresponding to the new MTEF
exercise. This second ceiling is communicated in July after delivery of the first circular for the
annual scheduling of the budget (February) and subsequent to the moment in which entities have
completed their detailed schedule with the submission of the draft budget (April).

17.3 Budget submission to the Legislature

Reference best practice states that the Executive Branch must have submitted the annual budget
proposal to Congress at least two months before the start of the fiscal year in each of the past three
years, so that the Legislative Branch has sufficient review time.

The Organizational Budget Statute (OBS)83 provides that the draft bill to be submitted by the
national government for the consideration of Congress, through the Minister of Finance, must be
filed during the first 10 days of each legislature (in Colombia’s case, no later than July 29). In
practice, the last three budgets approved by Congress of the Republic were delivered five months
prior to their start, on the following dates.

           •   For fiscal year 2013 the project was filed on July 27, 2012.
           •   For fiscal year 2014 the project was filed on July 26, 2013.

           •   For fiscal year 2015 the project was filed on July 30, 2014.
In addition to the draft budget bill,84 the National Government should submit the draft annual
budget for revenues and expenditures to the economic committees of the House and Senate each
year during the first week of April. This obligation was fulfilled for fiscal year 2015 on April 4,
2014.

Based on the foregoing it is established that the Government meets the legally established
timeliness dates for filing the draft budget before the Congress of the Republic.

PI-18 Legislative scrutiny of budgets

This indicator assesses whether the Legislature has sufficient powers and capacity to analyze,
review, debate, and authorize the draft budget bills and their amendments. To measure these
aspects of management, consideration is given to the nature and scope of the review, the internal
procedures of Congress, the timely adoption of the proposed budget, and the rules for budget
amendments. The indicator as a reference for dimensions 18.1, 18.2, and 18.4 is the most recent
completed fiscal year (2014); for dimension 18.3 it is the last three completed budgets (2012, 2013,
and 2014).

18.1 Scope of budget scrutiny

International best practice establishes that the budget examination by the Legislative Branch
should cover fiscal policies, the fiscal framework, and medium-term priorities as well as specific
details of the estimates of expenditure and revenue.

The consideration of the draft budget bill of 2015 by Congress included review by members of the
economic committees of the House and Senate in two stages. The first considered the Medium-
Term Fiscal Framework 2014 (MTFF)85 fiscal policy in areas such as austerity in operating
expenditure, major investments, the trend and projected income and expenses,86 draft tax reforms
required to meet the funding shortfall,87 compliance with fiscal targets set under the Fiscal
Rule,88and Colombia’s economic prospects and growth projections.89 Consideration was also given
to the total amount of the GBN90 and its consistency against the MTFF; the revenue trend for and
its availability; and the general provisions contained in the draft bill and other issues related to the
use and management of public resources. All this led to approval of the final budget total.

In a second phase expenditures by sector, entity, and programs and subprograms were examined,
although the last with some difficulty because of the level of aggregation in which information is
reported. Variations in resource allocations were analyzed by sectors and entities, relevant
explanations were requested from the ministers of the various portfolios or the NPD with respect
to the technical criteria used for allocations or their variations or of the adjustments. Levels of
performance achieved by the entities were also considered, as were the commitments made
through contracts and agreements in force, the obligations arising from laws and rulings, the
priorities established in the framework of sectoral and cross-cutting policies in force, the fiscal and
sustainability goals of the Nation, and regional needs. Proposed changes to the provisions were
considered, leading to agreements with the government with respect to financing priority
investments, regional needs, and other expenditures.91

Thus, it can be determined that the examination by the Congress did indeed cover fiscal policies,
the fiscal framework, and medium-term priorities as well as specific details of the estimates of
expenditures and revenues.

18.2 Legislative procedures for budget scrutiny

International best practice states that for the consideration of the budget, the Legislature must have
legally established procedures, which are respected and include measures for public consultation


85
   The MTFF was presented to Congress by the Executive on June 13, 2014 in compliance with the Law on Fiscal
Responsibility and Transparency.
86
   The speakers carefully reviewed the criteria and assumptions used for scheduling the 2015 budget, and considered
these reasonable as witnessed second debate report for draft Law 37 of 2014 of the Senate, and 052 of the House.
87
   The tax reform initiative resulted in Law 1739 of 2014.
88
   The Director General of the Central Bank participated in the session.
89
   The Director General of the Central Bank participated in the session.
90
   Pursuant to Article 56 of the Organizational Budget Statute (OBS), the amount of the budget is approved first (for
2015 this was CoP 216.2 billion, including CoP 12.5 billion that is unfunded).
91
   See the list of amendments and discussion in the official report of the first debate on the General Budget 2015.

and for internal organization, such as specialized review committees, technical support, and
negotiation procedures.

The Constitution of 199192 defines the functions of Congress, among which are reforming the
Constitution, making laws, and exercising oversight of the Government and the administration. In
its composition the Colombian parliament is bicameral, consisting of the Senate and House of
Representatives. The operation of the Legislature is regulated by Law 5 of 1992, which sets the
standards governing the meetings and operation of the Senate, the House of Representatives, and
the Congress of the Republic in full.

To fulfill its functions, the chambers are organized into four types of committees: permanent
constitutional, legal, special, and incidental. Among the permanent committees are the economic
committees, which are responsible for debating the bills related to finance and public credit93 and
budget.94

The draft bills, as a rule, should be discussed and approved in the first debate of the relevant
standing committee and, in the second debate, in each chamber in full; however, in the case of the
draft budget bill this can be done in a joint session of the third and fourth standing committees of
the two chambers.

With respect to the applicable procedures for consideration of the draft budget bill, Law 5 of 199295
establishes the terms and general provisions for the study, discussion, and approval; the process
starts with the assignment of one or more speakers to review the particulars and submit a paper
that account for the final amount of the GBN, the general context of the scheduling, the standards,
and other aspects bill introduces. A list of proposals to be discussed in the first debate is also
included.96

After the draft bill is studied, discussed, and approved in the commission, a second review is
conducted and new papers are developed in each Chamber to be debated in plenary.97 Requests for
amendments are analyzed by the Office of the Director General of the Public Budget of the Nation
(DGGBN) and amending letters are submitted to the respective chambers for debate in plenary. In
the event the investment budget is affected, a prior opinion from the NPD is required. Finally, once
the bill is approved in two debates, it is sent to the Office of the President for endorsement.

During discussion of the draft budget bill, public consultations were conducted through invitations
to associations representing sectors, during which explanations on the composition of the budget

93
   The following draft bills were debated: Finance and Public Credit; tax and contributions; tax exemptions; monetary
regime; laws on the Central Bank; central banking system; laws on monopolies; borrowing authorization; stock
market; economic regulation; National Planning; exchange regime, financial, securities and insurance activities, and
collecting savings.
94
   The following draft bills were debated: organizational budget laws; financial fiscal control system; divestitures and
destination of domestic goods; regulation of the industrial property regime, patents and trademarks; creation, deletion,
alteration, or organization of national public establishments; quality assurance; and prices and administrative
contracting.

and the incidence of assignments or variations were presented as was information on geographical
distribution as was discussed in various regional hearings.

The Chambers have a structure composed of special committees and an administration composed
of a General Secretariat and an Administrative Management units. In its internal organization, each
member of congress has a Legislative Work Unit to support his or her legislative efforts, composed
of staff selected by each member of congress.

Although there are formally established procedures for consideration of the draft budget bill that
are respected in practice (formation of committees to study, debate, and adopt the draft budget bill,
negotiation procedures, and mechanisms of general application for public consultation) but there
is not a technical unit to support the consideration of the draft budget.

18.3 Timing of budget approval

Best practice defines that the budget should be approved before the opening of the fiscal year and
that it draws on each of the last three years.

The dates of approval by the Legislature of the budget laws issued in 2012, 2013, and 2014 were:

As can be seen, the last three draft budget bill submitted by the Government, were approved by
the Congress before the new fiscal year began.

Rules for budget adjustments by the Executive
International best practice states that to avoid undermining the importance of the original budget,
authorization of amendments that concern the Executive branch must be clearly defined and
adjusted in line with its scope, to strict rules and procedures are that are always respected.

Generally speaking there are two broad types of amendments in budgetary provisions:98 those
which alter the sums initially approved in the Budget Law and those that do not. The first type of
amendments require that the Central Government submit draft bills to Congress for approval, with
the prior opinion of the DGNPB, and when the investment budget is affected also from the NPD;
while the latter type consider, depending on their scope, different forms of approvals and
applicable instances, as indicated immediately below.

           •    Amendments requiring law. Additional resources, transfers between operations,
                servicing of debt, and investments at the program and subprogram levels, when the
                source of funding or resource expenditure for a given project, and the total amount of
                each rent level previously approved by Congress is amended.

           •    Amendments by government legislative decree under a state of emergency.99
                Additional credits and transfers to the GBN designed to address expenditures incurred
                under states of emergency.
           •    Amendments by decree. Additions from donations, reductions, and deferrals and
                mergers of agencies.
           •    Amendments by resolution. Inter-ministerial Fund transfers, distributions, resource
                changes without amendments at the revenue level approved by Congress, from
                clarification of legend or correction of arithmetical errors.
           •    By agreement or resolution. Additions from inter-administrative contracts, internal
                transfers for operations, servicing of debt, and investment at the program and sub-
                program levels.
           •    By settlement decree or resolution. Adjustments and authorizations from placement
                of line items.
           •    Ex-officio. Adjustments and authorizations for change of use, use of authorized
                external credit, and funding situation changes.

The established rules are clear and procedures, in general, are respected by the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit and other entities, although these might generate some rigidity in investment
budgets. During the fiscal year of 2014 amendments were made to the GBN, as follows: through
inter-administrative agreements, CoP 179 billion; donations, CoP 10 billion, and budget reductions
of CoP 6,228 billion. Considering these amendments, the final appropriation to December 2014
amounted to CoP 196.9 billion, CoP 6 billion less than originally approved by the Legislature.

3.5   Predictability and Control in Budget Execution

This section presents indicators PI-19 to PI-26 that jointly assess whether the budget is
implemented in an orderly and predictable manner, from the perspective of revenue and
expenditures, as well as the existence of adequate control mechanisms with respect to the proper
use of public funds.

PI-19 Revenue administration

This indicator refers to agencies that manage central government revenue. The capacity to clearly
report to the responsible parties their obligations and procedures to be followed, the extent to which
risk management methods are used, the extent to which existing controls discourage evasion, and
the degree of proper management of late payments are factors that are considered in the
assessment.

The critical period for dimensions 19.1 and 19.2 is the current fiscal year; for dimension 19.3 it is
the last three completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014); and for dimension 19.4 it is the most
recent completed fiscal year (2014). The information used for the assessment was collected in
November and December 2015.

19.1 Rights and obligations for revenue measures

International best practice establishes that agencies that collect most revenues should provide
taxpayers with easy access to complete and updated information about their obligations and rights,
including administrative procedures that allow them to file claims.

The Directorate of National Taxes and Customs (DNTC), the agency that administers about 84
percent of tax revenues, has different service channels (virtual and physical) by which it informs
taxpayers of their obligations, duties, and rights, and provides additional information about the
procedures for filing claims, as indicated immediately below.

Onsite service channel. This medium involves direct assistance to taxpayers in places equipped
for the provision of services. At the time of the assessment, the agency has the following service
points:

       •    Service centers. Some 63 service points, distributed across 43 cities, provide
            personalized attention and deliver information, counseling, and assistance related to tax
            obligations, such as those related to the taxpayer’s unique identification number (RUT),




                                                 77
             digital access, submission of information through files forwarded, and billing. These
             centers use a shift-based scheduling system to organize citizen services.100
        •    Self-serve points (kiosks). These are physically and technologically suitable service
             spaces, located in service centers of the Regional Offices of the Director of National
             Taxes and Customs. While there, taxpayers can self-serve, with the support of officials,
             information on their tax, customs, and exchange returns, among other procedures.
        •    Mobile units. These are workspaces that can be located anywhere, to provide
             information, guidance, and clarification of concerns about the various procedures and
             services provided by DNTC. It facilitates the performance of campaigns on specific tax
             reforms and service.

Virtual channel service. Through the Web Portal: www.dian.gov.co, updated information and
tools are provided to taxpayers to facilitate compliance with fiscal obligations, including assistance
and guidance related to electronic computer services, software support, forums, regulations and
doctrinal information, information on procedures for filing claims or appeals, awareness
campaigns, information contact points, mailboxes for customer support, and training booklets and
videos. Similarly, complaints and claims can be filed by through the quejas@dian.gov.co mailbox
and can be accessed through the chat service of the Contact Center, for consultations about digital
services that address questions and concerns on deadlines and ceilings for tax declarations and
payments and general information.

In addition, informational content has been published on social networks since 2013, fora have
been hosted, articles have been published and educational videos distributed in relation to a
taxpayer culture, as have educational tutorials and videos about taxes and customs.

Telephone service channel. Support is provided through this service to address questions and
provide assistance for the use of electronic information services as well as general information on
procedures and services.

Moreover, training campaigns, discussion days, and service fairs are conducted throughout the
year, in which citizens are advised on the procedures and services provided in the centers, taxpayer
awareness-building, and specific mass-media campaigns for obligations, such as tax returns or
enrollment in the RUT. Citizen-customer outreach campaigns are also performed through email.

Because of the complexity of tax issues in Colombia, DNTC works to improve the language used
in messages and publications, to render them more immediately comprehensible to taxpayers.
Moreover, as an input to improving service and information, service assessments are made and on
ways that communications are delivered to citizens. For customs issues, strategies such as
traveler’s services, strengthening service guidelines, and certificate of origin strategies for customs
users are underway.

   Between January and June 2015, some 532,340 appointments were allocated through telephone and virtual channels
for the following points of contact: Bogota (Customs, International Centre, Bima, Street 75), Bucaramanga,
Barranquilla, Cali (Cali-center, Cali-south), Medellin (Alpujarra, country headquarters), Ibagué, Neiva (headquarters,
Pitalito), Pereira, Santa Marta, Yopal, Manizales, Valledupar, Arauca, Villavicencio, Cartagena, and Armenia.


                                                         78
In consideration of these efforts, it is evident that DNTC has developed the capability to help
taxpayers more clearly learn of their obligations and the procedures for filing complaints.

19.2 Revenue risk management

International best practice states that institutions that raise the bulk of revenues should use a
comprehensive, structured, and systematic approach to evaluating and prioritizing compliance
risks for all revenue categories and at a minimum for taxpayers with large and medium-sized
incomes.

In its organizational structure, DNTC has seven offices of director, including the Office of the
Director for Organizational Management, a unit that is responsible for the coordination and
administration of customs and tax risk through the Office of the Deputy Director of Operational
Analysis Management and coordinating groups for Administration and Risk Profiling and
Facilitation Control Programs.

Currently, DNTC has a taxpayer risk model composed of five elements: indicators, basic
information, statistical tools, interpretation processes, and a risk scoring module. There are three
types of indicators, those for consistency, based on operational logic applied between cross-
checking statements; behavior, based on taxpayer history; and the cross-referencing statements.
This information is segmented by various criteria (production sector, economic activity, revenue,
and other), analyzed with the support of statistical packages, and finally combined and
consolidated in a risk model called Single Points Model (SPM).

The SPM is used as a benchmark to prioritize certain customs and exchange processes, and for
controls to refunds; however, there is no full connection with a variety of control programs that
are designed in parallel. It should also be noted that there are actions that are not derived from the
SPM or other programs, which originate for special reasons, such as those from third-party
claims,101 or those selected directly by the administrations. The lack of linkage and the different
ways in which controls can lead to inefficiencies and reduce the integrity of revenue risk control
are issues of concern.

19.3 Revenue audit and investigation

To ensure the collection of expected fiscal revenues, there is a need for robust systems for audits
and investigation, which, once risks are identified, applies effective controls to minimize tax
evasion and non-compliance. To assess this, international best practice states that institutions that
collect a large share of public revenue complete all fraud investigations and audits under a
documented plan aimed at improving compliance with legal obligations.

DNTC has an operating plan and audit and investigations planning for most of the control measures
that are defined from the central level in the Office of Deputy Director for Operational Analysis.



101
   For assessment purposes of the indicator, these circumstances have no effect on the treatment of risk management
or its integrality.


                                                        79
Other investigations and audits arise in different ways during the course of the year,102 without
prior scheduling.

For 2014 there was no evidence of the existence of a plan that had a definite initial goal for the
number of audits and investigations to be conducted, a circumstance that precluded assessing the
level of compliance at the end of that year. In contrast, it was seen for 2016 that through the
document “Assessment Guidelines for Tax Management” goals were set for the number of actions
to be undertaken, a fact to be considered in future measurements. It is important to note that until
2011 the law103 provided that DNTC should meet a minimum coverage of actions for 20 percent
of the total number of filers, but this provision was repealed104 in the face of certain adverse effects
on management efficiency, consequently there is currently no goal in place in terms of the coverage
to be performed over the assessment period.

Although DNTC does not have a numerical target for audit and investigation , it has program goals
based on an expected return resulting from management control expressed as a monetary value, as
shown in Table 3.12.

                        Table 3.12. DNTC Tax Division Management Targets 2012-2014

This manner of establishing a management goal, as was expressed during the meetings with the
Offices of Deputy Directors of Operations and of Enforcement, presents methodological problems
as well as constraints to tracking, despite the definitions of indicators and variables used to measure
both the potential generated proceeds of enforcement actions such as effective collections that are
described in the Tax Management Assessment Guidelines.

Planning in the customs division, unlike that for taxes, included the number of enforcement actions
or apprehensions to be completed in the year, in addition to a managed collections goal. The
scheduling and the results are shown in Table 3.13.

As in the tax division’s management goal, represented by a revenue amount to be collected, there
are consistency issues reflected in substantial over-execution for the three years, particularly for
effective management in 2014, which exceeded the initial target by more than six-fold. With
respect to the number of actions scheduled and executed, high average levels of compliance are
observed, as was planned for in the last three years.

Given all this, and because it was only possible to establish compliance with the actions or
investigations in the customs division, it was necessary to establish their relative weight using the
share of external tax revenue to the account of the customs division out of the total DNTC revenue;
this amounts to 16.5 percent.105 Therefore, the conclusion is that less than 50 percent of audits and
investigations are completed as planned.

19.4 Revenue arrears monitoring

International best practices establish that fiscal revenue administrations should pay particular
attention to managing late payments, to ensure that the amounts owed to the Government are
effectively managed and that processes are established that allow accelerating payment of said
debt. As a parameter in valuing collections management, revenue in arrears at the close of the last
completed fiscal year is set below 10 percent of total collections for the fiscal year, and revenue in
arrears for more than 12 months represents less than 25 percent of total arrears for the year.

tax debts, DNTC’s Office of Deputy Director for Collections and Recovery, and for revenue
collected, the DGPP. Amounts owed and total tax revenues for the years 2013 and 2012 are
additionally included (see Table 3.14).

The proportion of revenue in arrears to total revenue is 16 percent, of which 19 percent corresponds
to the amount of the debts generated over the past 12 months, with 81 percent of the remaining
amount resulting from debts older than one year. It merits highlighting that of the total accumulated
debt at the end of 2014, approximately 60 percent corresponds to obligations contained in
administrative acts and the remaining 40 percent originates from private filers.

PI-20 Accounting for revenue

The efficiency of the tax system depends largely on the timing and diligence with which collections
are made available to the authorities of the National Revenue to finance the provision of public
goods and services. This indicator assesses the efficiency of the Central Government’s Fiscal
Administration in consolidating and analyzing information on revenue collection in a timely
fashion. The information used in the evaluation corresponds to the moment of assessment (i.e.,
November and December 2015, during the field mission).

20.1 Information on revenue collections

This dimension assesses the extent to which information regarding amounts collected is compiled,
recorded, and communicated in a timely fashion. Best practices require that the Ministry of
Finance receive data regarding the amounts collected from the agencies that generate all central
government revenues, disaggregated by type of revenue and consolidated in a report.

The public agencies that collect various revenues use the physical and technological infrastructure
of certain financial sector companies that handle collections, to receive tax returns and payments;
as valuable consideration for the financial services rendered, the agencies make use of a reciprocity
scheme consisting in allowing a float of a number of days in which money is held in the accounts
of the financial institution before being deposited to specific Treasury accounts authorized for said
purpose in each agency.

Under the existing collections mechanism funds enter weekly for most of the revenues collected
by DNTC and monthly for other revenue (e.g., fees collected by other agencies), and is recorded
in the information system. Once this information is in hand, the Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit conducts a data consistency verification process, after which it produces annual execution
reports by type of revenue and period.

At the portal www.pte.gov.co, and through a custom revenue query, access is enabled so any
citizen can obtain monthly statistical information on cash collections, refunds, and net collections
(cash collection-refunds), disaggregated by type of revenue and periods.

20.2 Transfer of revenue collections

The dimension assesses the frequency of revenue transfers to Treasury accounts or those of other
designated agencies. Best practices provide that the revenue be deposited directly into treasury
accounts or that it be transferred daily from other accounts to treasury accounts.

In Colombia, as was noted, there is a reciprocity scheme used as valuable consideration for the
services provided by financial institutions, consisting in allowing funds to remain at the
intermediary financial institution a certain number of days. Currently, and following a gradual
reduction process established in the agreement between DNTC and collections agencies,106 the
number of days has progressively declined until arriving as of March 1, 2012 to five calendar days,
two of which are fixed and three variable, that are awarded based on factors of quality, timeliness
of information, and number of documents.

Under the reciprocity scheme, the revenues collected are transferred after the expiry of the days
each financial institution is allowed into treasury accounts.

20.3 Revenue accounts reconciliation

This dimension establishes as a best practice a complete reconciliation of the appraisals (returns),
collections, arrears, and transfers of revenue to the treasury be performed at least once a month,
within the month following collection.

At present, the reconciliation that takes place between the tax administration (DNTC is the agency
that collects most of the revenues of the Central Government) and the Treasury focuses on
controlling transfers of revenue from the revenue collection agency and the values entered in the
treasury accounts. No reconciliations are made that, in addition to the actual revenue, identify the
values unpaid on returns or generated by official acts (appraisals), or the values that are collected
or could be collected through better management of collections and arrears.

This limitation prevents fully identifying the resources entering the system and those that could
potentially enter in the short term.

PI-21 Predictability of in-year resource allocation

This indicator assesses the extent to which the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has the
capacity to forecast payment commitments and provide reliable information on the availability of
funds to budget units for the provision of services. The scope of the assessment is the Central
Government and the critical period for dimension 21.1 is the time of evaluation (November and
December 2015), and for dimensions 21.2, 21.3, and 21.4 it is the last completed fiscal year (2014).

21.1 Consolidation of cash balances

Good practice dictates that all bank and central government cash balances are consolidated on a
daily basis.

Colombia has a Treasury Single Account (TSA) through which the whole process of collection,
transfer, management, and rotation of resources made by the bodies that constitute the General
Budget of the Nation, are centralized in the TSA, with the exception of those administering
parafiscal income and social security.107

A total of 4,873 accounts of different types currently exist under the system as noted in Table 3.15.

The balances of the accounts managed directly by the Treasury, corresponding to about 85 percent
of the value of the budget, that are transferred to entities are known or consolidated daily; however,
there are other accounts called Collection Accounts-Commercial Banks, which collect agency
revenues under a reciprocity agreement with the Treasury and hold them for a specified number
of days that compensate the banks for their administrative efforts and costs. In these accounts,
commercial banks move resources to the TSA once the term granted as payment mechanism for
their services has been reached; in most cases, the term as stipulated by the agreement is five days,
but occasionally it is up to 30 days.108 Based on this scheme, all the sums received by these accounts
and the available balances are consolidated once the days of reciprocity are met. The revenue

   Days vary depending on the financial service bank collection and complexity of the operation; for example
payments for military compensation.


                                                        85
managed by DNTC operates under different framework, whereby collecting entities register the
monies in their own accounting records (suspense accounts) for subsequent transfer to the TSA.
They do not have their own bank accounts linked to the TSA. The concept is known as ‘collecting
entities with transfer obligations to the Treasury.’

In addition to the these accounts, there are TSA payment accounts for entities to pay directly to
beneficiaries when geographical or other limitations prevent TSA from making direct payments to
beneficiaries.109 These transfers of resources to entities must be executed to beneficiaries within a
maximum of five days,110 but the initial, final, and average balances, as well as credits and debits
are known monthly as the bank statements are obtained. The control of these accounts is made
from the information in the bank statements that are used to calculate the average number of days
that the money has stayed in the account (maximum five days), and the agency’s rate of execution
(minimum 80 percent). These accounts use the commercial banks’ reciprocity scheme as a
mechanism to determine their financial services fee.

Through TSA operations, all balances are consolidated for both revenue and accounts for monthly
expenses.

21.2 Cash forecasting and monitoring

Best practice for this dimension of the indicator uses as a benchmark the preparation by the
Government of a cash flow forecast for the fiscal year, which is updated monthly on the basis of
actual cash flows.
In Colombia there is a short-term financial instrument for the execution of revenue and
expenditures known as the Annual Monthly-Based Cash Program (AMCP),111 by which the
monthly amount of funds available is defined in the Treasury Single Account for payment of
commitments made in the course of appropriations incorporated in the Budget and financed with
the Nation’s resources.

The AMCP is a forecast that assigns monthly quotas that are built from the appropriation of budget
resources with a time horizon, annual in principle, but which can be extended for a second fiscal
period if the total resource appropriation for the agency cannot be distributed for each line item.
Based on this scheduling, agencies can commit expenses up to their total budget for two fiscal
periods, one for expenditures made within 12 months, such as wages or overheads, and another for
the remaining AMCP resources that were not used and which can be rescheduled in a second
period.

Scheduling monthly quotas is dynamic and can be modified by the agency based on actual needs
by means of deferrals when there are surplus resources in the AMCP quota assigned or AMCP
advances if the agency requires more funds in the month. The former do not require authorization;

for the latter, application is required within a deadline set by the Office of the Director General for
Public Credit and National Revenue.

For its part, control of cash availability is performed at the beginning of the year through several
scenarios of revenue and monthly expenditure forecasts, and throughout the course of the year,
monthly monitoring of revenue and payments can identify in advance any treasury deficit or
surplus. As a control mechanism, AMCP estimates by expenditure item on the basis of actual
execution and the historic lag that has been recorded by agencies, and these are distributed in the
last quarter of the year.

21.3 Information on commitment ceilings

A best practice applicable to this dimension is that budgetary units should be able to plan and
commit to expenditures at least six months in advance, based on budgeted credits, and information
on cash plans and commitments.

The budget execution process in Colombia begins with an appropriation, which corresponds to the
maximum authorized amount per commitment by object of expenditure during the fiscal year (the
commitment arises from the acts and contracts issued or held by public bodies); following this, a
Budget Availability Certificate is issued, guaranteeing that a budget appropriation is available and
is unallocated; then the budget record is created through which the appropriation is finally effected;
the obligation and the payment reflect the fulfillment of the commitments, and payment is rendered
after verification of the requirements provided in the administrative act or contract.

This budget allocation process is effected by the AMCP instrument described in the preceding
dimension, in the stages of commitment, obligation, and payment; that is to say, it is not only a
cash plan or program, but also includes a payments program based on appropriations and execution
trends, so that agencies could be able to program the full period in advance.

21.4 Significance of in-year budget adjustments

A best practice benchmark used for this dimension of the indicator is to take a maximum of two
significant adjustments in budget allocations for the year, which are undertaken in a transparent
and predictable manner.

During 2014, expenditures and revenues of the budget were modified and the initial appropriation
of CoP 203 billion was increased through donations and agreements in the insignificant amount of
CoP 189 billion, representing less than 0.1 percent, followed by one significant reduction in the
amount of CoP 6.23 billion that was approved by decree112 issued in application of Articles 76 and
77 of the Organizational Budget Statute (OBS) and pursuant to the authorization granted by the
Council of Ministers at its November 26, 2014 session. The final appropriation was CoP 196.96

The reduction of appropriations, as explained in the grounds for the decree, was performed in a
transparent manner to adjust the budget to actual implementation capacity, ensure the execution of
ongoing projects, and ensure compliance with the main goals of the National Development Plan.
Items that were reduced correspond to operating expenditures of CoP 2.3 billion, CoP 1.5 billion
for servicing of debt, and CoP 2.4 billion for investment.

It should be noted that the reduction was properly based on the power legally granted to the
Government to reduce or defer all or part of the budgetary appropriations in any given month of
the fiscal year, upon prior opinion of the Council of Ministers; and that it conformed to the legal
norm that such an action can only be undertaken in cases that the law itself sets forth: (i) when
revenue collections in the year are lower than total expenditures and obligations to be paid from
such funds; (ii) that new funds were not approved by Congress or if those approved were to prove
insufficient to cover the expenditures; (iii) when authorized credit funds are not formalized; and
(iv) when so mandated by macroeconomic logic.

PI-22 Expenditure arrears

This indicator measures the volume of arrears, whether such arrears correspond to a systemic
problem, and whether arrears are under control. The critical period for dimension 22.1 is the last


                                                                88
three completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014) and for dimension 22.2 the period is the time
of assessment (November and December 2015).

Arrears are overdue debts, liabilities, or obligations that constitute a form of non-transparent
financing. Arrears can lead to increased costs for the Government because creditors can adjust
prices to compensate for the delays in payment. A large volume of arrears can indicate underlying
problems, such as inadequate controls on commitments, cash availability issues, inadequate
budgeting for goods and services.

22.1 Stock of expenditure arrears

Best practice states that the balance of arrears in expenditures should not be more than 2 percent
of total expenditures in at least two of the last three years.


The base used to set the stock of debts payable at the close of each period were the obligations that
were left unpaid for the next fiscal year, for goods or services received to satisfaction as of
December 31, when down payments were agreed to in the performance of a contract and these
advances were not paid. The values of budget reserves are not included because, although they are
legally established and have a budget record, their purpose has not yet been fulfilled. For its part,
the value of obligations corresponding to the required commitment sums sets the value of total
expenditures, equivalent to the value of goods received, services rendered, and other current
liabilities awaiting payment, including unpaid advances.

As shown in Table 3.17, for the three years under assessment, the amount of accounts payable,
represented more than 6 percent of total expenditure, but less than 10 percent.

22.2 Expenditure arrears monitoring

This dimension uses as a best practice benchmark the generation of quarterly reports within the
four weeks at the end of each quarter, containing data on the size, ageing, and composition of
arrears in payments.

At present, information is produced annually on the volume of arrears and their composition by
institution, but not by ageing of accounts payable. Annual budget execution reports, in turn, track
the backlogs of accounts receivable from the previous period and accounts payable from the
current period.

It is important to note that although a periodic report on Accounts Payable is generated, the IFIS
can identify arrears and calculate their ageing, as the PEFA mission team noted in the report
processed and delivered by the MFPC.

PI-23 Payroll controls

This indicator solely relates to the administration of the payroll of public servants, with emphasis
on change management and consistency with individual records. For dimensions 23.1, 23.2, and
23.3 the critical period is at the time of the assessment; for assessment of dimension 23.4, the
period is the three most recently completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014).

The following ministries and public agencies were selected for this assessment: Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit (MFPC), National Ministry of Education, Ministry of Transportation,
Ministry of Health and Social Protection, and the National Apprenticeship Service.

23.1 Integration of payroll information and personnel records

Best practices indicate that the approved staff list, database, and payroll are directly linked to
ensure budget control, data consistency, and monthly reconciliation.




                                                90
There is no centrally managed payroll in Colombia for the public sector and an integrated database
is not available. Each agency, with support from a human resources unit, is responsible for
managing its payroll. They use a variety of technology applications to this end, which process the
events that have occurred with their staff. Each agency through its own payroll system is
responsible, as a measure to ensure the quality of payroll data, to forward, each month, payroll
information to IFIS, to request payments through the TSA.

No reconciliation or verification control whatsoever is performed from the IFIS, except as related
to the availability of budget and the accounting records. This indicates a disconnection between
the information handled individually and the system that activates payments, the latter of which is
subject to the reliability of the information each user agency uploads.

23.2 Management of payroll changes

Best practice indicates that the necessary changes to personnel records and payroll are updated at
least monthly, usually in time for the next month’s payments. The occurrence of retroactive
adjustments should not be common. A maximum number of adjustments, equal to 3 percent of
salary payments, is confirmation of the reliability of the data.

As mentioned in dimension 23.1, personnel changes are handled from each agency and given the
diversity of applications that are used, there are no statistics regarding retroactive adjustments to
enable verification of this best practice at a unified or integrated information level. This
information is not available in the ministries and agencies selected for assessment.

23.3 Internal control of payroll

Under best practice, the authority to change records and payroll should be restricted and result in
an audit trail that is adequate to ensure complete data integrity.

As mentioned in dimension 23.1, each agency delegates the authority under its responsibility to
manage changes in the human resources or equivalent units, always subject to the rules of fiscal
responsibility and internal controls based on the Standard Internal Control Model (SICM). In the
ministries selected, the Internal Control Offices (ICOs) stated that payroll is reconciled monthly
and there are no material retroactive adjustments. However, they did not provide specific statistics.

Some internal audit reports of the agencies selected for assessment reveal inconsistencies in payroll
processes, but such exceptions do not involve material amounts or risks. Although there are, in
each selected agency, operating and procedures manuals for the human resources and payroll
process, there are no assurance reports with respect to the effectiveness of such internal controls
by the ICOs or the Central Government.

23.4 Payroll audit

Best practice requires the existence of a strong system of annual payroll audits, to determine the
existence of control weaknesses or “ghost” employees.




                                                 91
Three of the sample ministries (MED, MHSP, MT) replied to PEFA mission queries about payroll
audits. From their responses it was found that in the last three years, at least three of the OCI
performed internal audits of human resources departments, but these were only on with respect to
segments of the process or specific points and not on the payroll system as such. The Central
Government also lacks specific reports on audit coverage of payroll.

PI-24 Procurement

This indicator examines the key aspects of management of government procurement. It focuses on
the transparency of the arrangements and emphasizes open and competitive procedures, tracking
results of procurement and access to appeal and resolution procedures. For all dimensions the last
completed fiscal year (2014) is used as the critical period. Given autonomy in contracting available
to each agency, the budget executors represented in Table 3.18 were selected (on the basis of the

there is an exception to the statute on basis of the type of contract (e.g., derived from credit
contracts) or of the state agency (e.g., National Fund for Development Projects, Adaptation Fund,
or domestic public utilities companies) the Special Regime applies as set out in law, and
publication of contracting documents of the procurement process is mandatory.114

In 2011, the Government established the National Public Procurement Agency (NPPA) as the
governing body for public procurement to develop and promote public policies and strategies
targeted at ensuring that the public procurement and contracting system obtains optimum results
in terms of the valuation of public money through a transparent process.115 This agency has
designed and implemented the Electronic Public Procurement System (EPPS). This system (now
in version EPPS II) ensures that state agencies comply with the disclosure requirements of the
different acts issued in contractual processes and that parties interested in participating in the
procurement process (including bidders, oversight bodies, and the citizenry in general) can check
the status of the various contracting rules and elements.

24.1 Procurement monitoring

Best practices establish that databases or records should be kept in respect to contracting, including
data on purchases, the value of contracts, and the successful tenderer thereof. The data must be
accurate and complete for all methods of procurement of goods, services, and works.

Overall, in 2014 EPPS recorded CoP 94.5 billion from 760,643 public procurement processes.
According to NPPA estimates, in 2014 58 percent of the entities published their annual
procurement plans in EPPS. This means that the entry and active use of the system is still pending
on the part of a substantial group of public sector agencies. The participation rate is rising, in part
because of the legal requirement and the agility of EPPS II. To date, no quantitative study is in
hand regarding the annual contracting sums of the Central Government that are not using the EPPS;
however, the NPPA estimates that most of the gaps relate to local governments and other non-
Central Government agencies.

In Colombia, each agency autonomously conducts its contracting processes, in line with the rule
of law and various regulations,116 and has the responsibility of preserving relevant files and records
of all procurement processes. Public agencies are required to publish the documents and
administrative acts of the contracting process in the EPPS, within three days of their being issued.
(The offer that must be published is that of the winner of the contracting process). State agencies
are also required to make public in EPPS in a timely fashion the notice of a call or invitation that
meets a minimum threshold and the draft specifications, to enable interested parties to submit
comments or request clarifications.117 In 2012, NPPA modified the design of EPPS and in 2013 it
deployed the Colombian Government Virtual Store for consolidated purchases. Finally, in March
2015, it deployed EPPS II.

EPPS II advances from a mere notification instrument to a transactional platform that allows
buyers and vendors to undertake the contracting process online. From their account, state agencies
(buyers) can create and award contracting processes, and record and monitor contract execution.
Vendors can also have their own account, find business opportunities, monitor processes, and send
comments and submit their tenders. EPPS II is a publicly available “virtual shop”118 containing
information on acquisitions, purchases, the value of contracts, and the successful tenderer thereof.

NPPA annually checks that the registration information matches the process documents published.
Once the process is completed, NPPA asks state agencies to correct the registry information that
does not match the documents and also shares this information with the Office of the Attorney
General of the Republic. Additionally, NPPA forwards a report on activity in EPPS every month
to the Secretaries General of 240 state agencies (sector heads at the national level and some
decentralized entities and capitals) so they can check information quality.

With respect to technology, NPPA has incorporated and verified the technical safety and data
quality requirements at the time of selecting each one of the EPPS platforms. In 2015, it carried
out an internal audit on the subject of information security under the ISO 27001 international
standard; it also hired a consultant to strengthen the information security management system
under the same standard, and it is currently is in the process of implementing the recommendations
from both reports.

In particular, EPPS II uses communications through secure protocols and other security
mechanisms to ensure data integrity, access to the platform, and the confidentiality of tenders.
Additionally, timestamps are incorporated along with a log with all user actions on the platform.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no reports are yet available from the Central Government or
external auditors on the security of the EPPS.

24.2 Procurement methods

International best practices indicate that in the last year assessed, the total value of contracts
awarded through competitive methods should represent at least 80 percent of total contracting.
Pursuant to the Colombian legal framework, mainly the contracting statute,119 competitive bidding
should be privileged, but there are many exceptions where contracting can be performed directly,
including:
         (i)     Minor amounts (values determined according to the annual budgets of the agencies to
                 which the law applies and expressed in minimum monthly legal wages)
         (ii)    Borrowings
         (iii)   Inter-administrative, with the exception of insurance contracts
         (iv)    For the delivery of professional services or for the execution of artistic works that can
                 only be awarded to certain natural or legal persons or for the direct performance of
                 scientific or technological activities
         (v)     Lease or purchase of buildings
         (vi)    Manifest urgency

             public markets.
      (xii) Contracts entered into by state agencies for the provision of health services
      (xiii) Acts and contracts whose direct object are commercial and industrial activities
             specific to state-owned companies and mixed-economy companies, with the exception
             of contracts identified specifically by Article 32 of this Law.

According to the NPPA, under the “special regime” modality, which represents 28 percent of
contracting, both competitive processes as well as non-competitive processes are recorded. The
latter have the quality of direct contracting within the exceptions of the statute noted in the previous
paragraph.

At the date of this assessment, no information was available that would enable one to distinguish
the amounts within the “special regime” that constitute direct contracting. According to the NPPA,
it is very complex to differentiate between each mode because an individual review of contracts is
required, and clarification is made that under the “special regime” line there are also competitive
methods that are widely used. Although one cannot draw a statistical inference, it is noted that
when considering the contracting of the agencies in the sample, most of their contracts (more than
over 50 percent) used the direct contracting method, suggesting that uncertainty on this matter is
reasonable.

As can be established from the preceding paragraphs, at the time of this PEFA assessment, it is not
possible to ascertain the actual amount of direct contracting in manner to establish the
corresponding percentages of competitive methods, and therefore, it is not possible to perform the
calibration required by the PEFA framework for this dimension.

24.3 Public access to procurement information

Under best practices, key information should be available for public access, comprising:

           •   The legal and regulatory framework for public procurement
           •   Public procurement plans
           •   Tendering opportunities
           •   The awarding of contracts (purpose, contractor, and value)
           •   Data on the resolution of claims or procurement complaints
           •   Annual contracting statistics.

In EPPS, which is publicly accessible,121 information can be obtained on the legal and regulatory
framework for public procurement, including various circulars issued by NPPA to guide agencies
and potential vendors in the use of the system. There is also a feature for entering queries, and
responses of the governing body are published. In addition, procurement plans, bidding
opportunities, the awarding of contracts (purpose, contractor, and value), including the minutes of
award and annual contracting statistics, are available on the public page of EPPS.

The same does not apply to data on the resolution of claims or complaints on procurement.
Colombia has no specialized court with respect to procurement and all appeals or their equivalent
must to be submitted before ordinary courts administered by the Judiciary; moreover, there is no
publicly available database on court judgments on each lawsuit. Such records fall within the
regular court publishing process provided in law—a process that typically takes more than one
year, largely discouraging interest in making use of such resources.

24.4 Procurement complaints management

Under best practices, claims must be examined by a specially established body that:

           •   Is not involved in any capacity in procurement transactions or in the process leading to
               contract award decisions
           •   Applies no charges (these could make access prohibitive to stakeholders)
           •   Follows clearly established processes for the submission and resolution of complaints
           •   Possesses the authority to suspend the procurement process
           •   Issues decisions within the timeframe specified in the rules/regulations
           •   Issues decisions that are binding on every party (without precluding subsequent access
               to an external higher authority).

As noted in discussion of dimension 24.3, in Colombia there is no such specialized body. Claim
options need to be submitted to the ordinary courts, which do not use systematic processes targeted

at establishing the validity and relevance of the cases appealed (i.e., each judge of his or her own
accord and without time limits, produces judgments that can lead to a long appeals process, until
all instances within the provisions of Colombian law have been exhausted).

In fact, appeals per se do not stop the contracting process or execution of contracts already
awarded, which is the reason why judgments are frequently rendered after the contracts have been
wound up—a circumstance that often produces significant sentences against the Nation, in claims
for damages associated with contract awards. Therefore, the required best practice criteria are not
met in Colombia.

PI-25 Internal controls on non-salary expenditure

This indicator measures the effectiveness of internal controls for non-wage expenditures. The
period of analysis used for this assessment is the moment of assessment (November and December
2015).

25.1 Segregation of duties

Best practices indicate that proper segregation of duties is implemented through the expenditures
process and when responsibilities are clearly established. The main responsibilities to be
segregated are (i) authorization, (ii) recording, (iii) custody of assets, and (iv) reconciliation or
audit.




                                                 97
Internal Control in Colombia includes a regulatory framework characterized by the Internal
Control Law122and the SICM.123 Similarly, for the budget execution process and for payments there
are rules and procedures that safeguard adequate separation of functions.

Within the existing rules, the budget execution process includes mechanisms for segregation of
incompatible functions, which at the level of registrations and requests for payment are defined by
access profiles to IFIS, which constitutes the means of access to the TSA.124 Each agency in the
Central Government has financial units responsible for managing the modules that initiate
operations in which segregation of duties is required. Public agencies, in accordance with the
requirements of the internal control standards, have operating manuals and procedures that define
the allocation of responsibilities for authorization, registration, safekeeping of assets, and audits
of different officials and agency departments. As assessed for the MFPC, Ministry of Health and
Social Protection, Ministry of Transportation, and Ministry of National Education, the ICO control
manuals and procedures clearly set out the control responsibilities to ensure substantial
compliance.

25.2 Effectiveness of expenditure commitment controls

Best practice indicates that comprehensive controls on the commitment of expenditure are
effective if they limit the generation of commitments to cash availability and allocations approved
by the budget.

In Colombia controls on the commitment of expenditure, in addition to being included in budget
rules, are coordinated through compliance with the budgeting process in the IFIS II application,
which does not allow altering the budget chain and ensures that the expenditure commitments are
limited to the availability provided under the plan and cash scheduling. This fiscal rule, among
others, has enabled Colombia access to well-developed debt markets.

All Central Government member institutions comply with budgetary management connected to
the Single Account to effect payment. The IFIS securely prevents the recording of sums exceeding
the commitment and does not allow proceeding with a payment that exceeds those values. No
exceptions or anomalies have been reported by auditors or recorded by the IFIS.



25.3 Compliance with payment rules and procedures

Under best practices, all payments must be made using established procedures, based on available
evidence and all exceptions authorized in advance and justified.

The payment process is fundamentally standardized by the IFIS II payments module—
“treasury/payment macro process”—which controls payments based on the recorded availability
of the cash plan and monthly cash payments program.
The five selected agencies have internal systems of accounts payable and payments, aligned with
budgeting rules and the Single Account, and it was observed that they retain the payment records.
The reports of the ICO do no indicate any objections to individual payment systems. It was also
observed that the IFIS in turn produces evidence of the respective payments that are made only by
transfer to beneficiaries.

Justified exceptions only occur when the account of a beneficiary for payments has been attached
and the procedure established by legal rules regarding attached funds is followed. The budget cycle
does not allow entry of a commitment to paying an account without having previously enabled the
budget for the payment thereof. In 2014, the Central Government issued a report with a clean
opinion on budget execution, which includes the payment cycle.

PI-26 Internal audit

This indicator assesses the standards and procedures applied in internal audit. Internal audit, when
applied under best practices through a systematic and disciplined approach, is an important support
for the sustainability of the internal control system.

The critical period for dimensions 26.1, 26.2, and 26.3 is the time of the assessment (November
and December 2015), taking into account the preceding year (2014); the critical period for the 26.4
dimension is relevant reports issued in the last three completed fiscal years. Internal audits were
selected for this indicator, which in Colombia are produced by Internal Control Offices (ICOs)
belonging to the following agencies, which were selected because of the volume of their budget
transactions: National Ministry of Education, Ministry of Transportation (MT), Ministry of Health
and Social Protection (MHSP), and the National Apprenticeship Service.

26.1 Coverage of internal audit

Under international best practices an internal audit needs to function properly in all agencies of the
Central Government.

In Colombia, the legal and technical framework for internal control is governed by the Civil
Service Administration Department (CSAD), which the requirement for all ICOs to produce audit
plans and work programs, evidentiary documentation, results reports, and follow-up activities to
achieve the objectives of the internal audit, as described in international standards.

In accordance with the Internal Control Law125 and the regulations for Central Government
agencies,126 the Heads of Internal Control are appointed and removed by the President of the
Republic, which supports their independence from the highest executive authority of each agency.
The CSAD provides the ICOs with the technical framework for their efforts,127 assesses the
performance of the ICO heads, but it does not comprehensively monitor the work of these offices.
Manuals and/or technical guides and reports from the ICOs of selected agencies confirm that, in
terms of the work planned and executed, the internal audit function is implemented across the CG.

26.2 Nature of audits and standards applied

Best practices indicate that internal audit activities should focus on the assessment of the adequacy
and effectiveness of internal controls. In a similar manner, there should be a quality assurance
process within the internal audit function, and audit activities must adhere to professional
standards, including risk assessment techniques.

In accordance with the Internal Audits Guide promulgated by the CSAD, ICO efforts include a
focus on the adequacy of the Institutional Internal Control System (IICS), which is based on the
SICM approved in Colombia, and on the production of annually issued status reports on the state
(implementation) of the components of the IICS.128 However, to date, reports have not been issued
that address the effectiveness of the internal controls applied.

The practice of the ICOs reflects much of the International Professional Practices Framework
(IPPF), which essentially serves as the Audit Guide for ICOs. However, adjustment of its practice
is pending to update this framework. The internal audit plans are prepared based on a risk analysis
in accordance with methodologies of acknowledged technical value provided by CSAD. In the
case of the ICOs selected for PEFA review, no formal evidence of the existence and operation of
a system of quality assurance is found.

26.3 Implementation of internal audits and reporting

Under international best practice, annual audits programs should be in place and accordingly
executed, and the internal audit reports should be produced.

OCI reports are sent to the highest executive authority of the respective agency and to the authority
responsible for the area audited.

According to the detailed assessment of the ICOs selected for this assessment, it has been
established that the plans and programs compared to results reports exceed 88 percent efficiency.
Table 3.20 indicates the level of compliance with stated internal audit plans. (The Table draws on
CSAD records that are based on reports produced by 219 national agencies—roughly comparable
to the Central Government—and that are summarized in the Annual Executive Report for Internal
Control for the 2014 period.)

26.4 Response to internal audits

Under best practice, for all auditees, the administration provides a complete response to the
recommendations within the 12 months following the issuance of the internal audit report.

In accordance with current regulations, the authorities of the agencies under internal audit in the
Central Government are obliged to answer for the findings and recommendations reported by
ICOs.

According to the detailed assessment of the ICOs selected for this assessment, it has been
established that for reports issued in the last three years (2013, 2014, and 2015), the institutional
authorities have responded to the ICO findings and have done so in a period not exceeding 12
months after the date of delivery of the reports.

3.6    Accounting and Reporting

This section describes indicators PI-27 to PI-29 to assess whether relevant information is recorded
properly to provide timely information for decision-making.

PI-27 Financial data integrity

This indicator assesses the extent to which the bank accounts of the Treasury, the provisional
accounts, and advances are regularly reconciled, and whether operational processes support the
integrity of financial data. The critical period for the assessment of dimensions 27.1, 27.2, and 27.3
is 2014 (with information provided at the time of assessment, while that for dimension 27.4 is the
information applicable as of the time of the assessment (November and December 2015).

The following agencies of the Central Government were selected for this indicator: MFPC, MED,
MT, MHSP, and the National Apprenticeship Service (NAS).

27.1 Bank account reconciliation

Under best practices, reconciliation of all active bank accounts of the CG should be performed at
least weekly at the aggregate and detailed levels, within the week following the weekly period to
which they refer.

Reconciliation processes as regulated by the General Accounting Office (GAO), in the Public
Accounting Framework (PAF), correspond to each Public Accounting Agency,129 based on
Resolution 357 of 2008, which sets forth that these agencies shall internally establish their own
procedure wherein they shall determine the frequency and person responsible for the said activity,
as well as setting forth the actions of an administrative, budgetary, accounting, and fiscal type that
could be derived therefrom (Law 87 of 1993).

   Resolution 357 of July 23, 2008, by which the procedure is adopted for internal accounting control and delivery of
the annual assessment report to the General Accounting Office.


                                                        102
Reconciliations of the TSA under Treasury control are performed at the detailed level within three
weeks after the closing to which they refer. In the case of the closing ended December 31, 2014,
these were available on January 15, 2015.

With respect to bank accounts authorized for public sector agencies, which are not under the direct
control of the Treasury, the CG has reported objections regarding weaknesses in their cash
accounts amounting to CoP 1.81 billion,130 including problems with bank reconciliations. Of the
agencies selected for this PEFA assessment, NAS was challenged by the CG because of persisting
debit reconciling items on its records totaling CoP 979,322 million, and CoP 493,592 million
pending crediting, aged up to 16 years, from fiscal 1999 until 2014 (i.e., pending adjustment in
subsidiary ledgers). In addition to the PEFA sample set, other national agencies, such as the
National Penitentiary and Prisons Institute and the Agricultural Guarantee Fund, also received
material objections in the handling of their bank accounts and reconciliations. Therefore,
timeliness in preparing reconciliations cannot be generalized, especially for accounts outside the
control of the Treasury.

27.2 Suspense accounts

Best practices indicate that the reconciliation of transitional or interim accounts should be prepared
at least monthly, within the month following the period to which it relates. Transitional accounts
are cleared in timely fashion, no later than the end of the fiscal year unless duly justified.

As indicated in the discussion of 27.1, account reconciliations in general are regulated according
to the Public Accounting Framework (PAF) and regulations for the closing of the current
accounting period.131 In accordance with established deadlines, reconciliations of these accounts
must be made on a monthly basis and, by the end of the fiscal year, they have a 45-day window
after the closing to which they refer.

The DGPCNR confirmed it does not manage suspense accounts; however, footnote 5 of Table 3.9
of the 2014 Report of the GAO on the balance sheet, indicates that there are funds in transit for
CoP 1.5 billion at the end of 2014. This account includes transferred securities pending
confirmation by the receiving public accounting agency, including monies collected under
agreements with financial institutions pending transfer to the accounts of the respective treasuries.
These accounts are transient or temporary and must be reconciled at least monthly. During the
assessment no evidence of reconciliation of these balances was found.

27.3 Advance accounts

Under best practices, the reconciliation of advance accounts is conducted at least monthly, in the
month following the closing to which they refer. All advance accounts are cleared in timely
manner.

In accordance with current regulations, the closing activity of the accounting period includes
reconciliation and cancellation of advance payments made or received should be performed within

two months after the closing of the accounting period (in accordance with the entities deadline of
annual reporting—i.e., February 15 of the following year). Contractual rules require that for each
specific contract, accounts are created to ensure transparent management of resources, and these
accounts register all advances.

In the agencies selected for assessment, it was established that this rule is observed, most probably
because there are specific sanctions to maintain balances pending regularization, outside the limits
established in the contracts or equivalent thereof. Moreover, there are special controls for handling
advances.132

27.4 Financial data integrity processes

Under best practices, access to records and the introduction of changes to them are restricted and
registered, and an audit trail of changes is produced. There should be an operational body, unit, or
team in charge of verifying financial data integrity.

The security of integrated public sector financial information is regulated by the rules on IFIS,
under which they mainly register operations for budgets, treasury and accounting. There are
policies established by the IFIS Steering Committee to ensure information security, 133 including
with respect to who can access the system and the creation of passwords.134

Security policies identify responsibilities and set objectives for the appropriate and consistent
protection of information assets. The implementation of policies aims to reduce the risk of
spreading, modifying, destroying, or improperly using information assets or modifying critical
processes, whether accidentally or intentionally. Policies are also established to guide and improve
security management of information assets, and these provide the basis for monitoring throughout
the organization.

In the case of the Consolidator of Finance and Public Investment application used for the
consolidation of equity financial statements, there are audit records available for all changes in
permissions, identifying the changes and the date they were made.

Although there is no specific unit responsible for oversight of information and technology security,
the internal audit office of each entity has the authority to exercise this function, as does the Office
of the Comptroller General.

PI-28 In-year budget reports

This indicator assesses the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of information on budget
execution. Periodic budget reports must be aligned with the coverage and budget classification to
allow monitoring of their implementation and, if necessary, to take timely corrective action. The
analysis period is the last completed fiscal year (2014).

28.1 Coverage and comparability of reports

Under international best practices, coverage and classification of data allow direct comparison to
the original budget. The information includes all budget items and expenditure transfers to
decentralized units of the CG.

Analysis and Consolidation of the DGNPB of the MFPC are issued during the year showing
expenses and current income compared to the approved budgets.135 They are structured in such a
way as to reveal the budget execution by sectors, agencies, types of expenditure, accounts as
transfers, sub-accounts, sources of funding, changes during the period, commitments, obligations
and payments, the effective date, and the current lag. The classification of the BER is the same
used in the Law of GBN.136

Additionally, the Economic Transparency Portal (www.pte.gov.co) shows the implementation of
expenditure since 2000 and of revenue since 2013, where the initial budget, the current or final

one, and the budget execution compared with indicators is compared with the best year of
execution and the average of recent years.

28.2 Timing of in-year budget reports

Best practices indicate that budget execution reports should be prepared monthly and submitted
within two weeks of completion of the period to which they relate. Monthly BERs are issued and
published for expenditures, and quarterly for revenue. There is no express rule governing the
deadlines for submitting and publishing the BER.

In Colombia, BERs are issued and published for expenditures monthly, and quarterly for revenue.
In the case of expenditure BERs, the time elapsed between the closing date to which the report
refers and the date it is published on the website is two weeks; for revenue BERs, it is eight weeks
(two months) after the close of the calendar quarter to which it relates.

28.3 Accuracy of in-year budget reports

Under best practices, there are no material concerns about the accuracy of the data. The reports
provide an analysis of the implementation of the budget according to the budget classifications
that are in use and expenditure information in the stages of commitment and payment.

In Colombia, BERs include the entire budget that is approved in the Law of the GBN, and the
Settlement Decree at the level of revenue and expenditure and their execution. The reports reflect
the records made by agencies of their budget management in the IFIS system and state and compare
the current budget or current appropriation, commitments, obligations (accrued, paid, and
uncommitted appropriations). The regulations state that IFIS is the only source of information for
recording, monitoring, and control. Reports include analysis and comments related to execution.

No reports are known with material objections of from internal auditors of the four agencies
selected for assessment, or from the CGC in general for the Central Government, with respect to
coverage, quality, or timeliness of the data included in the BERs. For the year 2014, the CG issued
a clean opinion on the budget execution.

PI-29 Annual financial reports

This indicator assesses the extent to which the annual Financial Statements (FS) are complete,
timely, and consistent with the principles and generally accepted accounting standards. This is
crucial for accountability and transparency in the PFM system.

Critical periods are distributed as follows: dimension 29.1, the most recent completed fiscal year
(2014); dimension 29.2, the latest financial statements submitted for audit purposes; and dimension
29.3, the financial reports for the last 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014).

29.1 Completeness of annual financial reports

Best practices indicate that the financial reports of the Central Government (CG) budget be
prepared annually, that they be comparable with the approved budget, contain all information
about revenue, expenses, financial assets, nonfinancial obligations, guarantees, and long-term
obligations, and that they be backed by a reconciled cash-flow statement.

In Colombia there are two types of annual financial reports related to the CG:

      1. The report on the General Account of the Budget and Treasury, whose data are obtained
         from IFIS by the CG for purposes of the audit of the budget execution and Treasury
         accounts.137 This report, which includes all information on budget execution in the IFIS
         (and thus is considered complete), analyzes scheduling and budget execution and cash
         flows throughout treasury management.
      2. The consolidated Public Finance Equity FS, prepared by the General Accounting Office
         (GAO),138 includes the national central administration, decentralized agencies, and state-
         owned companies, and is composed of the report on the Financial Condition and Results
         at the national level (including the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Financial Activities, the
         Economic, Social and Environmental Statement of revenue, expenses, and costs, the

137
    Required by Articles 268 and 354 of the Constitution, Articles 38, 39, and 40 of Law 42 of 1993, and Article 310
of Law 5 of 1992.
138
    Accrual accounting in Colombia is governed mainly by the Public Accounting Framework (PAF) under Resolution
354 of 2007.


                                                       107
           Statement of Changes in Equity, and Notes to Financial Statements. Additionally, similar
           statements are prepared for all subnational governments and the entire public sector). It
           should be noted that a cash flow statement is not prepared, as is required under best
           practices.
Agencies at the central and decentralized level are part of IFIS, which, based on budget execution,
feeds equity financial information automatically, thus providing consistency between the financial
accounting and reporting of budget execution for revenue and expenditure. At the CG level, all
agencies are part of the consolidation, for which the GAO receives accounting information and
consolidates it through the Consolidator FS through the Revenue and Public Investment
Consolidator (RPIC). All assets of public agencies are incorporated in the accounting information
as of December 31, 2014.139

The CG in its 2014 report on the General Account of the Budget and Treasury considers that it has
presented the budget’s execution and treasury management fairly and without material objections.
This is not the case with respect to consolidated FSs, which received a qualified opinion for the
year 2014 because of underestimates and overestimates documented by the CG in its report, which
reveals uncertainty about the integrity of their data.

29.2 Submission of reports for external audit

Best practices indicate that the financial reports of the budgetary CG should be submitted for
external audit within three months after the end of the fiscal year.

The legal framework that supports and underpins the submission of the CG Financial Balance
Sheet140 provides that before July 1 of each year, the CG shall audit and certify the balance of the
finances or general balance sheet of the immediately preceding fiscal year, which shall be
submitted to the Accountant General by May 15 each year. For the year 2014, the FSs were
submitted for external audit by the GAO on that date (i.e., within the five months following the
fiscal closing ended December 31, 2014).

29.3 Accounting standards

Under best practices, accounting standards consistent with international standards should be
applied to all financial reporting. Therefore, most of the national standards should incorporate
international standards. If there are variations between national and international standards the
differences should be disclosed and explained. The standards used in the preparation of annual
financial reports should be disclosed in notes to such reports.

For the years 2012, 2013, and 2014 FSs were prepared observing the Public Accounting
Framework (PAF), consisting of the General Plan of Public Accounting, the Procedures Manual,
and Public Accounting Doctrine, harmonized with certain International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS) in force in 2006. In the year 2013, the GAO began the process of convergence
to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IPSAS for all agencies of the

      According to the sole paragraph of Article 354 of the Constitution and Article 47 (paragraph 2) of Law 42 of 1993.

Colombian public sector. Shortly before the PEFA assessment visit, the GAO issued a regulation141
for government agencies with respect to convergence through adaptation to IPSAS, which would
have a period of application from January 1, 2017.

Although the accounting standards used are disclosed in notes to the FSs, no report or explanatory
notes are available on the consistency between the standards in the PAF and International Public
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) PAF that have been implemented to the date of such
statements. The CG in its opinion refers to the verification of compliance with the rules, principles,
and procedures set out in the Public Accounting Framework and norms, principles, and procedures
governing the technical process of consolidation.

The accounting standards in the Colombian public sector have been enunciated by the GAO
through various media, including through institutional training programs to external customers,
publication on the GAO’s website, in the PAF, and in hard copy publications.

PI-30 External audit

This indicator examines the characteristics of external audits. The critical evaluation period is the
three most recent completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014).

30.1 Audit coverage and standards

Under best practices financial reports, including of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities of the
agencies of the Central Government, should be audited using the Auditing Guidelines (ISSAI) of
the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions and the International Standards on
Auditing (ISA) or national standards in line with such standards, for the last three completed fiscal
years ended. Audits should highlight important issues and systemic and control risks.

Table 3.21 displays the audit coverage of the budget executed by the CG for 2012, 2013, and 2014,
for which the CG used government auditing standards that were partially consistent with
international standards. To date an analysis is not in hand that reveals in detail the differences
between these standards, although the Government indicated in its opinion that such standards
were partly consistent with the ISSAI.

According the CG, a recent independent assessment of its audit performance, based on the
INTOSAI methodology, found that the financial audit is about 75 percent in line with international
standards, the compliance audit is at 60 percent, and the performance audit yielded the lowest
score, at around 25 percent. Currently, the CG is moving forward with a strengthening process to
adjust its practice to such standards.

                 Expenditure budget of the nation                   165.6         189.0       196.9       183.8
                 Coverage of CG audits (%)                           88.1          89.7          85        87.6
                                      Source: Internally prepared with data provided by the CG.



CG reports for the three years evaluated reveal important issues about weakness in the reliability
of financial statements that have produced adverse opinion on fiscal year 2013 and with
qualifications for 2012 and 2014. In this sense, it can be said that the audits highlighted material
relevant issues and systemic and control risks.

30.2 Submission of audit reports to the legislature

Best practices indicate that external audit reports should be submitted to the Legislature within
three months of receipt of financial reports by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI).

The relevant law142 provides that before July 1 each year, the CG shall audit and certify the
Financial Balance or General Balance of the fiscal year immediately preceding, which shall be

142
      126 Article 47 of Law 42 of 1993, on the organization of the fiscal control system and controlling entities.

submitted to the Accountant General by May 15 each year. The General Account of the Budget
and Treasury, which includes the Statement of Public Debt,143 is sent no later than July 31 of each
year.

Representatives.

Individual audit reports of agencies are not sent to Congress, but the Financial General Balance
compiles the results of individual audits performed on agencies subject to control.

30.3 External audit follow-up

Under best practice, where applicable, clear evidence should be available on effective and timely
tracking by the Executive or audited agency.

The CG does not make recommendations. The audit findings on agencies are forwarded to the
highest authorities of the audited agencies, which have a legal obligation144 to formulate an
improvement plan to address them. With respect to the audit of the Public Finance General
Balance, although important findings are noted that affect the opinion of the CG, and in some cases
these findings may be reiterated for the three years assessed, no improvement plan is requested nor
are recommendations made.

Improvement plans for each agency should be issued by their highest executive authority, within
the term established in the control action report by the competent department of the CG. There are
no uniform terms or deadlines. The time limits begin to take effect for each control subject, from
the effective date of receipt of the report. The competent department of the CG verifies that the
subject of fiscal control submitted an improvement plan within the term provided from receipt of
the report. With respect to reporting on the progress of the improvement plan, the frequency is
biannual, with cut-off dates of June 30 and December 31.




143
    This is not a statement produced by the GAO or the MFPC budget report. It is information obtained directly by the
CGC from the Integrated Financial Information System (IFIS); this budgetary information is directly used by CGC
for its audits.
144
    Organizational Resolution No. 7350 of November 29, 2013 establishes the Electronic Accountability and Reporting
System (EARS), which should be used by fiscal control subjects for the submission of accountability and reporting to
the CGC.


                                                            111
For the findings reported at the level of individual audits and which are part of the improvement
plans, the Electronic Accountability and Reporting System (EARS) application is used, a tool
through which agencies record these plans and their progress. The monitoring is done by the CG
through subsequent audits and the results are reflected in the individual audit reports. However, no
evidence is available of statistics or reports that reveal the actions taken in each agency to
overcome or respond to the findings identified in the audits and subsequent actions resulting from
weak or no reaction from the authorities.

Because of this gap, an institutional strengthening project is underway, which includes planning,
implementation, and monitoring of control measures.

30.4 Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) independence

Under best practices, the SAI should function independently of the executive branch, regarding
the procedures for appointing and removing the Director of the SAI, planning audit engagements,
mechanisms for disseminating reports, and the approval and implementation of the budget of the
SAI. This independence is guaranteed by law. The SAI has unrestricted and timely access to
records, documents, and information.

According to Colombia’s Constitution:145 “The comptroller is an agency of a technical nature, with
administrative and budgetary autonomy.” It also provides that the Comptroller be elected by the
full Congress in the first month of its sessions for a period equal to that of the President of the
Republic, from a slate of three candidates submitted, one each by the Constitutional Court, the
Supreme Court of Justice, and the Council of State, and only the Legislature may remove this
person, for serious offenses set out in the existing legal framework.

Delegated sector comptrollers, the deputy comptroller, and office heads are appointed and
removed by the Comptroller General of Colombia.

The legal framework guarantees the independence of the CGC to decide on its plans and other
necessary external control interventions and there are no restrictions with respect to practicing said
control, except in cases of national defense and others identified under the law, which although
they do not prevent access, do require compliance with certain protocols, such as in the case of
defense and security.

PI-31 Legislative scrutiny of audit reports

This indicator focuses on the legislative scrutiny of audit reports on the FS of the CG, including
institutional units, insofar as these (i) are required by law to submit audit reports to the Legislature,
or (ii) the ‘parent’ of controlling units must answer questions and take action on their behalf. The
critical period for analysis is the three most recent completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014).

31.1 Timing of audit report scrutiny

Under best practices, scrutiny of audit reports on the annual financial reports should be completed
by the Legislature within three months of receipt. The critical period for analysis is the three most
recent completed fiscal years (2012, 2013, and 2014)

In accordance with the existing legal framework,146 the Legislature, through the House of
Representatives’ Legal Accounts Committee (LAC), examines the audit reports of the annual
financial reports of the Central Government, submitted to it by Comptroller General (CGC), within
the legal time limits specified in Indicator PI-30.

Once the LAC examines these reports, it recommends that the Plenary of the House of
Representatives to close and file or not to close the General Account of the Budget and Treasury

31.2 Hearings on audit findings

Best practices indicate how frequently in-depth hearings should be conducted on the results
reported in audit reports, with officials responsible for all audited agencies receiving an audit
opinion that is qualified or adverse, or a disclosure or disclaimer, and with key officials involved
in the preparation of financial information and internal control reports147 and representatives of the
SAI to explain the findings.

As part of LAC’s work, documentary evidence is made available of explanations offered by
agencies to account for audit reports that have drawn a Comptroller General (CGC) response that
withheld, denied, or offered a qualified opinion with to aspects of agency FSs or budget execution.
In addition, such agencies have the right to challenge CGC reports before LAC. All such events
are recorded in the LAC meeting minutes.148

Moreover, LAC hearings are also held with other authorities, such as the Minister of Finance and
other ministers, the Comptroller General of the Republic, the Accountant General, and the Budget
Director, among others. There are no statistics to establish a percentage of such hearings measured
against the potential set; however, they appear to be rare.

As part of their review, LAC has the authority to obtain additional information directly from public
agencies. For example, during the scrutiny of CGC reports for 2014, it requested and obtained
from 347 agencies budget, accounting, administrative, internal accounting control, and
implementation information as well as update of SICM, reports of the statutory auditors (where so
mandated in law), and compliance improvement plans.

of the Comptroller General of Colombia.

31.3 Recommendations on audit by the Legislature

Under best practices, the Legislature should produce recommendations for actions to be
implemented by the Executive, and should systematically monitor their implementation.

However, in Colombia, the Legislature does not issue recommendations to the Executive and
therefore does no monitoring. The House’s LAC has the primary function of submitting the draft
resolution, by which it proposes to the Plenary of the House of Representatives the Closing of the
General Account of the Budget and Treasury (without producing recommendations to the
Executive); additionally it has the function of developing and promoting Congress’s oversight
capacity.

All LAC comments on the financial, accounting, and budgetary performances, and on internal
accounting control and SICM, are recorded in the Closing Resolution, which, after approval by
the Plenary of the House, is forwarded to the President of the Republic, all Cabinet ministers,
control entities, the Office of the Accountant General, and other CG-level agencies, to take
measures to correct and rectify those comments, give clarity to the management of public finances,
according to the Constitution, laws and international financial reporting standards. Although, as
noted, this presentation does not entail recommendations to, or tracking of, any Executive
response, members of LAC in the next period, as recorded in the proceedings thereof, frequently
question the lack of such follow-up.

31.4 Transparency of legislative scrutiny of audit reports

Under best practices, all hearings should be conducted in public except in strictly limited
circumstances, such as discussions related to national security or similarly sensitive matters. The
Commission reports should be debated in plenary of the Legislature and published on an official
website or through any other publicly accessible medium.

LAC hearings are not public, but those of the House of Representatives are and there is a television
channel that broadcasts many of the plenary sessions. The Institutional Channel is an open public
television with national coverage, created in September 2003 by the National Television
Commission to inform citizens about the development of draft bills, promote the social policy of
the State, and disseminate public information on programs and projects. Its programming
comprises live broadcasts of committee (exclusive of LAC) and Plenary Sessions of the Congress.

As illustrated by the examples cited in discussion of dimension 31.2, the analysis and results of
legislative scrutiny, which are discussed in the plenary chambers of the House of Representatives,
are published in records that are publicly available (with some limitations with respect to the House
website).

                           4. ANALYSIS OF PFM SYSTEMS

4.1   Integral Assessment of Performance Indicators

An assessment is presented below of the results of the PEFA Colombia Assessment 2015, based
on the seven pillars that structure the Performance Indicator framework for PFM measurement,
with particular attention given to identifying the main strengths and weaknesses that affect the
achievement of expected fiscal and budgetary performance.

Reliability of the budget (PI-1 to PI-3)
The reliability of the budget is one of the strengths of Colombia’s PFM system. The General
Budget of the Nation (GBN), which is approved annually by Congress, in its component of
spending (or appropriations bill) does not undergo significant changes during the implementation
phase, both generally and as disaggregated by administrative, sectoral, and economic categories.
In no year of the analysis period (2012-2014) did the deviation between the budget as approved
and executed exceed the 10 percent limit set for achieving a ‘B’ standard.

Changes that can be introduced by the Executive during the budget exercise are clearly defined,
limited, and strictly respected, leaving those changes that require altering the initial values
approved in the budget law subject to review and legislative authorization. It is also remarkable
that the contingency budget items are not used to affect sectoral spending priorities established.

Revenues are projected properly and, consequently, the securities registered in the component on
rents and capital resources of the GBN do not suffer significant deviations at the aggregate level
during the implementation phase. In none of the years between 2012 and 2014, are substantive
changes experienced in relation to international best practices. The institutional arrangements for
preparing fiscal forecasts, including the preparation of a 10-year Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
by the MFPC are appropriate and work in practice.

The variance in the composition of revenue as planned and actually executed shows high levels
relative to international best practices, and was modified in each year of the analysis period by
more than 10 percent. This result adversely affects the budget reliability, but does not detract
significantly from the overall performance.

Transparency of public finances (PI-4 to PI-9)
The PFM system in Colombia has mixed performance in terms of universality and fiscal
transparency. Indicators measuring compliance with international standards of budget
transparency show better performance than indicators that more closely measure universality,
comprehensiveness, and results-based management of the budget.

The first indicator set measures (i) the adequacy of the information sent by the Executive to
Congress, together with the draft budget, to support the latter’s analysis and scrutiny during the
approval process; (ii) public access to key tax information, in timely manner and through
appropriate media; and (iii) the existence of clear rules on the transfer of resources to subnational
governments. In all these indicators, PFM practices in Colombia show solid performance.


                                                117
Indicators associated with the comprehensiveness and universality of the budget also stand out as
an important strength, and include in the regular financial reports of revenue and expenditure,
operations undertaken by agencies that are not included in the GBN.
The General Accounting Office reported that with few exceptions, extra-budgetary agencies report
their budgetary and financial statements for consolidation into the Nation’s General Balance.

This is not the case for indicators related to (i) budget classification and (ii) performance
information for the delivery of services. In the first case, the budget classifiers system is not aligned
with international standards, and although the budget document presented to Congress is organized
by sectoral, functional, and economic classifications, the budget itself is not formulated, executed,
or reported with these classifiers. Additionally, the link between the budget classifiers and the chart
of accounts is still weak.

Moreover, the budget in Colombia still does not include consistent and complete performance
information for resources allocated to major ministries for the provision of goods and services in
the form of “products” or “results” with goals and measurable indicators. (This deficiency is being
addressed in the MFPC reform plan.) A notable exception to this general proposition are the
assessments conducted by the NPD to ensure the proper functioning of sectoral programs included
in the National Development Plan, 2014-2018.

Management of assets and liabilities (PI-10 to PI-13)
Asset management and public liabilities is a newly incorporated pillar in the PEFA methodology,
and Colombia’s performance is generally in line with international best practices.

In first instance, management of public debt stands out with (i) all public credit operations (internal
and external) and their records being contained in a proprietary system; (ii) control over servicing
of debt is daily and ongoing for the obligations of agencies in charge of operations that have
sovereign guarantees; (iii) quarterly reports are produced that account for the amounts disbursed,
amortization, the balance of the debt, and the debt composition between internal and external; and
(iv) the procedures for granting loans and guarantees meet clear criteria that are properly regulated
and are public knowledge. In addition, the Central Government has a medium-term debt
management strategy that operates as a guide or framework to be followed regarding the
composition of debt in terms of currency, interest rate, and maturity profile (deadlines). Under this
framework objectives and goals are set each year for the next fiscal period and the five following
years, and tracking is performed and is included in internal reports and in the MTFF document that
is delivered to Congress.

The national system of public investment in Colombia also complies with international best
practices with respect to conducting economic, financial, and social evaluations on the basis of a
uniform methodology, Adjusted General Methodology, that facilitates the process of formulation
and allows recording of the most important investment projects during the progress of the phases
for identification, preparation, evaluation and scheduling, as well as physical, financial, and
management tracking and monitoring for each project. However, the system has weaknesses in
linking investment and operating costs with the documents that are part of the annual and medium-
term budget system.



                                                  118
Public asset management shows a mixed performance, to the extent that an integrated annual
performance report has not yet been published and inconsistencies in accounting and reporting of
material values of financial assets (other than the treasury single account) and nonfinancial assets
have contributed to the Comptroller General (CGC) issuing a qualified opinion on the financial
statements for fiscal year 2014. Records of nonfinancial public assets are deconcentrated in each
executor and an integrated database is not available where coincidence with consolidated IFIS
records can be verified. Moreover, a physical inventory of the Central Government’s fixed assets
or of the public sector in general is not available, reconciled with accounting records. However,
these weaknesses are mitigated to some extent by the transparency with which the transfer or
divestitures of financial and nonfinancial public assets is managed.

Finally, the greatest weakness in relation to international best practices is still present as regards
the preparation and reporting of fiscal risks affecting the Central Government. At the time of the
assessment, beyond the risks analyzed in the medium-term fiscal framework, a comprehensive
report of fiscal risk is not available to analyze the manner in which the operations of state-owned
enterprises and subnational governments can affect fiscal stability. However, the advances that
have occurred in recent years to identify and quantify the most significant contingent liabilities
mitigate these weaknesses.

Policy-based fiscal strategy and budgeting (PI-14 to PI-18)
The Government complies with international best practice, because it has the institutional capacity
to perform sound macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and instruments and fiscal rules that support
a sustainable fiscal strategy. For the preparation of annual budgets and estimates of revenue and
expenditures over the medium term, the Central Government prepares and presents— together
with the annual draft budget bill— the MTFF, a legally regulated instrument since 2003.

This document provides a detailed analysis of macroeconomic and fiscal performance observed
over the previous period and a description of the expected future behavior of the main economic
variables and fiscal outcomes for the next term and over the medium term (the next ten years). The
fiscal strategy, which is also part of the MTFF establishes quantifiable objectives within the
framework of the fiscal rule adopted since 2012, which establishes a declining trend for the
structural deficit path for the national government, with goals through 2022 that are the object of
tracking and accountability to Congress.

The medium-term projections are made on the basis of well-founded and explained
macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions; however, there may be differences in the process of
formulating these, since there is no review and unification with other agencies on estimates and
methodologies used, and no central or alternative scenarios of fiscal forecasts are submitted, except
those made for the analysis of debt sustainability.

Revenue forecasts meet the standards of international best practices, given they have procedures
and assumptions by revenue that are explained in documents such as the MTFF and more detailed
annexes accompanying the draft budget bill. There are also standards and methodologies to
annually identify all laws that have a fiscal impact on both expenditures and revenues, and analyze
the effects these may have on fiscal sustainability goals.

A Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) has been prepared since 2006. This instrument
has a four-year timeframe and is organized under a sectoral scheme. Its estimates use the
expenditure space established in the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), in line with the
fiscal rule. The appropriations approved by the Central Government over the medium term are
made known to agencies prior to the start of the budgeting process, with those for the first year
coinciding with the draft General Budget of the Nation, but not the estimates defined for the
following years, which are only for reference purposes and are subject to changes in fiscal or sector
policy and also to changes in the economic outlook or adjustments in the calculation parameters.
The submission of allocations does not comply with best practice, because budgeting documents
do not include disaggregation by ministry and are not submitted by economic or administrative
classification, or by program or function. Nor is there a detailed explanation of changes at the
ministry level of expenditures that would enable reconciling and exposing differences that may
arise between a new fiscal period and its predecessor, or between the second year of the previous
fiscal year with the first year of the new MTEF.

A clear timetable is available for scheduling of the budget that, in general, is observed. However,
the final ceilings to schedule the draft budget bill are only known three weeks in advance to being
submitted to Congress, which strays from best practices, because the time for completing or
adjusting the detailed budget scheduling is limited. However, Congress has five months prior to
its opening to examine the draft budget bill, time that may even increase if counted from the time
the preliminary draft budget is delivered to the economic committees of the Legislature.

The congressional examination of the draft budget bill follows international best practices given it
encompasses fiscal policies, the fiscal framework and medium-term priorities, as well as specific
details of expenditure and revenue estimates. Formally established procedures are in place for its
scrutiny that are respected in practice and which include (i) the creation of specialized commissions
for study of the draft budget, (ii) discussion and approval of the draft budget bill, (iii) negotiation
procedures, and (iv) application mechanisms for public consultations.

However, the scrutiny process does not fully comply with best practice because Congress lacks a
technical support body to provide advice during the review process of the draft budget bill. Finally,
the rules established authorizing amendments to the budget that concern the Executive branch, are
clear and the procedures are generally respected by the MFPC and other relevant institutions.

Predictability and control in budget execution (PI-19 to PI-26)
The management of revenues is partly adjusted to international best practices. Taxpayers have
updated and timely information at their disposal regarding their obligations and procedures for
filing claims through the DNTC webpage, telephone help services, and on-site support, as well as
tax culture-generation events. Moreover, DNTC performs selection processes and enforcement
actions based on risk management processes for statements, payment, tax records, and customs
duties. The weaknesses are associated primarily with the practices of planning, implementation,
and monitoring of audits and enforcement, given expected results have not been achieved in terms
of additional revenue and coverage, and in the complete absence of regular and systematic
reconciliation with the Treasury of data such as statements or official acts (appraisals), the values
collected from collections management efforts, or the state of arrears.




                                                 120
In Colombia the Treasury Single Account system that centralizes—through the entire process of
collection, transfer, management, and drawing of funds—resources generated by the agencies that
are part of the General Budget of the Nation. Within this system, balances on accounts managed
directly by the Treasury are known or consolidated daily, although there are authorized collections
and payments accounts at agencies over which it is only possible to consolidate the available
balances on a monthly basis.

The Central Government has the capacity to forecast payment commitments and to provide reliable
information on the availability of funds to the budgetary entities through the short-term financial
instrument for the execution of revenue and expenditures known as the Annual Monthly-Based
Cash Program (AMCP), by which the monthly amount of funds available is defined in the Treasury
Single Account for payment of commitments made in the course of the budgetary appropriations
incorporated in the Budget and financed with the Nation’s resources. However, for the three years
under assessment, the amount of accounts payable is significant, representing between 7.1 percent
and 9.0 percent of total expenditures.

The administration, authorization, and registration of new products, the organization of payroll,
and related internal controls are deconcentrated in the executing agencies, which use different
applications that are not integrated with the IFIS’s payment system which, through the TSA,
disburses payments to each employee. In this sense, there is no comprehensive reconciliation of
the information, and if the data from each agency yields mistakes, they cannot be detected before
payment by the central system. Reconciliations between individual records and payroll depend on
each agency, and there is no certainty that this is done regularly. In fact, payroll audits are partial
and there is no assurance reporting on internal audits or of the CGC on the reliability of the multiple
applications in operation.

The public procurement system has improved significantly, with considerable alignment with
international best practices. However, a significant amount of contracting is still performed
through the direct method, which reduces security in the use of public funds. EPPS, the system
which should record all procurement plans, the contracting process, and the results of contracts,
may not include all contracts; thus, NPPA, as lead procurement agency, carries out tasks intended
to achieve full integration of data and the production of reliable and useful information about
procurement processes. The indicator on government procurement is further affected by the
absence of an administrative complaints or appeals process, with a specialized court to intervene
and speedily settle disputes. Thus, the public is limited to seeking complaint resolution through
the ordinary courts, a process that may well take several years, with final resolution long after the
applicable work of `contested contracts has been completed.

At the level of the structure and adequacy of internal control systems, SICM displays considerable
consistency with international best practices. The Civil Service Administration Department
(CSAD), as the governing body for internal control, annually publishes a maturity report at the
public sector level; in the period of analysis, this was scored as “satisfactory maturity.” These
reports, however, are the result of surveys sent by agencies and are not subject to external
verification of their quality (quality assurance), thus leading to uncertainty about systemic
reliability. Moreover, an annual report is not produced on the effectiveness of the controls, which
appear properly designed according to the agency surveys.



                                                 121
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the level of internal controls for non-salary expenditure, and
especially that of IFIS, which has automated controls, there is reasonable security with respect to
the prevention of arbitrary use of expenditure commitments and, in general, the overall payment
system, especially that of the TSA. The internal audit also has adequate coverage and execution in
relation to planned activities, although the efforts only partially align with international best
practices. There is a need for a more comprehensive development of a quality assurance system
that would, among other things, generate assurance reports on the effectiveness of internal control.
The response of institutions to the recommendations of individual internal audits is reasonable and
no major setbacks are observed.

Accounting and reporting (PI-27 to PI-29)
Budget execution reports are comprehensive and go some way to meeting best practices. Public
spending reports are prepared and published monthly in a timely manner, but the earnings reports
are prepared and published quarterly, within eight weeks after the closing to which they refer.

Overall access to and records changes in budget, budget execution, accounting ,and management
of payments under the Central Government is restricted and an access print is kept for audit
purposes.

Bank accounts managed directly by the Treasury are reconciled promptly in accordance with the
best practices, but this is uncertain, as reported by CGC, for other bank accounts that are managed
by public agencies, some of which the Central Government has challenged, with amounts of
considerable magnitude pending clarification. Moreover, no information is available about
reconciliations, legalization, or compliance with other rules for funds in transit reported in the
financial statements for amounts considered material, and reconciliation of advances is only
performed annually, with some delay.

The consolidated financial statements, in which the Central Government is included, are prepared
annually, according to local accounting standards (IPSAS as partially adjusted) and are subject to
scrutiny by CGC within five months of the annual closing. At the close of 2014, the CGC issued
qualifications on the financial statements with respect to their completeness due to over- and
under-estimations.

Scrutiny and external audit (PI-30 to PI-31)
The CGC submits their reports for scrutiny of the Legislature in timely fashion. Its professional
practice is partially adjusted to international best practices. Although the CGC does not issue
recommendations, it presents findings; moreover, there are no reports on the degree of assimilation
of external control by the Executive branch. In fact, recurring shortcomings persist in the opinion
of the Comptroller General (CGC), without being overcome.

For its part, the Legislature examines reports of the CGC within six months after receiving them.
Hearings are not often held with the authorities of those agencies to which the CGC entered
objections with respect to their financial information, and no conclusions to close or not close
accounts has been rendered with respect to fiscal year 2014. Given that the Legislature does not
make recommendations for follow-up implementation to address audit finding it is uncertain how
effective such scrutiny can be.

4.2      Effectiveness of the Internal Control Framework

As indicated in Section 2.3, the legal and regulatory internal control framework is supports a wide
range of standards, including those of the Internal Control Act, the National System of Internal
Control, and the Standard Internal Control Model (SICM), the last of which is based on standards
of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and the
Internal Control Guide of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(INTOSAI), which represent best practice.

Although the SICM was updated149 in 2014, and it refers in its technical manual to the principles
of internal control from the COSO 2013 document, its consistency with international standards is
partial. Figure 4.1 illustrates the SICM structure.

                           Figure 4.1 Structure of the Standard Internal Control Model




The SICM is structured with (i) two modules: Planning and Management Control, and Assessment
and Monitoring Control, (ii) six components, (iii) 13 elements, and (iv) a cross-cutting axis focused
on information and communication. The comparative analysis outlined in Tables 4.1 and 4.2,
reveals the inconsistencies of the SICM with best practices.

In summary, (i) the COSO/INTOSAI standard does not consider the definition of modules as set
forth in the SICM, and (ii) of the six SICM components, the only consistency is reflected in risk
management. Moreover, the SICM includes 13 elements, which are partially consistent with the
17 new principles provided in the COSO document (2013) of best practices. Table 4.2 provides a
schematic of the comparative analysis of the elements of the SICM against the principles of the
COSO document:

The differences between the models suggest variances from best practices, arising from a particular
interpretation that is not generally accepted. There appears to be a blend between administrative
practices and internal control practices, which can impede the identification of control components

and principles, and therefore the implementation and subsequent evaluation of the internal control
system.

As for the effectiveness of internal control, it should be noted that, in general, it is still not a practice
in Colombia that either internal auditors, or the highest executive authorities of public institutions,
or the Comptroller General the Republic (CGC) periodically issue comprehensive reports on how
appropriate and effective the internal control system is at the Central Government or institutional
levels. The only report that is issued by CSAD is based on surveys, without an independent
assurance.

The CGC prepares an annual report, only related to internal accounting controls, that indicates a
satisfactory level of control assurance; however, it is only based on the sample of agencies that
were audited and the assurance is not supported by a methodology of recognized technical value
from which a valid conclusion could be derived. The parameters used are different from those of
the CSAD survey-based report referred to in the preceding paragraph. The CGC ‘satisfactory’
conclusion is not in line with the type of opinion issued in the last three years, which keeps CGC
far from international standards.
At the time of the evaluation, a formal study of the degree of maturity of internal control in the
public sector and lessons learned in the years since the last update of 2014 was not available.150 In
fact progress is uncertain, since from SICM’s implementation, no progress is observed in the
reliability of financial information (CGC objected to the financial statements in 2012 and 2014
and issued an adverse opinion in 2013). Meanwhile, during this period there has been frequent
evidence of ongoing cases and cases tried for corruption in procurement and other areas of public
administration, which also suggests uncertainty about the effectiveness of internal control,
particularly in terms of prevention of fraud risks.

In terms of internal controls for budget spending and public procurement, there are a significant
number of rules and regulations, some of which are specifically identified in the analysis of
indicators in Section 3 of this report. The rules governing the Treasury and, in particular, budget
execution and the Treasury Single Account, together with the specific mechanisms of information
technology incorporated into IFIS, provide assurance regarding compliance with the commitment
control on cash allowances under the cash program.

The payment system is well defined and controlled from registration of receipt of goods and
services that should be registered as accrued. Each agency linked to the TSA must meet established
protocols on documentation, segregation of incompatible functions, and chart of accounts for
registration provided for in the PAF, so that payment is accepted by the IFIS and, consequently,
the transfer is made within the TSA module.

Registered commitments that have not resulted in closing tax obligations generate budgetary
reserves to be executed during the next fiscal year. Accounts not paid at the end of the fiscal year
continue as accounts payable and must be paid during the following year. These items are treated
as budgetary backlogs and do not affect the budget for the current year.



150
      In Annex 3 of the technical manual, the changes in SICM between the previous and new versions are identified.


                                                         127
In short, the degree of effectiveness of internal controls in the public sector in Colombia shows
relative progress with two pending tasks: (i) accountability for internal control, and (ii) the
implementation and effective monitoring by the authorities and the internal auditors of each
agency, with respect to assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of the system. At the level of
internal accounting controls, pending the measures to be taken, both in entities and in GAO, are to
avoid inconsistencies in (i) the application of accounting standards, (ii) the determination of
account balances, and (iii) accounts’ disclosures.

As for the internal control structure, the SICM differs from the international standard of
COSO/INTOSAI mainly in the following aspects: (i) the establishment of modules, (ii) the
components are only consistent in risk management (SICM does not cover control activities), and
information and communication and other components may be immersed in the categories set out
in best practice, and (iii) the 13 elements are partially consistent with the principles set out in the
COSO document and appear to be redundant with components.

4.3   Conclusions of the Analysis of PFM Systems

Sound PFM performance is a prerequisite for achieving the objectives that it pursues in
(i) aggregate fiscal discipline, (ii) the strategic allocation of resources, and (iii) the efficient
delivery of public services. In this section, an account of the strengths and weaknesses of the PFM
system in Colombia is noted, including their impact on the achievement of these objectives.

Overall, Colombia’s PFM system exhibits reasonable alignment with international best practices:
the scores achieved for the 2015 PEFA assessment indicators show that 15/31 (48.4 percent) have
ratings between ‘A’ and ‘B,’ while 16/31 (51.6 percent) are below ‘C +.’

A detailed analysis shows that the pillars I “reliability of the budget,” III “management of assets
and liabilities,” and IV “fiscal strategy and policy-based budgeting” show significant strengths and
are in line with international standards. Pillars II “transparency of public finances” and V
“predictability and control of budget execution” show some strengths, but generally have a mixed
performance. Finally, pillars VI “accounting and reporting” and VII “external scrutiny and audit”
exhibit systemic weaknesses and are far from meeting international best practices.

It is also important to draw attention to the composition of the dimensions evaluated within each
of the indicators presented. In rare cases, the indicators evaluated show homogeneous behavior
(i.e., their dimensions consist only of strengths or of weaknesses compared to international
standards). In most cases, the qualified performance is a combination of strengths and weaknesses,
which forces a careful reading of the diagnosis and the impact these may have on the fulfillment
of the objectives of the PFM system.

A brief summary of the potential impact of these general and specific strengths and weaknesses
on these goals is presented below.

Aggregate Fiscal Discipline
The components of the PFM system that contribute to aggregate fiscal discipline are (i) a clearly
defined fiscal strategy, together with the tracking and assessment of its results;(ii) the capacity to
prepare robust macroeconomic forecasts and those for fiscal performance; (iii) budget reliability,


                                                 128
particularly the limited variation between budgeted and actual expenditures, both globally and as
disaggregated by administrative, functional, and economic categories; (iv) robust projection of
aggregate annual revenue, which does not suffer significant deviations during budget execution;
(v) proper reporting of revenue and expenditure operations that are outside the GBN;
(vi) management of fiscal and non-fiscal revenues; (vii) the administration of public assets and
liabilities; (viii) the predictability of resources to commit expenditures during the exercise, and
(ix) effective management of internal controls.

These positive factors are partially offset by the few weaknesses that are still prevalent in the PFM
system, particularly (i) the reduced capacity of fiscal risk oversight generated by public sector
agencies as a whole; (ii) late payments; (iii) the difficulties remaining in the scheduling of medium-
term expenditures; (vi) the weak link between investment expenditures and the future recurring
expenditures they generate; and (vii) limitations in coverage and comparability of budget
execution reports and accounting records to inform timely decision-making.

Strategic Allocation of Resources
The strengths of the PFM system in Colombia with respect to the strategic allocation of resources
are (i) the existence of budgeting guidelines that assign credible budgeting ceilings, over the short
and medium term; (ii) the timely submission of the draft budget for consideration by the
Legislature; (iii) the delivery of complete and relevant information to Congress for analysis of the
draft budget; (iv) regular and timely approval of the budget law before the effective date of the
corresponding fiscal year; (v) the preparation and adoption of a National Development Plan (NDP)
every four years, which focuses on priorities in the allocation of public funds between institutions;
(vi) monitoring and assessment of NDP performance information; and (vii) assessment and regular
monitoring of public investment projects.

These strengths are counterbalanced by the following weaknesses:(i) the difficulty of aligning
planning and budget and ensuring consistency with budgetary spending ceilings in the medium
term; (ii) a budget classification that is not comparable with international standards; (iii) the
absence of performance information across the whole budget; (iv) the weak mechanisms of costing
investment projects (v) reporting of budget execution; (vi) preparation of financial and budgetary
statements; (vii) limited follow-up of the recommendations of external control; and (viii) the
meager overall assessment of the results of fiscal management by Congress.

Efficient Service Delivery
Efficient (and effective) delivery of public services is an important objective of Colombia’s PFM
system, and is driven by (i) proper budgeting of revenue and fiscal impact analysis of economic
and social policies; (ii) the availability of funds for commitment to expenditures, facilitated by the
use of the Treasury Single Account system; (iii) the prompt transfer of tax collections to the
Treasury Single Account; and (iv) the transparency of key budgeting and fiscal information.

In 2015, however, there were weaknesses that undermined the system’s capacity to deliver public
services efficiently, the most notable being poorly integrated management of payroll, purchasing,
and the public procurement system. Internal auditing and monitoring of budgeting reports on the
expenditures incurred by the frontline service delivery units are also important weaknesses.

4.4   Evolution of Colombia’s PFM System, 2009 through 2015

Finally, for purposes of demonstrating the evolution of the PFM system in the country, the PEFA
Colombia 2015 exercise prepared an annex that compares the results obtained in the 2009 PEFA
assessment with the results of the exercise performed in 2015, using the original PEFA
methodology in its 2011 version. Applying the same methodology at two different times can
generate direct comparability between the indicators and ensures a clearer reading of the progress
made during the period.

The results presented in Annex 7 of this report are reflected in the following graph.




      IP
       IP




In the first instance, it is necessary to note that there are several caveats with respect to
comparability of data sets. The set of PEFA performance indicators in the 2011 methodology
numbers 28, unlike the 31 used for the 2016 version. In 2009, the PEFA assessment could not
access information to score PI-22, on reconciling accounts, which explains of the discontinuity of
the line (above). In 2015, PI-18, on managing payroll, could not be scored, so the graph does not
display a score for the indicator in that year. Finally, the 2011 methodology modified the
evaluation criteria on the PI-2, PI-3, and PI-19 indicators, affecting direct comparability with the
version of the 2005 PEFA methodology used in the assessment of the PFM system in Colombia in
2009.

The organization of the PIs in the 2011 methodology by strategic dimension is as follows:



                                                130
   i.     Budget reliability (PI-1 to PI-4)
   ii.    Transparency of public finances (PI-5 to PI-10)
   iii.   Policy-based budgeting (PI-11 to PI-12)
   iv.    Predictability and control in budget execution (PI-13 to PI-21)
   v.     Accounting, recording, and reporting (PI-22 to PI-25)
   vi.    Scrutiny and external audit (PI-26 to PI-28).
As indicated in the following graph, the management of public finances in Colombia shows several
changes between 2009 and 2015; 12/28 indicators (42.8 percent) changed their level of
performance between the two periods. However, the overall system performance is very similar,
particularly taking into account PIs rated ‘A’ or ‘B,’ with 18/27 (66.7 percent) in 2015 compared
to 20/27 (74.1 percent) in 2009. In short, while individual PIs showed variations, the overall
performance level (and hence compatibility with international best practices) has not altered
significantly.




          IP




Of the five indicators that improved their performance between 2009 and 2015, three are linked to
the strategic dimension of “predictability and control in budget execution,” and more specifically
to the records of public credit operations (PI-17) and the effectiveness of internal controls for non-
salary expenditure and internal audit (PI-20 and PI-21, respectively). The improvement in the last
two indicators is particularly important to the extent they show a strengthening of assurance levels
in Colombia’s PFM, as measured by international best practices. The other two indicators with
positive movements in measured performance are expenditure arrears (PI-4) and legislative
scrutiny of the draft before its formal approval by Congress (PI-27). All these variations

experienced do not alter the balance between systemic strengths and weaknesses, except for PI-
27, which was transformed from a weakness in 2009 to a superlative in 2015.

There are five PIs that lost ground in recent years in relation to internationally recognized
standards: (i) the budget classification system (PI-5); (ii) the processes and procedures of revenue
collection (PI-13); (iii) management of information on resources received by the units providing
frontline services, especially schools and primary health care (PI-23); (iv) the integrity of financial
statements (PI-25); and (v) external control, particularly in relation to monitoring of
recommendations issued on the findings identified in audit reports (PI-26). Given that these
declines occur at different strategic dimensions, there appears to be no systemic effect on these
results. However, it is noted that the decline of performance in these five indicators has some effect
on the system, because three of the five indicators were strengths in 2009 but are weaknesses in
2015.

                              5. PFM REFORM PROCESS

This section provides a brief overview of the progress of the reform process undertaken by the
Government of Colombia in an attempt to improve PFM performance, offers a perspective on
recent and ongoing reforms, and discusses the institutional factors that will likely influence reform
developments in the near future.

5.1   General Strategy of the Reform

Following the enactment of the Constitution of Colombia in 1991, a major reform effort was
initiated by public institutions to adapt PFM systems to the new constitutional requirements and
to changes in the administrative organization of State, particularly with respect to decentralization
and Colombian fiscal institutions. Examples include the introduction of mechanisms to transfer
resources to local authorities, review and compilation of the budget legislation (culminating in
1996 with the approval of the Organizational Budget Statute), passage of the Organic Law of
Planning and preparation of a National Development Plan for each period of government, and the
creation of the General Accounting Office, attached to MFPC.

A second important stage in the PFM reform process aimed to modernize and strengthen
accountability, transparency, and fiscal sustainability so as to consolidate the national economy,
foster opportunities for private investment, and revive the national productive apparatus. Some of
emblematic reforms implemented were (i) the rationalization of expenditure of local authorities to
stabilize their finances and improve horizontal allocation of resource transfer through the General
Participation System (GPS) and, more recently, the rules for the use and distribution of resources
from the General Royalties System (GRS); (ii) the introduction of a Medium-Term Fiscal
Framework (MTFF) and the subsequent application of the fiscal rule, to foster fiscal discipline;
and (iii) the adoption of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the introduction of
the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and the integration of a financial information system (IFIS) as
instruments to improve and better control the allocation and execution of public funds.

Today a third stage begins for the reform process, which will be conditioned by the consolidation
of the peace process and post-conflict challenges, but also by the requirement that the country
better adapt to a more challenging international context, to positively channel a broader and more
varied set of opportunities for economic growth. Finally, the request for access as a full member
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will promote greater
alignment of regulations, systems, processes, and procedures to international best practices, both
in terms of PFM and other areas of State action.

5.2   Reforms, Recent and Underway

The diagnosis of the Colombia’s PFM situation would not be complete without a review of the
reform efforts carried out by the country to meet the challenges outlined in the previous section,
efforts which would potentially have positive impacts on performance of GFP in the future:

       •   The creation of the Inter-sector Commission on Government Finance Statistics
           (CIEFP), formed by the MFPC, the GAO, the NSD, the National Planning Department



                                                133
           (NPD), the Central Bank, and the Comptroller General of the Republic (CGC) for the
           unification of concepts and methodologies in defining operations registries, with a view
           to harmonizing the various processes of generation of government financial statistics.
       •   The development of the draft Annual Survey of Government Finance Statistics to
           generate a quantitative tool to tailor reports of fiscal statistics to the standards defined
           by the IMF GFSM in its 2014 version.
       •   Sectorization of public agencies in Colombia under the Single Institutional Code (SIC),
           compatible with the accounting criteria, national accounts, and institutional financing.
           This zoning allows grouping and/or consolidating government agencies for purposes
           of disclosure of fiscal, financial, and credit operations of the public sector and to project
           the impact of fiscal policy on the national economy.
       •   The design, organization, and implementation of an Information System of the Public
           Financial Management for harmonized production of timely and high quality
           budgetary, fiscal accounting, and management information, automatically (in real
           time), to strengthen the decision-making processes and transparency. The project has
           completed the preparation phase of a diagnosis on technical and operating regulatory
           issues, in addition to the preparation of an action plan to guide its implementation.
           Today, it is in the project implementation process in regard to its nine main objectives:
           (i) develop a conceptual model of an integrated information system to manage public
           finances (SIGFP), (ii) harmonize planning with budgeting, (iii) harmonize budgeting
           with accounting, (iv) integrate public debt and other financing operations in IFIS, (v)
           integrate the SIGFP with IFIS, (vi) generate GBN accounting consolidation in IFIS,
           (vii) harmonize territorial information with national information, (viii) generate
           accounting                consolidation               in              RPIC,              and
           (ix) generate budgeting, accounting, tax, and economic information in a timely,
           automatic, and quality-based manner.
The main goals of projects currently underway are:

       •   Improve RPIC system to consolidate accounting information with international
           standards (GAO).
       •   System implementation of budget consolidation accounting (CGC).
       •   Catalog budget for decentralized territorial agency-level services (CGC).
       •   Develop instruments for monitoring the regionalization of investments of the National
           Development Plan (NPD).
       •   Complement the classifier by object of expenditure for investment in harmony with the
           operating expenditure (NPD).
       •   Develop strategies to improve the information recorded in the Territorial Single Form
           (NPD).
       •   Design and implement tools to improve the quality of monitoring of spending (MFPC).
       •   Develop a model of fiscal monitoring based on accrual (MFPC).
       •   Budget modeling and monitoring of industrial and commercial levies and State
           agencies (MFPC).
       •   Harmonize budget/accounting (MFPC).
       •   Develop budget plan accounts and financial sorters of territorial agencies (MFPC).
       •   Design and implement a System Analysis and Evaluation of Public Policies, including
           performance audits, to support efforts by the Comptroller General of the Republic to


                                                 134
           improve the effectiveness of fiscal control, measured in terms of impact on the
           management of public administration.
       •   Strengthen CGC fiscal control activities through (i) the design of an observatory of
           public spending, aimed at better preventing fraud and corruption, (ii) strengthening the
           risk management approach in their strategic institutional processes, and (iii) the
           adoption and harmonization of standards and international best practices to the
           principal activities of the institution.
       •   Undertake a situation analysis of the Offices of Internal Control at the subnational level
           organized by municipal categories for the purpose of generating a proposal for capacity
           building and basic competencies for better operability.
       •   Develop of operational actions for improving access to information available to the
           public procurement and contracting systems (SECOPII).
       •   Computer support to IFIS so that the accounting and reporting system disaggregates
           information on public investment at the component and category levels.

5.3   Institutional Factors Supporting the Reform

The three fundamental factors supporting the reform process are (i) the leadership of the process
by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, (ii) the clarity of the reform strategy, particularly in
relation to the challenges generated post-conflict for the country, and (iii) the expressed will of the
international cooperators in supporting the Government of Colombia in this process with technical
and financial resources. Colombia PEFA 2015 can be an important input to guide a broad reflection
in the context of a high-level political dialogue on the PFM priorities within this process of
reforms.

Note (1)

      The Civil Service Administration Department (CSAD) annually presents the report called executive annual
      internal control report and the Comptroller General of the Republic (CGC) presents the annual report on the
      quality and efficiency of fiscal internal control. However, these two reports do not refer to ensuring the
      adequacy and effectiveness of internal control based on the components and elements referred to in best
      practice. The CSAD Report is a compendium of surveys on the internal control structure taken from the
      administration of each entity, which measures the adequacy of internal control and scores them for 2014, on
      average, as satisfactory, but did not report an effectiveness measure. According to the statement by the CSAD,
      as an institution it has no ability to verify the consistency of the information reported by entities. Meanwhile,
      the report of the CGC is not directed to components and elements of internal control and the general conclusion
      that internal control prosecutor is “satisfactory” has not been interpreted statistically or by a method of
      recognized technical value.

Note (2)

      According to the annual executive report of the CSAD, on maturity of Internal Control (cited below)(2)
      Central Government entities self-score all components of Internal Control, on average, as satisfactory.
      According to the CSAD maturity model, a satisfactory level is a value between 3.7 and 4.6 out of 5.0 and
      the optimum level called “advanced” is between 4.7 and 5.0. Internal Control Offices review such reports,
