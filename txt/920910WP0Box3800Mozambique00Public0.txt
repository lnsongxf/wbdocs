THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        Before obtaining the building permit, BuildCo must also obtain the
        right to the use and enjoyment of the land from the Municipal Council
        of Maputo City. According to Article 19 of Law 19/97 of 1 October and
        Article 24/2 of Decree No. 66/98 of 8 December, an exploration plan
        must be obtained prior to requesting an approval for the right to the
        use and enjoyment of the land and it costs MZN 320. Obtaining the
        right to the use and enjoyment of the land from the Municipal Council
   2    of Maputo City is often a timely procedure which can sometimes take       40 days         MZN 13,006

        recorded because the Doing Business case study assumptions state that
        BuildCo already owns the land that it intends to build the warehouse
        on.

        For the building permit, BuildCo must submit an application to the
        Municipal Council with the full detailed plan attached. The cost is MZN

      * Receive inspection from Municipality - I

      Inspections may occur during construction. According to the law, 2 - 3
      inspections should be carried out by the Municipal Council and by the
      Labor Inspectorate. However, in practice, these inspections rarely occur.
      When they are undertaken, these inspections are announced by the
      inspector, who informs BuildCo of the inspection date. Normally, an
      inspection is carried out when the concrete is poured. BuildCo must          1 day        no charge

      Request final inspection and occupancy permit

      BuildCo can request a final inspection only when the construction is
      fully complete. The final inspection must take place within 30 days of
      the request. Under the new initiative of streamlining the process of
      building control and fighting corruption the Municipality of Maputo
      requires the request for the final inspection to be made at the main
      office of the Department of Construction and Urbanization. The
      rationale behind this step is that before, companies would request the      1 day       MZN 13,006

      final inspection from their respective district office of the Department
      of Construction and Urbanization where they could possibly have

      wield their favorable decision.

      Receive final inspection

      The final inspection is carried out by the Fire Department, the Health
      Department, the Water Department, and other relevant agencies. This
      inspection is coordinated by the Municipal Authority, and its cost is

      In order to obtain the occupancy permit, it is necessary to request a

      building permit.                                                           28 days       no charge

      It is necessary to register the building for real property tax purposes.
      BuildCo must present the occupancy permit. According to Article 3,

        The Ministry of Energy divides new electrical installation in 10 categories.
        Our case study falls in category 7 ( a warehouse with more than 9
        employees). For new electrical connection of a category 7 building, an
        authorization is needed from the Ministry of Energy.
        The client requests an authorization to the DNE ( Direccao Nacional de
        Energia Electrica) with the following documents :
        - map of the land
        - map of the electrical lines installed and to be installed

      The application must be submitted in person at EDM. The following
      documents must be presented with the application: 1) copy of the
      Identity Card of the client; 2) design of an electrician; 3) location map of

      The client buys and installs the transformer

      Since the connection is done in medium voltage, the entrepreneur has to
      install a transformer for 140 KvA. A transformer of this type is usually
4     imported.                                                                30 calendar days           USD 10,000

      The client obtains external works by EDM

      EDM or a hired enterprise starts the external works after payment of the
      estimate. Payment has to be made at the premises of EDM. In case of
      installations of general tariff with more than 9 workers, the work is done
      with involvement of the Direcçâo nacional de Energía. The works take 2
5     days but the material is not available in Mozambique more than 50% of          30 calendar days     USD 3,025

      The client signs the supply contract and meter is installed

      The meter is installed by EDM. Article 52 of Decree 42-2005 states that
      EDM can request a deposit equivalent to 3 times the monthly
      consumption. For the clients of medium voltage, the deposit must be            7 calendar days     MZN 28,770

      done in a bank. EDM will reimburse the deposit after the expiration of
      the contract. The client hast to pay the deposit at the time of signing the
      supply contract. Most of the time , the client settles the deposit through
      a bank guarantee.

      is obtained to be submitted with the sale and purchase agreement to the
      notary and the name of the buyer is registered with the Tax Office. The                     2% of property
