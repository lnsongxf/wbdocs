The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) would like to express its great appreciation of the effort
and support extended to the study team by the relevant ministries/ agencies of the Government of
Vietnam at different central and local levels and the water supply and sewerage utilities during this
study.

The study was implemented during April – June 2014 and included (i) desk review, (ii) site visits, (iii)
draft report, (iv) consultation workshop, and (v) finalization of the report. At the consultation
workshop on June 9, 2014 jointly held by the Ministry of Construction and the World Bank/WSP with
representatives from ministries, donors, water supply and sewerage utility companies, and
provincial peoples committees, the key findings and recommendations of the study were presented
and positively received by the parties. Many comments were received at the consultation workshop
and these will form the basis of ongoing dialogue with the government on the reform agenda.

The views and conclusions presented in this report are those of the study team and do not
necessarily represent those of the WSP or of the World Bank. We hope that this report will serve as
a useful resource for further dialogue and discussions on reform/regulation and policy making in the
urban water and sanitation utility sector, and as such contribute towards the successful achievement
of the Government’s SOE reform goals and targets for the benefit of the peoples of Vietnam.

Review of Urban Water & Wastewater Utility Reform & Regulation in
Vietnam



Executive Summary
This Review, undertaken by the World Bank Water & Sanitation Program (WSP), is provided at the
request of the Ministry of Construction (MOC) of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam with the
objectives of (a) Providing guidance/recommendations concerning the reform proposals of state-
owned enterprises operating in the field of water supply and urban sanitation and (b) Providing
guidance/recommendations concerning economic management options for service providers. It will
be important to ensure that these reforms are undertaken in an explicitly poor-inclusive manner.

The Review achieves these objectives through a review of the current situation, are view of progress
on the reform agenda and presentation of potential options for improvement of the urban water
and waste sector in Vietnam, particularly in regard to:

    1. The current Urban Water Supply Enterprise Equitization Program
    2. Economic Regulation of Urban Water Supply & Sanitation Utilities

Accordingly, the Review is presented in two parts.

For water sector performance information much use was made of the MOC Water Database
(developed in 2012 with the support of WSP World Bank) that has established data on key financial
and operational indicators for the 791 Water Utilities in Vietnam (of which 29 also provide waste
water services). This information was supplemented by a desk study and through a number of
discussions with representative stakeholders in Ministries and Government Departments, and
officials in select provinces.


Section 1: Review of Reform: The current Urban Water Supply Enterprise
Equitization Program
The key focus of sector reform is the implementation of national policy of restructuring State Owned
Enterprises (SOEs) through Equitization. This policy was established in 1992 and was extended to the
Urban Water Utility Sector in 2002. The stated aim of SOE restructuring is to: "promote equitization
and diversification of ownership of SOEs in which the State is not required to hold 100% of shares."

In the water sector the process of equitization started in 2002 and it is ongoing. However of the 79
water & waste water utilities only 23 have been equitized (only three since 2011). Essentially it
involves ring fencing current water and waste water utilities (originally run as part of provincial
government PPC activities) and preparing them for sale as autonomous utilities, but with a major
shareholding retained by the PPCs.

1
 79 Utilities are included in the Database covering all 63 Provinces.Some provinces have more than one utility.
There are some bulk water supply only utilities (like Binh An BOT Joint-stock company in HCMC) with only one
client (SAWACO), that are included in the MOC Database.

                                                       i
The rate of equitization is of some concern. The review identified a number of potential ‘road blocks’
that could inhibit investors from taking up further offers for equitized utilities. Many of these issues
also impede broader sector reform. These ‘road blocks’ include:

       Tariffs and revenues are inadequate, resulting in lack of financial and operational
        sustainability
       Continuing effective state control (through majority shareholding) raises concerns over
        governance and autonomy.
       There is no clear contractual relationship between PPCs and utilities
       The method of utility valuation for share sale may be undervaluing liabilities related to fixed
        assets, many of which are underground.
       Some utilities may be less attractive to investors due to their small size and/or location in
        poorer provinces.
       Some utilities have developed subsidiary businesses outside their core utility service
        business that may be to the detriment of the public service objectives of the utility.
       Some utilities have started a process of fragmentation of their core business, forming
        separate companies for wastewater services, bulk water supply and treatment, and water
        distribution (even forming new companies for each distribution zone) under separate
        management and ownership structures
       Capacity of utility management for implementing reforms: this capacity varies enormously
        between utilities, but even in the most effective ones there is a concern that they need
        support for change management in the process of transforming from a public utility to an
        equitized company.

Data from the MOC Water Database show that water utilities in Vietnam have been making progress
in some areas, e.g.on coverage and bill collection, although other key operational indicators such as
NRW (m3/km/day) suggest problems with asset maintenance, operation and investment. Drinking
water quality indicators are poorly reported and there are issues with compliance, particularly within
the distribution networks.

Sector performance was also reviewed in an international context using the World Bank WSP
supported International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET). By
comparison with other countries, Vietnam has low expenditure on operating costs and low tariffs.
Although operating costs are recovered on average across the sector, the low level of operating
costs are consistent with the poor performance found across the country in terms of drinking water
quality, continuity of supply, leakage and pressure.

There is no evidence that the process of equitization, although creating ‘autonomous’ water utilities
with reduced state shareholding, has resulted in financial and service level improvements. Those
utilities that were already well managed continued to improve performance after equitization.

Some principles for establishing well-structured and well managed utilities have been highlighted,
including good management and governance practices: level of service definition; asset
management plans; investment planning; O&M planning; business planning, and; establishing
standardized and consistent tariff methodologies. Adoption of such good utility practices is
recommended, in conjunction with the introduction of formalized contractual arrangements
between PPCs and utilities. This will establish a better defined commercial relationship between the
PPC and utility, with clear description of obligations and responsibilities for each party.



                                                   ii
In this regard there is already national legislation in place (Decree 117 (Water Decree) Article 31
Agreements on provision of water supply services) that provides for such a contract between PPCs
and Utilities and contains provisions similar to our recommendations, but so far this has not been
implemented. This review makes a strong recommendation that this should be implemented as part
of any sector reform program.

The review concludes by highlighting priority activities for progressing the reform agenda and
improving sector performance. These include:

       Develop a Policy Circular on water utility SOE equitization and reform
       Support to PPCs and utilities in professionalizing the sector: commercial, operational,
        planning and financial management and associated institutional development
       Establishing the contractual relationship between all PPCs and their water utilities
       Support for operational and management improvements for better utility performance.
       Funding for capital investment schemes that offered the highest improvements in operating
        or financial effectiveness and that result in improved levels of service to the customers



Section 2: Review of Regulation of the Urban Water & Waste Water Utilities
In this Section we review the key aspects of sector regulation for Health, Water Resources and
Environmental aspects, and Economic Regulation

However, the main focus of our work is the Review of Economic Regulation, reviewing the
operation of the sector and assessing how the economic and financial basis of the sector may
continue to be improved. It is noted that the other two regulatory issues are important, and all three
aspects need to be managed holistically to improve the sustainability of the sector

It has been noted that the current legal framework for the provision of water and wastewater
services in Vietnam is not fully effective and does not correspond with the reality on the ground.
Furthermore enforcement is deficient and often national regulations are ignored by local authorities,
who prioritize short-term economic growth of their communities over sustainability.

It is against this background that this review has been conducted in order to assess the current
situation and to propose options for improving the governance and economic regulation of the
water and wastewater utilities. The goal to is provide better quality services at an efficient and
affordable cost to customers. It will also be important to ensure that low income households have
equitable service access, and that they can afford to pay for receiving these basic services.

Regulation is established under line ministries for the public health issues (Ministry of Health, MOH)
and water resources and environmental issues (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment,
MONRE). Neither ministry is responsible exclusively for regulating the water and wastewater utility
sector. Both ministries are responsible for setting standards and monitoring compliance. Day to day
monitoring is undertaken by the PPCs and utilities themselves, with the ministries checking to
confirm key results. Both ministries said that if greater emphasis was to be placed on enforcement
then additional resources would be required.




                                                  iii
The Review of economic regulation begins with a review of the inter-related factors that are crucial
to the performance of the sector. Even with effective utilities, the levels of service provided to
customers cannot be maintained or improved without a number of these key issues being addressed
holistically:

        o   Sustainable tariffs and funding structures
        o   Formal business planning
        o   Asset management and development
        o   Financial planning
        o   Capital investment


In a well- functioning economic regulatory system all these elements are regulated and monitored in
order to ensure that the utility is complying with its obligations for provision of services to customers
in an economic manner, and that agreed policies and plans are being delivered. Performance
standards, service and investment obligations and financial commitments have to be clearly defined
and met by all parties. Such understandings should be formally agreed and be binding on the utility
and PPC. Decree 117 (Water Decree) requires the establishment of a contractual relationship
between local state governments and the water supply companies, and Article 31 of this Decree
includes specific content covering these particular issues. Decree 117 has not yet been implemented.

Without such a contractual arrangement it is difficult to introduce effective economic regulation of
the sector, and the recommendation of this Review is that Decree 117 should be fully implemented
and apply to all the utilities, whether state owned or equitized/private.

Water utilities are natural monopolies. Effective economic regulation minimizes the scope for
monopoly abuse by protecting the public interest: tariffs that are above the reasonable cost of
service, quality of service that is below desired levels, or failure to serve less attractive low income
households. Indicators of effective economic regulation of water and sanitation services include the
following:

    o   Providers of water and sanitation services are financially sustainable and operate at an
        efficient level
    o   Returns provided by water and sanitation utilities are not above what could be considered
        fair and reasonable, and are sufficient to attract required capital
    o   Water is supplied on an optimal-cost basis
    o   All customers, including the poor, receive the expected quality of service and good quality of
        water
    o   Sector objectives for water and sanitation are achieved (such as universal coverage,
        continuity of supply, sufficient pressure, health standards met)
    o   The benefits of the regulatory framework exceed its costs

It was noted in the Review that there are several areas of deficiency in the sector that are linked to
failure on these issues including: lack of an economic regulator or associated regulatory framework;
utilities are generally not operating at a sustainable level; customers are not receiving the best level
of service that is economically feasible; there is no official customer grievance procedure, and; finally


                                                   iv
there is no effective dispute resolution system. Some discussion of each of these issues is included in
the Review.

This Review also looked to international best practice on economic regulation. This identified four
main regulatory approaches or models:
       Separate Regulatory Agency with a licensing regime
       Regulation by contract
       Regulation by contract with a separate Regulatory Agency (hybrid)
       Self-regulation


These models are reviewed and their applicability to the specific circumstances of the sector in
Vietnam considered. The Review concluded that the regulation by contract with a separate
national regulator is most appropriate for Vietnam.

Key lessons learned from international regulatory experience should inform the design and
application economic regulation for Vietnam’s urban water and wastewater utilities:

    •   Economic regulation is effective for both public and private utilities

    •   Regulation should be integrated for both water supply and wastewater services

    •   Regulation by contract is appropriate

    •   A written contract between the utility &government/owner should be established:

            o   Giving performance obligations and targets

            o   Establishing tariffs

    •   Clear mandate and effective enforcement powers are needed

    •   Regulatory mechanisms need to have flexibility built into them

    •   Effective economic regulation will take time to become established & capacity built.

    •   Significant staff and resources are needed at both the central and local level.

Lessons were also learned from the functioning of the national regulatory authority for the
electricity sector in Vietnam (ERAV).

A central independent Regulatory Authority for the water supply and sanitation utility sector is
recommended (WRAV), located in Hanoi but with regional and local offices. The Authority should be
established by statute with a clear mandate, authority, powers and resources. Policy for the water
sector would remain with MOC.

Key functions of the Authority should include: setting standards; monitoring cost and performance;
price/tariff setting (based on a review of service standards and targets, business and investment
plans, tariffs and financial sustainability).

An organigram is proposed, showing the relationships between the Regulator, PPCs and Utilities,
with regulatory offices at national and regional level. The decentralized nature of the sector is

                                                   v
recognized, and it is proposed that a small regulatory office be established in each province. This will
not only help in managing day to day compliance issues, but could also offer a facilitation role for
Regulator in establishing the initial regulatory methodologies and procedures with the PPC and
utility.

The Regulator would be responsible for safeguarding customer interests. This could involve the
establishment of independent consumer representative groups and developing policies to protect
the interests of low income households (service access, affordable tariffs, social funds etc). An
appeals procedure would be established for regulatory issues, including PPC, Utility and customer
concerns.

A “Road Map” is proposed for developing and establishing the regulatory arrangements and the
Water Regulatory Authority (WRAV).

The review concludes by highlighting priority activities for implementing the new regulatory
mechanisms and institutional arrangements. These include to:

    •   Design and implement a standard contract form ( Decree 117)

    •   Establish the regulatory system

    •   Enact enabling legislation to establish and mandate the Regulator

    •   Establish the regulator: WRAV and Local Regulatory Offices

    •   Develop a Policy Circular on tariff setting

    •   Provide TA/capacity building program to: (a) design and develop the regulatory system and
        the Regulator, and; (b) establish the regulatory system and institutions linking the Regulator,
        PPCs and Utilities

    •   Identify and prioritise investment needs and appropriate sources of funding to support key
        developments in the sector.

    REVIEW OF URBAN WATER & WASTE WATER REFORM &
                     REGULATION

INTRODUCTION

This Review, undertaken by the World Bank Water & Sanitation Program (WSP), is provided at the
request of the Ministry of Construction of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam with the objectives of (a)
Providing guidance/recommendations concerning the reform proposals of state-owned enterprises
operating in the field of water supply and urban sanitation and (b) Providing
guidance/recommendations concerning economic management options for service providers. It will
be important to ensure that these reforms are undertaken in an explicitly poor-inclusive manner.

The Review achieves these objectives through a review of the current situation, are view of the
progress towards achieving current reform agenda and the potential options for improvement of the
urban water and waste sector in Vietnam, particularly in regard to:

    3. The current Urban Water Supply Enterprise Equitization Program
    4. Economic Regulation of Urban Water Supply & Sanitation

Expected Outcome of this Review
The expected outcome of this Review is to establish the key issues facing the Urban Water &
Sanitation Sector, particularly related to the Reform and Regulation of Urban Utilities and options
open to Government. The intention is to use this Review as an opportunity to open up a dialogue
between the Government of Vietnam (GoV), sector stakeholders, and the World Bank (WB)with a
view to cooperation towards further actions and initiatives for improvement of sector performance.

Basis of this Review:
This Review is based on a combination of desk study of existing material and documents, together
with interviews and meetings with key Government Ministries and Institutions. A selected number
of Water Utilities were interviewed, and their views and comments on the reform process were
taken. Note has also been taken of international best practice, in order to have comparison on
performance and potential lessons for improvement

The MOC Database (developed 2012 with support of WSP World Bank) has established data on key
financial and operational indicators for the of the 792 Water Utilities in Vietnam(ANNEX A lists the
utilities included in the database).This MOC Database, together with data gathered in the course of
this Review, forms the foundation of the information used in this review of the current situation in
the Vietnam Water Utility Sector.




2
 79 Utilities are included in the Database covering all 63 Provinces.Some provinces have more than one utility.
There are some bulk water supply only utilities (like Binh An BOT Joint-stock company in HCMC) with only one
client (SAWACO), that are included in the MOC Database.

Urban Water & Waste Water Utilities
The current ownership status of the 79 Water Utilities is as follows:3:

                        State Companies:         100% local government ownership
                        Equitized Companies:     Private Investment but with Local Government
                                                  majority shareholding

                        Private Companies:      Some extended form of Private shareholding

                     TOTAL WATER SECTOR UTILITIES                           79

                     Equitized                                              23
                     Private                                                 5

The MOC Database at this time does not include the separate Wastewater Utilities. From our
research there are 29 utilities that provide both water and waste water services, as follows:

                                          Water&

Among the 23 equitized utilities 10 provide waste water/sewerage services. However, some of them
are leasing the waste water system from the provincial government, as the asset value of waste
water facilities and networks was not included in the corporate valuation at the time of equitization.

Two other earlier reports provide background on the development of sector reforms and
equitization45, and reference has been made to these reports to assist in the review of progress
against expectations. Other information sources are referenced throughout this review.

The approach and general methodology for this review were determined in consultation with
Ministry of Construction, who has an oversight responsibility for the water utility sector.
Consultation on general principles and sector management issues was made through meetings with
Ministry of Construction (MOC), Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment (MONRE), and Office of Government OOG, Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI).

General advice was sought on the Vietnamese experience of utility regulatory approaches and
institutions from ERAV, the electricity sector regulator, and various other institutions6.

During April 2014 a number of exploratory meetings were held by the team with senior managers
and state representatives for a limited number of utilities7:

    o    Sai Gon Water Supply Corporation/SAWACO (Ho Chi Minh City)
    o    Ba Ria – Vung Tau Water Supply Joint-stock Company (Bwaco)
    o    Can Tho Water Supply and Sewerage Company (Can Tho Wassco)

The purpose of these meetings was to obtain the professional view of these officials on the current
situation in the reform process, discussion on regulatory issues, and views on successes and the
constraints and factors likely to affect the future development of the sector. The comments and
information obtained have been used to confirm or inform the findings of this review.

Equitization of SOEs
The key focus of the current sector reform is the implementation of national policy of restructuring
State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) through Equitization. This policy was established in 1992and was
extended to the Urban Water Utility Sector in 2002.

The stated aim of SOE restructuring (decision no 339/QD-TTg) is to: "promote equitization and
diversification of ownership of SOEs in which the State is not required to hold 100% of shares."

The provincial governments have the duty to provide water and waste water services to the
community. Each PPC had established Water Supply Companies (WSCs) to provide these services.
Before equitization the utilities were typically Sole – Member Limited Companies in which the State
holds 100% of shares. The effect of equitization is to reduce the level of this State shareholding
generally through the establishment of private shareholder investments.

Equitization of SOEs in Vietnam started with a pilot program in 1992. The Government committed
itself more firmly to equitization in 1996 with introduction of Decree 28-CP which, along with its
supplementary regulations, has established the legal framework for equitization in Vietnam.

In the water sector the process of Equitization started in 2002 and it is ongoing. According to Prime
Minister’s Decision 14/2011 the process should be completed for all utilities as rapidly as possible.
To date, out of the 79 water utilities, only 23 have been fully equitized.

        REVIEW OF URBAN WATER & WASTE WATER REFORM &
                         REGULATION


SECTION 1 : URBAN WATER & WASTE WATER UTILITY REFORM


Section A .Effectiveness of Sector Reform



1 Equitization:
The process of equitization in the water sector follows the national SOE reform policies and
procedures. The provision of water services is seen as a ‘Public Good’ and therefore there are
particular pressures that closely link the concerns of the communities involved to the operation and
management of the utilities providing these services. Traditionally there has been strong control of
utility management and finances by the State, particularly at local level

The reduction of state shareholdings has led to concerns about the need to establish effective
mechanisms of governance and control of water utility affairs. At the same time the issues related to
establishing financial and management autonomy of the equitized water utilities are also major
factors in the reform process - both for the state shareholders and the private investors.

Extent of Equitization
Since 2002, out of the 79 Utilities recorded in the MOC database only 23have been fully equitized.
20 out of 23 were equitized between 2007 and 2011. Whilst there are general plans for the
equitization of all the utilities, the recent slowing in the process seems to be due to a number of
factors:

    a. Difficulties in establishing mechanisms for effective transfer of authority from the state
       to the enterprise inherent in the equitization process.
    b. The equitization of WSCs is a lengthy process. The MOC World Bank equitization report
       of 2013 reveals that the longest period for equitization is 1,350 days, the shortest is 68 days,
       and the average is 590 days. The Central Institute for Economic Management reports that
       generally the average time to equitize SOEs nationwide in the period 2005 - 2009 was 400
       days. Accordingly, the average time for the equitization of WSCs is 1.5 times higher than that
       for SOEs in all sectors in Vietnam.
    c. Difficulties in finding investors/capital for the non-state shares.

        Some key issues affecting the willingness of investors to be involved in the utility
        equitization program include;

            a. Tariffs and revenues in the sector are generally inadequate for full cost recovery,
               resulting in a lack of financial sustainability for utilities.
            b. Since the state typically retains effective control through it majority shareholding,
               the operation and management of the utility is unlikely to change significantly from


                                                  5
          the previously existing public services SOE mechanisms. The equitized utility cannot
          act as a fully autonomous business unit, and this adversely affects the confidence of
          potential investors
       c. The contractual relationship between the PPCs and the utility is not sufficiently well
          defined in key areas.

       These three key issues need to be addressed to improve the effectiveness of the
       equitization and associated reform process.

       d. Valuation of shares:

           Two methods are used for the valuation of utility companies:

                 (1) Asset Valuation: This is relatively easy to measure, but leads to potential
                     over valuation of the company. These assets are generally underground, in
                     poor condition, are in fact actually a liability in terms of high future
                     maintenance and renewal costs. In the United Kingdom water
                     privatizations this method was used for utility valuations in the first round
                     of the UK water sector share sales. Investors would not accept the related
                     high costs and liabilities. The UK Government had to re-launch the offer on
                     a “business related measure”, and had to give allowances for high costs of
                     renewal in some of the utilities.
                 (2) Business Related Valuation : Based on turnover, cash flow or some
                     business related measure, this method is found to give a more realistic
                     valuation, and more likely to attract investors

           In Vietnam before 2011, valuation was based on value of assets rather than business
           valuation. From 2011, with the promulgation of MOF Circular 202, there are now 2
           acceptable methods of valuation:
                   (i)    Asset method and
                   (ii)   Cash flow method: which is based on projections of cash flows and
                          profitability of the business.

           To date only the asset valuation approach has been used. Although this has caused
           problems in obtaining investors in some cases, asset valuation has been used
           because it is simpler. Currently, in the absence of a robust regulatory environment,
           there are no reliable/accurate projections of business performance and cash flows
           available for utilities. It is unlikely that the equitization process will speed up,
           provide value for money or prove sustainable without the introduction of effective
           regulation, utility autonomy, and commercial management into the sector.


d. Levels of State Shareholding

   These vary, with state holdings generally held above 51%, i.e. maintaining a state controlling
   share. The level of effective control by the state varies. The MOC WB Equitization Study
   (2013) shows that the proportion of state shares in the charter capital of 10 among the 14

                                             6
     surveyed WSCs accounts for 70% or more (more than 95% in the case of Vinh Phuc, Hau
     Giang and Son Tay). However, according to the equitization policy, the state has no
     requirement/intention of holding the absolute majority over 75%.

     As noted previously, in some equitized utilities management by state continues for all
     intents and purposes -almost as if the utility were still operating as it did directly as a part of
     the public service.

     In some cases the utility has achieved a certain level of autonomy, developing mechanisms
     for control satisfactory to its state shareholder, whilst still allowing the utility to operate as
     an autonomous company, as in the example of Ba Ria- Vung Tau. However the equitization
     process alone was not responsible for the introduction of these satisfactory control
     mechanisms.

e. The varying nature of individual regional economies; the size and form of the
   Utilities

     Each utility its unique customer base, asset condition and size, and has to operate within its
     own regional economic and political environment. Those utilities that are smaller or
     potentially less ‘profitable’ may have more difficulty attracting investors if the business
     model of the utility remains ill defined. The development of a national standard utility
     business model could be a cost effective aid to the equitization process for these smaller
     utilities.

f.   Utility Diversification
     The focus of the utilities should be on the core businesses of the provision of water and
     waste water services to the community. Experience shows that where utilities develop
     businesses away from their core business of provision water and waste water services (e.g
     setting up construction businesses, catering, real estate) this is generally to the detriment of
     public service objectives of the utility.

g. Fragmentation

     Generally for the most effective use of scarce resources and capital effective businesses seek
     to take advantage of ‘economies of scale’. The World Bank and other donors such as ADB
     have advised that it is much more effective to manage water and wastewater services
     combined under the management of a single utility. The practice of breaking apart existing
     water and wastewater utilities into smaller separate entities (eg water production, water
     distribution, sewers, wastewater treatment) for equitization purposes will not only be less
     effective economically and in terms of utility management and operation, but it may also
     bring problems in attracting investors to the smaller and less attractive, less profitable, sub-
     units.

h. Capacity of Utility Management for effective change: The issues of raising capital,
   developing autonomous utility management structures and governance mechanisms, and
   general ‘commercialization’ of utility operation are complex and demand skills and
   experience that may not be readily available in all utilities. This not only impacts the process

                                                 7
          of raising capital during the equitization process, but extends after equitization to the skills
          and resources needed to operate the utility in an effective commercial and business manner.
          Even in the best managed utilities the management expressed the concern that they lacked
          the necessary skills to carry out the changes effectively.

From this review we can conclude that the process of equitization itself, although creating
‘autonomous’ water utilities with reduced state shareholding, does not of itself lead to financial and
service level improvements.

It is not possible to say that the successful utilities became successful because of equitization alone
but we did observe that those utilities that had existing strengths and competences adapted better
to working within the new structures.

Before we look at the financial and management situation of the equitized utilities, in the next
section we review briefly the general performance of the sector and associated key indicators

 IBNET is an initiative to encourage water and sanitation utilities to compile and share a set of core
cost and performance indicators. The objective of IBNET is to support access to comparative
information that will help to promote best practice among water supply and sanitation providers
worldwide.

  This table shows that the water utilities in Vietnam have been making progress on coverage and bill
  collection, although key operational indicators such as NRW (m3/km/day) suggest problems with
  asset maintenance, operation and investment.

  Drinking Water Quality:
  Whilst articles appear in the press drawing public attention to poor drinking water quality (see
                    10
  examples below) , the Review found that there was very limited official information available on
  drinking water quality, especially at the point of consumption (the tap). This is a major deficiency in the
  regulatory reporting system that needs to be rectified. Drinking water quality is arguably the most
  important performance indicator for water supply utilities, with major public health implications. In
  many countries water utility operating costs and investment programmes are driven by the need for
  compliance with drinking water quality standards and the need to protect the health of consumers


RECENT PRESS COVERAGE ON DRINKING WATER HEALTH ISSUES:

VietnamNet Bridge 24/5/2014:

“What is “clean water” like?”
Nguyen Van Luc of the district of Long Bien said that a white-yellow layer precipitates to the bottom of his kettle
after every time he boils water: “After I boil water four or five times with the same kettle, the residues can be peeled
by hand,” Luc said.
Pham Huy Khoa, a neighbour of Luc in the district’s Ngoc Thuy Ward, said he had to have his water pipeline repaired
a few days ago. “This is the second time in the last two years I have had to have the pipelines cleared to eliminate the
dregs,” he said.
“Can water filters protect Hanoians? “
Many Hanoians said they do not believe the “clean” water provided by the Hanoi Water Supply Company is clean
enough.
Le Thi Lanh in Dong Da District said she has to filter the clean water supplied by the company with her RO-technology
(reverse osmosis) filter before using the water.
According to Lanh, she bought the filter two years ago for VND4 million. She has to pay another VND500,000 every
year to have the filter maintained and parts replaced.

“Ha Noi tap water poses health risks”
The article quotes detailed tests by Ha Noi Preventive Medicine Centre. The centre says tests on samples taken from
different water plants in Ha Noi since January this year show excessive levels of minerals and chemicals that can have
serious consequences for residents.Tests show excessive levels of Permanganate, Ammonia and Chlorine, all with
potential health risks to customers.

Vietnam compares reasonably well on many of these particular KPIs that feature in the IBNET
country reports. It is noteworthy, however, that with the exception of Bangladesh, Vietnam has low
expenditure on operating costs and low tariffs. Although operating costs are recovered on average
across the sector, the low level of operating costs are consistent with poor performance found
across the country in terms of drinking water quality, continuity of supply, leakage and pressure.



The charts below compare average operating costs and tariffs in Vietnam against the averages for
low- and middle-income countries using IBNET data. As can be seen, tariffs and operating costs in
Vietnam are low by international standards. This would indicate that there is significant scope in
Vietnam to increase operating costs (and tariffs) to improve service delivery performance and
overall sector sustainability. A major challenge will be for PPCs to increase their willingness to charge
sustainable tariffs to improve customer service levels and bring the sector more in line with
international comparators.

(b) Performance after equitization:
The study has found that there are few marked improvements in performance for those utilities that
have been equitized. Some of the changes discovered are summarized below:


                Connections/Coverage: Equitized utilities slightly outperform state-owned ones in
                 terms of coverage (62.9% vs. 59.6%)
                Non Revenue Water ( NRW) : no big difference between equitized and state-owned
                 utilities (21.3% and 22.9% respectively), although Ba Ria – Vung Tau performed
                 particularly well (10.1% vs. 14.6% before equitization)
                Labor/Staff: the MOC WB 2013 report shows a significantly higher growth rate in
                 labor costs after equitization (low: Binh Thuan 4%, high: Ba Ria – Vung Tau: 131%,
                 Son La: 352%)
                Training; some of the equitized companies have increased their training programs
                 with the aim of improving the capacity of staff and managers to operate under the
                 new structure


A tabulation of some comparisons between State Owned and Equitized Utilities is given in ANNEX
E11. It is difficult to find evidence to indicate that any performance improvements have occurred
directly as a result of equitization. Those equitized utilities that performed well (such as Ba Ria -
Vung Tau, Phu Tho) were already some of the better performers before the restructuring.

     3. Utility Performance of equitized WSCs
In this section we look at the financial and economic performance of the equitized water and
sanitation utilities.

The major benefit of the equitization program should be that it creates an autonomous utility
structure, with defined capital, structure and responsibilities, and with clearly defined financial and
operational responsibilities. This structure, no longer as a public service utility, offers the possibility
of operating as a fully effective, autonomous service company with access to capital and the ability
to manage the utility in a more ‘commercial’ and customer focused manner.

However on first review, apart from any potential beneficial effects on management and financial
restructuring, the general operational and financial performance of the equitized utilities cannot be
said to have improved directly as a result of the equitization process.

Certain well performing utilities were already improving their performance before equitization and
continue to do so. In general the overall sector performance is not changed radically by equitization.
However lessons can be learnt during the continuing reform process before and after equitization.

Management Performance:
International best practice for water utilities is that the most effective modern utilities operate with
clear and consistent management practices within a well-defined strategic, operational, financial and
commercial planning environment. This does not arise automatically just because of the
shareholder restructuring.

A well-structured and well-managed utility will follow clear procedures within a total management
planning environment, including12:

        Formal Business Planning for all aspects of the utility business
        Physical Asset Condition inventory and Asset Management Planning
        Establish Levels of Service( LOS) and Performance Targets ( linked to asset condition &
         investment possibilities)
        Clearly defined investment plan
        Strong financial management and control
        Operational procedures and capacity to meet LOS
        Formalized approach to Cost Recovery
These principles feature in all the best run utilities, whether public, private or equitized companies.
Some of the better managed utilities follow this approach, but in general the management approach
is lacking in the application of all or part of these best practice procedures.
Current Vietnam legislation requires water utilities to establish a formal contractual relationship
between the state (e.g. PPC/PC) and the utility. This is specifically detailed in the current legislation,
which includes the key provisions that have to be contained in the contract. Currently this is not
done. Those few contracts that have been established have not followed the guidelines, and some
contracts have not between the PPC and the utility as required.

                                                     13
The Decree 117 (Water Decree)has an Article 31– see text box below - concerning the required
contractual agreement to be established between PPC and utility, requires that key details such as
levels of service, tariff mechanisms and financing, as well as the other key management and
planning practices should be included in the contractual agreement:

  Decree 117 (Water Decree) Article 31 Agreements on provision of water supply services:

  “1. Agreements on provision of water supply services are legal documents concluded between
  Peoples Committees or authorized agencies and water supply units providing water supply
  services in the areas.


  2. An agreement on provision of water supply services has the following fundamental details:


              a. The area supplied with water
              b. The water supply development planning orientations;
              c. The projected financial sources for implementation of the water supply
                 development plan;
              d. The water supply charges, the roadmap and principles for its adjustment;
              e. Service conditions (water quality, pressure, flow and continuity), roadmap for
                 improvementof service conditions;
              f. Obligations and rights of the involved parties.”




This Decree is effective but has not been implemented. It is strongly recommended that this
contractual approach be used between PPCs and utilities to support the reform process. This
contractual arrangement should be established for all the utilities – for the public utilities (as a
precondition to equitizaton) as well as the equitized and private utilities

In practice, for the implementation of the Decree, it will be necessary to have detailed
implementation guidance so that stakeholders know how to implement this requirement before it is
enforced. To implement the Decree it will be necessary for the Government to develop and issue a
Circular on how Article 31 of Decree 117 will be implemented to establish this contractual
relationship. It will also be necessary to include all the previously noted management issues in such
a contract.

Successful achievement of LOS improvements and financial and economic effectiveness depends on
having clear management of all the interlinked items on the list shown earlier. In addition to
establishing the contract this will also require considerable linked actions in developing policy and a
comprehensive management approach by both state and the utility. This would require support and
investment in the necessary resources, Technical Assistance, capacity building and institutional
support by all parties.

                                                                   CUSTOMERS

   Investment& Performance:
   The nature of the water utility sector requires continuing and long term capital investment to
   maintain, rehabilitate and expand the treatment facilities and distribution systems. The nature of
   water utility assets, given the high proportion of underground assets in varying condition means a
   constant program of asset management and renewal is required. In turn this requires a fully funded
   and effective program of capital Investment.

   Even with the injection of funds from the equitization process, given the high capital needs of the
   sector there will be a heavy need for ongoing state support for the foreseeable future – until the
   utilities operate independently on a financially sustainable basis with full cost recovery tariffs.

   Utility funding sources:

       1. Tariff
          Tariff levels, the principle source of income for the utilities, are set only with agreement of
          the PPCs. Tariffs are not currently linked to either levels of investment or to levels of service.
          Nor are there mechanisms in place to link them to cost/price inflation (eg regular inflation
          indexation).

                                                      15
    A secure and sufficient level of tariff is of prime importance to ensure the true autonomy
    and efficiency of the utility. Currently all utilities have their tariffs controlled by the PPCs - on
    a non-regulated basis. Typically, since there is a social and political reluctance to allow
    sufficient or regular increases in tariff to allow full cost recovery (e.g. operation and
    maintenance (O&M),asset renewal and capital investment costs) tariffs are often maintained
    at below economic levels.

    Only a few of the better functioning utilities are achieving the preferred minimum of
    meeting O&M costs from tariff income. Many utilities are not yet achieving full cost recovery
    (eg O&M plus debt payments) whilst at the same time they are not delivering acceptable
    levels of service:




                                                 Average of approved tariff /
                                                 tariff rate required by the
                                                 water utility (expressed as % of
               Utilities                         required rate)
               State-owned                       87%
               Equitized                         85%
               Private                           94%
               Total                             87%


2. Shareholder Equity
   Given the sector’s poor financial sustainability, the shareholders equity funding is typically
   not enough to support continuous and heavy capital investment. The smaller utilities and
   those in poorer regions have the same level of investment needs per head of population but
   less capital to achieve it.



3. State Subsidy
   The majority of current investment needs and some O&M needs are covered by direct or
   indirect state subsidy, for example Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee supports an
   investment budget for SAWACO with regard to Transmission Pipe grade 1 and 2. This will
   need to continue until such time as a full economic tariff can be established. This situation
   has not changed because of the equitization process. However, this is only a short term
   solution since, given the nature of their assets (eg buried pipework, new treatment plants)
   and the limited availability of capital from the public purse, all water utilities will need to
   borrow in order to establish an effective Capex program.

    Currently utilities continue to apply to state government for funding on an ad hoc basis, and
    are not able to develop a full long term investment programs under these conditions.




                                                16
     4. Bonds, Loans, and Grants
        Of the main funding instruments available, it is potentially possible for utilities to raise extra
        capital through issuing bonds. However, given the weak financial situation of most of the
        utilities, and difficulties of guaranteeing repayment it is not a likely general solution under
        the present climate.

         Loans, soft loans and Grants in this sector are typically only available through State
         intervention, often sourced by donors.

         There is significant potential demand for the capital funding for the reform and
         improvement of the water utility sector. A suitable national funding mechanism needs to be
         developed focused at utility level, or on-lent and managed through individual provinces,



     5. PPP arrangements & Outsourcing
        Limited use of PPP arrangements has been made for water supply. Some arrangements have
        been established, but generally the income stream needs to be guaranteed by state or the
        utility. This approach has been used for bulk water supply treatment plants – where the
        state or the utility pays the PPP operator directly for services provided (e.g. water produced
        or supplied).

         In the drive for efficiency the more progressive utilities are considering outsourcing services
         and functions that can be more efficiently carried out by specialist service providers ( e.g.
         facility cleaning and maintenance or vehicle maintenance, NRW reduction). This brings
         potential cost savings in overheads as well as economic and operational gains through the
         use of private sector services.


      5 Water & Waste Water Utilities
The majority of the utilities are solely responsible for potable water supply (although it should be
noted 29 of the 79 utilities nationally offer both water and waste water services). The focus of this
review is on general utility management and operation, and many of the operational measures for
improvement relate directly to the water supply sub-sector, although there are some sector specific
differences for waste water services.

This review is focused on the progress of the existing institutional reforms, rather than on general
policy for development and improvement of the connectivity and capacity of the waste water
infrastructure in Vietnam.

However, for completeness we attach a brief review of the specific situation and issues in the
wastewater utility sub sector in ANNEX G13.

This reflects the similar utility issues for water supply utilities (e.g. insufficient revenues) but with the
added nationwide problem of lack of coverage of sewerage systems and inadequate treatment
levels. These sector specific issues, related to overall sector policy, are best considered outside the
scope of the current review.


      6. Market Fragmentation vs. Economies of Scale
In developed utility markets (eg United Kingdom and France ( ‘syndicat des eaux’)) the trend is
towards regional management and regional schemes, that will take advantage of economies of scale,
and making shared use of scarce resources and management skills.

In Vietnam, the development of a limited number of Regional Projects has been proposed, to
capture the benefits of economies of scale. For instance,3 regional water plants are included in the
Master Plan for the Mekong River Delta area, approved by the Prime Minister's Decision No. 2065
dated 12/11/2010. They are Song Hau 1, 2, 3 with capacity from 500.000-2.000.000 m3/day with
water source from Hau River. Currently these are awaiting funding.

However, as part of the equitization process there is pressure to increase stock value through
fragmentation of utilities. This has been evidenced by examples of the separation of functions such
as water production and distribution/retail activities. For example, splitting an integrated city utility
into a number of small water distributors is not effective because of losses of economy of scale,
administrative costs and most importantly, loss of the ability to carryout O&M and
investment/rehabilitation of the network city-wide. In the case of HCMC, the decision to split out
and equitize individually 6 distribution branches has proved highly inefficient for SAWACO and the

13
     ANNEX G. NOTES ON SEWERAGE AND WASTEWATER SERVICES


                                                     18
management and development of the water supply system in the city. It led to the break-up of the
city distribution network and created obstacles to efficient management and rehabilitation and
expansion of service network. As a direct result SAWACO is having to consider “buying back” the
private shares in those equitized water distributors.

If this restructuring of larger utilities along functional lines is to be carried out14 it should be
undertaken in such a way (eg by establishing functional divisions or subsidiaries, but not by
establishing separate functional equitized entities) that shared services, manpower or resources are
not split, or required to be duplicated in order to achieve the split.


     7. Investment Programs:
As a result of inefficient mobilization of private investment (through equitization or capital markets),
major capital investment is generally carried out using ODA loans or grant aid where available to
supplement limited national funding (through government/provincial budget or credit investment
scheme of state-controlled banks such as Vietnam Development Bank).

Concessional ODA sourced funding historically played a crucial role in funding the development of
urban water supply in the last 20 years. Major donors include multi-lateral banks (WB, ADB) and
some bilateral donors (Japan, Finland, France, Denmark, Netherland, Australia, Korea etc.) Often
these funds are also linked to institutional or operational improvement.

According to the WB WSP Report on Service Delivery Assessment of water supply and sanitation in
Vietnam (2014), anticipated public CAPEX for water supply and sanitation was estimated to be
US$208 million per year and US$231 million per year, respectively. The available information also
indicates a strong bias in expenditures in favor of urban areas. In the case of sanitation, for example,
the anticipated public CAPEX of US$205 million per year in urban areas is about 95% of the total for
the sanitation sector, and for water supply, the urban share is around 70% of the total water
spending. Anticipated public and household investments for water supply and sanitation are lower
than required capital investments by US$1,258 million per year and US$784 million per year,
respectively. This huge gap can be filled by additional ODA funding, and more importantly, private
investment under PPP program that is strongly promoted by the Government with support of
donors.




14
  As an example in Can Tho, there are 3 equitized subsidiaries with Government stake of 60-80% (which is
represented by the main company/Can Tho Wassco). They're 100% independent, no common services. There
are a few more 100% owned by the main company, which may probably equitized in the future.

    8. REFORM REVIEW: SUMMARY & CONCLUSION
The process of equitization of the urban water &wastewater utilities is continuing. At present, out of
the 79 Utilities, only 23 Utilities have been fully equitized. The rate of this process is slower than
anticipated.

In addition to the restructuring to allow access to capital, the equitization process has created the
potential benefit of autonomy for the utilities, and a clear financial and operating business structure
that will allow the potential for more effective utility functioning. These advantages are not yet fully
realized since the revised structure alone cannot bring all the advantages and efficiencies necessary.

Generally it cannot be said that performance improvements (financial and operational)have
occurred directly as a result of equitization. Overall the improvement has been limited, but with the
exception of those more efficient companies that were anyway performing well before they were
equitized.

However the equitization restructuring does offer opportunities for continuing actions to support
the reform process, leading to more effective provision of water and waste water services.

Some areas that would support the effectiveness of the reform process could include:

       Support to PPCs and utilities in ‘commercial’, managerial and financial preparation for
        equitization, and the financial and institutional support to become a fully professional utility
        operation on a sound commercial footing under the new autonomous equitized structure.
       Establishing a contractual relationship between the PPCs and the individual utilities as a key
        part of the ongoing reform process.
       Introduction of a formal approach to key financial and managerial functions across the
        sector including an approach that establishes and formalizes:
            o Levels of Service provision
            o Asset Management planning
            o Formalization of process of assessing investment needs
            o Clarity on the process for establishing and revising Tariffs and revenues.
            o Clear Financial Management objectives for the utility
            o Approach for effective project development and methods for attracting funding for
                 investment




                                                  20
            Development and implementation of this approach will be a key to successful reform,
            and in particular it will be needed for the viability of the utility, and required successful
            formalization of the contract between PPC and the utility and for successful regulation
            of the utility (as noted in Section 2 Regulation that follows) .

       Support for operational and management improvements for better utility performance.
        These would supplement existing sector initiatives, and would bring the necessary skills,
        capacity building and financial support to maximize results. This could result directly in
        improved levels of service (e.g. via NRW reduction programs) or general improvements in
        utility effectiveness (e.g. introduction of commercial systems, management training,
        customer service and billing systems etc.)
       Funding for capital investment schemes that offered the highest improvements in operating
        or financial effectiveness and that offer an improved levels of service to the customers

These are examples of some of the key issues that should be explored. Some are general to the
whole sector. The operational, financial and management needs will vary from utility to utility. Some
utilities will have greater needs than others, and some way of dealing with this variation should be
explored further

For all issues there are institutional, financial and resourcing needs, and a need for general and
coordinated change management processes. The sector is one of high importance to the
Government of Vietnam and improving its performance will have a great influence on the welfare of
the general population.

We welcome the opportunity to enter into further dialogue between the World Bank and the
Government of Vietnam on ways to continue and improve the effectiveness of this Reform Process

     REVIEW OF URBAN WATER & WASTE WATER REFORM &
                      REGULATION

SECTION 2:REVIEW OF SECTOR REGULATION



In this Section we review the key aspects of sector regulation:

     o   2.A Regulation of Health related aspects
     o   2.B Regulation of Water Resources and Environmental aspects
     o   2.C Economic Regulation


Of these aspects the main focus of this review and the main body of our work is the Review of
Economic Regulation. The economic issues are our main objective, reviewing the operation of the
sector and assessing how the economic and financial basis of the sector may continue to be
improved. However, the other two regulatory issues are important, and all three aspects need to be
managed holistically to improve the sustainability of the sector.

According to recent research,15 in order to deal with problems related to both water quality and
quantity as well as to strengthen the sustainable and integrative management of the nation’s water
resources, the Vietnamese Government has adopted a wide range of laws and regulations. In recent
years, more than 300 water-related regulations on the guidance and implementation of the Law on
Water Resources (1998 and 2012) have been issued and often amended to meet the requirements
of the country’s development and its increasing international integration. In spite of this, the current
legal framework for water resources management in Vietnam remains ineffective and does not
correspond with the reality on the ground. Furthermore, law enforcement is deficient and often
national regulations are ignored by local authorities, who prioritize short-term economic growth of
their communities over sustainability.

The system of state management of the water sector has not fully succeeded in formulating and
ensuring its effectiveness in a coordinated manner. The functions and tasks of state management
agencies for the water sector are still not clearly distinguished from those of agencies managing the
daily operation of works for the exploitation and use of water resources and water supply services.
In other words, Vietnam has still not achieved consistency and coordination of the systems of
policies, laws, standards and norms in the domain of water resources for the sustainable
development of the water sector.

It is against this background that we have conducted our review with a view to assess the current
situation and to propose possible avenues for improvement

2.A Regulation of Health Aspects
Ministry of Health (MOH) -Health and Environment Management Agency (VIHEMA)

Responsibilities
The MOH has responsibility for the regulation of health aspects of the urban water utility sector,
with specific responsibility for:

             o   Development of national standards (working with the appropriate Ministry)
             o   Drinking water quality control for urban water utilities, (rural water and small and
                 domestic standards are a separate issue under separate legislation).
             o   Drinking water quality for utilities of capacity 1,000 cubic meters per day or more
                 (Vietnamese Standard QCVN 01:2009/BYT)16, and applied to piped water supplies
                 and for plants and installations.

Standards:
Standards are well established nationally, within the legal framework:

             o   National Standards are developed on the basis of WHO minimum standards adapted
                 to Vietnam conditions. They were developed through inter-ministerial involvement
                 (including MOC, MONRE).
             o   The latest standards are set out in the ‘National Technical Regulation on Drinking
                 and Domestic Water Quality 2009’. This regulation details the various chemical,
                 biological and radioactivity standards for drinking water.

Monitoring:
The MOH has a clearly established function for monitoring and control:

             o   The National Technical Regulations determine the frequency of sampling,
                 monitoring and inspection prior to water use.
             o   The utilities are responsible for a program of reporting on water quality, and they
                 have to report the results to MOH. Testing has to be done weekly, 6 monthly or
                 every 2 years according to the category (A,B, or C parameters). Reporting is typically
                 annually, but may be more frequent.
             o   MOH have responsibility for a program of verification of test results
             o   MOH have 4 technical institutes capable of carrying out all tests. Funding is from
                 within MOH
             o   There are also DOH Centers for Preventative Health that work to an annual plan, get
                 funding locally and submit reports to the local government. However these reports
                 are also presented to MOH. These centers also have responsibility for monitoring
                 hospital waste
             o   A major problem throughout Vietnam is arsenic, particularly in groundwater.



             o   MOH/DOH Inspectors:

16
  Less stringent standard QCVN 02: 2009/BYT is applied to domestic water including piped water providers for
plants and installations of capacity 1,000 cubic meters per day or below
                                                  Page 23
                       These are at local government level. Most activities relate to food hygiene
                        control, but they will be involved if there are specific problems related to
                        potable water supply eg:
                             Cholera
                             Nitrates
                             Arsenic

General:
   o Most efforts are applied to monitoring source or production quality (ex-works). Quality
      throughout the distribution networks may not be monitored or controlled sufficiently to
      ensure that consistent quality levels are met at the point of consumption. Additional testing
      and appropriate resources would be required to extend the testing regime.
   o Generally quantity of water into supply is seen as being the main criterion of the water
      utilities – however there needs to be a balance to ensure water quality standards are met.
   o DOH (preventive health centers) have limited resources for monitoring and control both at
      central and local level, and if expansion of the regulatory activity for the urban water sector
      is required (eg if more emphasis was paid to water quality issues within distribution
      networks and at the tap) then higher levels of resources and staffing at central and regional
      level would be required.

In discussion with MOH officials the comment was made that whilst MOH are responsible for water
quality standards, there would be major benefit for MOH to be involved in water sector coordination
discussions. At present MOH are not directly involved, and feel that their involvement and better
coordination would be of benefit

Conclusion: Health Regulation
Current regulation is generally limited to source or treatment plant outlets. Quality levels within
distribution systems and at household levels are not monitored or controlled systematically, except
on an emergency basis, and generally quality levels are not achieved in these areas. However, if
sector requirements for monitoring (eg monitoring distribution systems more widely) were to be
increased then additional resources and management systems would be required.


2.B. Regulation of Raw Water Exploitation, Wastewater and
Environmental Aspects

MONRE is a ministry responsible for regulation of water resources and wastewater standards in
Vietnam. The amended Law on Water Resources of 2012 confirms that water is an essential natural
resource of Vietnam and aims to protect water resources effectively, use them reasonably, and to
prevent and remediate damages caused by water pollution while strengthening government
management of water resources.

    A. Water Resources


                                              Page 24
Licensing
The exploitation of water resources for domestic water supply by WSCs must comply with the
master plan on water resources as specified in the Law on Water Resources 2012. At present no
detailed procedures have been developed for applying the Law by national or regional authorities.
WSCs must obtain permits for exploitation of raw water for WTPs. The licensing work is conducted at
central and local levels. Under the provisions of Decree No. 149/2004/ND - CP dated 27 July 2004
and its replacement Decree No 201/2013, the discharge of wastewater into the environment, and
licensing the exploration and exploitation of surface and ground water for works with a yield of
50,000 m3/day (surface water) and 3,000 m3/day (groundwater)or more is the responsibility of
MONRE. Sources with the yields under these thresholds fall under the control of the PPCs.

The license granted to WSCs specify clearly the geographical points of water exploitation, volume
per day, site monitoring and reporting mechanisms.


Monitoring
WSCs are responsible for regularly monitoring water sources to ensure the quality is sufficient for
domestic use or for households (‘daily –life water’) and ensuring ongoing quality of such water
sources. In case of an incident of water pollution, WSCs are required to develop a contingency plan
for accessing other raw water sources. PPCs are accountable (i) to identify and publicize the Hygiene
Protection Zone of various areas supplying daily-life water as prescribed by MONRE, and; (ii) to
organize the dissemination of information on the quality of daily-life water sources, warn against
abnormal water pollution or water quality events that could affect the quality of daily-life water
sources in local areas.

At present about 40% of the water supply for urban areas is from groundwater. The urban areas
using groundwater most heavily are Ha Noi (with nearly 1,000,000m 3 /day) and Ho Chi Minh City
(more than 500,000m 3 /day). Rapid urbanization and economic development are having a big
impact on water resources in Vietnam, with groundwater in the shallow aquifers in Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh and other cities showing signs of contamination by organic compounds (herbicides,
insecticides, fertilsers etc)

The new Law on Water Resources 2012 specifies that the exploitation of underground water is
restricted in areas which contain: (1) surface water resources able to satisfy stable demand ; (2)
underground water with water levels declining in consecutive periods or experiencing dramatic
decline; (3) danger of land subsidence, saline infiltration, and increase in pollution due to
exploitation of underground water; (4) polluted underground water sources, or showing signs of
pollution but without technological solutions to deal with water quality management; and (5) urban
areas which have a point-source water supply or water supply services that are already adequate for
local requirements. However, it has yet to be determined how this Law will be fully enforced in
practice.


Conclusion: Water Resources
At present water resource regulation is weak – the laws and regulations are reasonable. but they
have not been implemented fully. Proper and effective implementation will require additional
resources and management systems.




                                              Page 25
   B. Wastewater and environmental aspects:


Licensing by PPCs

PPCs are responsible for licensing and issuing permits for wastewater discharges. PPCs are also
responsible for dispute settlement on environmental issues (as noted in Decree No. 149/2004/ND-
CP).

One of the specific objectives of discharge permits is to control the pollution of water sources and
end the use of toxic chemicals in industrial and agricultural production that would adversely affect
exploration, exploitation and use of water resources. MONRE has a shared responsibility (with PPCs
and other stakeholders) for the protection of water resources; for identification of areas being
polluted or depleted; for assessment of the current status of water quality and for provision of
monitoring and supervision of water resource quality and discharges of sewage into water sources.

Apart from the national technical regulations on the environment, there are also regulations on
environmental impact assessment (EIA), strategic environmental assessment, and environmental
protection. The Vietnamese government has issued Decree No. 29/2011/ND-CP of 18 April 2011
providing regulations on strategic environmental assessment, environmental impact assessment and
environmental protection commitment. Based on this decree, on 18 July 2011 MONRE adopted
Circular No. 26/2011/TT-BTNMT providing detailed guidance on strategic environmental assessment,
EIA, and environmental protection commitments.

SECTION 2.C REVIEW OF ECONOMIC REGULATION IN THE WATER
SECTOR

This Section provides a detailed review, and proposals for improvement, of economic regulation in
the water sector in Vietnam, and is the main focus of this part of the Review.

A key issue for sector sustainability is the lack of formal economic regulation. There is indirect
control, through national and state budget constraints on financial issues, or by the application of
laws and regulations on the operation and management of the utilities. Those utilities that are not
yet equitized are subject to normal public service checks and balances, but not specifically for the
utility services. The equitized companies are controlled by their shareholders, but there is no direct
regulation of the way that they provide their services to their customers. PPP contracts and
outsourcing activities will impose contractual obligations that can be enforced, but there is no
general and comprehensive system for regulating the way in which these utilities provide services to
the Public.

2.C.1       Identifying Regulatory Problems
In Section 1 we identified a number of factors that are linked to the poor performance of the sector.
Even with utilities that are able to provide effective operation and management of existing systems,
the levels of service provided to customers cannot be maintained or bettered without a number of
supporting issues being addressed:

        o    Sustainable tariffs and funding structures
        o    Formal business planning
        o    Asset management and development
        o    Financial planning
        o    Capital investment


The importance of these issues for sector viability is recognized in Decree 117 (Water Decree) Article
31. This Decree requires the establishment of a contractual relationship between local state
government and the Water Supply companies (WSCs),and includes specific content covering these
particular issues. However, as noted previously these important contractual relationships have not
been implemented. It is recommended that the PPC, rather than lower levels of government, is the
contracting party with the utility. This will improve sustainability since the PPC approves tariffs and
has much greater capacity (technical and financial) to manage contract implementation compared
with town and commune level governments.

The main functions of an effective Economic Regulator would be:(a) to assist the PPCs and utilities in
developing, establishing and maintaining their necessary systems and procedures to support their
contractual and regulatory obligations associated with the provision of water and sanitation services,
and (b) to ensure that both the PPCs and the utilities were compliant with the terms of the contract.
The benefits of such regulation would be an ordered and productive sector, improved levels of
service to the customers, and improved economic and financial efficiency.

The current ineffective regulation of the water and sanitation sector in Vietnam results in
performance by the utilities that is not fully satisfactory to either customers or to owners of the
utility (PPCs or shareholders/investors). Poor results occur when the regulatory framework does not
provide adequate incentives for proper performance or behavior. This Section builds the
groundwork for recommendations to improve the regulatory framework by identifying how and
where problems occur:

A. Goals of Economic Regulation
Economic regulation17 consists of the set of rules and institutional arrangements18that set, monitor,
enforce, and change allowed tariffs and service standards. Its purpose is to address the problem of
natural monopoly.

Natural monopoly19 occurs when the total cost of providing a service is minimized by having a single
firm provide that service. The problem of natural monopolies is that they are not subject to
competitive pressure, so they lack the competitive impetus to offer services customers want at a
price that reflects costs. Economic regulation mimics competitive pressure, enforcing desired service
standards and controlling prices so that service providers recover reasonable costs.

Effective economic regulation averts the potential problems caused by monopolies, such as tariffs
that are above the reasonable cost of service, quality of service that is below desired levels, or
failure to serve less attractive low income households. Indicators of effective economic regulation of
water and sanitation services include the following:

      o   Providers of water and sanitation services are financially sustainable and operate at an
          efficient level
      o   Returns provided by water and sanitation utilities are not above what could be considered
          fair and reasonable, and are sufficient to attract required capital
      o   Water is supplied on an optimal-cost basis
      o   All customers, including the poor, receive the expected quality of service and good quality of
          water
      o   Sector objectives for water and sanitation are achieved (such as universal coverage,
          continuity of supply, sufficient pressure, health standards met)
      o   The benefits of the regulatory framework exceed its costs

Poverty and Inclusiveness
It will be important to ensure that these regulatory reforms are undertaken in an explicitly poor-
inclusive manner. Although Vietnam has introduced a policy of free water supply connections for all,
this policy has not been supported by additional budget allocations to ensure that poor communities
benefit. As a result urban utilities frequently have insufficient funds to meet the demand for network
extensions and new connections, and it is more isolated, poor communities that are the least likely
to be connected. Reforms are also likely to result in tariff increases to ensure financial sustainability.
It will be critical for the regulatory arrangements to ensure that poor household affordability is taken

have a voice in the reform/regulation agenda.


In the next section, we detail the main challenges facing the water and sanitation sector in Vietnam
from a regulatory perspective

B. Economic Problems in the Water and Sanitation Sector
In this section, we identify the typical poor economic outcomes for utilities in Vietnam, following our
review in Section 1. Then, we describe how the lack of a framework for economic regulation
contributes to these inefficient outcomes. The problems identified in this section drive the
regulatory recommendations in the final section.

In a properly functioning market, service providers receive fair and reasonable returns in exchange
for operating efficiently and providing customers with the service they desire at a price they can
afford. Markets in sectors that are characterized by natural monopoly (a structural lack of
competition) will only function properly if they are governed by an effective regulatory framework.
Therefore, poor outcomes in the water and sanitation market signal deficiencies in the regulatory
framework.

The table below provides an indication of key typical failings in the water and sanitation market,
related to regulatory issues, as applied to the general case in Vietnam

Tariffs are not adequate for financial sustainability of the water utility at existing level of efficiency and coverage
                                                                                                                              Yes
Tariffs are not sufficient for capital investments to achieve desired level of sewerage coverage (collection and treatment)   Yes

Tariffs are well above cost of service and are not affordable by some of the utility’s customers                              Not applicable
                                                                                                                              NA
Returns earned by owners of the water utilities are above what could be considered fair and reasonable                        NA

Utility does not have adequate incentives for operating efficiently                                                           Yes

Unfair competition undermines financial sustainability of the water utility                                                   NA
Quality of service provided to customers is not adequate                                                                      Yes
No effective, independent entity or mechanism in place for customers to redress their grievances                              Yes
No effective dispute resolution procedure for PPCs, Utilities or customers                                                    Yes
Service provided and/or tariffs are leading customers to seek alternative source of supply                                    NA



This key concerns highlighted in the table demonstrate the need for economic regulation:

     o     All utilities lack a functioning regulator
     o     Utilities are generally not operating at a sustainable level
     o     Customers are not receiving the best level of service that is economically feasible
     o     There is no official customer grievance procedure
     o     There is no effective dispute resolution system




                                                                   Page 29
The water and sanitation market in Vietnam has no functioning regulator.
The key purpose of an economic regulator is to ensure that utilities are held accountable for the
services they provide and that tariffs charged to customers cover the reasonable costs of providing
those services. An effective economic regulator provides the feedback loop that is absent without
competition. In a competitive market, customers signal to a supplier that they are unsatisfied by
changing their behavior—either by purchasing the product from a different supplier or by switching
products. In the market for utility water and sanitation services, however, customers are not free to
replace their provider with another. Regulatory authorities can address this market failure.
Customers of regulated natural monopolies can notify the regulator if they are unhappy with price
or quality of service. A regulator will also provide the PPCs and utilities with a forum for dispute
resolution.

For instance, if a utility allows the quality of its service to deteriorate, there currently exists no
reliable body in the Vietnam that customers can turn to address this problem. An independent
regulator could fill this role.

The Utilities Operate Unsustainably
From the review in Section 1 the utilities face well-documented problems of poor finances,
deteriorating infrastructure, and low quality of service. These problems are closely linked to a poor
regulatory structure that keeps WSC’s tariffs well below the full cost of service. This section explains
how regulatory difficulties contribute to a WSC’s poor performance.

The Utilities deteriorating financial position
With tariffs set below its full cost of service, a WSC relies on government subsidies to cover its
losses. This system of recouping losses through government subsidies has led to deterioration of the
WSCs’ financial and operational performance, for the following four, interrelated reasons:

     1. A utility’s costs of service has increased with rises in the costs of inputs (such as electricity)
     2. A utility’s tariffs have fallen below the company’s cost of service,
     3. Subsidies available for the utilities often have had to be used to cover the increasing
        operating costs, and thus decreased the already limited availability of funds for capital
        investments
     4. The decreased capital expenditures (on asset maintenance and renewal) leads to further
        asset condition and performance deterioration. This lack of investment hampers ongoing
        efforts to improve system performance measures, such as levels of NRW20

In the following sections we look at international experiences with regulatory models and how they
might be applied in the Vietnam water sector

2.C.2 International Experience of Regulation of Water Supply and
Sanitation
This section summarizes briefly some of the regulatory mechanisms applied around the world for
economic regulation of water supply and sanitation, looking at both developed and developing
countries21. Each country’s regulatory framework has been developed/ influenced by its historical,
political, economic and legal environment, as well as factors relevant to the sector itself. These
examples are given to illustrate the key issues that need to be considered and options for dealing
with them. The Government of Vietnam will need to craft the chosen solution to take into account
the specificities and challenges of the water sector in Vietnam.
The international experience can be summarized in four regulatory approaches:

            Separate regulatory agency with a Licensing Regime
            Regulation by contract
            Regulation by contract with a separate Regulator (hybrid)
            Self-regulation

A.      Separate Regulatory Agency with a licensing regime–an agency separate from the
service provider issues licenses to service providers and sets the terms of supply services. This
model has traditionally been used to regulate private service providers (as in the case of England and
Wales and the United States), but is being used increasingly to regulate public service providers (eg
some states in Australia and the US). In some countries this agency is established as an
independent, autonomous institution to distance the agency from political interference and

21
  This section draws on previous World Bank studies (including Options Paper on Water Regulation in the
Philippines WB 2013)
                                                                        Page 31
influence. Regulatory agencies may be at a national (England and Wales), regional (US and Australia
states) or local level.
In each case the regulator has been established as an independent Commission or Authority by
statute, with commissioners appointed for relatively long terms (between 5 and 7 years) and
financed out of tariffs. Their functions are clearly set out in statute and cover standard setting and
monitoring, data collection on financial and operational performance, tariff setting and monitoring,
and consumer complaint handling. Their mandates have evolved and require greater consultation
with consumer groups. In England and Wales in particular OFWAT uses extensive benchmarking of
water companies to compare performance, which is widely circulated. The regulators have broad
powers derived from statute and supported by contracts or licenses established between the
regulator and utility, with powers to impose penalties/ sanctions and give incentives and broad
powers to require disclosure of data and information. In some cases they have dispute resolution
powers regarding contracts entered into by the utilities (such as the bulk supply arrangements
entered into by water companies in England and Wales). Each of the regulators carries out price
reviews on a periodic basis (in Australia and England, usually 5 years, in the US, more frequently).
Decisions of the regulators can be challenged in court (although for England and Wales there is an
appeal mechanism via the Competition Commission). In each case there is a separate agency or
agencies responsible for water sector policy and an agency responsible for monitoring water quality
and enforcing environmental standards. The regulators coordinate with these agencies to ensure
that utilities have the funds to cover planned and mandated investments and service improvements.
The regulator in England and Wales is at national level but it is has a relatively small jurisdiction. The
commissions in the US and Australia are at state level and mostly multi-sector regulators, with
specialists for each sector. The state commissions are relatively close to their constituents but there
is concern that approaches are not uniform between state commissions and there have been calls in
each country for coordination at a national level of service standards and tariffs.
Tariff setting methodology in England and Wales is based on a price cap which allows utilities to
retain efficiency gains as long as tariff limits are not exceeded. By contrast, the approach taken in
the US is to apply a rate base/rate of return methodology based on: the value of assets on which a
return can be earned (the rate base), the authorized (but not guaranteed) rate of return to recover
capital costs, and the allowable operating expenses for the utility. Once the utility’s total revenue
requirements are established, the commission approves the tariffs that can be charged to various
classes of customers. Whilst the system is not entirely without incentives as underperforming
utilities will not earn their authorized return, gains achieved from cost savings are generally
allocated to consumers and so there is limited incentive to achieve efficiencies. Some State
commissions in the US are moving towards performance based regulation in the energy sector and
have done so in the telecoms sector. There are calls to do so in the water sector also.
In England and Wales responsibility for water supply and sanitation service provision was aggregated
into 10 regional bodies established along river basin lines, which in turn were corporatized and
privatized. It was at this juncture that economic regulation was introduced by statute. In the US the
water sector is very fragmented and there has been little attempt at aggregation or policy to
promote efficiency and economies of scale.
Advantages and Disadvantages: Separate Regulatory Agency with a licensing regime

England and Australia regulator regulates almost all service
providers. In US, more piecemeal regulation (most private
providers, some public providers)


B.      Regulation by Contract- a contract typically defines the relationship between the asset
owner and the service provider. France has a long history of these arrangements with private sector
providers contracting with local government. Such arrangements are in place in Metro Manila and
Jakarta. These arrangements are also being used increasingly for public utilities through
performance contracts (in the case studies, France, Germany and Uganda). In some cases third party
approvals (such as parliament or a government agency) are required for approving changes in tariffs.
Whilst there is some standardization of terms and conditions of contracts (in France the association
of mayors has developed standard terms for affermage contracts for example), there is criticism that
regulation by contract allows tariffs to be determined on a case by case basis, with significant
differences in tariffs allowed in different communes, and there have been calls over the years for
some standardization in tariff setting methodology and national economic regulation. In France such
calls are fiercely opposed by communes and the private sector.
The range of contracts and arrangements available in France and Germany mean that there are a
number of models that can be applied to the particular circumstances of the utility, with greater or
lesser financing and investment risk passed to the private sector depending on the contract. There is
also use of mixed ownership companies.
In France regulation by contract has worked relatively effectively in terms of policies promoting
aggregation of water operations, with incentives for communes combining to form clusters to
delegate services to private sector providers. There has also been significant consolidation amongst
the private sector service providers (with three main water companies dominating the sector which
are now international providers). However, this concentration has raised concerns- these
                                                   Page 33
companies are well resourced and sophisticated and their negotiating power is often considered to
be much stronger than that of the communes.
Drinking water quality and environmental standards are typically monitored at the state or national
levels, but there is limited benchmarking of service providers and data is not always widely
distributed and published.
Municipalities have the ability to enforce sanctions against service providers directly, through
regulation by contract, and so accountability is achieved at a local level. Administrative courts also
step in, particularly in France, to ensure that both the public and private parties are performing their
contractual obligations.
In France and Germany regulation by contract is limited to private operators and so the public
utilities are subject to limited oversight and to political influence. As a result, public providers tend
to have lower tariffs but also lower performance levels. Uganda has developed a system of
performance contracts for public service providers, which has been effective, although there is a
perception that the system works in Uganda due to significant political support and consistent
policies and that it might be difficult to replicate elsewhere.


Advantages and Disadvantages: Regulation by Contract

Advantages                                                Disadvantages
Clear separation of policy function (at national level)   Limited regulatory oversight of public operators
and asset ownership and oversight function
(municipalities)
Entity overseeing performance (municipality) is local     Limited capacity of some municipalities
In France, aggregation of services of communes            In Germany the sector is fragmented and no policy
(economies of scale) has been encouraged through          towards aggregation
legislation, with some aggregating along river basins
                                                          No central body setting tariff methodology – lack of
                                                          consistency in tariffs.
                                                          Germany and France, regulation only covering private
                                                          sector operators.
Limited standardization of contracts                      Inconsistency in enforcement of contracts
Flexible – contracts can be amended, courts will          Still some lack of transparency in contract award and
determine on changes of circumstance                      extension of contracts – particularly in France where
                                                          there are three dominant private operators in market
                                                          (which may reduce room for effective competition)
Sanctions and incentives – contract with sanctions        Limited disclosure of information – little
and incentives, municipality with ultimate sanction of    benchmarking of private operators
termination
Administrative courts ensure equilibrium between
parties and both parties perform their contractual
obligations
Some obligations under law for disclosure of              Limited number of contracts (concessions) where
information                                               private sector is investing heavily
Private sector participation extensive in France


C.      Regulation by contract with a separate regulator (hybrid)– Under the hybrid model
regulation by contract is combined with regulatory supervision by an independent regulator.

                                                   Page 34
Typically tariffs agreed between the parties to the contract at the local level need to be approved by
the regulator. This combined approach has been used for public utilities (Colombia and Kenya) and
private WSCs (Niger and Colombia).
In Kenya and Colombia, there is a particular disparity between the large urban water providers and
the small scale rural providers and community based systems.
In Kenya there is a central economic regulator regulating publicly owned asset holders and service
providers. The regulator establishes a tariff setting methodology, approves tariffs agreed between
the public asset holders and the service providers and provides standardized contract terms and
conditions, whilst the local public asset holders monitor performance of the service providers
through a contract. The standard service agreements allow for different levels of service depending
on the size of water system/service provider and so has flexibility. Whilst there have been
significant improvements in service achieved since reform of the Kenyan water sector in 2002, there
has in practice been limited enforcement of investment obligations on the asset holders by the
regulator or enforcement of service provision standards and there is concern that there is limited
capacity and lack of accountability at the more local level.
In Colombia water service provision is decentralized to the municipal level. For the public service
providers regulatory functions are divided between three central agencies. These agencies have
ensured that there is resource and capacity located locally to effectively implement this approach.
Municipal utilities have been transformed into public stock companies that allow for private sector
participation and there are a number of examples of private sector participation in the water sector
in Colombia. Communal water boards still mainly provide water supply services in rural and peri-
urban areas, and the private sector is mainly involved in larger urban areas. Where there is a
concession or a lease/affermage contract between municipality and a private company, the general
practice is to set service standards and tariffs in the contract which are to be monitored and
enforced by the municipality (ie regulation by contract). However, the municipal concession and
lease contracts are required to be consistent with national service standards and tariff setting
methodologies established the national level by central bodies.
Advantages and Disadvantages: Regulation by contract with a separate regulator (hybrid)

Advantages                                                 Disadvantages
Central agency/ agencies with clear function and           Risk that central agency will be central focused and
powers and clear mandate                                   focused on larger providers, rather than at local level
                                                           – but this could be offset by local presence and/ or
                                                           performance contracts at a local level.

D.       Self-regulation– this is where the public service provider regulates its activities, sets tariffs
and performance standards and monitors performance. The utility is typically accountable to a third
party – such as a board of directors (as for many public utilities in the US where the municipality is
providing the service eg San Francisco) or a monitoring body, such as the city council (with or
without a formal contract). The majority of LGU service providers in the Philippines are currently
self-regulating and this has proved unsatisfactory as significant political interference has resulted in
low tariffs and underinvestment in many of the LGUs. There is also a difficulty in many self-
regulating models with respect to a lack of uniformity in performance standards or tariff setting,
with huge fluctuations from one service provider to another. Cambodia also has one service provider
in the capital that self-regulates. In sectors where there is competition (eg telecommunications), it is
often argued that market forces are sufficient to keep pressure on tariffs and performance allowing
the sector to “self-regulate”.

2.C.3 Regulatory Design: Lessons learnt from International Experience


There are significant differences between the regulatory models highlighted in the international
examples but there are a number of commonalities:

a) whilst traditionally economic regulation has been introduced in respect of private WSCs, there
   are more and more examples of effective economic regulation of public WSCs
b) typically regulators regulate both water and sanitation service provision, although in practice
   regulation of sanitation provision has proved more effective where there are extensive
   centralized sewerage systems
c) whilst the two principal models of regulation (other than self-regulation) used around the world
   have been regulation by a separate agency or regulation by contract, there is a growing number
   of hybrid models of regulation with a regulatory body operating alongside asset holders, or
   complementing regulation by contract
d) a written license or contract between the WSC and the licensor (regulator)/ asset owner setting
   out clearly performance obligations and targets and establishing tariffs (for both public and
   private WSCs) enables oversight and benchmarking of performance (an important issue already
   raised in separately Section 1 of this Review in relation to improved utility effectiveness)
e) a separate centralized regulatory function can be useful to promote standardization of terms
   and oversee tariff setting, even where there is in place regulation by contract,
f) effective regulation requires a clear mandate and effective enforcement powers - the majority
   but not all of the regulators in the case studies were commissions or authorities established by
   statute with powers to enforce their functions and impose fines,
g) regulatory mechanisms need to have flexibility build into them to allow them to adapt to meet
   the challenges and changing demands of the sector,
h) effective economic regulation has not been achieved instantly and it has taken time to build
   capacity within both the regulating entities and the regulated utilities
i) significant staff and resources are needed both at a central as well as local level to make
   regulation effective. In countries where there are national regulators and a large number of
   WSCs, the regulators have regional offices to serve WSCs at the local level. In some federal
   countries regulatory bodies have been established at a state level. Regulation by contract
   provides a more local link between the WSC and the regulator.

2.C.4 Regulation of the Electricity Sector in Vietnam


A good example of a relatively successful regulator in Vietnam is the Electricity Regulatory Authority
of Vietnam (ERAV). It has a clear mandate on its authority, functions and responsibilities23. It is has a
key role in an established sector reform agenda. Its activities and methodology approach have been
well established and over time resources, organization and capacity have been established to carry
out its regulatory functions.
There is a general perception that ERAV is evolving into a well-functioning and experienced regulator
for the electricity sector, but it is recognized that even after 6 years of operation it still has much
work to do.
Whilst any regulator for the water sector will have to deal with sector specific issues, ERAV provides
some important lessons for establishing a successful utility regulator in Vietnam:

Clear legal Mandate:
ERAV is established within the Vietnamese legal framework, under the Ministry of Industry and
Trade through Prime Ministerial Decision #153/2008 /QD-TTg da.

Defined Position and Function:
ERAV is an agency under the Ministry of Industry and Trade: implements advisory functions to help
the Minister in governmental management of electricity activities; organizes to carry out the
regulatory responsibilities in the power industry to ensure supplying electricity safely, stably, to
quality, using electricity economically/effectively and to ensure fairness, transparency, and
complying with the law.
ERAV has a legal status with separate official seal and bank account. It has an operating budget
supported by the national budget and from fees collected from the utilities. It has a head office
located in Hanoi.

Defined Responsibilities & Authorities
Whilst these include items specific to the electricity industry, many of them are also relevant to the
water sector. These include:

        Responsibility for approval or issuance of:
            o Regulation of setting the methodology, processes and procedures for promulgation
                 of retail tariffs
            o Retail tariff setting
            o Regulation of compliance with the law within the sector
        Advice and support to the Minister for promulgation of regulation and projects:
            o Granting, altering, amending and withdrawing Licenses
            o Regulation of least cost planning
            o Regulation of sector effectiveness ( eg consumption, power purchase agreements,
                 codes, standards)

Established Organization
ERAV has an official Board of Management with a Director and two Deputy General Directors. It has
a well-staffed organization, with appropriate qualifications and skills. These are organized in
functional departments:

     Administration
     Legal
     Customer Relation & Licensing
     Market Development Department
     IT
     Tariffs and Rates Department
     Planning & Technical Regulation
The Head Office is in Hanoi. Regional offices are envisaged for the central and southern regions to
reflect the regional structure of the power distribution utilities.

Lessons learned from ERAV
Whatever the approach for regulation in the Vietnam water sector, the lessons learnt in establishing
and implementing ERAV should be taken into account. It is a relatively effective regulator under
Vietnamese conditions. Although the sectors are different, the key issues for establishing,
implementing and operating a regulatory environment are the same.



2.C.5 Recommendations for Economic Regulation of the Urban Water
Utility Sector
This section sets out the recommendations for the regulatory approach for the water sector, taking
into account the findings from the previous sections.

                                               Page 40
The current situation for water services in Vietnam is described in detail in Section 1 of this report.
This highlighted some of the challenges that are affecting the progress of reform in the water sector.
One of the main challenges is the lack of formal economic regulation.

The decentralized nature of the sector, with 79 WSC’s, a mixture of public, equitized and private
companies, and a small number of PPP contracts will bring particular issues of management and
control.

In Section 1, reviewing progress of the equitization process and associated sector reform, it was
noted that there is a lack of formal control and integrated management across the water sector
business(pulling together and integrating levels of service, asset management and needs, O&M
planning, investment needs and business plans). Whilst guidelines for implementation of a method
of implementing this approach (e.g. through the proposed contract between PPCs and individual
WSCs) are already established, the detailed methodology, resources and program for
implementation are not yet in place.

A pre-requisite for the successful development of a Water Regulatory Agency is that it would have to
be undertaken in parallel with the formalization of the contractual agreements between PPCs and
individual utilities- a key part of the sector reform process. In particular this would require the
establishment of levels of service targets combined with formal asset management and planning,
investment planning, tariff setting and business planning procedures, without which effective
economic regulation would not be feasible.

Resolution of these key issues is necessary for effective economic regulation. Any regulatory
approach must be linked to their development and implementation.

Section 2.C.3 summarized international experience of water sector regulation that the government
could draw on, focusing on 3 main models: a separate regulatory agency with a licensing regime,
regulation by contract, and a hybrid mechanism combining regulation by contract with a separate
regulator. Section 2.c.4 reviewed the regulatory model in the electricity sector in Vietnam (with
regulator ERAV).

Proposed approach for establishing an Economic Regulator:
Drawing from the international case studies we recommend that the most appropriate regulatory
model for the water sector in Vietnam would be the model of regulation by contract with a
separate regulatory agency. This model would need to be adapted to the decentralized nature of
the Vietnam water sector. This model is similar in principle to the ERAV model for the electricity
sector although with adaption to the specific needs of the water sector.

The main functions of the proposed Water Regulatory Authority for Vietnam (suggested here as
WRAV) are shown in the following diagram below, which also references the main roles of the other
existing regulators and stakeholders in the water sector:

The WRAV would be an autonomous body, but under the guidance of the Ministry of Construction,
the line ministry for the sector. With a head office in Hanoi we recommend the establishment and
resourcing of a number of regional offices to deal with the large number of individual utilities in the
provinces. It will be important that the WRAV coordinates with the Ministries and Government
Departments involved in setting and administering policy on the water and sanitation sector as well
as with the other sector regulators.

   At the core of this regulatory model is the establishment of the contractual agreements between
   PPCs and utilities. The diagram above outlines the proposed institutional arrangements that would
   link these contractual arrangements at the provincial level to the WRAV, with a small Local
   Regulatory Office being established for each province to work directly with the PPC and utility. This
   Office would have the role of facilitating PPC/utility dialogue on contract compliance, establishing
   and monitoring a robust annual business planning process, and reporting on service quality,
   performance indicators and tariff related issues on behalf of the PPC and the utility. This would be
   an autonomous office, with close liaison with the WRAV head office. This local regulatory office
   would offer support in facilitating the initial establishment of the necessary contractual and
   reporting systems, as well as ensuring the effectiveness and validity of long term reporting and
   monitoring for regulatory purposes.




                                                  Page 43
Whilst it will be important that the Local Regulatory Office retain its autonomy for regulation of the
utility contract, the Office can also offer advice and resources to the PPC and the utility to facilitate
the achievement of the regulated goals of the utility.

The key steps to implement this regulatory model include the establishment of WRAV, regional
regulatory offices and the local regulatory offices:



    1. Create a central independent regulatory Authority for water supply and sanitation
        based in Hanoi with a limited number of regional sub-offices
    The benefits of creating a separate independent and autonomous regulatory Authority are that
    it will be established by statute (and so can be given a clear mandate and powers to regulate
    private and public WSCs), can take independent decisions, can draw expertise from the private
    sector (if deemed appropriate), and can source its operating budget through the central budget
    and/or through a fee added to the tariff (as for ERAV).
    There is also direct experience in the energy sector of economic regulation performed by an
    independent Authority established by statute, and the water sector regulator can be designed
    drawing on the experience of and lessons learnt from regulation in that sector.

    2. The Authority should be established by statute
    The international case studies highlight the potential sources of regulatory power (eg through
    legislation, a license, a contract, or a combination of these). In the case of legislation there is
    also a question as to whether this needs to be primary legislation or secondary legislation. In
    most cases the separate regulator was established through primary legislation. Where there is
    an existing overlap of institutional mandates and the need to clarify functions and powers (as is
    the case of the Philippines), it may be difficult for a regulatory entity to assert its authority
    unless it is established under primary legislation. This is particularly important regarding WRAV’s
    mandate with respect to the PPCs.


    It is important for the regulator to have well-resourced regional sub-offices since the water
    sector is highly decentralized, with many of the utilities and PPCs lacking the resources or
    capacity to develop and implement tariff methodologies and so needing support and assistance
    from WRVA. Ensuring a regional presence will enable WRAV to provide support at a local level
    and also to achieve more effective oversight. It will also enable a forum for consumer bodies to
    be formed at a regional level and to publicize service standards and explanations for tariff levels.
    The regional offices will also be able to assess more easily the immediate needs of the smaller
    WSCs and facilitate better coordination with PPCs on investment planning and review of
    subsidies.
    It is recommended to keep WRAV as a standalone agency, working in parallel with other
    regulatory bodies (Health, Water Resources and Environment).

    3. Composition of Authority
    WRAV would be autonomous, under the purview of the Ministry of Construction. It could
    comprise, for example, of 5 commissioners appointed for long terms (eg 7 years) – each with

                                                Page 44
prescribed levels of experience in particular relevant activities (eg water sector operations,
economics/finance, legal,). Appointments should be staggered (perhaps 2 or 1 changing every 2
years) to preserve continuity and avoid capacity vacuums Experience and expertise on
establishing and implementing a regulatory authority might also be drawn on – especially that
for ERAV, but also international experience.

4. Domain of the Authority
The Authority’s domain would include all WSCs (including public, equitized and private),
including those currently under concession or lease arrangements. Legislation may need to be
enacted or current legislation amended.

5. Functions and Powers of the Authority
The Authority would be the economic regulator of the water sector. Functions would include:
 a. Confirming tariff setting mechanisms and tariff decisions and conducting price reviews. To
    preserve local provincial autonomy it might be appropriate to prescribe a national tariff
    setting methodology for the PPCs to apply, and then monitor PPC adherence to the tariff
    setting and adjustment methodology. It is important that PPCs have a performance based
    contract with their WSC’s that sets out clear service standards and provides at least a
    methodology for tariff setting that will be followed. Similar to the approach taken in Kenya,
    the Authority could develop standardized contracts. Price reviews would be mandatory on
    a periodic basis (such as every 5 years) and the Authority would have the responsibility to
    ensure that the tariff setting methodology was being followed in these reviews.
 b. Developing harmonized service and performance standards, targets and reporting
    requirements commensurate with the size and capacity of different WSCs. This would be in
    consultation with other agencies.
 c. Dealing with private sector participation in water services - the Authority would adapt
    procedures for regulation of existing and new PPP contracts
 d. Monitoring performance (operational and financial) of WSC’s and assist PPCs to monitor
    contract compliance.
 e. Obliging WSCs to develop business plans and asset management plans and gather financial
    and performance data.
 f. Sharing data with other agencies and working with the existing MOC database system to
    benchmark WSC performance. The Authority will need to have clear enforcement powers
    (again, it could look at the powers of regulators in other sectors). The government may wish
    to put limits on these powers or impose general obligations of fairness and proportionality
    on the regulator, and determine how often tariff setting and reviews should take place. It
    should be noted, however, that such checks and balances tend to work better in an
    environment where the rule of law and judicial institutions are strong.
 g. Ensuring that poor households have equal access to utility services. The Authority could
    write a low income household policy that utilities should implement and could work with
    PPCs and utilities to ensure that sufficient funds are made available for equitable access.
    The Authority could also consider establishing social fund for this purpose. The policy could
    also cover the establishment of tariff and disconnection regulations to specifically protect
    the interests of poor households.


                                          Page 45
   6. Data collection and benchmarking
   The Authority should share data with other agencies and benchmark WSC performance within
   the sector. The Authority would be well placed, provided that it is well resourced at the regional
   level, to collect data and to assist smaller WSCs in preparing data and developing investment
   plans. It would then feed this information into other government agencies, and develop
   performance reports that it could disseminate to consumers as well as WSCs.


    7. GoV could consider incentivising local governments and PPCs to cluster
       operations (regionalise)
to achieve economies of scale and improve performance (perhaps with loans or grants for
investments from a fund administered by the Ministry of construction). Allocation of incentives
would need to be coordinated with the Authority and MPI/MOF.


   8. Water resource management
   Permitting functions should remain with the Department of Water Resource Management, but
   should be undertaken with formal coordination with the Authority to ensure consistency with
   PPC-utility contract conditions and utility business plans.

1. Drinking water standards and environmental regulation
2. should remain the responsibility of MOH and MONRE, but in consultation and coordination with
   the Authority.

3. Policy
for the water sector would remain with MOC

4. Water sector investments
5. would continue to be coordinated by MOC, MPI and MOF, with inputs from the Authority
   relating to the contents of regulated utility business plans (investment plans, asset management
   plans etc).

6. Funding
The establishment and operation of the Authority should be funded from the State budget until it is
fully functional, with significant resources devoted to staffing and establishment of the regional
offices as well as central functions. Subsequent funding could be supplemented by a charge included
in water tariffs, allowing government funding to gradually fall away. This would also enhance the
political independence of the Authority.

    One of the challenges facing regulators is often lack of resources and staff. Effective regulation
   requires significant resources, particularly in such a decentralized sector. An initial activity, as
   indicated in the roadmap below, is to set aside a budget appropriation for establishing and
   equipping the Authority. If MOC is to provide incentives to service providers through loans,
   grants and subsidies, thought will also need to be given to how these are to be funded.



                                              Page 46
7. Consumer consultation committees
   should be set up in the different sub-regions and be mandated by statute. There is often very
   low consumer awareness of the levels of service that the utility should provide – and that they
   should expect. In this respect the utilities could follow the UK model and issue a

                                 International case studies have shown the benefits of formally
    establishing consumer representative groups, with increasing recognition of these groups in
    statute. The Authority should be mandated to consult these groups on issues such as complaints,
    service performance and tariffs.

8. Communication
   The Authority should have a strong mandate to communicate water policy to stakeholders and
   provide support and information to all PPCs and WSCs. This will also link in with benchmarking
   and consultation with consumer groups.

9. An appeals procedure
   should be established in the law for appealing decisions of the Authority. The Regulator needs to
   be held accountable for its decisions. Stakeholders such as investors and customers will also be
   anxious to know how the Regulator can be brought to account for its actions and whether there
   is to be a mechanism for appeal against regulatory decisions and the remedies available if the
   regulator is found to have been unreasonable. In case studies there are examples of specific
   mechanisms created to provide this accountability (such as the Competition Commission in
   England and Wales) and also examples of the courts playing this role.

10. Wastewater and Sanitation should also fall under the mandate of the Authority
    but with recognition that whilst centralized sewerage provision is present in the larger cities, it is
    more limited in other areas and so the role of the Authority may need to evolve over time. The
    Authority could be responsible for setting/ establishing a tariff setting methodology for
    wastewater and sanitation and assisting WSCs to budget for centralized sewerage systems in
    more densely populated areas. It could also coordinate with other agencies to develop
    performance standards for septic tank construction and maintenance, and septage haulage,
    disposal and treatment, could develop and oversee a licensing system for faecal sludge/septage
    management. The possibility of requiring the water tariff to include a levy for investment in
    sanitation services could also be considered.


11. Consultation & Creation of Local Regulatory Offices.
    These Offices, created after consultation with local stakeholders, would have the role of
    facilitating dialogue and action between PPC and Utility to meet regulatory requirements, and
    facilitate the production of deliverables required by regulatory processes and procedures such
    as Business and Investment Plans, monitoring of KPIs. The Office would have a role in supporting
    the tariff setting process.


In order to implement such changes there would need to be supporting policy and planning
decisions and significant financing put in place. Any new regulations would need to be developed in
                                                Page 47
close coordination with the ministries, agencies and departments responsible for public health and
environmental regulation.24

It will be important to engage the different stakeholders in consultation on the regulatory approach
or model to be adopted in order to ensure that there is appropriate buy in and that the approach
will be effectively implemented. The government should also bear in mind the importance of
building flexibility into the regulatory model to allow the system to adapt with the changing
challenges and issues facing the sector in the coming years, and also in recognition that from
international experience it is difficult to design a perfect mechanism and that in practice the
mechanisms will need to be adjusted to fit the environment. Finally, the government should also
not underestimate the time that it takes to introduce and build capacity in a regulatory body, even
where existing resources and expertise are available in the market.

Below is a draft roadmap suggested steps to be taken by the government to implement the
recommended regulatory model.

3. Introduce performance contracts and work with PPCs (and utilities) to introduce a tariff setting
   methodology based on cost recovery
4. Assist utilities and PPCs to understand and implement performance based contracts, collect data
   and meet reporting requirements
5. Collate data and start disseminating it to other agencies and the public
6. Coordinate with MOF and MOC on tariff setting, and MOC/MOF/MPI on tariffs, subsidies and
   development of a funding plan or framework for the water sector.


Section 3 Conclusions

In Section 1 we provided a review of the progress of the reform process in the water sector, together
with recommendations for improving this process, and the performance of the sector in general.
This review covered the not only the equitization process, but also improving levels of service, and
the introduction of the integrated disciplines of asset management planning, business planning,
investment planning, and financial planning. It also recommended that all this be underpinned by
the establishment of contractual relationships between PPCs and WSC’s. Institutional and capacity
building support will be needed in this reform process, which will need dedicated funding – along
with capital investment funding for asset maintenance, renewal and expansion if levels of service are
to be improved.

In Section 2 we reviewed the need for regulation of the urban utility water utilities. Whilst there is a
national and regional framework in place for the regulation of health, water resources and
environmental aspects of the sector, there is no established economic regulatory framework or
system to ensure sustainable and effective provision of water services.

From our review of International and regional experience, plus the example of ERAV in Vietnam, we
concluded that an adaptation of a centralized Economic Regulatory Authority model supported by
sub-regional offices would be the recommended option for the Vietnam urban water sector.
However, development and implementation of the Regulator will require strong coordination with
the ongoing water sector reform program, including, critically the formalization of contractual
arrangements between PPCs and individual WSCs.

The steps for establishing the Economic Regulator have been outlined, together with a suggested
road map for implementation.

This review and recommended reform options are aimed at helping the Government of Vietnam in
developing a technically and financially sustainable water utility sector providing good levels of
service to customers and an efficient tariff level. We hold ourselves ready to discuss any aspect of
this review and its recommendations, and to provide further advice and assistance as may be
needed.

ANNEX D: Health Issues - Extract from Viet Nam Times 15th May 2014

Ha Noi tap water poses health
risks
Ha Noi- Tap water
Samples collected from different plants in the capital city fail to meet the Health Ministry's hygiene
standards and pose a public health hazard, according to the Ha Noi Preventive Medicine Centre.

The centre says tests on samples taken from different water plants in Ha Noi since January this year show
excessive levels of minerals and chemicals that can have serious consequences for residents. A sample
from the Phap Vfo Water Plant showed the Permanganate index, which can cause dermatitis, exceeding
the regulated level by 1.6 times, while that collected from the Ha Dong Water Plant exceeded the allowed
level by 0.4to 0.8 times.

Seven of 23 samples from different water plants in Ha Noi this March were also found high amounts of
Permanganate and ammonia. This time, samples from the Phap Yan and Ha Dong water plants had
permanganate contamination exceed the regulated level by 1.92 and 2.57 times respectively.
At the Phap Van Ha Ding water plants, the ammonia levels were3 0.3 to 0.7 times the regulated level. .
Two samples from the Son TayWater Supply Company had chlorine levels exceed maximum regulated
levels. High chlorine levels can affect the digestive system, liver and kidneys.

Nguyen Hoa Blnh, deputy director of the Ha Noi Preventive Medicine Centre, told the TilnPhong
(Vanguard) newspaper that the Phap Van and Ha Dingh water plants suffered contamination problems
often because they were old and lacked good quality underground water sources.

Tran Hon Con, lecturer at the Ha NC)i University of Natural Science, also told Tiln Phong that at 0.3mg of
chlorine per litre, the water can be sterilized, but at more than 0.5mg in each litre, it becomes a harmful
substance that can cause digestive disorders and, in some cases, mental disorder, he said. C6n said that if
the amount of ammonia in water exceeded the regulated level by very little, it would not affect people's
health. But if it was too high, it can transform to nitrite which can lead to anaemia and cancer. - VN

ANNEXF:         Water Management & Regulation - Good Practices

This note is prepared as a checklist for the current project:


Transitional Situations



    1. Adopt a long-term policy of full economic cost recovery based on affordable service
        standards.
    2. Adopt tariff policies that define the approach that will be used to determine revenue
        requirements and tariff structure and subsidies.
    3. Understand the condition of existing infrastructure and establish progressive performance
        targets based on existing asset condition and likely investment possibilities.
    4. Require business plans to be prepared by regulated utilities that focus on agreed-upon
        performance measures and strategies for obtaining full cost recovery.
    5. Adopt uniform financial planning software to support the business planning process and
        periodic updates of the business plan and request for tariff adjustment.
    6. Require regulated utilities to conduct willingness to pay surveys to understand the limits of
        tariff adjustments in the short and long term.
    7. Recognize that service improvements will most likely be needed before any significant tariff
        increases will be accepted.
    8. Initially focus on recovery of operations and maintenance cost and other cash expenses. Do
        not get carried away with theoretical positions regarding capital cost recovery until after
        operations and maintenance costs are recovered.
    9. Work closely with quality regulators to set realistic public health and environmental
        standards. The standards need to be based on the starting condition of the utility,
        availability of current and future investment, willingness to pay and incentives for achieving
        higher standards over time.
    10. Reaffirm or adopt policies that provide for termination of service to customers and the
        conditions that allow for termination of service.
    11. Adopt a policy of direct subsidies by government to customers.


Setting Performance Targets



    1. Be realistic about the starting condition of the infrastructure and available investment
       capital and the impact both have on a water utility’s ability to improve service and efficiency.
    2. Establish progressive targets based on the condition of the infrastructure and analysis of
       performance by other utilities and countries.
    3. Update performance targets based on comparative analysis of regulated water utilities.
    4. Provide significant incentives to regulated companies that will provide motivation to meet
       and exceed performance standards.
    5. Focus on a small number of the most meaningful targets rather than numerous targets.
       These are often the indicators that are directly associated with customer satisfaction and
       with financial sustainability of the utility.
    6. Require annual reports from regulated utilities that document progress toward meeting cost
       recovery objectives and performance measures.
                                                  Page 68
    7. Require independent verification of the performance measures by the regulated utilities.


Numerous Small Utilities



    1. Only regulate to the level of administrative capacity.
    2. For utilities that are regulated:
           a. Provide incentives to encourage small utilities that are regulated to consolidate into
                regional authorities.
           b. Promote PSP that results in multiple contracts with regulated utilities with one or a
                few private companies.
           c. Provide incentives to large utilities to adopt institution support mechanisms (ISMs)
                targeted at smaller utilities.
           d. Base state subsidies to small utilities on comparative analysis (of performance) and
                means testing procedures.
           e. To the extent possible, adopt a policy of declining state subsidies to motivate small
                utilities to become more efficient and to increase tariffs to willingness to pay levels.
           f. Allow for simplified tariff and reporting methods for smaller utilities.
           g. Encourage central government agencies to provide low-interest loans or grants to
                utilities that demonstrate compliance with regulations.
    3. For utilities that are not directly regulated:
           a. Adopt policies that provide for community based systems and provide guidelines to
                support their organization, operation and administration.
           b. Coordinate with NGO’s to promote, organize and train community-based
                organizations.


Public Participation



   1. Require service standards to be published and displayed in payment offices and other public
      places.
   2. Require regulated utilities to enter into written service standards with customers that
      describe service standards and customer rights, duties and remedies.
   3. Issue annual reports that provide information about the condition of the sector, progress
      achieved and future targets.
   4. Provide periodic information documents to government agencies and print media about the
      cost of water service and need for tariffs.
   5. Conduct information sessions with NGOs and public institutions (schools) about the
      condition of the sector, progress, future targets and need for rate adjustments.
   6. Organize and support water watch groups.
   7. Require regulated utilities to provide early notice of their intent to request tariff increases.
   8. Provide for customer input in the tariff review process through public hearings.
   9. Allow for either (a) rebates to customers that do not receive service to the level of agreed-
      upon service standards or (b) roll-back of tariffs is service standards are not met.

ANNEX G: Sewerage & Wastewater Services

Over the past 20 years, the Government of Vietnam has made considerable effort to develop urban
sanitation policies and to invest in urban sanitation including wastewater treatment systems.

According to the WB Urban Wastewater Review Report (2013), by 2012 some 17 urban wastewater
systems had been constructed in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang and another five systems in
provincial towns and cities with a total capacity of 530,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day). Currently
some 30 new wastewater systems, primarily comprising combined systems, are in the
design/construction phase.

During the past decade annual sanitation sector investment has been USD 150 million or USD 2.1
billion for drainage and wastewater during the period 1995-2009. This represents 0.45 percent of
GDP annually.

Despite these impressive initiatives, urban sanitation continues to face critical issues that need to be
urgently addressed:




       Although 60 percent of households dispose of wastewater to a public system, much of this is
        directed informally to the drainage system and only 10 percent is treated.
       While 90 percent of households dispose of wastewater to septic tanks, only 4 percent of
        septage is treated. Fecal sludge management is generally poor in most cities
       The focus of wastewater expenditure to date has been in constructing treatment facilities,
        but this has not always been accompanied by appropriate collection systems.
       Despite wastewater tariffs in the order of 10 percent of water tariffs being charged, cost
        recovery of the capital and operations and maintenance (O&M) costs of the wastewater
        systems is generally low.
       Institutional arrangements do not encourage efficient system operation with the
        wastewater enterprises having limited autonomy to manage operations and undertake
        system development.
       Financing needs are still very high. It is estimated that USD 8.3 billion will be required to
        provide sewerage to the forecast 2025 urban population of 36 million. This needs to be
        addressed in the context of the estimated economic losses resulting from poor sanitation of
        USD 780 million per year or 1.3 percent of GDP (WSP, 2007).
