PEKKA Impacts Evaluation

Executive Summary

This report presents the analysis of the baseline data collection as part of the effort to
evaluate the impact of the Program Kepala Keluarga (PEKKA) program. PEKKA is
an empowerment program to address the poverty and vulnerability of female-headed
households in the poorest parts of Indonesia. It wants to achieve this objective by facilitating
training to local women to become community organizers, providing seed grants to launch
sustainable micro-finance, and various capacity building initiatives. This program, which
is funded by the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF), consists of several components
that aim at building capacity at the national level as well as the local level.
	
	        The premise behind the PEKKA program is that poor female-headed households
in general, and poor widow-headed households in particular, are particularly vulnerable –
both from their poverty and arguably, from their status as a widow. Poor female-household
heads often lack the capacity to organize themselves in order to access resources provided,
for instance, by Indonesia’s various anti-poverty and development programs. As such, it is
argued that untargeted development programs (such as PNPM) are typically inadequate to
address the issue of the vulnerabilities of this marginal group. PEKKA wants to address
these needs by facilitating the formation of self-help groups among these female household
heads, and use these groups to channel resources to them.
	
	        The program has been operational since 2001. The expansion of the program to
nine additional provinces in 2010 provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the
program. For the evaluation, four out of the nine provinces were chosen in a manner that
allows for rich variations that come from differences in culture (e.g., matrilineal culture in
West Sumatera), urban/rural status, or the prevalence of polygamy. Within these provinces,
24 hamlets in 4 provinces, 4 districts, and 8 sub-districts were selected based on the share
and number of poor widows to be part of this evaluation, and 18 of them were randomly
assigned to receive the PEKKA program. The table below summarizes the provinces and
districts of sub-villages that are chosen to participate in the evaluation.

          Research Questions
          The objective of this report is to make use of the baseline data to obtain a snapshot of
          the communities that will become part of this evaluation. It aims to answer two different
          but related research questions. First, it examines whether the villages (and the households
          and individuals therein) that are selected to receive the PEKKA program (the “treatment”
          villages) have characteristics similar to those which will be part of the “control” group.
          Second, this report also makes use of the baseline dataset to answer the following question:
          Are female-headed households different from male-headed households – and if so, in what
          ways? We hope to use the dataset to inform us about the premise underlying the program.



          Data and Analytical Strategy
          Baseline data were collected in February 2011, before the implementation of the program,
          and the end-line data are expected to be collected three years after. Within each hamlet,
          100 households were surveyed. The household population is stratified into four sub-
          populations based on two dimensions: female headship and poverty status. Within each
          strata, a household is randomly sampled. A household is categorized as poor if its per-
          capita expenditure is in the lowest two quintiles in the subvillage. To ensure that we                      1




          have a large enough sample of poor female-headed households for a separate analysis, we
          oversample poor female-headed households and poor households. Out of 100 households,
          we chose 32 poor female-headed households, 32 poor male-headed households, 16 non-
          poor female-headed households and 16 non-poor male-headed households. The remaining
          4 households are reserved for the sub-village elites, that includes a head of the hamlet
          and women elites (tokoh perempuan). Each household observation is then weighted by its
          probabilistic sampling weight.
          	         To test for differences between treatment and control communities, we estimated
          a simple regression on community variables with a dummy variable that indicated
          whether a particular community was allocated into the treatment group. Similarly, to
          test for differences between households/individuals in treatment and control groups, we
          again included a dummy variable that indicated whether a household/individual lives in a
          treatment village. District fixed-effects were included in the regressions to reduce effects
          from unobservable variables at the district level.
          	         We implemented a similar estimation strategy to test whether female-headed
          households (and female household heads) have characteristics that are significantly different
          (in the statistical sense) compared to the male-headed households (and male household heads
          or their spouses). To wit, we estimated a regression on a dummy variable that indicated
          whether a household (individual) is a female-headed household (female household head).
          For this second set of regressions, however, we included village fixed-effects to reduce
          the potential bias coming from unobservable variables. In some specifications, we also
          included individual control variables (such as age and education) and household variables
          (such as per-capita expenditure) as control variables.
          1	           The per-capita expenditure of the household is determined using the simplified expenditure questionnaire that was fielded   dur-
          ing the construction of the sampling frame.

Results
On the difference between treatment and comparison groups, the baseline data suggest
that at various levels of aggregation (village/subvillage, household, individual), the two
groups are comparable. We find minor differences in baseline community characteristics
between two groups. Similarly, households in the two groups are also comparable in their
characteristics. In terms of the individual characteristics, there are less female adults in
the treatment group compared to the control group. Adults in the treatment group tend to
participate in more organizations, and are also more likely to participate in local governing
organizations such as Rukun Tetangga or Rukun Warga. Children under three years old are
also more likely to receive complete immunizations in the treatment group. However, in
many other individual characteristics listed above, the two groups are similar. At any rate,
in the final analysis, we can utilize the baseline characteristics to control for pre-treatment
differences.
	        Meanwhile, in terms of the difference between female- and male-headed households,
we do not find evidence for the claim that female-headed households are disadvantaged
across all dimensions. We find that female household heads tend to be older and less
educated compared to the male household heads. However, we find no differences in per-
capita expenditure between female- and male-headed households – both in the overall
sample and the poor household sample. Female-headed households have lower per-capita
income, but in the overall sample, the difference disappears after we control for age and
education. This difference in per-capita income persisted among the poorest sub-population.
We also do not find strong evidence for this claim when we examine differences in access to
financial services and government social programs, or in assets. In terms of access to legal
documents, female household heads are somewhat disadvantaged, but these disadvantages
appear to be correlated more with their level of education instead of their female household
head status. We find similar results for the law under which their marriage is certified.

          	        At the same time, we do find that female household heads have a lower subjective
          welfare and a bleaker view of their future. They are also more likely to experience negative
          mental states (such as loneliness and depression) and less likely to experience positive
          mental states (such as the feeling of happiness) compared to male household heads. These
          results persist when we control for age and education. The results also do not seem to be
          rooted in gender effects, since female household heads have a lower subjective welfare and
          are more likely to be in a negative mental states when compared to the spouses of male
          household heads.

I. Introduction

This report presents results from baseline data collection as part of the effort to evaluate the
impacts of the Program Kepala Keluarga (PEKKA) program. PEKKA is an empowerment
program to address the poverty and vulnerability of female-headed households in the
poorest parts of Indonesia. It wants to achieve this objective by facilitating training to
local women to become community organizers, providing seed grants to launch sustainable
micro-finance, and various capacity building initiatives. This program, which is funded by
the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF), consists of several components that aim at
building capacity at the national level as well as the local level.
	        The premise behind the PEKKA program is that poor female-headed households
in general, and poor widow-headed households in particular, are particularly vulnerable –
both from their poverty and arguably, from their status as a widow. Poor female-household
heads often lack the capacity to organize themselves in order to access resources provided,
for instance, by Indonesia’s various anti-poverty and development programs. As such, it is
argued that untargeted development programs (such as PNPM) are typically inadequate to
address the issue of the vulnerabilities of this marginal group.
	        Since its inception in 2001, the impacts of the program have not been rigorously
evaluated and documented. Gaduh (2007) provided an early assessment of whether PEKKA
has delivered its promised outputs to groups that are its target – namely, poor female-
headed households using a cross-section dataset that was collected by PEKKA’s program
managers. However, to make inferences about program impacts, it is necessary (though often
not sufficient) to have data on non-PEKKA households whose pre-program characteristics
were similar to PEKKA households as a comparison group in order to establish some sort
of a counterfactual. Since the data that were available then were only collected on program
beneficiaries, it was not possible to analyze program impacts. Fortunately, the expansion
of the program in 2010 to nine additional provinces provided an opportunity to conduct an
impact evaluation.
	        This report provides a brief overview of the impact evaluation strategy for PEKKA
and analyzes the dataset that was collected at the baseline, prior to program implementation.
Its objective is two-fold. First, it examines whether the villages (and the households and
individuals therein) that are selected to receive the PEKKA program (the “treatment”
villages) have characteristics similar to those which will be part of the “control” group. We
elaborate in Section IV why this comparability is important to establish. Second, this report
also makes use of the baseline dataset to answer the following question: Are female-headed
households different from male-headed households – and if so, in what ways? We hope to
use the dataset to inform us about the premise underlying the program.
	        On the difference between treatment and comparison groups, we find that at
various levels of aggregation (village/subvillage, household, individual), the two groups
are comparable. We find a number of differences, in particular for individual-level
characteristics. Since we have pre-program characteristics across treatment and control
groups, we can control for these characteristics when we perform the final analysis.
	        Meanwhile, in terms of the difference between female- and male-headed households,
we do not find evidence for the claim that female-headed households are disadvantaged in


                                                                                   Pekka Impacts Evaluation

          all dimensions. Although we find female household heads to be older and less educated, we
          do not find evidence that female-headed households – in both the full sample and the sub-
          sample of poorest households – are economically disadvantaged compared to male-headed
          households. However, female household heads tend to report lower subjective welfare as
          well as more incidences of depression or loneliness.
          	        This report is structured as follows. The following section discusses the PEKKA
          program, in particular how it is implemented, followed with a brief outline of the evaluation
          strategy. Then in Section III we discuss the data and the outcomes analyzed in this report.
          Section IV discusses the methodology used to assess the comparability of treatment and
          control groups as well as the results. It is followed by a similarly structured section –
          that includes both the methodology and the results – to examine characteristic differences
          between female- and male-headed households and their members. Section VI concludes.

II. Evaluating PEKKA

2.1 The PEKKA Program
The first step in the process to implement a typical PEKKA program is the formation of
self-help groups and PEKKA facilitates the self-organization of these groups among female
household heads. Once formed, the program use these groups to channel resources to its
members. Resources channeled through these groups include financial (i.e., seed money to
start a micro-finance scheme) and informational resources (training on financial literacy
and other relevant topics, capacity building opportunities, workshops, etc.). The program
cycle is expected to be around 3 years, and during that period, the program’s success is
going to be measured by: (a) The extent to which it is sustainable; (b) Stability of the
economic welfare of its beneficiaries; and (c) Better access to core social services.
	         How does the program target beneficiaries? A typical PEKKA program is rolled
out as follows. It begins with village selection. The village selection process begins at the
district level – which is two administrative levels above a village. Secondary household-
level data are typically available up to the district level. As such, program administrators
would use these data to find districts with high shares of female-headed households and
select treatment districts.
	         Within the chosen districts, program administrators would visit the sub-districts
officials to find village profile data in terms of the number of female-headed households
residing in these villages. In addition, they will also collect data on the number of divorces,
migrant workers – since it is quite common for many male migrant workers to leave to
work abroad and do not come back – and cases of domestic violence. Based on these data,
program administrators would choose the treatment sub-districts.
	         They then visited the village officials within these districts to find the number of
female-headed households in these villages and sort the villages based on this number.
Program administrators then begin visiting villages with the highest number of female-
headed households, and go door-to-door to introduce themselves and the program. They
then try to assess whether there is adequate interest in the program. If the interest is not
there, program administrators would move on to the next village in their sorted list, and
try to gauge interest in the program. They continue to do this until they have reached their
target number of villages.
	         If the interest is there, then program administrators will send facilitators to these
villages. These facilitators would try to facilitate the formation of a PEKKA group. They
would do this by, first, encouraging the acceptance of such a group by the community.
Second, they would find a “cadre”, which is an individual that would act as the group’s
local organizer. Third, they would facilitate discussions with interested female household-
heads on the working plan ahead. After groups are established, program administrators
would provide these groups with seed money to run a micro-finance scheme (along with the
financial literacy training to manage the operation) and various training modules on health,
legal and political rights, and others.

        Tenggara, West Nusa Tenggara, West Java, Central Java, West Kalimantan, Southeast
        Sulawesi, and North Maluku. Additional funding allows the program to expand further: In
        2010, the program began expansion into nine new provinces, namely North, West, and South
        Sumatera, Banten, Yogyakarta, East Java, South Kalimantan, South and North Sulawesi.
        With this expansion comes the opportunity to evaluate the impacts of the program.

        2.2 Program Evaluation
        Ideally, we want to evaluate the program using the randomized controlled trial (RCT)
        methodology by randomly assigning the PEKKA programs to villages from a population
        of eligible village (Duflo et al., 2007). However, in the case of the latest expansion of
        the PEKKA program, there are technical as well as logistical challenges that make RCT
        hard to implement. First, there is the issue of compliance – to wit, both to ensure that the
        program is implemented in treatment villages and no program is implemented in control
        villages. In the case of PEKKA, the risk of non-compliance is great. One way to avoid this                   2




        is to try to randomize at a higher administrative unit – i.e., instead of randomizing villages
        or sub-villages, we can try to randomize at the sub-district level. However, this would
        require PEKKA administrators to work at a lot of sub-districts simultaneously – which,
        unfortunately, was not possible given the amount of resources available to them.
        	         Instead, we implemented a less ambitious impact evaluation strategy. Working
        closely with PEKKA administrators, we began by choosing 4 of the 9 provinces. These
        provinces were chosen to allow for rich variations that come from differences in culture
        (e.g., matrilineal culture in West Sumatera), urban/rural status, or the prevalence of
        polygamy. In each of these provinces, we utilized secondary data to find eligible locations.
        First, we find a district with the highest share of poor widows. Then, within each district,
        we chose 2 sub-districts and within each sub-district, 3 villages based on the highest share
        of poor widows. Finally in each of the village, we choose a hamlet with the highest number
        of poor widows. We therefore have a total of 24 hamlets (or sub-villages) that will be part
        of this impact evaluation. Table I lists the 4 districts that are included in this study.

        2	            We have identified the following issues related to compliance. First, knowledge of the presence of a social program in another
        village within the same sub-district may create social tensions, as villagers in the control village may demand the same program in their
        village. The program administrators suggest that it would be very difficult for them to refuse these requests, especially from nearby villages,
        without being seen as unfair. Second, even if they can refuse to treat to the next village, villagers in the control villages can still come over
        to the treatment villages to join or create their own self-help groups. Third, even if they are prevented to come over, information about the
        benefits of self-organization might induce villagers in the control villages to try and form groups on their own that are similar to those in the
        treatment villages.

        III. Data Collection and Measurements

        3.1 Data Collection
        We collected data at the baseline, before program implementation, and we plan to collect
        another set of data to construct a panel three years after program implementation. Baseline
        data were collected in February 2011 by SurveyMeter, and we plan to collect the endline
        data in 2014. Data were collected at the village, sub-village, and household levels. For data
        at the village and sub-village level, the respondents are informants that are knowledgeable,
        and they usually work in the village or sub-village administration, although they do not
        necessarily have to be the village or sub-village head.
        	         Meanwhile, we interviewed a total of 100 households in each hamlet. The
        household population is stratified into four sub-populations based on two dimensions:
        female headship and poverty status. Within each strata, a household is randomly sampled.
        A household is categorized as poor if its per-capita expenditure is in the lowest two quintiles
        in the subvillage.3 To ensure that we have a large enough sample of poor female-headed
        households for a separate analysis, we oversample poor female-headed households and
        poor households. Out of 100 households, we chose 32 poor female-headed households, 32
        poor male-headed households, 16 non-poor female-headed households and 16 non-poor
        male-headed households. The remaining 4 households are reserved for the sub-village
                                                4




        elites, that includes a head of the hamlet and women elites (tokoh perempuan). To facilitate
        sub-village level analysis, we created a probabilistic sampling weight for each household
        observation. In each household, the main respondent is the household head and adults (to
                           5




        wit, individuals who are older than 15 years old) in the household.

        3.2 Measurements of Characteristics and Outcomes
        The survey collected a rich set of information on community, household, and individual
        characteristics. Below we describe the subset of variables and indicators at different levels
        of aggregations that is the focus of this baseline study.

        3.2.1 Village and Sub-village Characteristics
        Community variables are collected from an informant and not results of aggregations of
        household or individual responses. As such, for each variable, there is one observation for
        each village or sub-village. We can group the village-level variables as follows: community
        head characteristics, demographic and economic characteristics, access to different
        government poverty programs, and infrastructure. The demographic characteristics of
        interest include village size (in terms of both households and population) as well as the
        share of poor households. Meanwhile, the economic characteristics that will be examined

        3	           The per-capita expenditure of the household is determined using the simplified expenditure questionnaire that was fielded during
        the construction of the sampling frame.


        4	            In the case when the number of households of a certain strata in the population is too small, the remaining quota for that strata
        is allocated to the next strata in the following order: poor female-headed households, poor male-headed households, non-poor female-headed
        households, and non-poor male-headed households.


        5	           The probabilistic sampling weight is simply the population size divided by the sample size for each strata for each sub-village.

            are the community’s main economic sector, the labor market characteristics (i.e., wages and
            hours worked) in these villages and sub-villages, and whether villagers recently experienced
            significant adverse economic shocks in the past twelve months. We also look at whether the
            village receives the different types of the government poverty alleviation programs.
            	
            Furthermore, we also look at the village social and economic infrastructure. We compare
            the availability of electricity, educational facilities at different levels, and health facilities
            and staffs between treatment and control villages.   More specifically, we calculated the
            number of facilities and staffs per capita for the different educational facilities, as well as
            health facilities and staffs. In addition, we also look at their access to the market and the
            different levels of government, using time and monetary cost to reach the market and the
            subdistrict and district offices as a proxy, and whether there are financial institutions in these
            communities. Finally, we also compare the access of these villages to the “outside world”
            by looking at whether they can receive television and radio broadcast signals. Tables II - V
            below provide the summary statistics of all of the village and sub-village variables for this
            analysis.

            3.2.2 Household- and individual-level characteristics
            We hypothesize that PEKKA would improve the welfare of its beneficiaries, among others,
            by increasing their income, assets, human capital (especially those of children), as well
            as access to finance. We also expect that the close-knit community  provided by program
            would improve members’ subjective well-beings and social capital, while its information
            programs would improve the knowledge of female household heads regarding their legal
            and political rights and encourage local leadership – which, eventually, leads to better
            access to social services. We therefore collect a wide range of measures that capture notions
            of economic and subjective welfare, human and social capital, access to finance, and access
            to social services.6

            3.2.2.1 Economic and Subjective Welfare Measures
            We collected a wide set of information that include both economic and subjective
            assessments to measure household welfare. At the household level, we collected the
            households’ total expenditure and combined them with information on household size to
            construct the households’ monthly per-capita expenditure (PCE), per-capita income (PCI)
            and per-capita savings. Finally, we also collected a detailed list of household assets. Table
            VI presents the various per-capita measures of economic welfare. The summary statistics
            of household assets is presented in Table VII.
            	At the individual level, we collected information on economic and subjective well-
            being. On the former, we expect that the economic empowerment aspect of PEKKA may be
            affecting welfare by altering the employment opportunities of beneficiaries. We therefore
            collected employment information of adults in the sample, including their labor force
            participation, sectors and types of jobs. Table VIII provides the overall summary statistics
            on labor market characteristics of adult household members in the sample.
            6	           We also include a set of questions on respondents’ knowledge of their legal and political rights, although we do not analyze
            these questions in this baseline study.

      16
        	        Meanwhile, to measure subjective welfare, we collected the perceptions of adults
        regarding their current economic conditions, food consumption, health, and the welfare
        of their children. First, respondents were asked to rank, in a scale of 1 to 6, their current
        welfare, where 1 is poorest and 6 is richest. We also asked respondents their future outlook
        by asking them to rank where they would be in this welfare scale five years from now. We
        then define a variable that takes a value of 1 for respondents who who rank the future at
        least as good as today. Second, we ask respondents  to rate how well they fare in fulfilling
        their overall and health needs, as well as the overall, food, health, and educational needs of
        their children. Respondents were asked to rate on a 1 to 3 scale, where 1=not well, 2=just
        enough, and 3=more than enough. Finally, we also ask respondents to rate from 1 to 4 how
        happy they are, from very happy to very unhappy.
        	        In addition, we also included a set of questions to measure mental health. In
        these questions, we ask respondents how often they experience mental health problems
        such as feeling agitated, difficulties to concentrate and sleep, feeling depressed, lonely,
        afraid, difficulties to start something, and has ran out of options. On the flip side, we
        also ask respondents how often they experience feeling happiness and optimism of the
        future. Respondents can respond on a 4-point scale from “rarely”, “sometimes”, “often”,
        and “almost every day”. As indices of positive and negative mental states, we average
        the responses for positive and negative questions across the different questions, and then
        normalize the answer to one. Table IX summarizes the subjective welfare and measures of
        mental health for our sample.

        3.2.2.2 Access to Finance
        One of the programs offered by PEKKA focuses on encouraging female household heads
        to save and build financial capital in the group. It is therefore important to have information
        on households’ level of savings as well as the baseline level of access to finance for these
        households. As mentioned above, we collected a set of information regarding different
        forms of household savings. However, in addition, we also examined household access to
        the various formal and informal financial institutions, such as formal banks, government

        3.2.2.3 Human Capital
        Some of PEKKA’s programs aim at improving the human capital of the beneficiaries. We
        therefore look at a set of measures of education and health of adults and children in our
        sample communities prior to the intervention. For education, among the adult sample,
        we look at the literacy and education of adults (Table VIII). Meanwhile, for children,
        we examine the school enrollment status of children for their respective school ages for
        those between 7 and 15 years old (to wit, primary and junior high school students). More
        specifically, we look at two sets of measures, to wit, whether (i) children within this age
        bracket are in school, and (ii) whether children are in their appropriate level of schooling
        given their age (i.e., primary school for children 7-12 years old, junior high school for those
        who are 13-15 years old). We also look at whether children between the ages of six and
        fifteen worked outside the house for more than 20 hours per month.
        	        Meanwhile, for health, we focus on the immunization and nutritional status of
        children under three years old. For immunization, we look at whether children have
        complete immunizations, complete for their given age, and whether children who are
        older than 10 months have complete immunizations. Meanwhile, for nutritional status, we
        look at whether children are malnourished or severely malnourished based on different
        measures of nutritional status. More specifically, we calculated the z-score for the weight-
        for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height, using the methodology developed by the
        WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group (2006). Children under 3 years old
        are defined as “malnourished” when their z-score are 2 standard deviation below the
        population reference, and they are defined as “severely malnourished” when their z-score
        are 3 standard deviation below the population reference. The summary statistics on the
        measures of educational and health capital for children are presented in Table X.

               3.2.2.4 Trust, Community Participation, and Leadership
               For social capital, we collected measures of participation and trust attitudes. For community
               participation, we asked whether in the last three months, respondents participated in a list
               of community organizations. The list includes local government organizations (such as
               Rukun Tetangga, Rukun Warga, which are the local neighborhood administration and are
               administratively below the village-level administration), religious, social, sports and arts,
               or political groups, unions, or some informal credit associations. Also, as a measure of
               political participation, we asked whether respondents participated in the last presidential,
               parliamentary, district head and village head elections. Moreover, as a measure of leadership,
               we also ask whether respondents hold any structural position (i.e., chair, vice-chair, or
               secretary/treasurer) in these organizations or groups.
               	         Meanwhile, we collected a number of questions to measure trust attitudes. In the
               first set of trust questions, we ask respondents to rate in a 4-point scale whether they agree
               that different types of people can be trusted. The list of people includes people in this village,
               head of the sub-village, head of the village, the district head, people of a different ethnicity,
               and people of a different religion. We also include a measure of discriminative trust by
               asking respondents whether they tend to trust people of a same ethnicity and religion as
               theirs. Next, we also measure trusting behaviors in the community by asking them to rate
               their willingness to leave their house or children to their neighbors if they need to be away.
               In addition, we ask them to list friends in the village that they can talk to regarding important
               issues in their lives.
               	         We also include a measure of respondent beliefs of the trustworthiness of different
               types of an anonymous other. Respondents were asked to imagine a scenario where they lost
               a wallet or a purse containing Rp. 200,000 along with an identity card. Respondents were
               then asked to assess how likely they would get the wallet back with the money intact if it were
               found by: (i) someone who lives close by; (ii) a stranger; and (iii) a policeman. Respondents
               can respond on a 4-scale measure from “very likely” to “very unlikely”. Responses to
               (i) and (ii) can be interpreted as particularized and generalized trust beliefs respectively.
               Meanwhile, responses to (iii) can be interpreted as trust beliefs of the authorities. Summary
               statistics of both the participation and trust questions are presented in Table XI.

3.2.2.5 Legal Status
Meanwhile, we also include measures of legal status. Some of the problems that many poor
households have to face in accessing many of the available pro-poor government programs
are often related to their inability to show legal documentations, such as the marriage
certificate, the birth certificate of their child, or the government-issued identity cards. We
therefore ask respondents regarding their access to each of this important government
documents. In addition, we also collected information on the legal status of marriages in
the sample, to wit, whether they were conducted under the civil, legal, or traditional law or
none of the above. Table XII summarizes the legal status of our sample.



3.2.3 Other Characteristics
Finally, we also collect other additional information that may be useful to control for inter-
personal and inter-household differences when we conduct the post-treatment analysis.
At the household level, we have information on household composition, that includes the
number of members at different age groups. Using this information, we calculated the
dependency ratio of the household, which is the number of household members outside
of their productive age (i.e., younger than 15 and older than 65 years old) divided by the
number of members in their productive years. We also have information on the physical
characteristics of their housing, including their different amenities (see Table XIII).
	        Meanwhile, at the individual-level, we collected information on the respondents’
sex, age, and education, as well as their risk and time preference (see summary statistics
in Table XIV). We include risk and time preference parameters given findings that these
parameters are important determinants for a wide range of behaviors (Schechter, 2007;
Dohmen et al., 2011). For risk, we elicit the risk aversion parameter by asking respondents
to choose payoffs with different risk levels, which is then used to create an ordinal ordering
of risk aversion. Risk aversion is elicited using without real payoffs and there are some
concerns about potential biases from this approach. However, the experience from the
Mexican Family Life Survey suggests that such biases may not be so severe (Hamoudi,
2006). Meanwhile for time preference, we elicit the time preference (or “patience”)
parameter by asking respondents to choose different payoffs that give returns at different
times from today. The underlying idea is to measure the extent to which individuals are
willing to delay “instant gratification” to obtain greater payoff in the future. Similar to the
measure of risk aversion, the discount factor is elicited without real payoffs.

IV. Comparisons of Treatment and Control
Groups

4.1 Methodology
Recall that the reason for testing whether the treated and control groups are similar is to ensure
that any changes in the outcomes of interest that we find after three years can be reasonably
attributed to the program, and not to some pre-treatment advantages or disadvantages of the
treated groups. In this section, we describe the methodology used to check whether treated
and control groups are similar prior to the implementation of the program. We examine the
question of whether treatment and control groups are comparable in two iterations. First,
we look at whether community-level variables – measured at both village and sub-village
levels – are comparable prior to treatment. Second, we look at household- and individual-
level variables, and compare the average characteristics of individuals and households in
treatment and control groups. The comparisons are implemented in a regression framework,
elaborated below.


4.1.1 Community-level Specification
For the community variables, we estimated the following equation:

(1)

where Y is the different community characteristics whose balance between treatment and
control we are interested in, T is a dummy variable that indicates whether the community
will be receiving PEKKA and X are a set of district-level control variables, while v indexes
the community while d indexes the district. We collected data on both the village and
sub-village characteristics, and hence j may index either the village or the sub-village,
depending on the outcome of interest. A statistically significant bT would indicate that on
average, treated communities are different from untreated ones. The model is estimated
using ordinary least square (OLS). To account for unobservable variables at the district
level, we estimated a model with district fixed-effects  and the standard errors are robust-
clustered at the village level.
	        Note, however, that because we have a small sample size of 24 sub-villages with
16 treatment and 8 control sub-villages, these estimates are imprecise and the statistical
power of the community-level estimates are low. In other words, the statistical tests will
only be able to detect large differences in characteristics.


4.1.2 Household- and Individual-level Specifications
In the second iteration, we look at the household- and individual-level variables. As above,
we use the regression framework to make comparisons between households and individuals
living in treatment vs control communities. The base specification for household-level
variables is as follows:

(2)

where j indexes the household. To account for district-level unobservable omitted variables,
we implemented district fixed-effects and the standard errors are robust-clustered at the
village level. All estimates are made using OLS and observations are weighted by their
household probabilistic sampling weights. Hence, a statistically significant bT would indicate



                                                                                     Pekka Impacts Evaluation
      24
        that after controlling for district-level differences, on average, household in treatment
        and control communities are different. We employ a similar specification to compare the
        individual-level characteristics of children and adult members of the households. Naturally,
        here the dependent variables are the individual-level variables.



        4.2 Results
        The first part of the results section examine whether the sample treatment and control
        groups are balanced – namely, that their characteristics are not significantly different
        between the two groups. We use the regression framework to examine possible village-
        level, household-level or individual-level differences. Meanwhile, in the second part, we
        use this baseline data to attempt to examine whether poor female-headed households are
        disadvantaged compared to their male-headed households, and if so, in what way.

        4.2.1 Village and Sub-village Characteristics
        There are 24 sub-villages in the sample, each is located in a different village. Since village
        and sub-village data are based on reports of an informant (usually, the village or sub-
        village head), we have a total of 24 observations. Tables XIV - XVIII present results of
        our regressions based on Equation 1 to test for statistical differences between treatment
        and control villages in terms of the village and sub-village characteristics. To account for
        unobservable district-level variables, we implemented a district fixed-effects. A statistically
        significant coefficient on the Treatment variable (the first column of these tables) indicate
        that the difference between treatment and control (sub-)villages are statistically significant.
        For this analysis, we dropped several variables that do not vary across all villages and sub-
        villages, such as the sex of the sub-village head (they are all male), the number of hospital
        located in the sub-village (which was zero), and access to international television broadcast
        (which is not present).
        	        Based on the village and sub-village observable characteristics, we find that
        treatment and control sub-villages are comparable. At the village level, there are four
        variables that are statistically significantly different at 10% between treatment and control
        sub-villages. Treatment sub-villages are located in villages with a smaller number of sub-
        villages and a greater share of Moslems (Table XV); in terms of infrastructure, they have
        a smaller share of households without any electricity and their markets are located further
        from the village office (Table XVI). Meanwhile, at the sub-village level, treatment sub-
        villages tend to have a higher average daily wages for male compared to the control sub-
        villages (Table XVI).

      4.2.2 Household-level Variables
      We conduct a similar exercise for the household variables. For each of the 24 villages, 100
      households were selected. This gives us a total of 2,400 observations. We estimated Equation
      2 using OLS with district fixed-effects that is weighted by the probability weights of each
      household. The results for the basic household demographics and housing characteristics
      are presented in Table XIX; household economic welfare and access to social programs
      in Table XX; and household assets in Table XXI. As before, a statistically significant
      coefficient on the Treatment variable indicates meaningful differences between treatment
      and control households. Overall, we find that on most of the household-level variables,
      treatment and control households are comparable. As expected in any random assignment,
      we find some statistically significant differences in some of these variables. Remarkably,
      there are only two household variables where this difference is statistically significant:
      Treatment households are, on average, more likely to have access to scholarships (Table
      XX) and are more likely to have an air conditioner among their assets (Table XXI).

       4.2.3 Individual-level Variables
       Tables XXII - XXVI compare the characteristics of individual adults while Table XXVII
       compares those of children between treatment and control groups. Comparisons of these
       individual variables further suggest that treatment and control groups are broadly comparable.
       There are some differences between the two groups. In terms of adult characteristics, there
       are less female adults in the treatment group compared to the control group (Table XXII).
       Those in treatment group are less likely to be doing housework in the past week and are
       more likely to be casual workers (Table XXIII). In terms of their subjective assessments
       of their future, those in the treatment group are, on average, more positive in their outlook
       compared to those in the control group: They are more likely to think that their future is at
       least as good – if not better – than the present (Table XXIV).
       	        With regards to community participation and social interactions, adults in the
       treatment group are more likely to participate in local administrative organizations such as
       Rukun Tetangga or Rukun Warga. They also tend to participate in more organizations than
       those in the control group (Table XXV). However, they tend to have less close friends to
       discuss important issues in their lives.
       	        Meanwhile, in terms of children human capital, older children – to wit, between
       7 and 15 years old – in the treatment group spend more time to work around the house
       compared to those in the control groups. Children under 36 months are also more likely to
       receive complete immunizations in the treatment group compared to those in the control
       group (Table XXVII).

V. The relative welfare of female-headed
households
This baseline dataset can also provide useful insights regarding welfare in different types
of households. One of the rationales for programs such as PEKKA is that female household
heads face particular obstacles that limit their social mobility. These obstacles create a
welfare disadvantage that may lead to inter-generational transmission of poverty to children
in these households. The empirical evidence for this supposed disadvantage, however, has
been mixed (see review by Fafchamps and Quisumbing, 2007). A review of existing studies
by Buvinić and Gupta (1997) found that female-headed households were disproportionately
represented among the poor. However, based on poverty measures using household PCE’s,
Drèze and Srinivasan (1997) did not find that widows are disproportionately concentrated in
poor households in India. Similarly, an analysis of household datasets from 10 developing
countries by Quisumbing, Haddad and Peña (2001) found that the differences in the
poverty status between male- and female-households are insignificant in eight out of the
ten countries, including Indonesia.
	        Using our dataset, we can do a preliminary analysis of the extent to which poor
female-headed households in our sample regions are disadvantaged compared to the male-
headed households. Furthermore, we can also compare the individual welfare of female
household heads to male household heads or their spouses. There are some caveats. First,
naturally these results are descriptive, and should not be interpreted as an analysis of
the causal impact of being in a female-headed household or being a female household
head.7  Second, the findings may not be generalizable beyond our sample population, since
villages that are included are not randomly drawn, but are selected from those are located
in subdistricts with relatively numerous female-headed households compared to other
subdistricts in the district. Nonetheless, since PEKKA (and other programs similar to it) is
likely to be interested in villages with such characteristics, insights from the following results
may be useful in informing designs of program targeted at female-headed households.

5.1 Methodology
The objective of this analysis, therefore, is to examine whether, in terms of their welfare,
female-headed households are on average significantly different from male-headed
households. As before, we use the regression framework to examine this question. In
particular, we estimate the following specification for the household outcomes:


(3)


where like before, Y denotes the outcome of interest, X are vectors of control variables, and
j and v respectively indexes household, community, and district.        is a dummy variable
that takes on the value of 1 if household j is female-headed. Estimates are made using
OLS and observations are weighted by their household probability weights. We eliminate
potential unobservable variables at the village level that might influence the results by
implementing a village fixed-effects. Standard errors are clustered at the village level. We
utilize a similar framework to examine differences in individual-level variables for the
household heads and children living in the different types of households.
	        We consider two definitions of household headship. The first definition follows the
standard definition in national surveys conducted by BPS-Statistics, which is the person
in the household who is responsible to provide for the economic needs of the household
or who is appointed to be the household head. One criticism of this definition is that the

7	           Fafchamps and Quisumbing (2007) discuss the difficulties in trying to identify the causal impacts of being in a female house-
holds – in particular, the fact that the female household status is often endogenous to many of the outcomes of interest.




                                                                                                                           Pekka Impacts Evaluation
      34
        latter part of this definition creates an ambiguity with regards to the economic role of
        the household head. Our second definition, which hereafter is referred to as “economic
        headship”, sharply distinguishes this economic role by defining the household head as the
        person responsible for the economic needs of the household. In our discussions of the
        household head characteristics, we will consider both definitions. We show that the results
        based on either one of these definitions are similar. As such, in the sections following
        that discussion, our analysis focuses only on results based on the economic headship
        definition.


        5.2 Household Head Characteristics
        We begin by examining differences in the exogenous characteristics of female and male
        household heads. Table XXVIII presents an individual-level regression of the age, literacy,
        education, risk aversion and discount factor (or patience) of household heads. These are
        results from the specification without any control variable. Columns (1) - (3) are results
        based on BPS’s household head definition, while columns (4) - (6) are results based on
        the economic household head definition. A statistically significant coefficient on FHH for
        a particular characteristic would indicate a difference between female- and male-headed
        household.
        	        Overall, results based on these two definitions give a reasonably similar picture on
        the relative characteristics of female household heads compared to their male counterparts.
        Based on the first definition, however, female household heads are about 11 years old older
        that male household heads. They are also less literate, more likely to have no schooling, and
        are less likely to have some secondary education. In general, female household heads have
        about 3.3 years less education than male household heads. These differences are smaller
        under the economic headship definition, but they are qualitatively similar. Meanwhile,
        there do not appear to be significant differences between female and male household heads
        in terms of their risk and time preference parameters.

                          5.3 The Economic Welfare of Female-Headed Households
                          Hereafter, our analysis will be based on the economic definition of household headship.
                          In this section, we will examine the relative economic characteristics of female-headed
                          households compared to their male-headed counterparts. In most cases, the analysis will be
                          done for two sets of sample. First, we will focus on the full sample. Then, considering the
                          possibility that our findings might hold differently for poorer households, we perform the
                          analysis for a subset of households whose per-capita expenditure are among the lowest two
                          quintiles in our sample population.8 We begin by examining differences in the demographic
                          characteristics of the different types of households before looking at the different economic
                          welfare measures.

                          	        Table XXIX present the results of the estimates of raw correlations – i.e., without
                          any control variables – between household demographics and the household type. The first
                          three columns are results from the regressions on the full sample, while the last three are
                          results from the regressions on the poorest subset of the sample. Nonetheless, the results

                          of the two sets of regressions are similar. The size of female-headed households tend to
                          be smaller by around one member. In most cases, the smaller household size comes from
                          having a smaller number of children. The share of female adults tend to be higher by 27
                          percentage points in female-headed households. However, there is no difference in terms
                          of the dependency ratio – to wit, the number of people of productive age (15-65 years old)
                          divided by the number of people that are not of the productive age.
                          	        Meanwhile, in Table XXX, we find the raw correlations between various economic
                          welfare measures, as well as access to finance and government programs of households.
                          Based on   PCE’s, we do not find statistically significant disadvantages among female-
                          headed households – in fact, the coefficient on FHH is positive, although it is not statistically
                          significant. However, female-headed households tend to have lower per-capita income and
                          are less likely to have savings.
                          	        Moreover, we do not find significant differences in access to finance between
                          female- and male-headed households. On the other hand, female-headed households have
                          better access to the different types of social programs provided by the government, such as
                          the health insurance for the poor (Askeskin), the unconditional cash transfer (BLT) and the
                          subsidized rice (raskin).

                          	

                          8	           Recall that our sampling procedure oversampled poor households (i.e., households whose PCE – calculated based on a quick
                          expenditure survey prior to the full survey – are in the bottom two quintile) and particular poor female-headed households. Each observation
                          is then given a probability weight based on its poverty status and household type constructed before the full survey. To construct the poorest
                          40%, we use the probabilistically weighted observations to find the 40th percentile PCE. Households with per-capita expenditure equal to or
                          below this threshold is included in this subset. Because of oversampling of poor households, more than 40% of the sampled households fall
                          under this category.

          Estimated using OLS with village fixed-effects. Standard errors are robust and clustered at the village. Each line is a separate regression
          and FHH column contains coefficients for the female-household status in the regression without any individual and household
          control variables.  Household head status is based on the economic headship definition. t statistics in parentheses.

        As we have seen in the previous section, female household heads tend to be older and
        to have less education. The differences in these exogenous characteristics may play a
        more important role than household types for the aforementioned differences. To explore
        this possibility, we include the age and years of education of the household head in the
        regressions for all of our outcome variables. In addition, except for monthly per-capita
        expenditure and income, and per-capita savings, we also included the logarithm of the per-
        capita expenditure to control for overall household economic welfare status. As before, we
        control for unobservable village differences using the village fixed-effects.

*Log(PCE) is not included as a control for the regression of this variable. Estimated using OLS with village fixed-effects. Standard errors are robust and clustered at the

                               	        The results of the regressions that control for these characteristics are presented
                               in Table XXXI. They indicate that many of the economic welfare differences between
                               female- and male-headed household found above become insignificant once we control
                               for the education and age of the household head. The lower per-capita income of female-
                               headed households, for instance, appears to be attributable to the lower average education
                               of the female household heads. Nonetheless, even after controlling for household head
                               characteristics and the average welfare of the household, the advantages in access to the
                               different social programs of female-headed households persist.
                               	        One possibility, however, is that the supposed economic disadvantages of female-
                               headed households are more severe among poorest households. To investigate this
                               possibility, we take a subset of households with PCE within the first two quintiles in our
                               sample population. Table XXXII present estimations similar to that for Table XXXI on this
                               subset of observations. Our analysis of this subset once more suggests that there do not
                               appear to be many significant differences in household welfare or access to social programs
                               between female- and male-headed households among this poorest subset. We do find two

        	        Meanwhile, access to productive assets is often cited as among the obstacles faced
        by female household heads. To explore this possibility, we examine asset composition
        differentials between the different types of households. Land is one of the very important
        productive assets in rural societies. However, as shown in Table XXXII, we do not find
        evidence for the notion that female-headed households are disadvantaged in terms of land
        ownership. In both the full sample and the sample of poorest households, female-headed
        households are more likely to own the land and/or the house in which they live. On the
        other hand, in the full sample, female-headed households are less likely to own other land.
        This difference, however, is not present among the poorest households. However, in the full
        sample, female-headed households are also less likely to have many household appliances
        and the various types of vehicles. They are also less likely to have cows as one of their
        assets. The differential ownerships of some of these assets, however, are absent in the
        poorest household subset.

                              5.4 Children’s Welfare in Female-Headed Households
                              We also explore whether there are welfare differentials between children living in different
                              types of households. As mentioned before, if female-headed households faced special
                              challenges, these difficulties may get inter-generationally transmitted to children – among
                              others, by forcing children out of school. Furthermore, if these households are less able to
                              access social services or do not have adequate resources to care for their young, younger
                              children may not receive the necessary health service such as complete immunizations or
                              proper nutrition.

        Estimated using OLS with village fixed-effects. Standard errors are robust and clustered at the village. Each line is a separate regression and FHH column contains coefficients
        for the female-household status in the regression without any individual and household control variables.  Household head status is based on the economic headship definition.
        t statistics in parentheses. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001




        	        Table XXIV looks at whether educational and health status of children varies in
        different types of households. Again, we find very weak evidence that children in female-
        headed households are worse off than those in male-headed households. In the full sample,
        we do not find evidence of differences between female- and male-headed households
        in the measures of educational and health status of children considered in this analysis.
        We only find a significant difference in one variable: Older children in female-headed
        households are more likely to work more than 20 hours a month on both household and
        non-household work. Meanwhile, in poorer households in the sample, we find that female-
        headed households are less likely to obtain complete immunizations. We find qualitatively
        similar results – which are not reported here – when we control for the age and education
        of the household heads, as well as the log PCE of the households.

        5.5 Attitudes, Social Capital, and Leadership of Female
        Household Heads
        In this section, we will look at and compare the different aspects of the individual lives of
        female household heads. First, we will look at the subjective welfare and mental health
        status. Then, we examine a number of social capital measures such as trust, tolerance, and
        participation in the communities. In particular, we will also look at whether individuals
        assume leadership positions in the groups that they participated in. We will first compare
        these aspects between female and male household heads. However, given well-documented
        gender differences in individual preferences and social attitudes (see e.g., Eagly and
        Crowley, 1986; Croson and Gneezy, 2009; Gaduh, 2012) as well as mental health status,

such as depression (Grigoriadis and Robinson, 2007), we worry that significant differences
between the female and male household heads may merely reflect gender effects. Therefore,
we also compare between female household heads and the spouses of the male household
heads.
	        There is no significant difference between female and male household heads in
terms of whether they think that their overall welfare will get worse. However, overall
female household heads assess themselves to be less confident than male household heads
in their ability to fulfill their daily needs. In the full sample (the first two sets of columns in
Table XXXV), the coefficients on FHH are negative for subjective assessments regarding
the ability to fulfill the food and health needs of children are negative. They are even less
confident when compared to the spouse of the male household heads. Compared to the
spouses, female household heads are also less likely to be confident of their ability to fulfill
the needs for their own health, although this difference disappears once we control for age,
years of education, and the logarithm of household per-capita expenditure.
	        When we look at only the poorest subsets of our sample (Panel B in Table XXXV),
however, most of these differences in the subjective assessments of their ability to fulfill
the needs of their households disappear. Without the control variables, the coefficient for
the regression on fulfilling the health needs of children was negative and significant in the
comparison between female and male household heads, but its significance disappears when
age, education, and per-capita expenditure variables are included. Similarly, significant
differences between female household heads and spouses of male household heads among
the poorest subsets are not robust to the inclusion of these control variables.
	        Nonetheless, female household heads are less happy with their lives overall compared
to male household heads or their spouses. These differences are present in the full sample as
well as the subset of only the poorest households, and they are robust to the inclusion of the
aforementioned control variables. One plausible explanation is that the stress from being
the single provider for the household might have taken a toll on their mental health. In Table
XXVI we find evidence that female household heads tend to experience negative mental
states more frequently than male household heads. When we looked at individual questions
on mental health, we find female household heads more often experience difficulties to
sleep, depression, loneliness, fearfulness, and are less likely to feel happy compare to male
household heads, both in the full sample and poorest household subset. It is possible that
these results simply reflect gender effects given the higher incidences of depression among
women  (Grigoriadis and Robinson, 2007).  However, similar findings in our comparisons
between female household heads and spouses of male household heads suggest that gender
differences cannot fully account for these differences.9




9	           Ideally, to test whether these results come from the responsibility for being a single provider or uniquely from the female house-
hold head status, we would like to compare between female and male household heads in households with a single provider. However, we do
not have a large enough single-provider households with male household heads.

        	        Next, we look at differences in the social capital. We first look at helpfulness
        and trusting attitudes. If female headed households receive unequal treatments from
        their communities, we would expect them to be less trusting of their neighbors and less
        willing to contribute and participate to their communities. Table XXXVII looks at the
        social cooperative attitudes while Table XXXVIII explores the question of community
        participation.
        	        Our results on the social cooperative attitudes suggest that here, gender effects
        appear to play an important role in explaining differences in attitudes. Compared to
        male household heads, female household heads are less trusting of strangers, people of
        different religion and ethnicities, and consequently are more trusting of coethnics, and
        are less willing to help their neighbors. These differences in the level of trust however are
        consistent with previous findings on gender differences in trust (Croson and Gneezy, 2009)
        and helpfulness (Eagly and Crowley, 1986). Similar results on Indonesia were also found in
        a study that utilized the national-level dataset, namely the Indonesian Family Life Survey
        (Gaduh, 2012). Further evidence of this can be seen here in the comparisons between
        female household heads and the spouses of male household heads: In all social cooperative
        attitude variables in the full sample, none of the coefficients is significant. We find similar
        results in the poorest household subset, except for one variable: Female household heads
        appear to be more trusting of the district head compared to male household heads and their
        spouses.
        	        Meanwhile, in terms of community participation, there is no difference in the
        overall likelihood that female household heads participate compared to male household
        heads or their spouses (Table XXXVIII). Female household heads are also neither more or
        less likely to hold leadership positions in the groups they participated in compared to male
        household heads. However, we find that women and men tend to participate in different
        types of community organizations. There is hardly any difference in the various aspects of
        community participation between female household heads and spouses of male household
        heads. However, in the full sample, female household heads are more likely to participate
        in credit associations and less likely to participate in sports/arts and worker associations.
        Female household heads are also more likely to participate in religious or adat groups
        compared to both male household heads and their spouses, but these differences are not
        robust to the inclusion of the control variables in the regressions. Most of these differences
        disappear in the poor household subset. Interestingly, in the poorest household subset,
        female household heads tend to participate more compared to the male household heads.

5.6 Political Participation and Legal Access of Female
Household Heads
Moreover, we also find that female household heads tend to participate less in political
organizations compared to male household heads. As shown in Table XXXIX, in the full
sample, female household heads are less likely to participate in local governing institutions
(such as the Rukun Tetangga or Rukun Warga) and mass or political organizations, while
in the subset, the difference is only robust for the latter. These differences are robust to the
inclusion of the aforementioned individual and household characteristics. However we do
not find such differences when we compare female household heads with spouses of male
household heads. In terms of their use of their political rights in elections, we do not find
robust differences between female and male household heads. Female household heads
appear to be less likely to use their political rights compared to spouses of male household
heads when we control for characteristics.
	        In terms of access to legal documents, we find mixed evidence. In the full sample,
female household heads appear to be less likely to have access to the different legal
documents. However, when we control for age, education, and the logarithm of per-capita
expenditure, we find female household heads to be more likely to have access to birth
certificate, but less likely to have access to the identity card. We do not find statistically
significant differences in terms of access to the marriage certificate. When we compare with
spouses, we again find that female household heads have less access to birth and marriage
certificate when the control variables are not included; however, these disadvantages
disappear once the control variables are included. In fact, female household heads are more
likely to have access to the identity card compared to spouses. We find similar results for
the poorest household subset. When we examine the control variables in the regressions
(which are not reported here), we find that years of education appear to play a significant
role in increasing the likelihood of having access to these legal documents.
	        Meanwhile, we also find that female household heads are less likely to have been
married under the civil law (which tends to confer better legal protection) and are more
likely to be married under the religious law. Again, these differences disappear once we
control for age, years of education and per-capita expenditure. As before, our examination
of the control variables (which are not reported here) indicates that among the control
variables, the years of education is the only important variable explaining the likelihood of
marrying under the civil vs. religious law. Furthermore, given the weaker legal standings
of marriages under the religious law, we would also expect that in many cases, the female
household status might have been the result, and not the cause, of the choice of the marriage’s
legal arrangements.

VI. Conclusion

We use the baseline dataset for PEKKA impact evaluation to examine two questions.
First, we examine the extent to which villages, sub-villages, households, and individuals
in treatment and control villages are comparable. On this question, we find that the two
groups are comparable with some minor differences. Second, we also examine the question
of whether female household heads and members of their households are systematically
disadvantaged  in all dimensions. On this second question, we do not find strong evidence
in the affirmative.
	        On the difference between treatment and comparison groups, the baseline data
suggest that at various levels of aggregation (village/sub-village, household, individual), the
two groups are comparable. We find minor differences in baseline community characteristics
between two groups. Similarly, households in the two groups are also comparable in their
characteristics. In terms of the individual characteristics, there are less female adults in
the treatment group compared to the control group. Adults in the treatment group tend to
participate in more organizations, and are also more likely to participate in local governing
organizations such as Rukun Tetangga or Rukun Warga. Children under three years old are
also more likely to receive complete immunizations in the treatment group. However, in
many other individual characteristics listed above, the two groups are similar. At any rate,
in the final analysis, we can utilize the baseline characteristics to control for pre-treatment
differences.
	        Meanwhile, in terms of the difference between female- and male-headed households,
we do not find evidence for the claim that female-headed households are disadvantaged
across all dimensions. We find that female household heads tend to be older and less educated
compared to the male household heads. However, we find no differences in per-capita
expenditure between female- and male-headed households – both in the overall sample and
the poor household sample. Female-headed households have lower per-capita income, but
in the overall sample, the difference disappears after we control for age and education. We
also do not find strong evidence for this claim when we examine differences in access to
financial services and government social programs, or in assets. In terms of access to legal
documents, female household heads are somewhat disadvantaged, but these disadvantages
appear to be correlated more with their level of education instead of their female household
head status. We find similar results for the law under which their marriage is certified.
	        At the same time, we find that female household heads have a lower subjective
welfare and a bleaker view of their future. They are also more likely to experience negative
mental states (such as loneliness and depression) and are less likely to experience positive
mental states (such as the feeling of happiness) compared to male household heads. These
results persist when we control for age and education. The results also do not seem to be
rooted in gender effects, since female household heads have a lower subjective welfare
and are more likely to be in a negative mental state when compared to the spouses of male
household heads.
