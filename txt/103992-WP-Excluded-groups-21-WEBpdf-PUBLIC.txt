Urban Development Series



         Produced by the World Bank’s Social, Urban, Rural & Resilience Global Practice,
         the Urban Development Series discusses the challenge of urbanization and what
         it will mean for developing countries in the decades ahead. The Series aims to
         explore and delve more substantively into the core issues framed by the World
         Bank’s 2009 Urban Strategy Systems of Cities: Harnessing Urbanization for
         Growth and Poverty Alleviation. Across the five domains of the Urban Strategy,
         the Series provides a focal point for publications that seek to foster a better
         understanding of (i) the core elements of the city system, (ii) pro-poor policies,
         (iii) city economies, (iv) urban land and housing markets, (v) sustainable urban
         environment, and other urban issues germane to the urban development agenda
         for sustainable cities and communities.

The term “inclusive cities” is increasingly being used as a “catch-all” phrase to signify intent but
with little precision in its use. In this note we use “inclusive cities” to mean cities in which we
see a commitment to an inclusive politics with the establishment of institutionalized interac-
tions between organized groups of disadvantaged citizens and the state with local government
taking a primary role. In addition, inclusive cities are ones where public accountability is
found, including the provision of essential information about municipal budgets and activities
(and those of other government services) with good communication to all residents. They are
also cities in which governments have undertaken specific measures to secure improved access
for low-income and otherwise disadvantaged groups to a range of essential goods and services
including secure tenure for housing, inclusion in access to basic services (e.g., inclusion in the
piped water and sewer network, waste collection services, government health care services and
schools, community policing, and emergency services), and where required approval of and
support for housing improvements.

They are also cities in which local governments and other relevant state agencies have made
efforts to ensure a “city for citizens” on a citywide basis that includes investment in affordable
public transport; public space throughout the city including the central areas in which urban
residents have access for trading, consumption, and recreation; and support for skill training
and enterprise development.

This note begins by considering who is excluded and from what and how. It then considers the
contributions that large sections of the excluded population make to the city economy and the
benefits for city governments of engaging with them. It considers the types of policies and pro-
grams that are intended to engage excluded groups, distinguishing between those developed
and implemented by professionals and those developed and implemented by aided self-help
and social and urban movements.

Seven challenges to the achievement of more inclusive cities are discussed: lack of household
income and the continuing prevalence of informal incomes; a lack of state investment capacity;
a lack of political will; a lack of the basic data needed for identifying and addressing exclusion;
a lack of space for participation, especially by the lowest income groups; a lack of vision for
what an inclusive city means within city government; and the constraints on inclusion from
city governments organized sectorally. The note then discusses the metrics and indicators that
can help inclusion and that have relevance for the post-2015 sustainable development agenda.

2                                    Who Is Typically Excluded
                         or Marginalized in the Urban Context?

A first point to recognize is that the scale and depth of urban poverty in Africa and much of
Asia and Latin America is greatly underestimated because of inappropriate definitions and
measurements. Understanding the causes of such inaccurate measurement provides insight
into those groups who are typically excluded and marginalized; in part they are marginalized
because they are “invisible” to those authorities tasked with supporting them.

About one in seven of the world’s population lives in poor quality and usually overcrowded
housing in urban areas. Most of these people lack provision for safe sufficient water, sani-
tation, and many other needs. They include very large numbers of urban dwellers who are
malnourished and suffer premature death or disease burdens that are preventable. However, a
significant proportion are not defined as poor by many poverty lines because the actual costs
they face of food and nonfood needs are not taken into account properly. Most income-based
poverty lines fail to take sufficient account of the high cost of necessities in the larger urban
centers and/or the costs of meeting nonfood needs such as rent, water (from vendors or kiosks),
access to public toilets and washing facilities, and transport. Nor is account taken of the poor
quality of much accommodation and of many services.

Obviously, sufficient income is of critical importance to inclusion. To survive, the urban poor
have to find work that provides a cash income. In most urban contexts, most or all basic servic-
es have to be paid for. Finding income-earning opportunities that are stable and not dangerous
and provide an adequate return is central to reducing their poverty or moving out of poverty.
This is especially true given that we know that ill-health or injury is a major trigger leading to
chronic poverty. Yet we actually know very little about the difficulties facing low-income urban
dwellers in securing sufficient income and what would help them to do so. This is all the more
remarkable when poverty is defined by income-based poverty lines.

The quality of the home and its neighborhood are important for health and well-being. Home
and neighborhood are also often important for income because the home is a location for income-
earning work, especially for women. And the lack of adequate basic services such as water piped
to the home, electricity, and household waste collection exacerbates the difficulties in earning a
living. More generally we know remarkably little about the ways in which income circulates in
low-income settlements and how this is influenced by relations with the wider city and the driv-
ers of economic growth. We also know remarkably little about what best supports low-income
groups in getting higher incomes—although studies highlight important factors such as the avail-
ability of credit and being able to have a bank account, the extension of a reliable supply of piped
water and electricity to the home, good social contacts, literacy and the completion of secondary
school, and cheap, safe, and convenient public transport. Understanding these requires attention
to the spatial aspects, that is, inequalities in these issues between neighborhoods and districts
within cities. So, often, the data collected on incomes, living conditions, or service provision are
from too small a sample to show these spatial inequalities. Figure 1 summarizes some of the criti-

                          of Engaging Excluded Groups
Many positive opportunities exist for health and development to be realized in urban centers,
and this is also true of informal low-income settlements. Despite multiple forms of social
exclusion and adverse incorporation, cities are places in which many residents undertake new
activities and frequently create new identities. As individuals and within family and neigh-
borhood groups, they create new livelihood opportunities, improve their human capital, and
positively engage the state. People’s energy, optimism, and aspiration are critical resources to
address human challenges across the globe. Urban citizens are creative and entrepreneurial;
sadly, experience suggests that the challenge for public policy is as much to avoid stifling these
as it is to support them. As Benjamin describes, the economic activities in informal settle-
ments reinforce each other, and activities are further disadvantaged by the operations of the
real estate market (Benjamin 2004). Government interventions in India have not supported
such processes, but he argues that market processes in informal settlements have the potential
to provide relatively inclusive urban growth as long as flexible regulatory and land-use policies
prevail to enable mixed-use development.

Low-income residents keep the city functioning. They serve in shops, run public transport
vehicles, support public services, provide essential goods, and are maids, cooks, drivers, garden-
ers, security guards, etc. In summary they undertake numerous activities, frequently for very
low remuneration, that facilitate the lives of other residents.

The scale of present inequalities across the world is such that multiple and repeated concerns
can be identified about associated externalities, that is, the impacts on broader society. Re-
search has shown that violence and conflict are linked to inequality—but this is not the only
issue. Underpinning much public concerns is an evident sense of discomfort and genuine
ambivalence. The majority of urban citizens appear to be concerned with issues of equity and
fairness, and protesters associate their causes with issues of citizenship and social justice.

Significant costs are likely to be incurred if cities are managed in an increasingly differentiated
manner with growing spatial, social, and political exclusion and without attention to inequali-
ties of access to basic services, infrastructure, employment, and other opportunities. What is
lost? The potential contribution of individuals is not realized. Collective capabilities to address
the public interest are not developed. Resources are wasted such as on securitization of urban
space rather than invested in more positive activities. Increasing protests and defensive actions
may lead to further polarization and increased exclusion. Acting now to prevent such frustra-
tions has benefits for the public good.

A wide set of concerns surround the broader consequences of income inequality, particularly in
respect to its impact on democracy. Greater social distance of political elites from low-income
populations may result in an increasing inability of government to act in the interests of all.

In practice urban programming draws across a number of approaches as agencies seek effective
interventions to reduce urban poverty. Urban poverty reduction programs and projects are
generally realized through the combined efforts of different agencies that may include residents’
associations and/or livelihood groups, local government officials and politicians, national
government departments, and in some cases other professional civil society groups including
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and academic institutions. In many nations, state
or provincial governments also have importance. Problems often arise with overlapping
responsibilities for particular investments or services within each area—and contestation over
relative roles and responsibilities. It is important to recognize that in most aspects of urban
poverty reduction, higher levels of government and international agencies are only as effective
as the local organizations and institutions they support (and help fund).

We introduce seven approaches below. Many are not specifically urban. Arguably only urban
management and the final approach (aided self-help) are “urban.” However, the remaining five
are also used widely in urban areas and have taken on a particular modality (as summarized
below) because of the realities of urban lives and the nature of urban institutions. All have become
distinctively adapted to the urban context, that is, to the commodification of all nonfamily
aspects of everyday life, high level of institutional engagement by the state, influence of high
population concentrations and densities on housing and basic services, and the dependence of
livelihoods on formal and informal labor markets.

The first five approaches are primarily designed and realized by professionals. These may be
located in the official international development assistance agencies, national and subnational
governments (including urban governments), and international, national, or local NGOs. The
remaining two are more clearly hybrids between formal and informal urban livelihoods and
ways in which professional interests have sought to engage with and represent more grounded
experiences. This is also true of the market approach, which, although deliberately promoted
by some, also includes the main modalities by which individuals and households accumulate
income and wealth. Arguably, an eighth approach is used by the urban poor themselves—that
of clientelism (but this is not expanded on here).

In practice, it is unusual that only one of the seven approaches outlined below is followed
for reasons of ideology and the complexity of urban poverty (where one rarely finds a single
unambiguous cause). Rather these approaches are taken up and blended together through
programs and projects that attempt to address specific contexts and the associated needs and

   Medellín is Colombia’s second-largest city,
   with a population of more than 3 million in the
   metropolitan area. Drug-related conflicts resulted
   in the city’s becoming one of the most violent in
   the world during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999
   the municipal government introduced measures
   to reduce spatial segregation including a
   cable-propelled transit system (gondola) that
   integrated into conventional public transport
   and other neighborhood improvements for areas
   serviced by the gondola, including additional

   lighting for public spaces, pedestrian bridges
   and street paths, school buildings, recreational
   centers, centers to promote microenterprises,
   more police patrols, and a family police station
   next to a gondola station.

   A study compared these neighborhoods with those not included in the public works project to assess the impacts of this
   intervention on reductions in violence and changes in associated factors such as including collective efficacy (e.g. willingness
   to help neighbors) and citizens’ trust in the criminal justice system and reliance on police. The intervention was associated
   with significant declines in neighborhood violence: The drop in homicides between 2003 and 2008 was 66 percent higher in
   intervention neighborhoods than in the set of other neighborhoods that were compared with the intervention neighborhoods
   (the control neighborhoods), and the corresponding drop in reports of violent events was 74 percent higher in intervention
   neighborhoods. Residents of intervention neighborhoods also experienced more growth in willingness to rely on the police
   and perceptions of collective efficacy. By improving public spaces and creating new institutions, the intervention provided
   more opportunities for neighbors to interact, develop trust, and become willing to intervene when the social order was
   threatened. It also appears that relations between citizens and police improved in intervention neighborhoods, which could
   increase the efficacy of law enforcement in fighting violence and further deter would-be violent offenders.

   The study also illustrates how the benefits of place-based interventions can diffuse beyond their intended areas of impact. The
   government’s principal motivation for bringing effective public transport to remote neighborhoods was to improve residents’
   access to jobs and attract new businesses to impoverished neighborhoods.

           Box 2. Citizen-Led Coproduction in Resettlement of Those Living by Railway Tracks: Mumbai, India

   The upgrading of Mumbai’s suburban railways
   required the removal of informal settlements
   that in many places had grown to be within
   touching distance of the trains. The railways
   had been ordered to slow their speeds in such
   places to try to reduce the very large numbers
   of fatalities each year. Those living close to the
   railway tracks were rehoused without force
   and with their support. This was possible only
   when the National Slum Dwellers Federation of
   India provided an organizational resource (to
   support the railway slum dwellers federation)




                                                                                                                                    flocu, Thinkstock.com
   that could match the state contribution of land
   and finance. Needs were acute. Mumbai relies
   on its extensive suburban railway system to get
   its workforce in and out of the central city; on
   average, more than 7 million passenger trips are made each day on five major railway corridors. In 1999 nearly 32,000
   households lived in shacks next to the tracks at high risk and without water and sanitation. Discussions within the Railway
   Slum Dwellers’ Federation (to which most households along the railway tracks belonged) showed that most families wanted
   to move if they could get a home with secure tenure in an appropriate location.

   A relocation program was developed as part of a scheme to improve the rail network. First, the negotiations reduced the
   number of people that had to move by cutting down the size of the space cleared (the railway authorities initially wanted
   close to ten meters each side of the track, the federation negotiated down to three meters with the promise of a wall). Land
   sites were identified to accommodate those that had to move (and these were visited), and the Federation was given the
   responsibility for managing the resettlement. People to be resettled were involved in designing, planning, and implement-
   ing the program. Critically the Federation identified those with an entitlement to receive a new home. Teams of Federation
   leaders, community residents, and NGO staff prepared maps that showed each hut, and each hut was identified with a
   number. Draft registers of all residents were prepared, and the results returned to communities for checking. Any claims were
   checked against the register. Anyone could claim that they had been left out, but they had to have all of their neighbors
   (as identified on the map) verify their claim to residency. This system prevented fraudulent claims for inclusion and speedily
   resolved disputes. Households were then grouped into units of 50 and each unit moved to the new site together to reduce
   the social costs of dislocation.

   In Peru the women’s nutrition movement (Orga-

   lar need. Women’s organizations manage the
   provision using both community volunteers and
   state resources: extensive community involve-
   ment in food provision and cooking meals
   reduces processing and delivery costs. These
   groups also determine the beneficiaries.

   The tradition of food relief managed by local women began between 1948 and 1956 when the government set up groups
   to distribute overseas food aid. During the 1970s and early 1980s, these local kitchens evolved to become an identifiable
   group of community kitchens with some securing independence from the state. Shortly afterwards, the glass of milk program
   was catalyzed by Lima’s local government in 1984, at a time of acute needs, and rapidly resulted in independent organiza-
   tions. Just months after the program was initiated, more than 25,000 mothers from 33 districts in Lima marched on Congress
   to demand official support; this campaign was followed by legislation in January 1985. Activities provide cereal and milk,
   primarily for children, pregnant women, and breast-feeding mothers. The women’s community kitchen organizations have
   also been involved in similar activities, negotiating for support from the Municipality of Lima as far back as 1986. The
   community kitchens organizations campaigned for legislation (Law 27307) with associated regulations that ensure the state
   finances food-processing activities. Participatory planning means that committees sit alongside central and local government
   representatives—and that demonstrations are no longer needed.

   The movement organizations believe they have broadly succeeded in establishing their entitlement and securing involvement
   in delivery—at the same time affirming their identity as citizens with both rights and management capacity, as opposed to
   “poor people” with unsatisfied needs and few skills who require patronage and social welfare practices. They have also
   succeeded in challenging traditional male-led residents’ associations and enabling women to play a role as community
   leaders and political activists.

   perpetuating the discrimination and stigma against the sex workers.

   In one exercise, the sex workers were asked what their priorities were; at the top of their list was the ability to wear shoes
   outdoors. In the complex network of social relations of the Tangail neighborhood, the samaj—modeled after traditional vil-
   lage councils and consisting of landlords and originally two sardanis or madams—wielded tremendous power and control
   over the sex workers. Mastans—male gangs allied to local politicians and landlords—acted as enforcers, regulating local
   economies and exploiting vulnerable groups through the use and threat of violence. Forbidding the sex workers the right to
   wear shoes was a way of publicly marking their status as lesser beings and restricting them to the locality.

   As they organized together and negotiated the right to wear shoes, they were more able to address their needs: for example,
   challenging the police when they were harassed. The women were working together to manage a health clinic, secure
   education for their children, and have the ability to save for their old age.

                 Box 5. Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI) and the Programming of the Urban Poor

   SDI is a network of federations of slum and shack dwellers and homeless and landless groups in towns and cities of Asia,
   Latin America, and Africa. These federations bring together residents of informal settlements and those living informally in
   formal areas, enabling them to identify and realize a range of strategies to address their needs and interests. These national
   federations link to small professional agencies (NGOs) that provide them with support services. The core form of organiza-
   tion within these people’s federations remains savings schemes, local groups that draw together residents in low-income
   neighborhoods to save, share their resources and strategize to address their collective needs. Local groups benefit from
   peer support through community-to-community exchanges. Community mapping and surveying form the basis for building
   a strong platform at the neighborhood level, and pilot activities identify and demonstrate improved solutions for housing,
   basic services, and settlement planning. Where possible, the federations also develop an increasing emphasis on citywide
   strategies for change.

   With most federation savers and savings-group managers being women, these savings groups help address the multiple
   forms of disadvantage, oppression, and exploitation that they face. The immediate focus and localized orientation to collec-
   tive savings provides them with a new role supported by their peers. This challenges and helps overturn discrimination and
   limited social expectations as women engage with each other as activists (rather than remaining subservient to male and/or
   older household members) and in public (rather than enclosed in the household) and being strategic (rather than passive).
   The collective nature of savings helps to ensure that women are nurtured as they develop a new understanding of themselves
   and their capabilities. As women take up new leadership roles in providing essential goods and services, centered on
   the home and neighborhood, an engagement with the state begins. New relations with the state include those with local
   councilors, officials, and sometimes traditional authorities. These are essential if urban deprivation is to be addressed and
   development to take place—even if these are often clientelist. Savings activities lead to Urban Poor Funds (at national and/
   or city levels) with blended finance.

   Since SDI’s inception in 1996, the network of federations that make up SDI has grown from the six founding members
   (Cambodia, India, Namibia, Nepal, South Africa, and Thailand) with the addition of Bolivia, Brazil, Ghana, Kenya,
   Malawi, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The core SDI network now involves more
   than 16,000 savings groups with an average membership of 70 per group. A key mechanism for investing in improved
   tenure and services has been Urban Poor Funds, which are established by SDI affiliates as they begin to undertake precedent-
   setting investments (for example, building houses or a community-managed public toilet) to show their capabilities. Just under
   $10 million is currently in the savings accounts of the federations from daily savings collections. Much of this finance is
   circulating locally within savings schemes. An additional $2 million is community savings in national urban poor funds.

   These local groups and the larger federations to which they belong are engaged in many community-driven initiatives to
   upgrade informal and squatter settlements, improving tenure security, and offering residents new development opportunities.
   They are also engaged in developing new housing that low-income households can afford and installing infrastructure and
   services (including water, sanitation, and drainage). More than 200,000 households have secured formal tenure (either
   individual or collective) as a result of this work. Across the network of federations, 102 agreements are in place with pro-
   vincial or city authorities that establish a dialogue with potential for more equal relationships between the authorities and
   the communities.

   In 1992 the Thai government provided the Urban Community
   Development Office (UCDO) with capital of B 1,250 million
   (or just over $41 million) to allow it to make loans available
   to organized low-income urban communities so that they
   could undertake a range of activities related to housing,
   land acquisition, and income generation. This funding
   also provided for small grants and technical support to
   community organizations. The Thai government recognized

   Organization Development Institute (CODI) was established
   as an independent public organization to continue and extend
   this work.

   In 2003 the government responded to continuing problems of poor-quality and often insecure housing and neighbor-
   hoods threatened with eviction in urban areas with a new program Baan Mankong or “secure housing,” which is broadly
   consistent with the work of CODI and implemented through the Institute. Baan Mankong channels government-financed
   infrastructure subsidies and housing loans directly to low-income communities, which plan and carry out improvements to
   their housing environment and to basic services. Infrastructure subsidies of B 25,000 ($625) per family are available for
   communities upgrading in situ, B 45,000 ($1,125) for reblocking, and B 65,000 ($1,625) for relocating. Families can
   draw on low-interest loans from either CODI or banks for housing, and a grant equal to 5 percent of the total infrastructure
   subsidy is available to help fund the management costs for the local organization or network.

   Baan Mankong supports processes designed and managed by low-income households and their community organizations
   and networks. These communities and networks work with local governments, professionals, universities, and NGOs in
   their city to survey all low-income communities and then plan an upgrading program to improve conditions for all these
   within three to four years. Once the plans have been finalized, CODI channels the subsidies and loans directly to the com-
   munities. These upgrading programs build on the community-managed programs and on what communities have already
   developed. Upgrading existing settlements is supported whenever possible; if relocation is necessary, a site is sought close
   by to minimize the economic and social costs to households. The program imposes as few conditions as possible seeking to
   support upgrading in ways that allow urban poor communities to lead the process and generate local partnerships, so that
   the whole city contributes to the solution.

   Between 2003 and July 2012, Baan Mankong supported 874 projects in 1,637 communities (some projects cover more
   than one community) spread across 286 urban centers and covering 91,805 households. Sixty-one percent of beneficia-
   ries belong to communities that were upgraded in situ with long-term secure collective tenure. Ten percent of beneficiaries
   relocated to new sites within two kilometers of their former homes. During the same period, grants for infrastructure upgrad-
   ing and associated technical assistance and capacity building exceeded $147 million, and loans for land and housing
   exceeded $181 million. More than 78 percent of households supported by CODI are now living in settlements that have
   also achieved tenure security, via long-term leases or collective land ownership.

                  Box 7. Asian Coalition for Community Action (ACCA) and Community-Led Upgrading

   In 2008 the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR) launched the Asian Coalition for Community Action (ACCA) to
   catalyze change in Asian cities in regard to slum upgrading. This program builds on the tradition of work within the Coali-
   tion. ACCA enables community groups to be the primary doers in planning and implementing projects in which they tackle
   problems of land, infrastructure, and housing. In each country, the support for community initiatives is channeled through
   ACHR members that are already working on issues of urban poverty and housing. These groups share a belief in a large-
   scale change process that is led by people. Many of these groups already support federations and networks of low-income
   community people, and most have already cultivated some kinds of collaborative links with local government agencies.
   ACCA offer new tools to these groups to enhance, strengthen, and scale up the work they are already doing to create a
   collaborative, citywide mechanism for bringing about change in their cities.

   The core activities of the program, which account for 60 percent of the budget, are the small upgrading projects and larger
   housing projects that are implemented in low-income communities by their residents. The plans for these projects, as well
   as the citywide surveying, saving, and partnership-building processes they are part of, are developed and implemented by
   the local groups. The budget ceilings for the upgrading projects are very small (a maximum of $3,000) but offer flexibility
   in how community organizations use those small resources to address what they choose. These budgets give people some-
   thing in their hands to start, to negotiate with, while forcing people to economize and think of what other resources can be
   mobilized. The expectation is that if communities plan well and use these funds strategically to link with other resources, then
   these modest amounts can help “unlock” people’s power to negotiate with other actors for more resources, more land, and
   more support. Each ACCA city can access the following:

       ■■ $15,000 for at least five small upgrading projects
       ■■ $40,000 for one big housing project in each city
       ■■ $3,000 per city for city process support, to cover a variety of joint development processes within the city,
          such as surveying, network building, support for savings activities, local exchanges, and meetings and
       ■■ $10,000 per country per year for national coordination, meetings, and exchanges.

   The program supports the setting up and strengthening of collaborative mechanisms to build linking, learning, and mutual
   support structures.

   By October 2012, the program was supporting infrastructure improvements in close to 1,000 settlements in 165 cities in
   19 Asian countries. Community development funds have been established in 107 cities; 70 of these are cities in which
   the process of fund establishment has been directly linked to ACCA investments. In 57 percent of the big housing projects,
   the land has been provided by the government under a variety of tenure arrangements. Analyzing the budgets of these
   projects shows that only 4 percent of funds have been provided by ACCA, 13 percent are from the communities, 3 percent
   from minor sources, and the remaining 80 percent have been provided by local and/or national government agencies. By
   December 2010, in 91 cities (out of total 107) some kind of committee was formalizing this city-community partnership.
   National-level collaborative mechanisms are also working now in eight countries (Cambodia, Fiji, Lao People’s Democratic
   Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam).

5                           An Assessment of the Key Challenges
                              (Local, National, and International)
                                    to Engaging Excluded Groups
                                        in Rapidly Growing Cities
Many challenges need to be addressed if excluded groups are to be engaged more effectively
and inclusive cities are to be achieved. Eight key challenges are highlighted here: (1) lack of
household income and the continuing prevalence of informal incomes; (2) a lack of state
investment capacity; (3) a lack of political will and state capacity even when political will is
established; (4) a lack of the basic data needed for addressing poverty; (5) a lack of space for
participation, especially by the lowest income groups; (6) a lack of vision for what an inclusive
city means; (7) the constraints on inclusion from city governments organized sectorally; (8)
and the lack of channels through which international agencies can support urban governments
and civil society groups.

In regard to the first of these, lack of income is a major reason for social exclusion on the
grounds of residency—and an inability to invest in human capital and so improve labor market
access and health. Many of the opportunities that are created are most easily accessed by those
who have some resources. For example, microfinance programs may require savings. Very low
incomes and multiple necessary expenditures mean that individuals and households have a
very limited capacity to save or invest and little ability to withstand shocks. Credit unions
and microfinance initiatives may require regular monthly payments, but this is particularly
difficult for those employed informally on very low wages. Banks may not locate close to
informal settlements. Women may find it difficult to accumulate savings if they cannot make
deposits outside the dwelling. Such realities illustrate the difficulties involved in taking up
market-based opportunities. Subsidy finance and special provision for those with low incomes
may also be more difficult. In South Africa, the water and electricity subsidy is offered on the
basis of formal residency in low-income settlements. Households informally renting a room
or backyard shack cannot access such state redistribution. In cities across the global South,
household access to piped water (and hence usually much lower prices per liter) may be offered
but be available only to those with the capital to invest in the line and meter. Such examples are
also illustrative of the third challenge, a lack of state capacity to design effective interventions.

It should be recognized here that income inequalities may also be significant in addition to
inadequate absolute income. High levels of income inequality and the spatially segregated
cities to which they contribute appear to reduce social mobility. This occurs as political elites
fail to commit to financial redistribution—or do not commit on a sufficient scale. For example,
improving incomes through cash transfers may do little if the costs of basic services and other
essentials (such as rents) increase as well. Such examples highlight how little we know about
factors determining the supply and price of rental accommodation in low-income settlements
despite the high percentage of tenants in many towns and cities; it is not uncommon for
between 30 and 60 percent of residents in informal settlements to be tenants.


                                                              19

A particular difficulty is that high levels of informal                neighborhood to (usually) low-quality and limited public
employment in labor markets contribute to income                       services (often with personal favors to the community

Many substantive efforts have been made to enhance relations between low-income,
disadvantaged, and other excluded groups and the state. These invariably establish more
participatory forms of engagement between government agencies and organized groups of
citizens. In most instances, the focus of the excluded groups’ interaction on the part of the
state is with local government. This reflects the primary significance of local government in
areas of importance to disadvantaged or excluded residents—including not only access to
infrastructure and services but also the influence of building and land-use regulations on the
cost and availability of housing and land for housing. Local governments are undoubtedly
significant, but it has to be recognized that they generally have very limited capacity to make
capital investments and generally support inclusion. Nevertheless city governments are critical
to efforts to secure more inclusive cities (as defined in the introduction). Below we summarize
three of these efforts to illustrate what is possible.

Efforts to advance democratization in Brazil following the return to democracy in the mid-
1980s included reflections on how to advance the accountability of local government. Among
other innovations, participatory budgeting developed as a result of innovations taken by
activists belonging to the federation of local neighborhood associations and the Partido dos
Trabalhadores (Workers’ Party) in Porto Alegre. After its introduction in the mid-1900s,
participatory budgeting had spread to 104 cities by 2001 and is now in use in more than
400 municipalities in Brazil. The particular form changes in different locations but what is
consistent is the organization of residential neighborhoods into groups that either directly
express their choices on local priorities for municipal investment or that elect delegates to
make these choices. In some cases, other excluded groups such as women are also formed
into participatory councils to inform local authorities about their priorities. Formal budgetary
responsibility remains with the elected representatives, who respond to the identification of
priorities in their budget process. Important in the participatory budgeting cycle is the annual
reporting on the priorities identified in the previous year. The scale of municipal investment and
the percentage delegated to the local participatory bodies vary considerably across the towns
and cities using participatory budgeting. However, it is evident that the balance of investments
has changed toward basic public goods and services in response to greater involvement by
citizens living in low-income neighborhoods. Participatory budgeting has also been important
in institutionalizing relationships between local neighborhood associations and challenging
clientelist political practices with their relations of dependency and subjugation.

The work of the Urban Community Development Office in Thailand was partially introduced

improvements in informal settlements. UCDO also built on other practices of savings-based
organizing to strengthen neighborhood associations and bring them together in citywide
networks. The residents in informal settlements were encouraged by Office staff and local
NGOs to set up community-based savings and loan groups. Loans were made available by the

                                  Can Be Monitored and Assessed
Far more discussion has taken place around what indicators should be used for measuring and
monitoring progress after 2015 than how the whole data generation system should be struc-
tured to encourage, serve, and support inclusion. Most of the discussion focuses on developing
an agreed upon set of national level indicators to be applied to all countries. This ignores the
extent to which inclusion in urban areas is linked to the capacity, competence, and account-
ability of local governments and to the extent to which those who are excluded are organized
and able to engage with local government. Data collected on exclusion should serve and sup-
port those institutions or groups tasked with tackling the different aspects of exclusion.

The list of indicators suggested also fails to address the vast limitations in current indicators—
for instance, in relation to water, sanitation, and housing conditions. What is at fault is the
whole internationally endorsed data collection system because it fails to produce relevant data
with the disaggregation and detail needed to inform (mostly local) assessment and action.

For measuring and monitoring poverty or other aspects of exclusion, fundamental limitations
are seen in what data are currently gathered and from whom data are collected (for example,
for data collected from interviews, who is interviewed; for household surveys, the size of the
sample and how it is chosen). The issue also arises of for whom the data are available and
useful; here the key issue is how much this provides relevant data disaggregated to the small-
est political unit (for example, the ward) or geographic unit (for example, each street). If a
commitment is made to inclusion, it needs to be supported by a commitment to generate the
data needed to address inclusion, that is, which housing units and streets do not have regular
supplies of safe water piped to their homes, electricity connections, and so on; this is not served
by the aggregated figures produced by national sample surveys.

 The reliance of most governments on national sample surveys for much of the data relevant
to inclusion (or poverty) means that the data collected provide a very aggregated view, for
instance, data “for urban populations” but not for each urban center, let alone for each ward
or street. Censuses should provide data down to this level and so in theory provide data rel-
evant for addressing exclusion, but they are expensive and generally done only once every
10 years—and it is not clear whether most census-taking institutions actually make the data
available to local governments in a form that allows them to identify (socially and spatially)
who is excluded.

The issue also arises of whether those who are undertaking household surveys or collecting
data for censuses actually include households in informal settlements. It is obviously difficult
for such data collection to take place in informal settlements for which we have no maps, no
street names, no house addresses or numbers, and no data on households who live there—


                                                             24

8               Conclusion: Toward Measures of Inclusion
                              That Work for the Excluded

Perhaps the most important issue in regard to what information supports inclusion is greater
acknowledgment about what urban poor groups are doing themselves with respect to data col-
lection and analysis and how they see and use this to negotiate greater inclusion: for instance,
the extent to which one finds direct support to urban poor organizations that also helped
support their work in partnership with local government—as in the more than 100 cities with
formal agreements between local government and the federations and/or a jointly managed
fund or the Urban Poor Fund International managed by SDI and the Asian Coalition for
Community Action (ACCA) managed by the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights.

This in turn is supported by new forms of data collection whose collection and use contributes
to greater inclusion—as in the surveys, maps, and enumerations undertaken by federations or
networks of community organizations already mentioned. Direct engagement is also needed
by local governments with organizations of the urban poor to identify the metrics that work
for them and their members. The list of topics that these need to cover will not differ much
from the previously noted lists, but the indicators chosen by urban poor groups for measuring
and monitoring these may differ very considerably. One of the indicators that appear to be
important are the numbers who, facing relocation, are located close to their original locations,
or who are allowed to identify alternative sites for their new accommodation. Ease and cost of
access to water, public transport, toilets, electricity, and other basic services matter enormously
to the low-income populations and particularly women, who have primary responsibility for
providing for their families, but the actual indicators they would choose to assess these are
likely to be more detailed than the kinds of indicators suggested for the post-2015 sustainable
development goals—and rooted in local contexts.

 The ability to move around the city safely, quickly, and cheaply is also likely to be important
for large sections of the low-income population: A well-functioning affordable public transport
system helps widen the income-earning choices of low income groups. A city where the needs
of pedestrians and bicycles are met also is important for inclusion.

One revealing indicator of exclusion is the proportion of land occupied by informal settlements
plus the proportion of the city population living in such settlements. Indicators of inclusion
might be worth considering such as the level of support for improving informal settlements,
the presence of consultative mechanisms to engage city councils and organized residents, the
presence of review mechanisms to assess government expenditures, and the presence of up-to-
date information about informal settlements including populations, existing services, and the
land area these occupy. But it is important that the metrics chosen to measure and monitor
exclusion are locally generated and locally relevant—and thus with limitations on how these
can be compared internationally. When working in a particular city, it is possible to report on
a range of indicators important for inclusion, for instance, the quality of the relationship be-
tween urban poor organization leaders and local government staff and politicians, the ease with
