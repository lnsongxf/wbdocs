Executive Summary


1. Overview of the Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors

Cambodia has experienced strong economic growth along with significant poverty reduction over the past
decade. Average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth was about 10 percent between 1998 and 2008,
compared to a 1.8 percent population growth rate during the same period. Poverty has been reduced significantly
(around 10 percentage points in a decade) and continues to fall, declining from 35 percent in 2004 to 30.1 percent
in 2007. Economic growth has been broad-based, covering all key sectors, and per capita GDP has increased from
$250 in 1998 to an estimated $795 in 2008. The country has achieved macroeconomic stability and put in place
an open trade regime, which has led to significant inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI has been the
primary contributor to the explosion of non-traditional exports (largely textiles and garments), which together with
the tourism and construction sectors has been the most significant source of growth and non-farm employment.
Growth, however, has proven to be vulnerable to global economic and financial crises. The slowdown in garment
exports and in tourism arrivals reduced the GDP growth rate in 2008 to 6.7 percent, and the economy contracted by
2 percent in 2009, its worst performance in the post-conflict period.

Agriculture continues to be the mainstay of the economy and has recently emerged as an important source
of growth. The sector expanded at an annual rate of 4.4 percent between 1998 and 2008. Although lower than the
GDP growth rate, the agricultural growth rate in Cambodia has nevertheless been impressive when compared to the
average rate in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region (3.8 percent). The sector expanded by another 4.7 percent in
2009 despite global economic and financial crises. It makes up about one-third of total GDP and provides employment
to about 70 percent of the labor force. The main sources of agricultural growth are: (i) gains in crop productivity (both
rice and non-rice); (ii) public and private investment in agriculture and rural infrastructure (transport, irrigation, and
processing); (iii) an increase in the rural labor force, as well as substantial investment in social infrastructure such as
health, education, and sanitation.

Rice is a dominant crop, consisting of about one-quarter of agriculture GDP and about half of crop value
added. It is grown on 84 percent of cultivated land by about 85 percent of farmers. Despite this concentration on rice,
there has been a significant amount of diversification in the sector over the last decade. Production of non-traditional
food and industrial crops (maize, cassava, and soybeans) has had the most rapid growth, partly as a response to
increasing demand from the livestock sector, which expanded at an annual rate of 28 percent between 1995 and
2007. Other crops in which production significantly increased in the 2000s include tobacco, peanuts, sesame, and
rubber.

The agriculture sector in Cambodia has great potential to contribute to economic growth and exports. The
country is endowed with a good climate and large land and surface water resource base. With appropriate technical
and institutional support from the public sector, there is significant potential for making sustainable increases in
overall crop yields by increasing the use of agricultural inputs such as good seed and fertilizers and by improving
irrigation infrastructure.

Despite the potential of its agriculture sector, there is justifiable concern about Cambodia’s ability to seize
these opportunities. The concern is that there exists a set of constraints to agricultural development, and unless
these are addressed by appropriate policies and interventions, they will slow down economic growth and poverty

    reduction. These constraints include: (i) coordination issues between agricultural research and extension that limits
    the effectiveness of public expenditures; (ii) weak and underdeveloped irrigation and rural roads infrastructure; and
    (iii) an excessive focus on rehabilitating primary irrigation infrastructure to the detriment of developing secondary and
    tertiary systems and of maintaining these irrigation systems.



    2. The Level and Composition of Expenditures on the Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors

    The agriculture and productive rural infrastructure sectors in Cambodia are serviced by three line agencies:
    the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (MAFF), the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology
    (MOWRAM), and the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). MAFF is responsible for supporting dryland agriculture,
    upland and lowland crops, rice production, and marketing and for agricultural support services relating to research,
    extension and farmer education. It is also responsible for water resource functions for irrigated agriculture, for fisheries
    development, and for forest and catchment programs. It is organized into four thematic areas: general agriculture,
    rubber development, forestry, and fisheries. MOWRAM is responsible for the development and management of
    all water. It has two technical departments: the Engineering Department is responsible for the rehabilitation or
    construction of irrigation/water resources infrastructure as well as its operation and maintenance, while the Irrigated
    Agriculture Department deals with the institutional issues related to the development and maintenance of irrigation
    infrastructure. Finally, the mandate of MRD covers other rural infrastructure, including rural roads, water supply and
    sanitation, ethnic development, community development, and rural economic development.

    Between 2000 and 2008, total government expenditure grew faster than the economy and capital expenditure
    faster than recurrent. Between 2000 and 2008, Cambodia’s gross development product (GDP) tripled from Riels
    14,082 billion in 2000 to Riels 41,977 billion in 2008. In real terms, GDP grew by an annual average rate of 9.3 percent
    between 2000 and 2008. During the same period, there was steady growth in the government’s recurrent budget
    from Riels 1,215 billion in 2000 and to Riels 4,439 billion in 2009, with real increases exceeding 14 percent annually
    between 2006 and 2008. On average, government recurrent expenditure, in real terms, increased by 10.1 percent
    between 2000 and 2008, which was higher than the trend rate of growth in GDP. The ratio of government recurrent
    expenditure to GDP remained broadly unchanged over the period 2000 to 2008 at between 7 to 9 percent.

Executive Summary                                                                                                            3




Total funding for the agriculture, irrigation, and rural roads sectors from the government and donors increased
from Riel 464 billion in 2007 to Riel 644 billion in 2009. This is equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP (Figure 1). Donors
continue to provide significant funding for these sectors in Cambodia. Donor spending an agriculture, irrigation,
and rural roads averaged about $50 million in each of these years, increasing from Riel 194 billion in 2007 to Riel
207 billion in 2009, albeit at significantly slower rate than government spending during the same period. Most donor
funding has gone to agriculture, while funding for rural roads and irrigation has been declining. The share of donor
funding in total agriculture, irrigation and rural roads funding has decreased from 42 percent in 2007 to 32 percent in
2009 (Figure 2).

However, by international standards, Cambodia’s public spending on agriculture compared to both GDP and
to agricultural GDP is low when compared to levels in countries with similar levels of per capita GDP. Out
of ten countries, only two, Indonesia and Bangladesh, have equal or lower ratios of public spending on agriculture
to GDP, and only Bangladesh has a lower ratio of public spending to agriculture value added. Furthermore, public
expenditure on research and development (R&D) broadly defined in Cambodia is relatively low, at only 0.1 percent
of agricultural GDP compared with 0.2 to 0.6 percent elsewhere in Asia. Although, international experience shows
little positive correlation between level of agriculture spending and high rates of agricultural growth. there is evidence
that the quality of public spending does have positive implications on sector growth. As the analysis below shows,
Government agriculture spending in Cambodia has generally gone for the provision of public goods and services
which are necessary for sector growth. While public spending has in no doubt contributed to high rates of agricultural
growth in Cambodia and Bangladesh, both countries also share similarities in terms of conducive and relatively
distortions free policy environment, which have encouraged private sector contribution to sector performance.

Government recurrent expenditures have been growing faster than GDP in Cambodia. There have been large
increases in recurrent government spending at MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD on agriculture, irrigation, and rural
roads respectively. However, this does not reflect any increased priority in recurrent spending for the sectors. MAFF,
which, as a service provider, is most dependent on its recurrent budget, has the largest recurrent budget (expenditure
Riel 78.2 billion in 2009), followed by the MRD (expenditure Riel 54.6 billion) and MOWRAM (expenditure Riel
31.4 billion). The annual recurrent expenditure growth rates of the MRD (21.4 percent) and MOWRAM (15.1 percent)
between 2000 and 2008 exceeded the total recurrent budget growth rates in real terms, while MAFF recurrent
spending grew by 9.2 percent.

Irrigation and rural roads have been given priority in the small but expanding government capital budget.
Capital expenditure is largest in MOWRAM, where it increased from Riels 17.9 billion in 2004 to Riels 148.7 billion
in 2009. The MRD’s capital expenditure has increased from Riels 64.7 billion to Riels 87.6 billion over the same
period. The capital budget is significantly larger in MOWRAM and the MRD relative to recurrent budget, and exceeds
funding received from donors. Together, MOWRAP and the MRD spend about 16 percent of the total government
capital budget. MAFF on the other hand has essentially no capital budget, having received no funds for construction
or equipment since 2004.

Our functional analysis of MAFF budget spending shows that only 3 percent of its budget goes to extension
and 5 percent to agricultural research. The shortfalls in domestic operating budgets for research and extension
have been covered by donors, which have allocated about 31 percent of their funding to these functional areas to
fill these domestic funding gaps. These are also areas where donor dependence is highest—during 2007 to 2009,
the share of government funding in total funding was only 3.5 percent for extension and 41 percent for agricultural

    research. Donor dependence is significantly less in the case of rural roads and irrigation investments (72 percent each
    between 2007 and 2009) where donor aid has been concentrated mainly on new or rehabilitated infrastructure.

    In total, the government share of total agriculture expenditures averaged 43 percent between 2007 and 2009
    period. This heavy dependence on donor support in agriculture in general has created a number of issues, one of
    which is whether this funding is fiscally sustainable and another is the proliferation of project implementation units,
    which have attracted key skills and personnel away from the government to donor projects. Meanwhile, ministries
    are focused on projects rather than on policy and budget strategy, while the priorities of the donors may not always
    be aligned with national development goals.



    3. Budget Processes and Performance

    The budget processes within MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD are governed by systems put in place by the
    Ministry of Economics and Finance (MEF). The three-year rolling Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
    forecasts and allocates the overall resource flows to priority sectors within the government. However, the priorities in
    high-level five-year planning documents such as the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), which guides the
    MTEF, are very broadly defined and may become outdated as development proceeds and circumstances change.

    Budget Strategic Plans (BSPs), introduced under the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP)
    in 2007, are a key policy and budget planning tool for the ministries. The BSP a tool to align the sectoral
    planning with budgeting process. It is used by line ministries to prepare their medium-term and annual budgets
    and their program budgets. Despite some progress, the links between the NSDP, the MTEF/BSP, and the annual
    budget remain weak. Donor practices in a number of areas continue to challenge the government’s ability to capture
    externally financed spending in its chart of accounts. The main weakness is continued poor integration of capital
    and recurrent expenditures, which is exacerbated by the creating of separate unit (DIC) in MEF and PMUs within
    line ministries that manage all aspects of donor-funded projects. To be fully effective, BSPs need to reflect all public
    sector resource flows to a sector (recurrent and capital), whether from the government or donors. At the moment,
    the BSPs only capture government resources, and this is a major weakness, given the high volume of donor aid.

    The BSPs should become the central planning tool for the implementation of the Strategy for Agriculture
    and Water (SAW) and should cover both domestic budget allocations and donor allocations. At the moment,
    their effectiveness is constrained by capacity limitations, and by the difficulty of including donor aid, which currently
    flows through project implementation units (PMUs). The desirability of moving away from projects towards a more
    integrated and programmatic approach is understood by the donor/development partner community.

    The constraints on improving budgeting are systemic and thus are to some extent beyond the control of
    the line ministries. The MEF is responsible for public finance management, and the Public Financial Management
    Reform Program (PFMRP) is working on improving the system, though the ten-year PFMRP timetable recognizes
    that these reforms will take some time to deliver.

4. Efficiency and Effectiveness of Expenditures on the Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors

For the purposes of this PER, the performance of the government in achieving its objectives is measured
in terms of production, of increased incomes for the immediate beneficiaries of public expenditure, and of
reduced expenditure. Most of the objectives of SAW for research, extension, and irrigation are aimed at increasing
the incomes and livelihoods of farmer beneficiaries. In the case of rural roads, the immediate objectives of SAW
are to increase the incomes of farmers and to reduce the prices and costs of transport. Also included are the wider
objectives of promoting growth and reducing poverty.

The levels of output from public expenditure have            Figure 3. Cost-effectiveness Indices: Actual and Trend Lines,

been an upward trend in outputs for both irrigation and      140

complications due to the wide range of irrigation work
being done. The limited available international evidence suggests that unit costs in Cambodia are high for extension
and rural roads and low for irrigation compared with other countries but do not show any tendency to increase.

The analysis of economic returns to public expenditures is based on benefit-cost ratios (BCRs). The BCR is
the ratio of the net present value (NPV) of benefits to the NPV of costs that would have been calculated if economic
appraisals had been done over the past decade. The BCRs were low (close to 1) in 2007 but rose to more than 2 after
the commodity price increases since 2007 and despite irregular donor funding and poor coordination with research
(Figure 4).

Since 2007, public expenditures on extension have yielded high returns reflecting in part raising benefits
along with higher agriculture commodity prices. In the case of irrigation, returns to public expenditure have been
low, even after an increase in prices since 2007. This is due largely to the disproportionate expenditure allocated
to rehabilitating irrigation schemes that have limited or no maintenance operations. With better targeting of public
funds, it should be possible to double the returns from public expenditure on irrigation. Public expenditure on rural
roads has yielded steadily growing returns throughout the decade. If output targets remain stable and are achieved,
extension will yield one of the highest returns among all government expenditure categories, whereas returns to
expenditures on rural roads could be much higher.

In agriculture, an analysis of economic returns to public expenditure on extension must consider the benefit-
cost ratios (BCRs) in other words, the ratio of the net present value (NPV) of benefits to the NPV of costs

    that would have been calculated if economic appraisals had been done over the past decade. The BCRs were
    marginal (in other words, close to 1.0) in 2007 but jumped to over 2.0 after recent food commodity price rises.

    In agriculture, BCRs for extension have increased since 2007, peaking at BCR of 3 in 2008. Since 2002 rice
    production has increased by 28 percent, which is attributable largely to an increase in adoption rates of improved sees
    and farming practices and irrigation on yields as a result of farmers’ contact with extension agents. Public spending
    on agricultural extension in Cambodia has potential to continue to generate high rates of return but there is a need to
    increase diffusion rates and adoption rate per extension worker. There is still a considerable scope to increase farm
    productivity levels, especially for wet season rice, which indicates that extension activities could continue to provide
    significant benefits over medium to longer term. Increasing long-term performance of public extension activities
    requires improvements in its institutional functionalities. Achieving better balance between operating costs and
    recurrent costs, coupled with broader institutional changes which devolve more MAFF budget resources and staff
    to provincial and district levels would go long way to deliver extension messages to larger number of farmers. Better
    integration of agricultural research and extension delivery functions will ensure that public spending on development
    of new crop varieties, and information on research trials on fertilizer and soil management techniques for specific
    agro-ecological conditions will reach farmers quickly and in easily accessible format.

    In the irrigation sector, the BCRs remained close to 1 throughout the 2000s, suggesting that irrigation is
    performing well below its potential. The BCRs for irrigation have not improved in recent years, despite better
    farm incentives, and vary widely depending on the design of the schemes. This is largely due to a sharp increase
    in the unit costs. The analysis in this review suggests that only about 70 percent of the command area could be
    actually irrigated in Cambodia, largely because of incomplete rehabilitation. This in turn is the result of public funds
    being spent on primary canals at the expense of secondary and tertiary canals. Meager funding for maintenance is
    another key reason for the limited effectiveness of irrigation investments. There is also the possibility of using new
    technologies in irrigation investments, which would reduce the need for costly maintenance works in the future. The
    government has been encouraging the creation of Farmer Water User Communities (FWUCs) to undertake local
    maintenance works. While this is valid in principle, it may take many decades to achieve. It is therefore unrealistic
    to place full responsibility for maintenance on the FWUCs, meaning that the optimum share of public funding to be
    devoted to maintenance is about one-third.

Executive Summary                                                                                                         7




Expenditures on rural roads have yielded very large benefits in recent years, with BCRs of higher than 2
since 2005 and reaching 3 in 2008 and 2009. Between 100 and 600km of rural roads have been rehabilitated
and 300 to 1,000km have benefited from periodic or routine maintenance. The recent increase in expenditures on
maintenance will further increase the effectiveness of these investments, although the share of the budget assigned
to maintenance is still far below the optimum level of about 45 percent of total roads spending. The costs of building
and maintain rural roads are increasing with the growing shortage of laterite. New materials and techniques will need
to be found and piloted, such as bamboo concrete and engineered earth methods if the progress in increasing rural
access is to be sustained, but this will require higher upfront capital outlays and more capacity building.

The analysis shows that there is room for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures
in agriculture given the potential indicated by the BCRs (see Figure 5). There are number of ways to increase the
effectiveness of public investments at current spending levels. For example, expenditures on research, extension,
irrigation, and rural roads should be seen as mutually dependent and can be more effective when concentrated in
the same locations and when the best locations are selected. Furthermore, geographical targeting of productive
infrastructure investments first in areas of high agricultural potential (as defined by higher population densities and
closeness to main domestic and international markets) could increase returns to scarce public resources.



5. Climate Change and Public Expenditure

Much work has recently been done in Cambodia to assess the impact of climate change on agriculture.
Predictions of climate change in Cambodia are difficult as the country is situated between two weather systems.
However, analysis to date suggests that most areas of the country will be subject to shorter rainy seasons and longer
and drier dry seasons. The social effect of this will be an increase in food insecurity among vulnerable households.

The net impact of climate change on agricultural production in Cambodia will be complex and is likely to vary
considerably from one region to another. The most strongly felt impact will probably be the reduced and more
variable growing seasons, which will require farmers to invest in water storage and will require the development
of new crop varieties and farming techniques that are more resilient to unpredictable growing seasons. This is
expected to increase significantly the returns to public expenditure in research and extension and in water storage
and management.

In a country like Cambodia, where the pattern of climate change is both more mixed and more uncertain
than in other countries, it is prudent to argue that public expenditure priorities should focus on “low regret”
investments that combine standard national planning goals with climate adaptation. These would be public
investments that could result in “low regrets” or opportunity costs (such as increased use of better seeds and
improving farming techniques, including water and soil management) if the more negative climate effects as currently
projected do not materialize. Investments in increasing agricultural productivity would qualify as one such “low
regret” option.



6. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations

The effectiveness of public spending on agriculture could be substantially increased in Cambodia. The recent
increases in agriculture prices have boosted BCRs to levels that some have interpreted as a signal to the government
8                                                     THE AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION, AND RURAL ROADS SECTORS: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW




    to increase its spending on agriculture. In this public expenditure review, we suggest that there is little room to do
    this within the existing budget envelope unless offsetting reductions are made in other areas. Should such room be
    found, the prime candidates for increased allocations should be extension, irrigation, and rural roads. On the basis of
    PER analysis, the following recommendations are offered for improving the performance of public expenditures on
    agriculture, irrigation, and rural roads:

    Reallocate more budget resources on agricultural extension. Government funding for extension is low as a
    share of its agriculture budget and, as a result, these services are dependent on donor support. Public extension
    has potential to deliver high returns in Cambodia. There is an opportunity to significantly increase government
    by reallocating it from functional areas of lesser value for money. However, any spending increases, both from
    government and donors, should be accompanied by improvements of institutional functionality of MAFF extension
    systems and establishment of monitoring systems to measure the effectiveness of expenditures on these functions.
    Better harmonization of service delivery standards between various extension providers (government, NGOs and
    private sector) and elimination of conflicting messages would also improve the efficiency of extension spending for
    all.

    Don’t ignore funding for agricultural research. Analysis of efficiency of agricultural research spending in Cambodia
    was constrained by data limitations, but international evidence shows that agricultural research can have very high
    rates of return.While increased public spending for agricultural research is justified, it should come with institutional
    changes which clarify the specific functions of the country’s various research institutions and by consolidating
    laboratory capacities in various government units in order to reduce overlap and waste of resources. This can be
    done by establishing joint planning and evaluation systems by the government, donors and private sector to identify
    research needs and resource requirements. Technical expertise of donors could play an important role in building
    more effective research capacity in Cambodia. Better integration of national agricultural research institutions with
    extension services could further increase public spending efficiency on research, as well as extension.

    Prepare for climate change. Related to two above recommendations, long-term efficiency of public spending on
    extension and research could be further improved by focussing more research efforts on development of new crop
    varietals and dissemination of knowledge on improved water storage and soil moisture preservation at farm-level—
    i.e. “low regret” investments that combine increased agricultural productivity with climate adaptation and mitigation
    against negative effects from reduced and more variable growing seasons.

    Increase the effectiveness of irrigation investments. Public funding for new and rehabilitated irrigation schemes
    needs to be extended to secondary canals and associated infrastructure. The rehabilitation of tertiary canals using
    public funds is also justified provided that it includes arrangements the costs of operation and maintenance to be
    recovered from the end users. There also a need for more selectivity in funding irrigation schemes.

    Increase the share of the budget designated for maintenance of irrigation and rural roads. In the case of
    irrigation, the optimal level of maintenance expenditure should be about 33 percent of total investment, and in the
    rural roads sector, an average of 45 percent is required for periodic and routine maintenance combined. This level of
    maintenance should ensure that the next major rehabilitation is not required for at least 10 years.

    Investigate the economic viability of using new technologies for rehabilitating and maintaining rural roads.
    New technologies to consider include the use of bamboo reinforced concrete (for busy roads) and engineered

Public Expenditure Planning and Management. We propose the following priorities to increase the effectiveness
of public expenditure for consideration.

  (a)	 Use the Budget Strategic Plans (BSPs) within each ministry as the key policy and budget planning tool
       for allocating and managing all resources to the sectors. The BSPs should become the central planning tool
       for the implementation of the Strategy for Agriculture and Water (SAW) and should include both domestically
       financed budget allocations and donor allocations.

  (b)	 Reinforce the annual budget process by requiring MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD to assign “hard”
       and enforceable budgets to each department through the BSPs. The current system of partial program
       budgets should be absorbed into this comprehensive approach.

  (c)	 Use the MEF Treasury system to record expenditure on a departmental basis. This would require
       an expanded version of the Tableau des Opérations Financières de l’Etat (TOFE) and greater devolution of
       responsibility for expenditure to departments.

  (d)	 Introduce an annual review and planning process for the annual and medium-term budget process
       that includes both the government and all of its development partners, that puts BSPs at the heart of
       the process, and that integrates the SAW into government planning. The donors, in consultation with
       the government, are preparing to map the way forward, and this should be done as a joint government/ donor
       activity. The SAW initiatives are an opportunity to establish systems for regular and informative appraisal,
       monitoring, and evaluation of expenditures and for these to be fed back into future budget decisions.

     1. Introduction


     Agriculture is a high priority for the Cambodian government as it is one of the core sources of the country’s
     economic growth and export earnings. Starting from a low base, government spending on agriculture rose to 1.3
     percent of GDP in 2007 and to 1.5 percent in 2009, mainly through significant increases in outlays on irrigation and
     rural roads. This period of rising public spending on agriculture overlapped with robust annual growth in agriculture
     output. Al-though insufficient time has elapsed to assess with confidence whether there is a causal relationship
     between the level of public spending and agriculture growth in Cambodia, the evidence provided in this chapter
     shows that public expenditures may indeed have had a significant impact in increasing and sustaining agricultural
     growth, along with conducive policy environment. The analysis confirms that Government budget spending has been
     generally going for the provision of public goods and services, which have high returns on investments. However, the
     analysis also shows that there is a good potential for further efficiency gains on resources spent.

     This report focuses on areas with highest potential efficiency gains to increase the value for money from
     investments in core public goods and services such as extension, irrigation and rural roads. This is a first
     attempt to carry out such an analysis in Cambodia, and even in the Greater Mekong sub-region. Based on extensive
     data gathering and sur-veys, this chapter analyzes the efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural sector expenditures
     in Cambodia and assesses various options for increasing the impact of government expenditures on agricultural
     growth. Other chal-lenges include an excessive focus on rehabilitating primary irrigation infrastructure and a neglect
     of secondary and tertiary systems, a lack of maintenance of irrigation and rural roads, and the slow pace of developing
     or adopting new technologies to reduce future maintenance costs. There is also a need to better prioritize agricultural
     and related infrastructure expenditures, both by type and by geographic location, to maximize their impact on
     growth.

     The rest of the report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 presents recent developments in the agriculture sector
     of Cambodia. Chapter 3 gives an overview of sectoral expenditure trends over the last decade. The budget process
     and its relationship to sectoral development strategies is discussed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 discusses the novel
     contribution of the AgPER in analyzing the efficiency and effectiveness of government spending using benefit-cost
     analysis to examine select public investments. Chapter 5 discusses how likely climate change trends may affect future
     agriculture expenditures and suggests some priority areas for public spending. The conclusion section summarizes
     the major findings and policy recommendations of the report.

2. Overview of the Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors


Cambodia has experienced strong economic growth along with significant poverty reduction over the past
decade. The average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth was about 10 percent between 1998 and 2008
compared to a 1.8 percent population growth rate during the same period. Poverty has been reduced significantly
(around 10 percentage points over last a decade) and continues to fall, declining from 35 percent in 2004 to 30.1 percent
in 2007. Economic growth has been broad-based, covering all key sectors, and per capita income has increased from
$250 in 1998 to an estimated $795 in 2008.

The country has achieved macroeconomic stability and put in place an open trade regime, which has led to
significant inflow of foreign direct investments (FDI). This FDI has been the main cause of the explosion of non-
traditional exports (largely textiles and garments), which together with the tourism and construction sectors, have
been the most significant source of growth and non-farm employment. Growth, however, has proven to be vulnerable
to global economic and financial crises. The slowdown in garment exports and in tourist arrivals reduced the GDP
growth rate in 2008 to 6.7 percent, and the economy contracted by 2 percent in 2009, its worst performance in the
post-conflict period.

Agriculture in Cambodia continues to be the mainstay of the economy and has recently emerged as an
important source of growth. The sector expanded at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent between 1998 and
2008, which was primarily driven by growth in crop production. Although lower than the GDP growth rate, it was
nevertheless impressive when compared to the average agricultural GDP growth rate of the East Asia and Pacific
(EAP) region (3.8 percent). The sector expanded by another 5.4 percent in 2009 despite global economic and financial
crises. Table 2.1 presents the sectoral growth trends between 2000 and 2008.

The sector occupies a more dominant role in the Cambodian economy than in its neighboring countries. The
share of agricultural value added in GDP declined from 45 percent in 1996 to around 30 percent in 2008–09. Despite
its falling share of GDP over time as the economy continues to mature, agricultural output has continued to expand
due to productivity gains, which reflected an increase in the area under irrigation, the use of improved inputs, and a
generally greater degree of commercialization as more private investors, both domestic and foreign, have invested
in agriculture. However, the sector has still a high share of its workforce in agriculture, which, when forestry and
fisheries are included, was around 70 percent in the late 2000s compared with 42 percent in Thailand and 58 percent
in Vietnam.

     Rice is the dominant crop in Cambodia, representing more than one-fourth of Cambodia’s agriculture GDP
     and 40 percent of all value added of agricultural crops. It is grown on 84 percent of cultivated land by some
     85 percent of farmers.1 The country has achieved an annual rice surplus since 1995, with rice production growing at
     an impressive annual growth rate of 6.5 percent between 1999 and 2009, well above the population growth rates.
     Production over the last 10 years has increased both through area expansion (2.6 percent per annum) and increased
     yields (3.9 percent per annum). In absolute terms, rice productivity rose from an average 1.5 tons per ha in 1994 to
     2.8 tons per ha in 2008/09, which makes it one of the highest growth rate of yields in South East Asia, albeit from a
     low base (Table 2.2). In fact, while yields in Cambodia have increased dramatically, they are still lower than yield levels

     However, despite improvements over last decade, the productivity of agriculture sector remains low when
     compared to neighboring countries in the region. This is largely due to low levels of input use and of mechanization
     and irrigation, which suggests that there remains considerable scope for increasing output and productivity. For
     example, Cambodian farmers applied the least amount of fertilizer compared with farmers in neighboring South
     East Asian countries (Table 2.3). Investment in rural infrastructure has been particularly low, and this has resulted in
     lower rates of rural development than the rest of the region. The country has the least developed road network in
     the region with the smallest percentage of paved roads. More than 70 percent of the unpaved rural road network is
     barely accessible or is impassable in the rainy season, which keeps some parts of the country isolated and impedes
     their trade in agricultural products, thus causing them chronic economic difficulties. Despite undisputable evidence
     that access to water increases agricultural productivity, effective irrigation coverage is still limited. Currently there are

2. Overview of the Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors                                                                       13




around 2,400 irrigation schemes in Cambodia, covering a total of 1.046 million season hectares (582,085 hectares of
wet season irrigation and 245,288 hectares of dry season irrigation). According to MOWRAM’s inventory statistics,
the total irrigated capacity figures for both the dry and wet season show actual effective coverage ranging from 27 to
40 percent of rice fields. However, as discussed in Chapter 4, public expenditure on irrigation both by the government
and by donors has been insufficient to provide complete and well maintained irrigation systems. The absence of such
systems means that small farmers are dependent on volatile rainfall patterns and are not willing to invest in farm
inputs, such as improved seeds and fertilizers.

Yet the agriculture sector in Cambodia has the potential to contribute to economic growth and exports
as demonstrated by increasing private sector investments over the last few years. The country is endowed
with a good climate and a large land and surface water resource base. With appropriate technical and institutional
support from the public sector, there is significant potential for sustainable increases in overall crop yields through the
increased use of agricultural inputs such as good seed and fertilizers and improvements in irrigation infrastructure.
This is demonstrated by the growing domestic surpluses of paddy rice since 1995, which have led to robust growth
in rice exports, both formal and informal. Cambodia currently exports around 2.25 million tons of paddy rice, which is
exported informally mainly to Vietnam and Thailand. Formal exports of milled rice (at around US$700 million) account
for around 15 percent of the country’s total export earnings, which are currently dominated by garments (around
70 percent of total exports). If Cambodia were able to sustain its current growth rates of paddy production, it might be
able to export some 3 to 4 million tons of milled rice by 2020, which would make it one of the leading rice exporters
in the world.

Because of the abundance of fertile and sometimes under-used land in Cambodia, there is also significant
potential for agricultural diversification by increasing production of non-rice crops. Among non-rice crops,
production of maize, cassava and soya beans has seen the most rapid growth recently (above 20 percent annual
growth rate in value added since 2002), partly due to increasing demand from the livestock sector. Other crops in
which production has surged dramatically during the last decade include tobacco, peanuts, and sesame, mostly
through the expansion of cultivated land. In addition, rubber and fish, despite their more modest growth over the last
decade, still represent more than US$250 million of Cambodian exports annually.

Furthermore, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has made improvements in agriculture and rural
development high priorities in its broader national economic development strategies. The Rectangular
Strategy II 2008, which is a key strategic development document, highlights the government’s resolve to make
agriculture a leading sector of the national economy and a key source of sustainable economic growth, as well as its
desire to expand food security and reduce poverty. 2 The National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), which is the
implementing document for the Rectangular Strategy,3 recognizes that the traditional engines of growth (tourism,
garment exports, and construction) need to be complemented by other sources that are more broad-based in
order to attain its priority objective of improving the lives of the rural poor and achieving the Cambodian Millennium
Development Goals by 2015. The Agricultural Sector Strategic Development Plan 2006 10 (ASSDP) stresses the
importance of agricultural commercialization and private sector development, which are being addressed through its
seven sectoral goals. The Strategy for Agriculture and Water 2010 13 (SAW), which replaced the ASSDP, provides
a strategic framework for the implementation of the NSDP. The strategy emphasizes the development of the

     agribusiness sector as one of its priority areas and recognizes the potential income loss to the country, and related
     vulnerabilities, from the export of unprocessed agricultural commodities. It contains a commitment to increasing the
     competitiveness of processed agricultural exports, particularly rice, through a wide range of strategic interventions
     to increase Cambodia’s competitive advantages. Finally, in August 2010, the government approved a policy on the
     Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export. The policy recognizes the strategic importance of rice production to
     Cambodia’s economy and lists a number of policy measures and related investment priorities, as well as responsible
     institutions to implement them, to promote rice production and exports.

     Despite well-defined strategic development goals and few policy-induced distortions, there is a concern
     about Cambodia’s ability to convert its potential into development outcomes. There exists a complex set of
     constraints to agricultural development that, unless addressed by appropriate policies and public investments, will
     result in a loss of opportunities. Many of these constraints lie beyond the narrow domain of the agriculture sector
     and require multi-sectoral interventions (for example, the development of port, rail, and trunk road infrastructure,
     trade facilitation, and access to finance). These constraints may be limiting the effectiveness of some sector-specific
     interventions. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive set of fiscal and policy incentives plus substantive
     public investments for the sector to make productive and sustainable use of the country’s natural resources. These
     issues will be discussed in more depth in the chapters that follow.

3. The Level and Composition of Expenditures on the Agriculture,
Irrigation, and Rural Road Sectors


A. Trends in Expenditures on and Support for the Agricultural, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors.

The agriculture and productive rural infrastructure sectors in Cambodia are serviced by three line
agencies: the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry (MAFF), the Ministry of Water Resources and
Meteorology (MOWRAM), and the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). MAFF is responsible for supporting
dryland agriculture, upland and lowland crops, and rice production and marketing and for agricultural support services
relating to research, extension, and farmer education. It is also responsible for water resource functions for irrigated
agriculture, for fisheries development, and for forest and catchment programs. It is organized into four thematic areas:
general agriculture, rubber development, forestry, and fisheries. Agricultural research is the responsibility of the semi-
autonomous Cambodia Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI). MOWRAM is responsible for the
development and management of all water resources according to the Law on Water Management of 2007. It has two
technical departments: the Engineering Department is responsible for the rehabilitation or construction of irrigation/
water resources infrastructure as well as its operation and maintenance, while the Irrigated Agriculture Department
deals with the institutional issues related to the development and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure, including
the establishment of Farmer Water Users Committees (FWUCs). Finally, the mandate of the MRD covers other rural
infrastructure, including rural roads, water supply, and sanitation, ethnic development, community development, and
rural economic development.

Between 2000 and 2008, the total government budget increased at faster rate than GDP. Cambodia’s GDP
increased from Riels 14,082 billion in 2000 to Riels 41,977 billion in 2008. In real terms, GDP achieved an annual
average growth rate of 9.3 percent between 2000 and 2008. During the same period, total government spending
more than tripled from Riels 1,512 billion to Riels 5,458 billion, which translates into an annual average growth rate
of 11.9 percent in real terms. As a result, total government expenditure increased from 7.6 percent of GDP in 2000
to 9.8 percent in 2009.

Total government spending for MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD grew three times over between 2004 and
2009, driven by a five-fold raise in spending on irrigation. In 2009, total government spending on these ministries
was Riel 398 billion. In real terms, spending for agriculture, irrigation, and rural infrastructure increased at average
annual rate of 11.7 percent (Figure 3.1).4 In relative terms, total government spending on MAFF, MOWRAM, and
the MRD increased from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to 0.9 percent in 2009, while the total budget for these three
ministries increased from 2.5 percent of agricultural GDP in 2004 to 2.7 percent in 2008. It should be noted that these
figures are low compared with countries at the same income level, as discussed below, although there has been a
strong upward trend. When compared to total government budget, spending on MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD
remained stagnant at around 8 percent during 2004 to 2008 period, indicating that agriculture did not receive more
funding than other sectors.

MOWRAM had the largest increase in the government budget over the 2004 to 2009 period, while the
MRD received the largest cumulative share of government spending. The government budget for MOWRAM

     increased from Real 32.2 billion in 2004 to 174.7 billion in 2009 (an average annual rate of 30 percent in real terms),
     while its share of the total budget for three ministries increased from 20 percent in 2004 to 44 percent in 2009 (Figure
     3.2). The budgets of MAFF and the MRD also increased though much more modestly over the same period at annual
     rate of 4.7 and 3.9 percent respectively in real terms. In fact, the budget share for MRD declined from 51 percent in
     2004 to 36 percent in 2009.

     Total funding for the agriculture, irrigation, and rural roads sectors from both government and donor sources
     increased from Riel 464 billion in 2007 to Riel 644 billion in 2009. This is equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP 5 (Table
     3.1 and Figure 3.3). Donor spending on agriculture, irrigation and rural roads averaged about $50 million per year
     between 2007 and 2009, increasing from Riel 194 billion to Riel 207 billion, albeit at significantly slower rate than
     government spending over the same period. The share of donor funding in total funding decreased from 42 percent
     in 2007 to 32 percent in 2009.

Almost half of this donor funding was spent on agriculture, with the rest being split between irrigation and
roads. Donor spending on rural roads declined over the 2007 and 2009 period, which in turn contributed to the
declining share of donor spending in total spending, while funding levels for agriculture and irrigation have been more
stable (Figure 3.4).

Agricultural producers in Cambodia enjoy a number of tax exemptions, which could be considered as
additional indirect support to the sector. The main source of indirect support to the sector is the exemption
from import duty for fertilizers and tractors. Figure 3.5 presents official customs figures, which may understate the
volumes and values involved as there is a large degree of informal trade in fertilizer markets. According to the official

     customs figures, imports of fertilizer have grown substantially since 2004, both in value and quantity, with a sudden
     jump in 2009. By 2009, nearly 200,000t of fertilizer and over 20,000 tractor units were imported, reflecting the
     renewed interest of the private sector in agricultural production after increased returns in 2007 and 2008. The value
     of imports has increased to over $40million for fertilizer and about $20 million for tractors. Assuming a 20 percent
     tax rate on fertilizer imports (in other words, the same as fuel imports) and a 15 percent tax rate for tractors (in other
     words, the same as for other equipment and machinery), the indirect support given to agricultural producers through
     tax exceptions was about $11 million in 2009, which makes up about 7 percent of total spending and 14 percent of
     government spending on agriculture, irrigation, and rural roads.

     How does Cambodia’s spending on agriculture, irrigation and rural roads compare to spending by other
     countries? International comparisons show that Cambodia spends less on agriculture than other countries when
     spending is measured as a share of agricultural budget in GDP (Table 3.2). Out of ten countries, only two—Indonesia
     and Bangladesh—have equal or lower ratios of public spending on agriculture to GDP, and only Bangladesh has a
     lower ratio of public spending on agriculture to agriculture value added. Public expenditure on R&D, using a broad
     definition, for Cambodia is relatively low, at only 0.1 percent of agricultural GDP compared with 0.2 to 0.6 percent
     elsewhere in Asia.

     International experience suggests that higher public spending does not always translate into higher
     agricultural growth.6 Comparing year-on-year changes, public sector spending on agriculture, irrigation, and rural
     roads seems to have little correlation with agricultural GDP growth in Cambodia. While public investment ranged
     between 2.3 and 2.7 percent of agricultural GDP between 2004 and 2008, agricultural GDP growth ranged from
     -0.9 percent up to 15.7 percent over the same period. This indicates that changes in agricultural GDP in Cambodia
     have less to do with the relative levels of public spending than other factors such as climate.

     On the other hand, international experience shows that expenditures on public goods, such as agricultural
     research, extension, and farmer education and training and rural infrastructure do help to increase agricultural
     growth and competitiveness. In fact, quality of expenditures is equally if not more important than the relative levels

of public resources spent. Clearly, spending in some areas and activities will generate higher economic and social
returns than in others. For example, in allocating public funds for agriculture, many governments have chosen to
spend their agricultural budgets on subsidies for private farm inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, while spending
far less on rural infrastructure and technology development. Yet international evidence suggests that returns to
private input subsidies are typically lower than returns to investments in public goods. This is in part because private
input subsidies are prone to encourage rent-seeking and in part because public input subsidies substitute for private
financing of these private inputs. For example, Lopes et al (2006) empirically document that the government’s decision
to subsidize either private or public goods has negative consequences for economic development. Furthermore,
analytical evidence shows that expenditures on private goods in many cases have negative returns due to high levels
of corruption, the crowding out of private input purchases, resource misallocation, and consequent inefficiencies in
input use. For example, estimates from 15 Latin American studies indicate that a 1 percent increase in the budget
share for agricultural input subsidies reduces per capita agricultural income by 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent (Lopez,
2005).

Changes in macroeconomic conditions or agriculture policies also have an important impact on sectoral
growth rates. Cambodia has maintained conducive and relatively distortions free policy environment, which have
encouraged significant growth of private sector investments. This could indicate that: (a) the agriculture sector in
Cambodia has the potential to yield high returns on investments and (b) Cambodia’s investments in the agriculture
sector, both government and donor, may have been relatively efficient.

In Cambodia, public spending on agriculture has been allocated to public goods and services, and the
government should be commended for this. While Cambodia was able to achieve high agricultural GDP growth
rates with low levels of public spending, maintaining these growth rates would require eventually more and better
public spending to maintain current growth rates and to reduce the variability of growth due to weather-related
shocks.

However, there is a need to achieve a clearer understanding of the impact of the levels and composition of
public expenditures on agricultural growth. Recognizing that the tight fiscal space makes it difficult to implement
a dramatic increase in public spending levels any time soon makes it even more important to ensure that public
expenditures for agricultural development are efficient. Chapter 5 of this report discusses the specific expenditures
that have had the greatest impact on agricultural growth in Cambodia.



B. Economic Composition of Sector Budgets

Analyzing the economic composition of the budget is the first step in determining the allocative efficiency
of public expenditures. In determining the economic composition of public spending on agriculture, irrigation, and
rural roads in Cambodia, expenditures must first be classified into recurrent and capital expenditures. Recurrent
expenditures are then further divided into salaries and operating costs. The recurrent expenditure data used in this
analysis are budgets for entire ministries. This is not a problem with respect to MAFF and MOWRAM since their
ministry budgets are aligned with agriculture and irrigation activities respectively. However, for the MRD, this is less
satisfactory since the ministry also deals with rural water supply, rural sanitation, and community development. We
therefore estimated that about 40 percent of the MRD’s total recurrent budget is allocated to rural roads.
20                                                     THE AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION, AND RURAL ROADS SECTORS: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW




     The analysis of total government recurrent and capital budgets provides a basis for evaluating spending on
     agriculture. The total government recurrent budget increased from Riels 1,215 billion in 2000 to Riels 4,439 billion
     in 2009, an average annual increase of 10.1 percent. The total government capital budget became increasingly
     important over the same period, growing from Riels 297 billion in 2004 to Riels 1,019 billion in 2009. Appropriations
     to the government’s capital budget have increased each year, growing at an annual average rate of 17 percent in real
     terms between 2004 and 2008.

     Recurrent funding makes up about one-third of total government spending on agriculture, irrigation, and rural
     roads. MAFF has consistently had the largest recurrent budget among the three ministries, with its expenditure rising
     from Riels 23,415 million in 2000 to Riels 78,192 million in 2009, an average annual increase of 14.7 percent. The large
     share of recurrent budget in the total budget reflects the service provider functions of MAFF compared whereas the
     other two ministries are mainly responsible for rural infrastructure development. MOWRAM had the smallest share
     of recurrent budget, rising from Riels 6,199 million in 2000 to Riels 31,352 million in 2009, an annual average growth
     of 20.6 percent. The MRD experienced the highest recurrent budget growth, rising from Riels 7,550 million in 2000
     to Riels 54,596 million in 2009, an average of 29.8 percent annually (about 40 percent of the MRD’s total recurrent
     budget is allocated to rural roads)

     Operating costs make up the largest share of the government recurrent budget, while the share of wages
     has remained modest. During the 2000 to 2006 period, the share of operating costs in total budget was 41 percent
     for MAFF, 74 percent for MOWRAM, and 58 percent for the MRD. The higher figures for MOWRAM and the MRD
     reflect the infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance responsibilities of those ministries. The share of wages and
     salaries during the same period was 26 percent for MAFF, 18 percent for MOWRAM, and 16 percent for the MRD,
     which highlights the general problem of low salary levels in public service.

     The low level of wage provision in recurrent budgets is a concern for the sustainability of public service
     provision functions. One of the functions of the recurrent budget is to balance the wage and operating components.
     The wage component should consist of sufficient resources to employ and retain adequate numbers of qualified
     staff, while the non-wage component should provide resources so that a trained and motivated workforce can
     deliver public services effectively and efficiently. Typically, the distribution of financial resources between salaries
     and operating costs in more advanced economies is around 60 or 70 percent to around 40 or 30 percent. If these
     proportions become out of balance, there is a risk that the agency in question will become unstable and ineffective. It
     might become difficult to recruit, retain, and motivate staff if salaries are too low, while inadequate operating budgets
     make it impossible to deliver planned work programs. This would apply particularly to extension services in those
     provinces where there is no donor support.

     It is common in developing countries for staff to have little operating budget despite their very low salaries.
     The low salary/low operating budget scenario is also common across ministries in Cambodia. The solution is not
     simply to recommend that salaries be increased in isolation. Macro fiscal analysis is needed to establish whether
     there is any fiscal space for this and, indeed, whether it should really be the top priority for the use of scarce fiscal
     resources. These issues are also bound up in public administration reform, which is being handled by the Council for
     Administrative Reform, and are outside the mandates of the line ministries.

     There have been large increases in government capital spending during the 2000s. In 2009, capital spending
     made up about 64 percent of total government spending for the three line ministries, up from 55 percent in 2007.
     The MRD and MOWRAM have been priority recipients of the increased appropriations to the government financed

capital budget over the past five years. MOWRAM’s capital expenditure increased from Riels 17.9 billion in 2004
to Riels 148.7 billion in 2009 (Figure 3.6). The MRD’s capital expenditure increased from Riels 53.3 billion in 2007
to Riels 87,559 billion in 2009. In the case of both ministries, the government capital budget has grown to be larger
than their recurrent budgets, making up about 80 percent of their total government provided budget. Capital budget
expenditures for MAFF are very low, which reflects its role as a service provider rather than an infrastructure provider.
In 2009, its capital budget was only 4 percent of the total budget.

The capital budgets of the three ministries combined have accounted for around 30 percent of total capital
expenditure in Cambodia in some years. MOWRAM’s share peaked at 21 percent in 2006, and despite a large
absolute increase in 2009, it had declined to 15 percent of the total. The MRD’s share of the total also declined from
a peak of 22 percent in 2004 to 19 percent in 2009. It should be noted that the combined ratio of capital expenditure
to recurrent expenditure for MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD was 151 percent in 2009, compared to 23 percent in
the case of total government capital and recurrent expenditures, which further illustrates the high share of capital
expenditures in the budgets of MOWRAM and the MRD.

Are the current balances between recurrent and capital expenditures optimal? As we will see from the analysis
of Chapter 5, the answer is probably no. In the irrigation sector, operating and maintenance budgets (O&M) cover only
a fraction of the sector’s total maintenance needs. In 2009, O&M accounted only 14 percent of the total recurrent
budget, up from 10 percent in 2007, which is equivalent to $1 million for the whole country. Even these limited
funds are used mainly for pumping rather than for maintenance. The situation is similar in the roads sector where
government provision for O&M was only 31 percent of the recurrent budget in 2009 (some $4 million), which is about
20 to 30 percent of what is needed to maintain rural road network to adequate standards.7

The government has been trying to address the issue of underfunding for rural infrastructure maintenance
in a variety of ways. In irrigation, government policy makes Farmer Water User Committees (FWUCs) responsible
for O&M expenditures over a five-year transition period, during which time the FWUCs receive training and technical

     support. However, much international experience as well as experience from Cambodia suggests that this approach
     has not generated the expected degree of maintenance by end users. As for roads, the funds for maintenance
     are used mainly for gasoline and gravel. Routine and periodic maintenance is carried out by staff of the provincial
     departments of the MRD. The MRD has a stock of medium and small-sized vehicles from various projects that are
     used to carry out maintenance, and no vehicles have been bought for O&M from the MRD’s capital budget (see
     Annex D for details of the central and provincial recurrent budgets).



     C. The Functional Composition of Sector Budgets

     Analyzing sectoral expenditures by functional areas gave us a clearer sense of how government and donor
     spending is related to sectoral development goals and constraints. We assembled data on functional areas by
     disaggregating departmental-level budget data at the central MAFF level for 2007 to 2009. No disaggregated data are
     available at the provincial level. During the period of 2007 to 2009, the central MAFF budget constituted 65 percent
     of the total MAFF recurrent budget, the rest going to the provinces. We assumed for the analysis that the structure
     of the central and the provincial budget is likely to be similar. We aggregated data from 23 budget units within MAFF
     into 11 primary functional spending areas.

     The majority of government agriculture expenditures between 2007 and 2009 were concentrated on policy
     and planning, forestry, and agricultural education/training (57 percent). Only 5 percent of the budget was spent
     on agricultural extension and research (Table 3.3). The largest budget allocation increases during this period were for
     livestock/ veterinary services and for policy and planning.

     At the same time, donors have concentrated on providing assistance to agricultural extension, which made up
     some 31 percent of total donor funding, followed by agro-industry (15 percent), and fisheries (14 percent).8 Agricultural
     research was one of the functional areas that received the smallest share of donor funds (3 percent), along with
     agricultural machinery and rubber production.

Taking government and donor spending together, agricultural extension and policy and planning are the
two functional areas that received the largest shares of total funding (18 and 16 percent respectively). In total,
agricultural extension and research received 22 percent of total expenditure. This shows that government extension
services would find it difficult to operate without donor support. Services would have to be scaled back from the
current five extension agents per district to two. Fisheries (13 percent) and forestry (10 percent), both of which have
donor-supported sector plans in place, continue to be major beneficiaries under, though forestry receives a lower
share of donor support than of the government budget. Agricultural machinery, research, and rubber production
received the lowest share (7 percent total). During the 2007 to 2009 period, agro-industry had the largest increase in
budget allocations, while rubber production, agricultural machinery and agronomy, and land improvements had the
largest declines. Figure 3.7 presents the spending shares for government and donor funds by functional areas.

As see from the above, the agriculture sector in Cambodia relies heavily on donor funds, although there are
some functional areas where the government provides the majority of funding. Overall, the ratio of government
to total consolidated funding for the agriculture sector stood at 41 percent in 2007, 43 percent in 2008, and 46 percent
in 2009 (Figure 3.8). This ratio has been improving but the government is still dependent on donors for the majority
of sector funding. As noted above, areas such as agricultural extension and agro-industry receive very little funding

24                                                     THE AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION, AND RURAL ROADS SECTORS: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW




     from the government, and are therefore dependent on donor resources for the majority of their resource flows.
     The government’s contributions to agricultural extension, agricultural research, agronomy and land improvement,
     livestock and veterinary, agro-industry, and fisheries are all less than 50 percent.

     Why has government funding been so low for some functional areas and so high for others? A number of
     factors may be at play. Government funding may be low because it does not see these areas as priorities, perhaps
     because of a perception that returns to public investments in those areas will be low. Alternatively, it could be a
     rational response to the fact that donors are allocating more resources to these functional areas based on their agency
     priorities, thus allowing the government to reallocate its scarce funds to other functional areas that would otherwise
     have been underfunded. The indications are that both elements may be in play. Until recently, the MEF had been
     skeptical about the effectiveness of and returns to agricultural research and extension expenditures. On the other
     hand, donors have not just been filling gaps but have deliberately emphasized research and extension because they
     anticipated favorable returns, a view which is supported by some international as well as local evidence. However,
     the government’s perceptions may be changing as indicated by the increase in spending on agricultural extension in
     the 2011 budget.

     Over-dependence on donor funding has a number of implications. The first is related to the lack of fiscal
     sustainability as there is uncertainty about the duration of donors’ funding commitments to various functional areas
     or to the sector in general. Donors have increasingly been taking a longer-term view of their support, but there are still
     time limits on any donor’s funding commitments. Secondly, unless a sector is supported by the government budget,
     donor support means establishing parallel project-based financing and management systems. Donor accountability
     requirements mean a proliferation of PMUs, which often operate outside government structures and which have
     incentives to attract skilled staff away from the public sector. The PMUs distract both resources and attention away
     from the core business of government. And there are no procedures requiring all donors to provide the government
     with the necessary information to capture their financing in line agency budgets, which would remain a key challenge
     for achieving government’s budget comprehensiveness and transparency. Third, the timing of donor funding is less
     predictable than government funding, and this can lead to funding gaps, which can add to uncertainty.

     Unlike the situation in the agriculture sector, the government provides the majority of funding for irrigation
     and rural roads. During the three years from 2007 to 2009, the government provided 72 percent of the resource
     flows to the irrigation sector, which signifies the high priority given to this sector on the national development
     agenda. Similarly, the government provided some 74 percent of funding for rural roads during the same time period
     (78 percent in 2009) (Figure 3.9).

     Both MOWRAM and the MRD command a sizable share of the government’s capital budget, specifically
     29 percent during the 2004 to 2009 period. Detailed departmental data are not available for MOWRAM or the
     MRD, which makes it difficult to analyze the ministries’ budget provisions by functional areas. The Department of
     Engineering within MOWRAM is well equipped to carry out construction and rehabilitation work in the irrigation
     sector. However, the limited funding available for capital expenditures has meant that civil works have had to be
     carried out in phases, with the highest priority given to the construction or rehabilitation of primary channels, leaving
     the work on secondary and tertiary structures for later when and if funds become available. This piecemeal approach
     has limited the effectiveness of public funds as discussed in Chapter 4. In roads, capital spending has focused on
     rehabilitating national and rural roads under the Department of Rural Roads. While most government-funded capital
     work on rural roads is carried out by state sub-contractors, donor-funded rehabilitation work tends to be done by
     private sector contractors.

An additional source of capital funds for rehabilitation of rural roads comes from Commune Sangkat Fund
(CSF). Some 90 percent of CSF funds are used for infrastructure, of which historically about 80 percent has been spent
on rural roads. The CSF is financed by a sub-decree that provides for a fixed annual allocation of government domestic
revenues. This fixed amount was 2.8 percent of domestic revenues in 2009. The CSF funds are complemented by
various donor funds. In 2009, funds channeled through the CSF for use by communes reached $27.0 million.

Summary. In agriculture, shortfalls in domestic operating budgets for research and extension have been
covered by donors. Donor funding for agriculture in Cambodia has given priority to agricultural services and has
helped to fill domestic funding gaps particularly for agricultural extension. However, there may be disadvantages to
this very extensive dependence on donor funding related to the sustainability and predictability of fund flows and the
diversion of skilled workers from the government to donor projects. There may be a need for some rebalancing of the
government/donor relationship in this area.

One solution might be to adopt a programmatic or sector-wide approach that would require donor projects
to operate through government channels. Some other improvements might include: (a) bringing donor aid more
closely into the government’s planning and budgeting processes; (b) recording donor spending more explicitly in
government accounts (or at least alongside the government accounts); and (c) requiring donors to report and be
accountable to the relevant national ministry. There is also a need to consider whether the approaches, levels of
input, and cost structures in the donor-funded sectors are compatible with the government eventually taking over
financing responsibility for thse areas.

The government has provided high levels of domestic capital spending to rehabilitate physical infrastructure
in the irrigation and rural roads sectors over last decade. However, there is a room to increase the effectiveness
of this capital spending on irrigation since it has mainly been used to build or rehabilitate primary infrastructure such
as water storage facilities. Since many farmers are still unable to use such infrastructure, this has negatively affected
the returns to these investments.

Furthermore, while impressive amounts of infrastructure assets have built in both sectors, the emphasis on
rehabilitation and new construction has limited the amount of resources available to maintain and preserve

     the quality of those assets. Therefore, a rebalancing of domestic capital and maintenance budgets is required in
     order to increase the efficiency of this spending.

     The policy of exempting fertilizer and farm machinery from import duties provides additional support
     to the sector in the amount of $11 million, which makes up about 14 percent of government spending on
     agriculture, irrigation, and rural roads. The government should be commended for providing this additional support
     to agriculture.

4. Budget Process and Performance


The budget processes for MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD are governed by the systems put in place by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). Since 2005, the government has engaged in a comprehensive program
of Public Finance Management (PFM) reform through its long-term (2005 15) Public Finance Management Reform
Program (PFMRP). The PFMRP provides the direction for the development of PFM systems.

The Medium-term Macro Framework (MTMF) and the Medium-term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) provide
the planning framework for macroeconomic and inter-sectoral resource allocations within which line
ministries have to operate. The MTEF allocates the global resource envelope between sectors or administrative
units (in other words, line ministries) and between the wage and non-wage elements of the ministry budgets. The
MEF first introduced guidelines on the preparation of the ministry Budget Strategic Plans (BSPs) 9 by line ministries
in 2007. Within MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD, the BSP process is managed jointly by the Department of
Planning and Finance of each ministry. The BSP is essentially the bottom-up component of the MTEF system for
allocating resources between sectors and ministries and is used by MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD to prepare their
medium-term and annual expenditure plans. The BSPs have a programmatic structure based on the identification of
organizational objectives, budget activities, output targets, and indicators for ministry spending.

Despite some progress, the links between the NSDP, the MTEF/BSPs, and the annual budget remain weak.
The recurrent, capital, and donor budgets are not yet fully integrated into the BSPs. For example, externally financed
spending is only partially captured in the government budget and is not classified according to the government chart
of accounts. Also, the current BSPs have some weaknesses relating to the low levels of application of program
expenditures and the inadequate specification of objectives, targets, and indicators. This is due to a combination
of weak guidelines and supervision from the center and to capacity constraints in the line departments. To be fully
effective, the BSPs need to reflect all public sector resource flows to a sector, whether from the government or
donors. At the moment, the BSPs only capture government resources, and this is a major weakness given the high
volume of donor aid. One of the difficulties in incorporating donor funds into the BSPs is the fact that donor projects
are run by project management units (PMU) that are separate from and independent of the institutional mainstream
of the ministries. As a result, the Departments of Planning and Finance have no authority over them. Only MOWRAM
has made some progress in this area by consolidating the PMUs within its functional remit [check] into two or three
central Project Management Offices (PMOs).

Both MAFF and the MRD are involved in the piloted introduction of Program Budgets (PBs) that began in
2007. The PB system, which is intended to provide more budget detail and more transparency, replaced the previous
system of Priority Action Programs (PAPs) in 2007, but the system is still in the early stage of development. In the
case of MAFF, the PB still applies to only 18 percent of the recurrent budget even after three years of piloting (see
Annex C). This can be attributed to a combination of weak capacity and a lack of guidelines in the line departments
in this area. In the MRD, PBs account for nearly 50 percent of the total recurrent budget, with 70 percent of PB
allocations being allocated to rural roads maintenance. MOWRAM is not yet involved in the PB pilot.

PBs that are prepared as part of the BSP are intended to increase the relevance and improve the performance
of public expenditure in a number of ways. The traditional kind of budgeting process is not explicitly based on the

     government’s policy objectives and priorities. In contrast, the PBs align the resource allocation process more closely
     with policy priorities. While Sector-wide Approaches (SWAps) are intended ambitiously to be “sector wide,” PBs are
     focused on a single area of policy activity, which makes them easier to manage.

     However, the problems that stand in the way of improved budgeting are systemic and are to some extent
     beyond the control of the line ministries. There are distorted incentives inherent in the PB system. This is because
     under the current system, non-program PBs are less structured and less demanding in terms of the specification
     of activities, outputs, targets, and indicators and are therefore allow ministries more flexibility in dealing with short-
     term, unanticipated needs. The MEF, which is responsible for the PFM, is working to improve the budgeting systems
     through the PFMRP. The ten-year PFMRP timetable recognizes quite realistically that it will take time to deliver these
     reforms.

     A major deficiency in the current budgeting process is the lack of a coherent departmental budgeting and
     financial reporting system. The departments of MAFF are provided with annual budgets, but all transactions have
     to be approved centrally. The system for monitoring and reporting expenditures and results by technical departments
     on an ongoing basis is, therefore, very opaque. A transparent system that would allow individual departments to be
     held to account is vital as the basis for the functional planning and monitoring of resource use.

     Another element in any future solution to improve resource planning lies with donors. The donor community
     understands the desirability of moving away from projects towards a more programmatic approach. This is clear
     from the support that donors have given to the preparation of the Strategy for Agriculture and Water (SAW) and
     its five programs. However, the transition to programs should be coordinated with the current development by the
     government of budget planning and management instruments, including and especially the BSPs. The donors and
     the government should prepare to map the way forward for this transition.

     Since 2000, donors have led initiatives to introduce SWAPs as a way to improve the budgeting process
     in the health and education sectors in Cambodia. They were motivated by the realization that new and more
     comprehensive approaches were needed both to provide more holistic sector planning and to bring all donor resource
     flows under one coherent sector policy and strategy framework. The health and education sector SWAPs have been
     reasonably successful in terms of providing sound policy and strategy frameworks. They have also been successful in
     positioning the government as the lead partner and in persuading donors to locate their resources within a common
     sector planning framework. Having donors adopt common financial and implementation arrangements has been
     more difficult, although a degree of joint planning and monitoring activity has been achieved. However, channeling
     donor resources through government systems to save on transaction costs and to stem the loss of skilled personnel
     from the government to PMUs has not yet been generally accepted by most donors because of fiduciary risks.

     What has been the budget execution performance of MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD? It was only possible
     for us to analyze the execution of the government recurrent budget. This is because domestically funded capital
     expenditures are not allocated to specific ministries. Instead, in accordance with the Budget Law, they appear as a
     single line item, to be apportioned by the Prime Minister to line ministries during the year.

     Overall, between 2000 and 2009, MAFF and MOWRAM were within 5 percent of budget in only four years out
     of nine and the MRD in only one year out of nine. The budget execution rate for MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD
     reflects some under-spending during earlier years when the government’s unpredictable revenue position led to
     difficulties with cash flow budgeting (Figure 4.1). Deviations from the original budget allocations were greatest during

How consistent are government and donor spending priorities with programmatic spending budgets? Actual
government spending on agriculture and irrigation deviates from the projected costings set out in its strategies
(Table 4.1). Comparing the ASSDP and SAW costings with government and donor spending reveals that research
and extension were under-funded, while forestry, market access for agricultural products, and irrigation were over-
funded. The amounts actually provided for the institutional and legislative framework and for forestry reform were
close to the amounts projected in the ASSDP. Compared with SAW costings, actual spending on investments in
irrigation appears to have been substantially above what was projected in 2005. It should be noted that most of the
projections in these strategies refer to investment costs only, which have been matched by government capital and
donor project funding over a common three-year time frame. The analysis is complicated by the fact that the ASSDP
and SAW include substantial allocations for food security, for which there is no single operational responsibility within
the government.10

10	 Some of the activities in the food security programs can be assigned to research, extension, and/or crop production. However, a large
    part of the ASSDP is assigned to scaling up the National Program for Food Security and Poverty Alleviation (NPFSPA), which supports
    community-based development with no pre-assigned sub-sectoral allocations.

     Summary

     The ministries’ Budget Strategic Plans (BSPs) have the potential to be the key policy and budget planning
     tool for allocating and managing all resources among and within sectors. The BSPs should become a central
     planning tool for the implementation of SAW and should cover both domestically financed budget allocations and
     donor allocations. The annual budget process would also be strengthened by requiring MAFF, MOWRAM, and the
     MRD to assign “hard” and enforceable budgets to each department through the BSPs. The current system of partial
     program budgets should be absorbed into a departmentally based approach covering all resources allocated to a
     department.

     There is a need to introduce transparent reporting of expenditures for monitoring the performance of
     activities financed by the budget. At the moment, the MEF Treasury system records expenditures only by economic
     classification but not on a departmental or functional basis.

     We suggest that a joint government/development partner annual review and planning process should be
     introduced for the annual and medium-term budget process that puts BSPs at the heart of the process. The
     government and donors have already succeeded in putting in place an agreed sector plan—SAW and its program
     design document for 2010-2013. At the same time, progress has been made in developing budget planning processes
     within the government. The three-year rolling Medium-term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) is actively predicting
     and guiding resource flows to priority sectors within the government. The BSPs, introduced in 2007, should become
     the central planning tool for the implementation of SAW. To encourage devolution of expenditure responsibility to
     departments, we recommend expanding TOFE under the MEF Treasury system. Absorbing SAW into the sector
     budgets will require it to be coordinated with and integrated into the budget planning and management instruments
     that have been put in place under the PFMRP. The donors, in consultation with the government, are preparing to
     map the way forward, and this should be done as a joint government/donor activity. The SAW initiatives present an
     opportunity to establish systems to ensure more regular and informative appraisal, monitoring, and evaluations and
     for these to be linked into budgeting decisions. Annex J presents one possible approach to improving the linkages
     between budgets and the strategic programs in the SAW under joint government/donor supervision.

5. The Efficiency and Effectiveness of Expenditures in the Agriculture,
Irrigation, and Rural Road Sectors

The analysis of how public resources are spent and of the impact of those resources is particularly important
for low-income country, such as Cambodia, with limited budget resources and high dependence on donor
aid. For the purposes of this PER, the performance of the government in achieving its objectives is measured in terms
of crop production, of increased incomes of the immediate beneficiaries of public expenditure, and of reductions in
expenditure. Most of the SAW objectives for research, extension, and irrigation involve increasing the incomes and
livelihoods of farmer beneficiaries. In the case of rural roads, the immediate objectives are to increase the incomes of
farmers and to reduce prices and costs of transport as well as the wider objectives of promoting growth and reducing
poverty. Based on the results of this analysis, we make some recommendations for increasing the effectiveness and
efficiency of public expenditures on the agriculture, irrigation, and rural roads sectors in the future.

The chapter presents a sequence of analytical steps that form the building blocks of a comprehensive
analysis of public expenditures. We begin with a discussion of outputs and outcomes achieved as a result of
public expenditures, both by the government and donors. We then assess the unit costs of these outputs and
their trends over the past decade, which yields information about the efficiency of resource use. We then estimate
the effectiveness of public spending using the techniques of cost-benefit analysis (CBA), identifying areas where
performance could be improved and additional benefits achieved for the lowest possible cost. In order to complement
data that were obtained from secondary sources, the study team carried out a rapid field survey to confirm the
analytical results. The survey provided us with detailed information about farmers’ perceptions about the benefits
and constraints of public service provision in the extension, irrigation, and rural road sub-sectors. (Annex F provides
summary of the field survey and Annex G a summary of case studies in Cambodia.) The chapter then concludes with
the results of an illustrative simulation analysis that estimates the impact of various expenditure scenarios on GDP
growth. However, it is important to recognize that the analysis of effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures
is a complex task that is complicated by the limited information basis in Cambodia. As such, the results should be
treated as indicative.



A. Outputs and Outcomes achieved in the Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors

Outputs are defined as the immediate results from government-executed activities, which would be under
its control. The outputs achieved are estimated using the available management records for MAFF, MOWRAM, and
the MRD, most of which are compiled in the annual reports for each ministry. No independent verification of these
data is available at national scale. The outputs reflect the indicators chosen by departments of the three ministries,
which track results of their main activities. These indicators are appropriate, and reporting in most cases has been
well organized. The analysis of agricultural research is constrained by lack of systematic and reliable information on
outputs and costs, and will be therefore excluded from the analysis of efficiency and effectiveness. The discussion
below summarizes the main outputs and outcomes achieved in agriculture, irrigation and rural roads sectors (see
Tables 5.1 and 5.2).

Agricultural Extension

Extension outcomes are closely associated with the adoption of improved farm management practices.
The model used in Cambodia is for extension officers to train lead farmers who are then expected to contact other
farmers. The key output variable associated with extension performance is thus the adoption rate per extension
worker and subsequent diffusion rate among farmers. The MAFF/DEA extension service typically contacts between
25,000 and 40,000 farmers a year, which amounts to between 1 and 2 percent of all farmers in Cambodia. Over
2002 to 2009 period, the total number of farmers contacted amounted to nearly 10 percent of all farmers, although
it is likely that many contacts were repeat contacts. Extension outputs are well defined and relatively continuous,
although with some large spikes and gaps in outputs, reflecting the lumpiness of project activities. However, there
is no clear trend in the outputs.

The evidence from field survey confirms that most farmers obtained extension messages from other
farmers, suggesting that diffusion is indeed active. Furthermore, the evidence from Cambodia shows that about
half farmers who have been contacted by extension officers adopt some form of improved farm practices, although
about half of these adoptions are partial. The field survey found that over 90 percent of farmers were aware of DAE
extension services, including farmers living in “non-extension” villages that were not covered by DAE extension
activities. The adoption rate of extension messages, including partial adoption, was found to be 71 percent in villages
visited by DAE extension officers and about 45 percent in non-extension villages (i.e. between 67 and 87 percent of
all adopters adopt extension messages at least in part). The survey provides evidence of the importance of indirect
contact—i.e. 61 percent of farmers reported obtaining extension advice from other farmers in their villages, while
37 percent obtained advice directly from DAE extension officers, and 36 percent obtained advice from NGOs. The
field survey confirmed also a relatively high satisfaction rate among farmers with DEA extension services. Farmers
reported an average yield increase of 31 percent as a result of adopting extension messages.

According to the field survey, most common messages received by farmers were for: rice farming (71 percent
of households), fertilizer use (68 percent), pest management (65 percent) and compost making (59 percent).
Over 40 percent of farmers also benefited from assistance with vegetables, sustainable rice intensification (SRI), and
livestock and water management, while about 20 percent of farmers benefited from assistance with post harvest,
cash crop and organic farming techniques. However, the majority (66 percent) of farmers reported that extension
messages were difficult to understand, while 51 percent said that there was too little training, and 39 percent said
that there was a lack of experiments and demonstration work. This suggests that the level of extension activity in
villages is too thinly spread. Yet, only 11 to 13 percent of farmers reported problems associated with the lack of
experience and skills of extension workers, supporting the view that good field capacity exists in DAE extension
services.



Irrigation

The main output indicator used by MOWRAM is the area of new land irrigated as a result of its activities.
Figures are reported separately for dry and wet season areas, which are very different in terms of water use and
impact on yields. The incremental area rehabilitated each year has averaged about 5 percent of the total irrigated
area, which means that over last eight years MOWRAM has probably rehabilitated about 40 percent of the total
irrigated area in Cambodia. The proportion of area rehabilitated is slightly higher for dry season irrigation than for wet
season. However, total irrigated area is variable on year-to-year basis. The data presented by MOWRAM does not
34                                                            THE AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION, AND RURAL ROADS SECTORS: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW




     specify the proportion of the area that is actually cultivated. The results of the field survey suggest that there are
     many schemes in which actual irrigated area is smaller than total command area. For example, MAFF figures indicate
     that the average annual increase in dry season irrigation was about 4.6 percent from 2002 to 2009, compared to 7.5
     percent of MOWRAM figures. This suggests that only about 60 percent of the new area reported by MOWRAM
     may be actually under cultivation.11 The Cambodian Irrigation Schemes Information System (CISIS) contains data for
     command areas and cultivated areas for about 70 of the 710 schemes entered in the database. These data suggest
     that almost all wet season irrigated area and about 87 percent of dry season area is actually cultivated.

     The field survey results also indicate that by far the main issue associated with irrigation is lack of water
     (reported by 85 percent of farmers). Lack of distribution canals and water diversion were also important (48 percent
     and 39 percent) emphasizing the problems associated with partial rehabilitation of schemes. Poor management of
     water allocation was mentioned by 36 percent of farmers and lack of maintenance by 25 percent. Lack of funding
     and cooperation were less significant problems and lack of labor was reported as a problem by only 4 percent of
     farmers.



     Rural Roads

     The MRD’s 2007 Rural Road Strategic Plan (RRSP) suggests that 84 percent of rural roads are in poor or bad
     condition, based on a road condition survey in 2002. The RRSP estimated that it would require an investment of
     $314 million to bring all rural roads to good condition and that the annual costs of maintenance would be $17.2 million,
     including both periodic and routine maintenance. However, much has been achieved since 2002. The MRD data
     show an increasing trend in the number of kilometers of road rehabilitation, with large increases in 2008 and 2009.
     On average about 1 percent of all rural roads were rehabilitated each year, with about 1.3 percent benefiting from
     periodic maintenance and 1 percent receiving routine maintenance. The Commune Database provides additional
     indication of the extent of the achievements in rehabilitation of rural roads. Although the database is based on
     subjective assessments, there are some encouraging indications of improvements that suggest that only 37 percent
     of rural roads may have been in poor condition in 2008, which translates into required rehabilitation cost of $133
     million. The Commune Database also reports plans to build an additional 7,668km of new rural roads at a total cost
     of over $100 million.

     The field survey shows that farmers perceive highest benefits from improved roads coming from improved
     roads (in 1 to 4 scale) to improved access to hospitals and schools (3.4), followed by time savings (3.0).
     Increased volume of traders and general economic activities were also rated highly (2.9 3.0). Reduced transportation
     cost was rated less highly perhaps because (fuel) transport costs have risen sharply in recent years, which have
     partially offset gains from improved roads. The survey also asked farmers to estimate the scale of benefits and
     concluded that travel times were reduced by over 50 percent, costs of motorbike travel by 15 percent, and cost of
     travel by cars and lorries by 41 percent. On the other hand, the field survey states the poor quality of roads, due
     to lack of maintenance, as a main issue related to rural roads (80 percent of respondents), and less than half the
     respondents expected the benefits of the road rehabilitation works to be sustained.




     11	 The MAFF figures for dry season irrigation are higher than the MOWRAM figures, suggesting that the MAFF data cover areas that are not
         recorded by MOWRAM. MAFF does not report wet season irrigation, which is complicated by the variety of practices used for agricultural
         water management in the wet season.

Agricultural Extension

The typical model of government extension activities in Cambodia is where extension workers generally
work intensively with a small number of lead farmers (typically about 50 per extension officer) and aim to
achieve high adoption rates (i.e. Farmer Field Schools). In general, the cost of government extension workers is
similar to NGOs. The direct annual costs per government and NGO extension officer are less than $1,000 per year.
36                                                     THE AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION, AND RURAL ROADS SECTORS: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW




     However, it can rise up to $20,000 per year for NGO extension officers when all local and international overhead
     costs are included. The average total cost per farmer contacted by the government extension officers was $273,
     including all overhead costs of the Departments of Extension and Crop Production and other project related costs.

     International comparisons are difficult because they tend to report a narrower range of costs and because
     different extension systems define farmer contacts in different ways. For example, Fleischer et al (2002) reported
     costs of only $15 per farmer visited for the national extension project T&V approach in Kenya (2000); $80 $100 for
     a monthly visit system of private extension in Nicaragua (2001); $65 for the Indonesian Farmer Field School (FFS)
     system (1993 99) and $48 for the Philippines IPM farm field school program (1992 97). The Cambodian statistics
     show considerable variations in costs per farmer from year-to-year basis, caused mainly by large changes in outputs.
     However, the trend line for real costs per farmer is flat and shows that, on average throughout the 2004 to 2009
     period, there has been no increase in extension costs per farmer in real terms. However, it is difficult to draw clear
     conclusions on the optimal unit costs and level of farmer extension contact as it involves better understanding of
     issues related to changing extension messages and curriculum, institutional development goals, farmer perceptions
     and household dynamics, which goes beyond the scope of this analysis.



     Irrigation

     The average cost of bringing an additional hectare under irrigation over 2004 to 2009 period was $858, when
     government and donor expenditures are divided by the incremental increase in irrigated area. However, cost
     has increased substantially over this period, and was particularly high in 2009, when it increased nearly threefold to
     over $2,500/ha, partly as a result of the high level of spending by the government. The recent rise in unit costs may
     be partly because the higher MOWRAM expenditures in recent years may not be reflected yet in the increase of
     additional new irrigated areas, which was rather low for 2009. The lower unit costs in early years may be because
     some of the earlier works done by MOWRAM were relatively modest in size but enabled large areas of land to return
     to irrigation, demonstrating increasing marginal cost of irrigation investments as easier schemes are rehabilitated
     first, with subsequent schemes requiring more expensive investments into water storage and transmission systems.
     However, these unit costs compared favorably with the unit cost of $1,500 to $2,000/ha used for budgeting in
     MOWRAM.

     It should be noted that the unit costs of irrigation works in Cambodia still compare favorably with international
     norms. A review of World Bank support for Agricultural Water Management worldwide from 1991 to 2004 (World
     Bank, 2006) reported that the shift from new construction to rehabilitation over the period resulted in a reduction in
     unit costs from $6,600/ha to $2,900/ha. There are also wide variations internationally. A major review of 208 World
     Bank projects (Jones, 1995) estimated an average unit cost of $4,800/ha, with a range from $1,400/ha (South Asia) to
     $18,000/ha for Sub-Saharan Africa. Inocencio et al (2007) update this analysis with a review of 314 irrigation projects,
     estimating average unit costs of about $5,000/ha worldwide, with $8,200/ha for construction and $2,900/ha for
     rehabilitation. The average cost for Southeast Asia was $4,400/ha with $9,700/ha for new construction and $1,800/
     ha for rehabilitation in 2000 prices. Thus these data provide some comforting evidence that irrigation expenditures in
     Cambodia are efficient by international standards.

     The analysis of effectiveness assumes annual maintenance costs of irrigation schemes as $115 per ha,
     which is about 50 percent of total rehabilitation cost on discounted basis. The national guidelines recommend
     contributions from FWUC members of 140 kg/ha for paddy, or about $35 equivalent for dry season irrigation for O&M

costs. There are also costs of water pumping and the private sector typically charges an additional 360 kg of paddy
per hectare for this, which is equivalent to $80.



Rural Roads

The total cost of government-funded rehabilitation of rural roads was estimated as $53,000/km, including
cost of technical support and management. This compares with the current contracting unit costs used by the
MRD of between $30,000 and $45,000 depending on size, location and topography. Surprisingly, the trend line for
the actual costs per km for rural roads has declined in real terms over the period, despite the fact that the unit costs
reported by the MRD have increased by some 50 percent over recent years, notably as a result of increases in the
costs of laterite and fuel. This may be because many road works carried out in early years involved major rehabilitation
and improvement, including for example frequent tree removal (i.e. opposite to irrigation schemes where more
complex works were carried out in later years). Management may also have become more efficient as the MRD has
adopted improved contracting systems and overhead costs have been spread over a larger volume of activity.

Comparisons rural roads unit costs with other countries are complicated due to differences in circumstances,
including topography, construction techniques and road sizes. However, these data suggest that unit costs of
road rehabilitation in Cambodia are high by international standards. For example, the World Bank Vietnam Rural
Transport Project included a condition that roads must cost less than $15,000/km. According to a recent Bank funded
Rural Roads Project Report in India, a $34 billion rural roads spending program succeeded in building 375,000km on
new rural roads and rehabilitating a further 372,000km. Assuming that the ratio of construction to rehabilitation unit
costs was 4:1, the unit rehabilitation cost would be about $18,000 $/km. In Africa, unit costs show a wide variation
from less than $3,000/km in Mozambique to $8,000/km in Uganda and $19,000/km in Ghana. There are a number
of possible reasons for the high costs in Cambodia, including the need for demining in some areas, and the fact
that a large proportion of the roads are in areas that are flooded every year and therefore require large amounts of
construction material.



C. The Effectiveness of Expenditures on the Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors

The analysis of effectiveness measures how the government spends its resources to achieve its sectoral
development objectives, and the value for money it gets for spending those resources. The performance of
the government in achieving its objectives is measured in terms of production volumes, increased farm incomes, and
reduced costs in providing services to intended beneficiaries. This is consistent with the NSDP monitoring indicators,
which include a mix of output and outcome indicators, including cultivated area, rice yield, rice production, irrigated
area and rehabilitated rural roads (RGC, 2008).

The analysis considers the impact of public expenditure on rice production, which is the main crop in
Cambodia and serves as a good proxy for the whole agriculture sector. The choice of rice is justified on the
following grounds: (a) it accounts for about 40 percent of crop value added in Cambodia: (b) it is a crop for which
returns and farmer decisions are reasonably clear and well understood in Cambodia; and (c) it is a crop that has been
a key focus of public spending on research, extension, and irrigation.
38                                                                                               THE AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION, AND RURAL ROADS SECTORS: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW




     In this analysis, the quantification of the benefits from public spending are measured as changes in production
     volumes and in crop gross margins. The effects of public spending on production and crop margins are calculated
     using crop budgets. The effect of rainfall on production is estimated by assuming a best-fit linear relationship between
     rainfall and production. It is assumed that irrigation investments generate higher production and crop margins than
     extension in rainfed conditions. The benefits and production arising from dry season irrigation are higher than for wet
     season irrigation, reflecting the fact that wet season irrigation only involves a marginal increase in yields, whereas dry
     season irrigation makes a crop possible in areas where it would not otherwise be possible to grow a crop. The table
     also shows that the benefits associated with marketing of crops are relatively low compared with the benefits from
     reduced travel time.

     The national data shows that the average annual growth in rice production has been 436,000 tons per year
     from 2002 to 2009. Out of this about 166,000 tons can be attributed to the increase in cultivated area and conversion
     to irrigation, and 74,000 tons to the improvements in rainfall through the period. The remaining 196,000 tons was a
     result of increased yields not associated with irrigation, of which 68,000t can be attributed to increased fertilizer use.
     The remaining annual increase in yields of 128,000 tons was caused by adaptation of improved farming practices
     (Table 5.4). The contribution of extension to increased production is estimated at an average 32,000 tons per year.
     Public expenditure can be credited for the production from the increase in dry season irrigation (60,000 tons per
     year) and for the production from conversion from rainfed to wet season irrigation (28,000 tons per year). Public
     expenditures can be thus attributed to an average annual increase of 120,000 tons of production, which is about
     28 percent of the total production increase.

     Note: Increased production due to expansion of dry season irrigation and conversion of rainfed wet season to irrigation, is estimated from MOWRAM figures, assuming
     MAFF average yields for the period. Expansion of wet season rainfed area is taken from MAFF figures, assuming average yields for the period. The impact of improved
     weather since 2005 is calculated by linear correlation of total production with total rainfed. Because the correlation is not linear, this creates unrealistic annual results, but
     the average response is more reliable. Fertilizer impact is based on import figures and crop budgets for yield impact.




     The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was carried out to estimate the net benefits generated by public expenditures.
     The key assumptions of the CBA are presented in Table 5.5. The CBA calculates benefit-cost ratios (BCRs), which
     present the discounted net benefits generated for every unit of expenditure incurred (i.e. present value of future
     steam of benefits and costs) based on prevailing market prices at a given year. The advantage of BCRs approach
     is that it can be applied to both capital and to recurrent expenditures, making it possible to compare infrastructure
     sectors with service delivery sectors. The BCRs are calculated using a discount rate of 6 percent. BCR of 1 indicates

Note: BCRs were calculated as discounted net benefits generated for every unit of expenditure incurred, which includes both capital and recurrent expenditure. This makes it possible to compare infrastructure
sectors, such as rural roads, with those delivering public services, such as extension. The BCRs were calculated for each year, based on actual trend of unit costs of a year and expected benefit stream valued at
market prices. The bar chart compares the BCRs for each year to potential BCRs that would have been theoretically achieved if the performance of public expenditure had met its stated targets or if there would
have been a balance between rehabilitation and maintenance expenditures. For example, BCR for extension is calculated by assuming the average actual diffusion rate of 3 farmers per extension worker per visit,
while potential BCR was calculated by assuming average diffusion rate of 5 farmers per extension worker per visit, which is a target set by Department of Extension of MAFF     .

     Since 2007, public expenditures on agricultural extension have resulted in attractive returns, while returns
     to irrigation investments have remained low (Figure 5.2). Performance of public expenditures in extension and
     irrigation was close to 1 from 2000 to 2006, suggesting that public spending generated little or no net benefit to
     Cambodia in that period. The poor performance of public spending on irrigation, even after the increase in prices
     since 2007, is puzzling. It may indicate disproportionate expenditure spending on rehabilitating irrigation schemes
     with poor or little maintenance operations. With a better targeting of public funds on better schemes it should be
     possible to significantly increase the returns from public expenditure in irrigation. Public expenditure on rural roads
     has given acceptable and steadily growing returns throughout the decade.

     The results would suggest that, if high current outputs and prices for agricultural products (i.e. rice) are
     sustained, public expenditure on extension and rural roads will continue to significant returns. However, there is room
     to increase the efficiency of public expenditures as returns on investments are still significantly below their potential
     (Figure 5.3). This is particularly relevant when maintaining high returns on public investments during periods of price
     declines of agricultural products.



     Agricultural Extension

     The Agriculture PER analysis shows that, until 2006, BCRs for extension were mostly around 1, which indicates
     the limited effectiveness of public spending. However, since 2007, the increase in international rice prices had
     a strong effect on crop margins. This has had a dramatic effect on the effectiveness of public expenditures, which
     makes returns to extension investments equally attractive to roads, peaking at a BCR of 3 in 2008. While the average
     total cost per farmer contacted by public extension officers in Cambodia has comparable to international norms, there
     has been rather significant gap between actual and potential BCRs over 2000–09 period—in other words 3 and 5
     respectively. The quality of extension staff at district and provincial levels is generally good, but the effectiveness of
     extension spending has been limited by sub-optimal length and frequency of farmer visits to maintain/achieve desired
     knowledge diffusion and adoption rates, which may result from insufficient operating budgets.

     The results of the CBA are consistent with the evidence from various country specific studies, which show
     that public spending on extension can be a cost-effective means of generating greater economic returns to
     farmers (see Birkhaeuser et al, 1991). For example, in a meta-analysis of 292 research studies, median rates of
     return of 58 percent for extension advisory services investments have been found, which translates into BCR ration
     of about 6.5 using a 6 percent discount rate (Alston et al, 2000 and Dercon et al, 2008).

     Public spending on agricultural extension in Cambodia has potential to continue to generate high rates of
     return. While savings in costs, especially those associated with overheads, would have a positive effect on BCRs,
     the key variable that affects the performance of extension expenditures is the adoption rate per worker and the
     resulting increase in diffusion rates. As a benchmark for effectiveness, an extension worker in Cambodia would need
     to generate adoption of new practices worth about $1,500 per year in increased farm margins, assuming that this
     increase in farm margins is sustained. This can be achieved by a combination of extension measures, such as: (a)
     improving extensive messages (such as advice on planting times), which when assuming an increase in margins of
     about 10 percent (or about $15 per adopter), would require 100 new adopters per extension worker per year; and (b)
     intensive messages (such as the adoption of a comprehensive package of seeds and inputs), which when assuming
     an increase in margins of about 50 percent (or about $75 per adopter), would require only 20 new adopters per year.
     The number of adopters could be roughly similar to the number of farmers contacted with a diffusion rate of 3 and an

adoption rate of 35 percent. In areas of higher population densities and good agricultural potential, such as Tonle Sap
region and Southeastern provinces, extension workers can expect even higher diffusion and adoption rates.

For extension there are strong initial gains from adopting improved rice seeds and efficient fertilizer and
pesticide use practices. Once these basic improvements have been adopted, there remains limited scope for
further improvement. Most dry season irrigated cultivation in Cambodia already uses improved seeds and modern
farm inputs. Further improvements in dry season yields are still possible, but they will be more modest than those
achieved during the last decade. However, there is still a great scope to increase rice productivity in the wet season
by improving seed varieties and expanding their use and associated techniques, and by improving water storage and
management. There is also scope in both wet and dry season farming for advances in crop diversification. Therefore,
in the foreseeable future, there seems little reason to expect the benefits from extension to diminish, provided that
institutional efficiency will be gradually increased.

Increasing long-term performance of public extension activities requires improvements in its institutional
functionalities. The main issue related to current performance of DAE extension services is insufficient operating
budgets which results shorter and less frequent than optimal visits to farmers to help increase knowledge and spur the
adoption of more new technologies, but also broader institutional issues. Achieving better balance between operating
costs and recurrent costs, coupled with broader institutional changes which devolve more MAFF budget resources
and staff to provincial and district levels would go long way to deliver extension messages along extensive margins
by reaching larger number of farmers. Harmonization of extension messages and delivery approaches between
various service providers (government, NGOs, private sector), and elimination of conflicting messages, would also
improve value of money for extension spending by all. Finally, better integration of agricultural research and extension
delivery functions will ensure that public spending on development of new crop varieties, and information on research
trials on fertilizer and soil management techniques for specific agro-ecological conditions will reach farmers quickly
and in easily accessible format, providing a principal basis for intensification of extension messages.



Irrigation

The BCRs for irrigation have been close to 1 throughout 2000s, suggesting that irrigation remains a challenging
sector for public expenditures. High priority given to irrigation may be based on expectations of impact that has
not been achieved. The BCRs did not respond to increasing rice price trends since 2007 which effect was more than
offset by increasing irrigation unit costs, although the latter still compare favorably with international norms. This is
a major concern and MOWRAM needs to devote more attention to prioritizing its investment activities. The wide
variability of BCRs by schemes shows that irrigation investments can be competitive even with current high level of
unit costs if schemes were well selected and designed, fully implemented and properly maintained.

The actual BCRs of irrigation investment are less than half of potential returns. The main reasons are incomplete
rehabilitation and inadequate maintenance. It has been estimated that only about 70 percent of command area could
be actually irrigated in Cambodia, and this has lot to do with lack rehabilitation of the whole irrigation areas as public
spending has been mainly limited to headworks and primary canals to the neglect of secondary and tertiary canals,
which contributed to low returns as many farmers are still not able to irrigate.

The second reason for low effectiveness of irrigation is almost complete lack of funding for maintenance. The
lack of maintenance work means that actual BCRs are about 2/3 of their potential levels (i.e. lack of proper maintenance

        Box 5.1. Example of Alternative Approach to Irrigation Infrastructure Investments

        Earth canals dominate canal distribution systems in Cambodia, which cause high losses of water, vulnerability
        to erosion and siltation and substantial land take. It is worth considering alternatives such as simple box-section
        concrete canals for the secondary distribution network illustrated in left photo above. While the construction
        of a concrete canal is much more expensive than construction of an earth canal (on the right), the size of canal
        needed is much smaller, causes less siltation and may not require large regulator and off-take structures, such
        as are commonly constructed on earth canals, so total capital costs may not be so much higher than for the
        earth canal option. Furthermore, water is used more efficiently by avoiding transmission losses while keeping
        maintenance costs low.




     have reduced benefits by up to 10 percent each year). In order to sustain the benefits of irrigation rehabilitation works,
     it is recommended that about 5 percent of the rehabilitation costs are devoted to maintenance in each subsequent
     year. This means that about one-third of total expenditure on irrigation should be devoted to maintenance. There
     is an opportunity to use new technologies and approached for irrigation investments, which reduce the need for
     costly maintenance works in future years (Box 5.1). While the government’s objective of engaging Farmer Water
     User Communities (FWUCs) in maintenance is valid in principle, this may take many decades to achieve. It is thus
     unrealistic to place full responsibility for maintenance on FWUCs, meaning that the optimum share of public funding
     to be devoted to maintenance is about one third.

     The comparison of BCRs with international experiences should be treated with caution, given the wide
     range of economic, social, and physical conditions and given Cambodia’s unusual circumstances in the
     wet season. Multilateral funding for irrigation projects generally requires internal rates of return (IRRs) of at least
     15 percent, equivalent to a BCR of about 1.8 using a 6 percent discount rate. This provides a yardstick for international
     comparison which suggests that Cambodian irrigation investment has been roughly in line with international
     norms. Morales and Mongcopa (2008) reviewed experience with ADB funding for irrigation, based on 105 projects
     in 18 Asian countries. Proportion of these projects that were rated as successful at ex-post evaluation was only
     55 percent. The study focused on 21 projects rated as successful, giving an average IRR of 32 percent at appraisal

and 18 percent at evaluation. The figures for partly successful or unsuccessful projects were 18 and 7 percent,
respectively. The evaluation stressed the importance of good project design, extensive stakeholder consultation,
flexible implementation and effective O&M. Project size had no impact on success, and the effect of cost over-runs
was modest. The review of 192 World Bank irrigation projects around the world found that two-thirds of the projects
were considered satisfactory, with an average IRR of 15 percent at the time of evaluation. Barker and Molle (2004)
also demonstrated the sensitivity of irrigation to food prices, showing that, in Sri Lanka, the BCR of irrigation fell from
around 3 in the 1970s to less than 1 from the mid-1980s. Jones found that cropping intensity, which is a proxy for the
technical performance of the scheme, was also important and that larger irrigation projects were significantly more
successful than smaller ones in all regions.

The scope for introducing major new irrigation schemes in Cambodia is limited and MOWRAM expects to
concentrate its resources on rehabilitating and improving existing schemes and expanding the coverage
within these schemes. The analysis of benchmarks shows that rehabilitation of irrigation can be probably justified
on economic and financial grounds if the cost per hectare of the additional land that is actually brought under irrigation
will be less than $2,000 and if the irrigation schemes are maintained so that the irrigated area continues to be
cultivated for at least 10 years. As the more efficient schemes have been probably already rehabilitated and improved
maintenance on these schemes reduces the need for repeat rehabilitation, the costs per hectare of future investment
are expected to continue to increase in the future. The wide range of BCRs indicated by the CISIS information
suggests that this could have a substantial impact on the effectiveness of public expenditure on irrigation. It is
therefore important that MOWRAM’s prioritization practices are technically sound from engineering, agricultural and
economic perspectives.



Rural Roads

Expenditures on rural roads have resulted in the largest benefits in recent years, with BCRs higher than 2 since 2005
and reaching 3 in 2008 and 2009.12 This explains the high priority given to rural roads by communes, households, and
politicians. The increase in rice productivity seems to be closely associated with a marked increase in the value of
rural labor, and this has led to a large increase in the returns to rural roads, as people value time savings more highly.
About 100-600km of rural roads have been rehabilitated (an average of about 1 percent each year) and 300-1,000km
have benefited from periodic or routine maintenance (an average of about 2.3 percent each year).

The BCRs of rural roads depend heavily on the level of maintenance efforts. In order to secure a full benefit
stream for 20 years, the MRD estimate that the combined costs of routine and periodic maintenance should average
about 9.5 percent of rehabilitation costs each year. This means that about 45 percent of total rural roads spending
should go to maintenance. These conclusions are similar to those reached by Abrams (2004) and MRD (2004). If
benefits were to fall by 10 percent a year without maintenance, then the BCR would be reduced to 60 percent of
the potential level. The benchmark analysis shows that the rehabilitation or construction of rural roads is generally
justified on economic grounds if the cost per beneficiary is less than about $250 and if the road is maintained so that
the population has the benefit of the road for at least 10 years. This justification is based primarily on savings in travel
time for those people using the road on a daily basis.




12	 The CBA for rural roads does not include donor-funded projects due toa lack of information about outputs and unit costs.
44                                                    THE AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION, AND RURAL ROADS SECTORS: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW




     With the gradual completion of the road reconstruction program and the increasing distances involved
     in sourcing laterite, the unit costs of rehabilitation and maintenance are expected to increase markedly.
     Switching to new technologies, such as moving from laterite surface to Double Bituminous Surface Treatment for
     road pavement, is also likely to increase the unit costs of rural roads, although it will also change the nature and
     frequency of maintenance requirements and may reduce total maintenance costs.

     There is little synthesis of international experience. Individual project evaluations provide a useful range of
     evidence. The ADB evaluation of the Laos Rural Access Roads Project reported an IRR of 11.8 percent (BCR of 1.5),
     while in Tajikistan the IRR for rural roads was 21.5 percent. In India, the National Planning Commission evaluated
     21 projects in Rajasthan in 2006 and estimated the average IRR as 15.6 percent.



     Results of Sensitivity Analysis

     The sensitivity analysis shows that all BCRs are sensitive to the choice of discount rate. Increasing the discount
     rate from 6 percent to 10 percent will reduce all BCRs by 25 percent. However, increasing the discount rate will
     affect fewer investments that generate short-term benefits, such as extension, while it will reduce the attractiveness
     of infrastructure investments, especially expenditures for maintenance which are needed to sustain longer-term
     benefits.

     For extension expenditures, the BCRs are highly sensitive to number of farmers contacted, adoption rate and estimates
     of yield changes. For example, if extension services would achieve diffusion rate of 5 instead of 3 as assumed in
     the analysis, the BCRs would have been 67 percent higher. Similarly, if the adoption rates are 50 percent rather than
     35 percent, the BCRs would have been 43 percent higher. The BCRs are inversely proportional to the unit costs of
     the extension service, such that 10 percent savings in unit costs result in a 10 per cent increase in BCR.

     For irrigation, the BCRs are directly proportional to the estimates of the proportion of irrigated areas from
     total command area. The data from individual BCRs shows high variability in this parameter, which could be as
     high as 50 percent from average estimates. The BCRs are also strongly affected by incremental yield assumptions.
     As expected, the BCRs are inversely proportional to costs per hectare and these are relatively unreliable, given the
     uncertainty about the portion of actual irrigated land.

     For rural roads, the BCRs are directly proportional to the estimates of the frequency of use of the roads and
     the reduction in time taken and in the costs of travel. These estimates are based on case study evidence and
     cannot be validated against national level data. The BCRs are also strongly influenced by the assumptions on ongoing
     maintenance activity. A lack of maintenance has a tendency to reduce benefits rapidly which means that BCR for
     rehabilitation without maintenance may not be able to reach acceptable levels.

     To validate the findings of CBBA a review of 14 case studies from Cambodia was undertaken, mainly
     comprising ex-post project evaluations. The review showed that the results of this analysis are well within the
     boundaries of BCRs reported in case studies in their magnitude. The range of BCRs for extension was 1.4 to 12;
     for irrigation 2 to 8; and 1 to 11 for rural roads. Some very high figures have been calculated, notably for extension
     activity, especially at a local scale. In some cases, this may have been because project overhead costs have not been
     included. Details of the case studies are provided in Annex G.

database is prone to significant noise due to self
reporting. As such, the analysis would focus on broader spatial trends rather than relative performance of communes.
The analysis shows that the proportion of communes for which BCRs are less than 1 is about 50 percent for extension,
and 25 percent for irrigation and rural roads. Between 85 and 95 percent of communes have BCRs of less than 6.0,
for all agricultural interventions. The fact that majority of communes for which data is available seem concentrate in
area of BCR for irrigation between 3.0 and 4.0 which may mask a large diversity of BCRs between geographical sites.
This indicates that geographical targeting of public spending may be most important for irrigation investments.

The aggregate spatial trends illustrate that there is a general tendency for returns to be highest in the so
called “rice belt” which runs from North East provinces around Tonle Sap area to South Eastern provinces of
Cambodia (see Annex H). However, the pattern is patchy due to missing, with large variations between neighboring
communes, which could indicate data errors. The quality of data is not sufficient to allow any reliable spatial
prioritization. However, it does show the importance of space in influencing returns to public spending.

There are strong advantages from concentrating public expenditure on areas with highest agricultural
potential. Irrigation is widely spread around the country, but its effectiveness is strongly influenced by its geographical
location and level of funding. Annual expenditure on irrigation is generally concentrated in 20 to 40 schemes, which
may benefit perhaps 100 communes. The number of roads rehabilitated by the MRD has risen to 34 per year in 2008–
2009, from about 15 roads per year in previous years, suggesting that between 50 and 70 communes are affected
annually. Thus, public expenditure in irrigation and roads now reaches perhaps 5 percent of communes in any one
year and has reached about 30 percent of communes over the last decade. The spending per commune on irrigation
is normally between $200,000 and $500,000 while the spending per commune on rural roads is somewhat higher,
including an allocation of all overhead costs. In addition, the CSF provides much smaller funds to each commune.

     Based on current patterns of spending, it will take 20 years before government expenditure on irrigation and
     rural roads reaches all irrigation schemes and rural roads in Cambodia, assuming that the schemes and roads
     that have been rehabilitated are not revisited during that time. Yet, there are strong arguments for accepting the
     concentration of expenditure. Firstly, wide variation in BCRs, if true, indicates the need to close geographical targeting
     of public expenditures. MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD all have experience in the geographical prioritization of
     public expenditure, often involving technical and economic analysis undertaken jointly with donors. These processes
     can be developed and improved further. Secondly, extension, irrigation and rural roads are strongly complementary
     and the total benefits generated are at least 20 percent higher if they are implemented in the same geographical
     location. For example, the field survey found that farmers in irrigation villages rate extension as significantly more
     useful than other farmers.



     D. The Impact of Public Expenditures on Economic Growth

     The impact of public expenditure on economic growth is estimated using the BCRs, which are based on crop
     margins, and adjusted for additional labor income. This is because economic growth is defined as value added,
     including profits and labor income. For extension, additional labor income is assumed as 30 to 40 percent of crop
     margins and for irrigation it is assumed about 25 percent of margins. For transport, the BCRs are based on reduced
     travel times and transport costs. It is thus reasonable to expect that the time released by quicker travel will be used to
     generate additional growth through other farm and non-farm activities. It is also assumed that market wage provides
     a reasonable estimate of the value that the time released will generate in the economy.

     Improved crop productivity and reduced transport costs will lead to a combination of increased farm-gate
     prices and reduced consumer prices. The increased farm prices directly contribute to agricultural GDP and the
     reduced consumer prices will benefit the rest of GDP by allowing consumers to increase consumption on other
     goods. The contribution of public expenditure to the growth of total GDP and for agricultural GDP was calculated
     based on BCRs for 2006 to 2009 (Table 5.7). Total public expenditure in extension, irrigation and rural roads, including
     both government and donor funding, was $118.5 million in 2008. Most of it was in the form of investment, which
     generated an increase in total value added of $30.2 million. It was estimated that about two thirds of total benefits
     are generated by rural roads, but these benefits are dominated by time savings only part of which lead to more
     agricultural growth. When adjusting to this, the total increase in agricultural value added was estimated at about
     $12 million.

     Simulations were carried out to explore the impact of allocation of public expenditure to agriculture versus
     other sectors on GDP growth. The analysis presents results of allocating $1million of public spending to either
     investments in non-agriculture sectors or investments in agriculture sector (Table 5.8). Three sets of scenarios were
     developed on various allocations of public expenditures to agriculture and non-agriculture investments, which are

based on relative performance of public expenditures in generating growth in agriculture and non-agriculture sectors,
and on contribution of agriculture and non-agriculture sectors to government revenues. For each scenario, the analysis
presents the NPV of incremental GDP growth. The base-case scenario assumptions aim to depict the situation in
Cambodia in 2010. In this set of assumptions, BCRs for agriculture are higher than they were before 2007, but not
as high as they could be potentially be if the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures were to improve (i.e.
high-case scenario). For non-agriculture sectors, the differences in relative BCRs are based on differences in sectoral
growth rates, although this does not necessarily reflect returns to public expenditures. It is assumed that the public
revenue from agricultural growth is small (at 5 percent) and that it is obtained largely from VAT and from taxes on
trade and related economic activities, rather than from agricultural production itself. It is assumed that the incremental
revenue generated by the growth in agriculture and non-agriculture sectors is allocated to the same purposes as the
original $1 million. It should be noted that the assumptions used in the analysis and the resulting changes in indicators
are subjective estimates, which have not been validated statistically. The results should therefore be treated only as
illustrative.

The analysis shows that under the base-case scenario $1 million of public spending generates about $2 million
worth of incremental GDP growth, while investing $1 million in higher growth (in non-agriculture) sectors
generates GDP of $2.9 million. However, increasing BCR for agriculture investments under high scenario to 2.5
would generate $2.7 million of additional GDP growth from $1 million public investment in agriculture, compared to
$2.2 million additional GDP growth from investment in non-agriculture sectors. Under the low-case scenario, the
impact of public spending on GDP in agriculture sector is less than 40 percent of that for non-agriculture sectors. Under
this scenario public investment in non-agriculture sectors would be more favorable than investment in agriculture.
This set of assumptions would have typified the situation in many developing countries in the years up to 2007, and
may explain the lack of public investments in agriculture back then.

In the high-case scenario, agriculture generates higher BCRs than other sectors. This scenario confirms that if
recent increase in world crop prices be sustained, and potential improvements in efficiency of public expenditure are
achieved, then public expenditure in agriculture could become an important contributor to economic growth. This is
particularly relevant in Cambodia where agriculture has demonstrated high growth potential.

     Summary

     Our analysis of effectiveness and efficiency explains the high priority given by the government to rural roads
     and the lower priority it has given to extension, at least in the past. It also validates the interest in increasing
     public expenditures on agriculture as a result of greater farm profitability in recent years. The high priority given to
     irrigation in the past seems to have been misplaced, given the problems with the performance of the sector.

     The government’s extension service plays a valuable role in assisting Cambodian farmers as a complement to
     private and NGO activity, and there are some valuable workers in the service. However, the kinds of information
     that it provides to farmers is sometimes not well matched to their needs, often because of a lack of resources. The
     effectiveness of donor spending on extension is limited by the stop-start nature of their funding. A more coordinated
     system of support is needed to increase continuity and build sustainable practices.

     Research results have often not found their way into mainstream extension practices in Cambodia, which
     could increase its effectiveness. Government and donor spending on both research and extension should be better
     coordinated. Research into the development of new crop varieties and farm management practices needs to include
     applied research to ensure that it meets the needs of farmers in their specific agro-ecological conditions and the need
     for agriculture to adapt to the changing environment, climate, and economic circumstances.

     Our analysis has shown that an incomplete pattern of rehabilitation of irrigation schemes is resulting in low
     returns to public investments. Limiting rehabilitation to headworks and primary canals is a very inefficient use
     of public resources, except in the rare circumstances when the private sector or the farming community has the
     capacity to complete the rehabilitation.

     Returns to expenditures on the maintenance of existing irrigation infrastructure will generally be higher than
     those on the construction of new schemes. The returns to rehabilitation on infrastructure that has been maintained
     are double those of rehabilitation on infrastructure that has not been maintained. In irrigation, the optimal share of
     total expenditure that should be devoted to maintenance is 33 percent. Official MOWRAM policy requires Farmer
     Water User Communities (FWUCs) to take responsibility for all maintenance. It will take a long time for these FWUCs
     to build up the necessary technical, institutional, and financial capacity to take full responsibility for the maintenance
     of irrigation schemes. Unless the government and donors provide funding for maintenance while FWUCs build this
     capacity, there will be few irrigations schemes on which rehabilitation will be justified. Therefore, there is a need for
     the government to fund maintenance in the interim before beginning a phased withdrawal to allow FWUCs to take
     over responsibility.

     Both the government and donors should pay more attention to the maintenance of rural roads. Current
     allocations for the maintenance of rural roads still fall short of the optimal share of total expenditure, which is about
     45 per cent. It is expected that the costs of rehabilitation of rural roads will increase in coming years as a result of
     the growing shortage of laterite. There is a need to develop and pilot new techniques, such as moving from laterite
     surface to Double Bituminous Surface Treatment for road pavement, if recent progress in expanding rural access is
     to be sustained.

     Expenditures on research, extension, irrigation, and rural roads should be seen as complementary and will
     be more effective when concentrated in the same locations, preferably the best locations. Continued strong
     agricultural growth will have a dramatic effect on reducing poverty. However, concentrating public expenditures in

high agriculture potential areas is unlikely to reduce nationwide inequities so the government should put in place
complementary social protection programs to reduce inequities and poverty in less advantaged areas.

In order to ensure that growth can be sustained at a high level similar to that achieved by many Southeast
and East Asian economies in recent decades, the Cambodia government will also need to address some
broader sectoral issues. These include the need to correct market failures (such as information and coordination
externalities); to improve the business enabling environment; to remove barriers to accessing finance for agricultural
investments, including the high cost of finance relative to economic returns in agriculture; and finally, to upgrade the
level of technology. Continuing improvements in agriculture sector policy environment and more efficient collaboration
between the government and donors, NGOs, and the private sector would increase the effectiveness of public
spending in the agriculture sector.

     6. Climate Change and Public Expenditures


     Cambodia is situated between two global weather systems, which makes it vulnerable to the effects of
     climate change. There is some scientific evidence that climate changes will make northern and western parts of
     the country drier, with fewer floods and more droughts, while the opposite is expected to take place in the south
     and east. Agricultural growing seasons (reflecting the effect of a combination of rainfall and temperature on potential
     evapotranspiration) are expected to become markedly shorter in the next 50 years before returning to close to their
     current levels by 2080 (see Annex I for further analysis). This implies the need to adapt public expenditures in the
     agriculture sector to increase their effectiveness and efficiency in the future. In this chapter we evaluate the potential
     impact of various climate change parameters on agricultural production (particularly rice) in Cambodia and then we
     analyze the implications of various climate change scenarios for public expenditure patterns.



     A. The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture

     The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) is in the final stages of preparing the Second National
     Communication (SNC) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This includes
     a Vulnerability and Adaptation (V&A) Assessment that analyzes likely changes in temperature and rainfall and in
     growing seasons. The V&A projections of annual rainfall and temperature were made using the PRECIS model and
     fourteen Global Climate Models (GCMs) (Masutomi, 2009). These suggest that temperatures are likely to increase by
     about 2˚C by the end of the century. Changes in rainfall patterns are complex, because Cambodia is on the boundary
     between two global weather systems. The PRECIS analysis of past trends suggest there has been a general increase
     in total rainfall of about 2 mm per year, with the highest increases having been in the northwest during the wet
     season and in the southeast during the dry season. It should be noted that the northwest and southeast are the main
     rice-producing regions in Cambodia. The GCM analysis presents high and low emission scenarios. In general, the
     dry season is projected to get drier and the wet season wetter, especially after 2025. Rainfall is expected to increase
     most in the southeast, while the northwest may experience some decline. The wet season is projected to start later
     than it does now, especially in the low emissions scenario.

     According to the V&A projections, every additional 10mm of wet season total rainfall will add 6,500 tons (or
     about 0.1 percent) to rice production. The V&A modeling considers a range of agro-hydrological zones, and the
     assessment concludes that production in the south and east may increase by 1 percent over next 50 years, while the
     opposite may happen in the northern parts of the country. The effects of total rainfall on rice production are likely to
     be small. The potential impact of higher temperatures suggests that research and extension for farming practices that
     optimize soil and crop moisture (such as zero tillage) is expected to become more valuable in coming years.

     The changing temperature and rainfall patterns are expected to affect growing seasons. The V&A assessment
     analyzes rainfall patterns and shows that there have been considerable changes since 1960, but its projections
     suggest that changes will be less marked in the future. However, the combination of rainfall patterns and temperature
     will increase evapotranspiration which in turn is expected to have a significant impact on growing season. Under both
     scenarios, the average growing season for the majority of cultivated land is expected to decrease from seven months
     to five months. This effect will be moderated after 2050, when increased rainfall is expected to counteract the effect
     of higher temperatures.

6. Climate Change and Public Expenditures                                                                                  51




Furthermore, the PRECIS analysis for the V&A assessment suggests that there will be changes in the start
and duration of the wet season, which will affect the length of the growing season. Since temperatures are
sufficiently high at the end of the wet season to allow most crops to mature, there would only be a limited impact
on crop production if the wet season started and finished later, especially if light-insensitive crop varieties were
used. Therefore, the main effects of seasonality would be the loss of production that would occur if the wet season
became shorter. The V&A analysis suggests that wet seasons could shorten by at least a month in many regions,
although this effect might be reversed after 2050 in the low emissions scenario.

However, the wet season will still be sufficiently long in most major crop growing regions to allow for one
rice crop to be grown, especially if short maturing varieties are used. Thus, the main loss of production could
come from the inability to grow a second crop. Currently, the late season crop typically accounts for about 25
percent of rice production in Cambodia and is also important for vegetable production. Much of this would be under
threat from a shortened growing season, except where irrigation is available. Irrigation that is designed for an early
end to the wet season gives returns up to twice as high as supplementary wet season irrigation and will become
increasingly relevant as climate change progresses. Therefore, responding to changing seasonality must be the most
important priority when adjusting public expenditures in agriculture to climate change.

An analysis suggests that, as the climate changes, the south and east Cambodia will have more floods and
fewer droughts, while the opposite will happen in the north and west (Endo et al, 2009). This is consistent with
the V&A analysis on total rainfall. The frequency of drought days is likely to decrease by 25 percent in the northwest
and increase by a similar amount in the southeast. Losses from drought and floods are variable and can be traumatic
when they occur. However, only about 5.5 percent of total production has been lost to flood and drought in Cambodia
in the last decade. If the frequency of extreme events and associated losses were to increase by 25 percent, then
losses in production would be about 1.4 percent of total crop production, which could be worth about $20 million per
year.

The V&A analysis of past rainfall patterns that examined the duration of droughts showed that adopting crop
varieties and farming practices that will enable crops to survive one additional day of drought would reduce
average annual losses from drought from about 5.5 percent to about 5.0 percent of total production. This
would be worth about $8 million for the economy, suggesting that public investments in research and extension for
drought resilience is justified. The increasing frequency of droughts in the northwest, including the Tonle Sap region,
suggests that investments in drought-bridging water storage should favor this region.



B. Implications of Climate Change for Public Expenditures

In theory, expected increases in rice production in south and southeast Cambodia and decreases in northern
parts of the country should result in a shift in public expenditure in favor of the more productive areas. In
particular, the importance of extension activities associated with water management and the scope for irrigation
point to the need to increase public expenditures in these areas that would not reduce their effectiveness. However,
as shown above, the changes involved in production are likely to be marginal. Instead, issues associated with flood
and drought risk and changing seasonality are likely to have a more important effect on the optimal allocation of public
expenditure in agriculture. In this section, we discuss these changes in turn.
52                                                     THE AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION, AND RURAL ROADS SECTORS: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW




     Research and Extension

     There are substantial benefits to be gained from the development of new crop varieties that are adapted to
     new climate conditions. The order of magnitude of these benefits can be illustrated by what would happen if public
     expenditures were support the development of varieties that would be able to survive one additional day of drought
     or flood. This would reduce average losses from drought from about 5.5 percent to about 5 percent of total crop
     production, which would be worth about $8 million if all farmers were able to benefit from these seeds. Given the
     current unit cost of developing crop varietals is about $1 million per varietal, the returns to developing more drought-
     and flood-resistant crop varieties could be high, provided they are widely adopted by farmers. However, in practice,
     it is likely that these varietals will only be adopted gradually. Increasing the efficiency of extension services can
     accelerate this process. Extension agents can also help farmers to adapt to climate change, particularly by changing
     their cultivation practices and cropping choices.



     Irrigation

     Returns to irrigation are expected to increase substantially as a result of the increased need to store water
     to protect against increased drought and flood frequency and a shorter wet season and growing period. The
     shortened rainy season is likely to be the feature of climate change that has the most significant impact on agriculture
     and on the performance of public expenditures on agriculture. If irrigation were used to ensure the survival of a crop
     during a shortened rainy season, the benefits of this would be about double the benefits of standard wet season
     supplementary irrigation.



     Rural Roads

     The marginal likely increase in the frequency of flood events will increase the need for major repairs and to
     designing rural roads to survive floods, which may add additional costs to rural road rehabilitation. However,
     it is expected that the effects of climate change factors on rural roads will be smaller than its effects on research,
     extension, and irrigation.

     Current priorities for climate change activities are defined in the National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA)
     and will soon be further elaborated for the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR). The NAPA contains
     16 non-health priorities, of which seven are associated with investments in agricultural water management. This is
     consistent with the analysis in this chapter, which stresses the importance of irrigation in preparing for climate change.
     The NAPA includes a priority on supporting integrated farming systems. However, it does not put a sufficiently high
     priority on funding research and extension on adapting crop varieties and practices.

     In a country like Cambodia where the pattern of climate change is both more mixed and more uncertain than
     in other countries, it is prudent that public expenditure priorities should focus on “low regret” investments
     that combine standard national planning goals with climate adaptation. These would be public investments that
     would result in “low regrets” or opportunity costs (such as the increased use of improved seeds and better farming
     techniques, including water and soil management) if the more negative climate change effects as currently projected
     do not materialize. Investing in increasing agricultural productivity would qualify as one such “low regret” option.

Summary

The net impact of climate change on agricultural production in Cambodia will be complex and is expected
to vary considerably from one region to another. The strongest will probably be the reduced and more variable
growing seasons, which will require farmers to invest in water storage and the development of new crop varieties and
farming techniques that are more resilient to unpredictable growing seasons. This is expected to result in significant
increases in returns to public expenditures on research and extension and in water storage and management.

     7. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations


     A. Agricultural Sector Growth and Public Spending

     Cambodia’s success in improving livelihoods and reducing poverty has been driven by strong economic
     growth. Agricultural sector growth has been lower than in other sectors, but it has been relatively robust and a key
     factor in the impressive reduction of poverty. Growth has been high despite of low levels of public spending as a
     percentage of GDP.

     Our analysis of the effectiveness of public spending has shown that more and especially better spending on
     agriculture or related infrastructure could lead to higher growth. The potential for high returns from agriculture
     sector is demonstrated by the increasing interest shown by private sector investors in agriculture in recent years.
     However, significantly more public investments in productive rural infrastructure and more public services will be
     needed to leverage more private sector investments in the sector and to reduce the risk and volatility facing farmers
     and commercial producers. Returns to investments in the agricultural sector are still limited by the under-provision
     of non-infrastructure types of public goods by the government, especially in two key areas—agricultural technology
     (generation, adaptation, and dissemination) and public regulatory capacity.

     Furthermore, sustaining high agricultural growth levels continues to depend on non-investment factors such
     as climate change. While weather and climate-related shocks have had a large impact on changes in agricultural
     GDP in Cambodia, targeted public investments in irrigation and drainage could have a significant impact in reducing
     such climate-induced volatility in agricultural yields and hence returns. The key is to ensure that investments are
     meaningful and efficient and tackle genuine constraints to agricultural production in a given location.

     When we looked at expenditure trends over last decade, a clear pattern of funding emerged, with donors
     concentrating mainly on MAFF and MOWRAM recurrent expenditure financing, while the government has
     funded MOWRAM capital investments and much of the MRD’s rural roads capital investment. In recent years,
     there have been some signs that the government is funding more maintenance expenditures, especially for rural
     roads. The overall pattern of funding is pragmatic but there are problems of aid dependency in the areas of agricultural
     research and extension. While increasing the budget allocation for capital spending on rural roads has generated
     positive agricultural and non-agricultural benefits, the high priority given to irrigation investments in the past seems
     to have been somewhat misplaced in light of the highly variable returns to these investments.

     The analysis presented in this report demonstrates that the performance of public expenditure, including
     both government and donor resources, in extension and irrigation was weak until 2007, after which improved
     economic conditions led to a period of higher returns. The performance of rural roads has tended to be stronger
     and more stable, although they have also been positively affected by improved rural incomes. There have been a
     number of problems with public expenditures that have limited their effectiveness and thus their performance. These
     include: (a) a lack of continuity in agricultural research; (b) poor coordination between research and extension; (c) a
     lack of continuity in funding the O&M costs of extension; (d) an excessive focus on rehabilitating primary irrigation
     infrastructure and a neglect of secondary and tertiary systems; (e) a lack of irrigation maintenance; (f) a lack of
     periodic and routine maintenance for rural roads; and (g) the slow pace in developing new technologies for rural roads
     to address the declining supplies of laterite.

B. Policy Options Available to the Government

There is a case to be made in favor of more and better public expenditures for agriculture. Through much of
the last decade, the BCRs for public expenditures in extension, irrigation, and rural roads have been below 2. It has
therefore been difficult to justify increasing public expenditures for those sectors. The recent increases in agriculture
prices, however, have boosted BCRs to levels which could justify increased government spending on agriculture.
While increasing agricultural spending on public goods and services is desirable, we believe that there is little room
to do this relative to GDP within the existing budget envelope in the short-term, unless offsetting reductions are
made in other areas. Should such room be found, the prime candidates for increased allocations should be extension,
irrigation, and rural roads. The recommendations in this chapter would therefore focus primarily on improving the
overall efficiency and effectiveness of existing agriculture spending levels.

We offer the following recommendations for improving the performance of public expenditures on agriculture,
irrigation, and rural roads:

  i.	   Reallocate more budget resources on agricultural extension. Government funding for extension is low as a
        share of its agriculture budget and, as a result, these services are dependent on donor support. Public extension
        has potential to deliver high returns in Cambodia. There is an opportunity to significantly increase government
        by reallocating it from functional areas of lesser value for money. However, any spending increases, both
        from government and donors, should be accompanied by improvements of institutional functionality of MAFF
        extension systems and establishment of monitoring systems to measure the effectiveness of expenditures
        on these functions. Better harmonization of service delivery standards between various extension providers
        (government, NGOs and private sector) and elimination of conflicting messages would also improve the
        efficiency of extension spending for all.

  ii.	 Do not ignore funding for agricultural research. Analysis of efficiency of agricultural research spending in
       Cambodia was constrained by data limitations, but international evidence shows that agricultural research can
       have very high rates of return. While increased public spending for agricultural research is justified, it should
       come with institutional changes which clarify the specific functions of the country’s various research institutions
       and by consolidating laboratory capacities in various government units in order to reduce overlap and waste of
       resources. This can be done by establishing joint planning and evaluation systems by the government, donors
       and private sector to identify research needs and resource requirements. Technical expertise of donors could
       play an important role in building more effective research capacity in Cambodia. Better integration of national
       agricultural research institutions with extension services could further increase public spending efficiency on
       research, as well as extension.

  iii.	 Prepare for climate change. Related to two above recommendations, long-term efficiency of public spending
        on extension and research could be further improved by focussing more research efforts on development of
        new crop varietals and dissemination of knowledge on improved water storage and soil moisture preservation
        at farm-level—i.e. “low regret” investments that combine increased agricultural productivity with climate
        adaptation and mitigation against negative effects from reduced and more variable growing seasons.

  iv.	 Increase the effectiveness of irrigation investments. Public funding for new and rehabilitated irrigation
       schemes needs to be extended to secondary canals and associated infrastructure. The rehabilitation of tertiary
       canals using public funds is also justified provided that it includes arrangements the costs of operation and

            maintenance to be recovered from the end users. There also a need for more selectivity in funding irrigation
            schemes.

      v.	 Increase the share of the budget designated for maintenance of irrigation and rural roads. In the case
          of irrigation, the optimal level of maintenance expenditure should be about 33 percent of total investment, and
          in the rural roads sector, an average of 45 percent is required for periodic and routine maintenance combined.
          This level of maintenance should ensure that the next major rehabilitation is not required for at least 10 years.

      vi.	 A longer-term measure to improve the efficiency of spending on rural roads would require investigation
           of economic viability of new road rehabilitation and maintenance technologies. New technologies to
           consider include the use of bamboo reinforced concrete (for busy roads) and engineered earth. The government
           could usefully invest in or create incentives for others to invest in promoting skills in these technologies.

     Public Expenditure Planning and Management

     The key areas of weakness related to public spending in the three line ministries are: (i) the weak link between
     policies, programs, and the budget process; (ii) the duplication of programs, including unrealistic budget estimation
     without identified any sources of funding; and (iii) the lack of effective internal control in the procurement process.
     This weakness is compounded by duplication of programs and unrealistic budget estimations with no identified
     sources of funding.

     We make the following recommendations for improving government expenditure planning and man-
     agement:

      i.	   Use the BSPs within each ministry as the key policy and budget planning tool to allocate and manage all
            resources to the sectors. The government should consider using the BSPs as the central planning tool for
            the implementation of the Strategy for Agriculture and Water (SAW) and applying them to both domestically
            financed budget allocations and donor allocations.

      ii.	 Reinforce the annual budget process by requiring MAFF, MOWRAM, and the MRD to assign “hard” and
           enforceable budgets to each department through the BSPs. The current system of partial program budgets
           should be absorbed into this comprehensive approach.

      iii.	 Use the Treasury system to record expenditure on a departmental basis. This would require a more
            comprehensive financial reporting (currently called an expanded version of the TOFE) and greater devolution of
            responsibility for expenditures to budget entities.

7. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations                                                                               57




  iv.	 Introduce an annual review and planning process for the annual and medium-term budgets that includes both
       the government and its development partners that puts BSPs at the heart of the process and that integrates
       the SAW into government planning. The latter will require the coordination and integration of all the budget
       planning and management instruments that have been put in place by the government under the PFMRP. The
       donors, in consultation with the government, are preparing to map the way forward, and this should be done
       as a joint government/donor activity. The SAW initiatives are an opportunity to establish systems for regular
       and informative appraisal, monitoring, and evaluation of expenditures and for these to be fed back into future
       budgeting decisions.

     Annex B: Note on Data Sources


      cquiring time series data for this analysis has been a challenge, and dealing with data needs for three ministries in
     A
     the current state of public finance management reform is complex and demanding. Time series data for recurrent
     expenditure by economic classification are readily available. However, budget and expenditure data on a functional
     basis are hard to find. A variety of sources have been used to build the data sets used in this study for the allocation
     and composition expenditure analysis of agriculture, irrigation and rural roads. They are:

     The TOFE (Tableau des Opérations Financières de l’Etat) tables of MEF for recurrent expenditure by economic
     classification:  the TOFE tables provide a time series of budget and expenditure data by ministry broken down by
     economic classification. The TOFE tables are compiled and issued by the Department of Economic and Public Finance
     Policy (DEPFP) of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), based on the expenditure records of the General
     Department of National Treasury (GDNT). GDNT is the body responsible for preparing Government’s consolidated
     expenditure accounts and financial reports. These tables were available for the analysis period 2000–09. However,
     a change in the budget classification introduced through a new Chart of Accounts in 2007 means that there is a
     discontinuity in the presentation by economic classification. Provincial expenditure, which was reported up to 2007,
     is not separated thereafter, when budgets are structured into a Non-Program and Program budget framework.

     Line-ministries’ data for recurrent expenditure by functional area: the Government Budget is structured by
     administrative unit (i.e. by ministry) and by economic classification (by Chapter and Article). But expenditure figures
     by functional area are not available from the standard budget expenditure reports. This is a particular limitation in the
     analysis of agriculture which has a large number of functional areas or subsectors. To enable the study to carry out
     a functional expenditure analysis of agricultural spending, a dedicated exercise was put in place with the assistance
     of the MAFF Department of Finance. The MAFF Department of Finance arranged for individual line departments
     to compile spending figures for two years, 2007–09. Based on these reports, a functional analysis of government
     expenditure (and ultimately of donor disbursement also) is then possible.

     Spending reports received from 23 budget units in MAFF were rationalized into eleven functional spending areas:
     
       •	   Agronomy and land improvement
       •	   Agricultural machinery
       •	   Agricultural extension
       •	   Livestock and veterinary
       •	   Rubber production
       •	   Agro-industry
       •	   Agricultural research
       •	   Agricultural education and training
       •	   Forestry
       •	   Fisheries
       •	   Policy planning and management




                                                              cambodia: INTEGRATED FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENT AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW
Annex B: Note on Data Sources                                                                                              63




 he aligning of more than 150 donor projects to the above functional areas was made by the PER team. In many
T
cases, it was evident even from the title of the project as to which area it should be located in. Project descriptions
in the CDC data base also help. However, the classification of some projects is not straightforward. For example,
projects which have training or capacity building objectives have been classified under Agricultural Education and
Training, though in the MAFF budget this item is limited to training at the agricultural universities.

Projects which relate to value chains, including input supply projects, have been classified under Agro-industry,

whereas the responsibilities of the department of that name are much narrower. Projects which are predominantly
for extension have been allotted to the extension program though their resources may overlap with other technical
areas such as agronomy and land improvement, or with livestock and veterinary. Large integrated projects pose a
particular problem since they are comprised of components which serve a range of functional areas. Neither the
DIC nor the CDC data bases provide a breakdown of project disbursements by components. Thus, in most cases,
the disbursements for these projects have been disaggregated, based on information contained in project design or
other donor documents available to the PER team. However, design documents provide an ex-ante presentation of
cost allocations, and there is a degree of uncertainty about the actual expenditures. The assumptions regarding the
allocation of individual project disbursements to the functional areas are indicated in the working tables at Annex C.
For a small number of large projects, it has been possible to obtain information from donors on actual disbursements
to different functional areas.

MOWRAM’s Department of Finance  provided actual expenditure data on ministry wage and operation and
maintenance budgets for 2007–09.

MRD’s Departments of Finance and Rural Roads provided expenditure data on the rural roads department wage
budget for 2009, and on the rural roads operation and maintenance budget for 2008 09.

MEF’s DIC  provided records of domestically financed construction and equipment expenditure for the government
financed capital budget. Records both at the aggregate ministry level and by individual project are available. The
domestically financed capital budget has increased in importance in recent years, nearly quadrupling between 2004
and 2009. Along with national roads, rural roads and irrigation have been priority recipients, and together accounted
for 75 percent of this source of funding in 2009.

CDC and DIC provide data for donor project disbursements. The CDC data base provides a range of technical
and cost and disbursement information on nearly all multilateral and bilateral, loan and grant, donor projects sponsored
by the so-called traditional donors, and for one of the major new donors, the Republic of Korea. The Republic of China
projects do not yet appear in the data base.

 isbursement data disaggregated by project are available on the CDC data base only from 2007. Projected
D
disbursements are also available for many projects for 2010 12. Data input to the CDC system is the responsibility
of donors. CDC holds training sessions with donor operatives to ensure that there is conformity across donor
organizations, but there is no ex-post central quality assurance. As a result, there are occasional cases of inaccuracy
in the data in terms of misclassification and duplications. The PER team reviewed each project on the CDC data base
before including it into the PER data set for functional analysis.

 or multilateral lending agency loan and grant projects, DIC maintains disbursement records. Since the DIC carries
F
out direct checks with donors on its disbursement figures, DIC records have been the preferred source for multilateral

     projects for the years 2007 09. DIC records do not show projected disbursements for 2010 12. For bilateral projects,
     CDC figures have been used.

     The Ministry of Interior’s National Committee for the Management of Decentralization and De-concentration
     Reform (NCDD)  provided data on the Commune/Sanghat Funds (CSF), which channel significant volumes of
     resources to rural roads. NDCC has provided expenditure figures for 2002 09.

     Data reliability: the spending reports contained in the TOFE and DIC reports are considered to be reliable, because
     they are based on the actual payments passed and reported by the General Department of the National Treasury.
     The CDC data are subject to a degree of uncertainty because of the donor-input modality. There is no procedure for
     CDC to check all the data once they have been provided. Indeed, it would require a lot of resources to do so. The PER
     team found, however, that there was a reasonable degree of conformity between the DIC and CDC data for those
     projects which are reported on by both organizations. Overall, it is thought that the CDC data are probably accurate
     to within +/ 10 percent margin of error.

      he Beneficiary Perception Survey was conducted as part of the PER Review. The survey was expected to provide
     T
     evidence of the impact of public spending (both Government and donors) for agricultural extension, irrigation (large
     and small scale) and rural roads. The field survey was undertaken between 22nd February and 2nd March 2010. The
     survey was intended to supplement the data from secondary sources and from case studies.

      he survey focused on the effectiveness of public interventions, relying mainly on farmer perceptions. In particular,
     T
     the survey intended to assess the effects that agricultural extension, irrigation and rural roads have had on agricultural
     production and local livelihoods. The survey does not aim to collect evidence of the coverage of Government activity,
     which is more effectively done in CSES and MOPS.

     Table F.1. summarizes the sample villages in the survey.

      he survey collected data from three types of respondents in each village: key informants of the village, farmers (farm
     T
     households), and laborers. Different semi-structured questionnaires were used for each type of respondent. Work in
     each village started with one group interview/meeting with 4-6 key informants. Then, thirty farm households were
     interviewed and five laborers were selected among the sample farm households whose members were laborers for
     further interview to assess the impacts of public intervention on local demand for labor.

      he selection of the thirty sample farm households from each village was done differently for extension, irrigation,
     T
     and rural road villages. In rural road villages, the sample farm households were randomly selected among all village
     households while farm households in village irrigation were also selected randomly, but only among the village
     households that had access to irrigation systems. The method in the latter case was employed because the survey
     aimed to examine the benefits of irrigation, while the data on coverage of (or access to) irrigation among village
     households could be collected from the interviews with the village’s key informants. In the case of extension villages,
     the sample selection targeted the households that were contacted by the extension service. However, because the
     number of contact farmers was usually 20-30 per village, some non-contact farmers were included in the sample. The
     main focus of the interviews was on the questions associated with the selected intervention type, but all respondents
     were also asked a subset of questions on other types of intervention.

they attended the extension training. The figure should
in any case be unsurprising since the selection of the
households in these three villages was deliberately targeted on those receiving the extension courses provided to
the village. While the survey aimed to interview 30 households per village, it tried as much as possible to cover those
farm households receiving extension services.

H
 owever, while the method of selecting farm households in other villages for interview was different to that in the
extension villages, the percentage of farm households having received extension advice still appears high: 41 percent
in rural road villages and 47 percent in irrigation villages. While the figure in irrigation villages could be influenced
by the selection of households that in particular benefited from the irrigation scheme, the statistic in rural road
villages should be more representative given the random selection of farm households in those villages. However,
the coverage of extension services at 41 percent of the households in rural road villages could be the result of
extension programs provided by many different actors (i.e. the government, donor projects, and NGOs), rather than
a single service provider.

T
 he extension service further reaches untrained farmers. Its coverage can be understood through the range of
awareness of extension advice. The survey indicates that 93 percent of the surveyed households were aware of
extension advice. The proportion of households who were aware of extension advice was highest in irrigation villages
(97 percent, which is about twice the farm households that directly attended the extension training). However, the
coverage appears slightly less in extension villages (92 percent).

 armers are becoming aware of extension advice through multiple sources. The first major source is other farmers—
F
i.e. 61 percent of the interviewed households were aware of extension advice through this source. Other major
sources of extension advice are government extension workers, NGOs, and radios/TVs. Notably, farmers also become
aware of extension advice from ‘merchants/traders’. The extension advice from this source reaches 20 percent of the
surveyed households.

 he extension service from the Government and NGOs has larger coverage in extension villages and to some extent
T
in rural road villages. In extension villages, 58 percent of the households become aware of extension advice from
the Government extension workers and 52 percent have heard of it from NGOs. In irrigation villages, more farmers
tend to become aware of extension advice from other farmers/friends and radios/TVs. Unlike in extension villages,
extension advice from merchants/traders plays a more significant role—i.e. some 41 percent of farmer households

     in irrigation villages become aware of extension messages from merchants/traders. This implies that availability of
     irrigation encourages interaction between farmers and merchants/traders on agricultural extension.

      he extension messages that farmers have learned are largely in the forms of rice production, application of fertilizers,
     T
     pest management/control, and compost making. Among farmers directly learning from extension advice, 71 percent
     reported having learned rice production techniques, while the share of households receiving extension advice on
     application of fertilizers, pest management/control, and compost making ranges from 59-68 percent. About 43-
     46 percent of households attending extension courses have learned vegetable cultivation, livestock raising, water
     management, and SRI. The coverage of extension services on cash crop production, organic farming, and post
     harvest techniques is lowest, at about 20-22 percent of extension participants.

     Impact of extension services. The adoption rate among farm households that were receiving extension services
     appears high, but they only managed to apply some parts of the extension package they learned. About 67 percent
     of farm households partially applied what they learned from the extension courses into their actual farming practices.
     Full adoption is very low (about 6 percent) and found only in two of the extension villages.

 mong those having received extension advice, about 27 percent did not apply even part of the extension package
A
they received. They did not apply the extension advice because a lack of working capital and agricultural inputs were
their major constraints. Other reasons were because the adoption extension advice requires extra labor. Lack of
water availability to supply farmland also constrains farmers from adopting the techniques. Some farmers explained
that they did not apply the extension advice because they did not understand it or sometimes because they did not
believe in the extension advice.

T
 he partial adoption is most commonly observed and the rate is highest in irrigation villages (87 percent), followed
by extension villages (67 percent, excluding 14 percent of full adoption). This implies that the adoption rate of the
extension services is likely supported by the existence of the irrigation system. Though the adoption rate in irrigation
villages is not far higher than that in extension villages, it is because those extension villages are also characterised
by the availability of irrigation systems. Nevertheless, the adoption rate is far lower in villages that have no irrigation
such as Puchrey Chang village (Mondulkiri) or in villages where irrigation is limited such as Choim Tamao village
(Kampong Cham) while in villages with better availability of water supply from irrigation the adoption rate is even up
to 93 percent in Damnak Kanseng village (Pursat), though much adoption is only partial.

T
 able F.3 presents data on adoption rates for extension advice and perceptions of its usefulness. The table demonstrates
that extension advice works better in extension villages than in other villages, which again confirms the supporting
role of the irrigation schemes to the effectiveness of the extension service. Though they only partially adopted the
advice, none of farmers in irrigation villages found the extension service useless, 26 percent viewed extension advice
as very useful, and the rest have benefited in some degree from their adoption of the extension advice.

 he farmers in extension villages also value the usefulness of the extension advice in their farming practices, but the
degree of its usefulness is less compared to that in the irrigation villages. As extension villages also have irrigation
and water, the lower degree of usefulness may on one hand be due to different types of extension services and
could on the other hand be explained by the fact that irrigation systems in these villages have long been in existence
well before the introduction of the extension service. These to some extent reduce the perception of farmers on the
usefulness of the extension adoption.

     of the extension advice. The comparison shows that
     partial adoption increases yield by 31 percent while
     full adoption produces only 23 percent higher yield. This could be explained by fact that adaptation of extension
     messages is very farmer specific and depends on specific farm conditions. This further supports the argument that
     extension services would need to provide customized messages which responds more closely to farmer demand,
     rather than one size fits all advise.

     stream water for a greater variety of uses which include wet season rice, early wet season, and dry season rice.

     Impact of irrigation investments. Since irrigation is used for supplementary supply of agricultural water in the wet
     season, especially in the time of drought, the availability of water through irrigation systems is meant to protect
     loss of agricultural outputs. Also, availability of water should in theory encourage farmers to improve their land and
     water management, and adopt new farming techniques. This will eventually have an effect on agricultural yields.
     Furthermore, access to irrigation systems should prepare farmers to increase the number of croppings on their
     land.

     T
      able F.5 illustrates the behaviour of farmers in managing their farms in relation to access to irrigation and the impact
     on yield. In response to drought, farmers in irrigation and extension villages tend to make use of the water sources,
     either immediately when there is drought, or wait for some time before starting to use the water source. This
     behaviour of farmers toward water use is only commonly observed in villages where availability and access to water
     are not a constraint.

     F
      armers in rural road villages behave differently. A majority (58 percent) of them have no choice other than waiting
     for the rainfall when facing drought in the wet season. In particular, all farmers in Puchrey Chan village (Mondulkiri)
     are fully dependent on rainfall. This is because they have no or limited access to the water source. For example, only
     20 percent of the interviewed households in Angkal village (Prey Veng) could access water from the village irrigation
     system.

     T
      able F.5 reveals that 99 percent of the interviewed households in irrigation villages, in particular those who have
     access to irrigation system, were able to improve their land in the last two years. About 50 70 percent of the surveyed
     households in other villages improved their farmland, except Koh Toch (7 percent) and Puchrey Chang (33 percent)

n terms of the effect on yields as reported by the farm householdss it is observed that farms in irrigation villages
I
gain the highest yield increase, which is on average 44 percent higher than before the existence of the irrigation. The
increase in farm yields in rural road villages is not much different from that in the extension villages where the average
yield increase is 33 percent. Table F.5 would help to explain the effect of land improvement on farm yield in rural road
villages as offset of yield gain in extension villages that are likely determined by farm access to water. However, this
yield increase is basically farmers’ perception on effect of public intervention and is subject to many other factors
such as seeds and other inputs that are not controlled in this survey.

I
n addition to its supplementary use to irrigate farms in the wet season, the availability of irrigation schemes assists
farmers to double their crops on their land. In irrigation villages, almost all of the households having access to the
irrigation scheme have been able to double their crops since the existence of the irrigation scheme. In the case of
Damnak Kanseng (Pursat) some households are even trying a third crop to test the capacity of water supply. Farmers
in the villages expressed their willingness to farm a third crop, but complain about the limited capacity of water supply
and also the lack of secondary and tertiary canals.

 he farmers’ ability to increase the number of crops appears lower in rural road villages (22 percent) and extension
T
villages (27 percent). However, this is unsurprising since it reflects a lower coverage of irrigation in rural road villages.
For Koh Toch village, all farmers practice vegetable cultivation and have been traditionally dependent on pumping
water from the river. Therefore, farmers do not report changes in terms of increasing the number of crops on their land.
In Samreth village, although farmers have access to river water (without reservoir) through pumps, the rehabilitation
of the reservoir allows 27% of the village households to increase their number of crops while the rest also benefit
from easier access to reservoir water.

T
 able F.6 contains a number of factors that the survey tried to understand from the perception of farmers on the level
of influence that each factor may have had on yield. Of all surveyed households, 73 percent reported that the yield
of their agricultural production had increased (100 percent in irrigation villages, 73 percent in extension villages, and
47 percent in rural road villages). Table F.6 presents perceptions of farmers experience yield increases concerning
factor causing the increases.

     and water management has had strong effect on yield of agricultural production. All other factors also have an effect
     on yield. The degree of effect that other factors contribute to yield increase looks fairly good.

      bout 23 percent of farmers reported that the their agricultural production yields have not improved. About 44 percent
     A
     of them explained that pest infection was the major cause of no yield increase and 26 percent indicated drought as
     the factor. Furthermore, farmers in Choim Tamao Keut (Kampong Cham) and Puchrey Chang (Mondulkiri) in the
     north-eastern Cambodia found that too much rain undermined their cash crop and rice production, or even destroyed
     their farm crops.

     Main issues. According to the reports from respondent households, farmers in Koh Toch and Samreth villages did
     not notice any significant problems or challenges in relation to irrigation in their villages. Both villages are located on
     the bank of the river, and thus access the river water for their farm production by using pumps. All households in
     both villages practice vegetable cultivation, but Samreth also use river water for rice farming, while Koh Toch does
     not. Farmers in Puchrey Chang did not report problems associated with irrigation because there is no irrigation in
     existence in the village.

      s reported by farmers, major problems with irrigation and water management include lack of water in the irrigation
     A
     system, lack of distribution canals, both secondary and tertiary canals, and lack of water diversion systems. Lack of
     water in the system is pointed out by 85 percent of the respondents, followed by lack of distribution system (48 percent)
     and lack of water diversion system (39 percent). This implies that while the functioning of the supplementary canals
     (secondary and tertiary canals) is limited, or even absent in some cases, water is still undersupplied to the main
     canals.

      armers reported also problems related to the management of water and maintenance. Both poor management of

     water and lack of maintenance are likely to be explained by the lack or non-existence of management committees or

     in these study villages. Only one village (Trang) in Battambang province had an established FWUC and it tends to
     work well in collecting and managing the water user fees as well as taking responsibility over the operation and
     maintenance of the irrigation system.

Rural roads

Coverage. Among nine villages selected for the survey, rural roads have been improved in eight villages. Koh Toch
is the only village whose roads have never been rehabilitated in the past 10 years. Most roads in the study villages
were last improved 2-3 years ago. Most of the responses from the surveyed households indicate that the road
improvement was mainly financed by CSFs and by Government. Very few households find NGOs or private sector
as source of finance.

Impact of rural road investments. All respondents in the survey agreed that rural road improvement does have a
positive effect on local livelihoods. Based on farmers’ perceptions, the degree of effect of rural road improvement in
irrigation villages is higher than in extension and rural road villages. About 60 percent of the respondents in irrigation
villages feel that road rehabilitation has improved the livelihood of people in the village a lot.

 able F.8 presents the types of benefits that rural road improvements have brought about. According to farmers’
T
perceptions, the degree of impact of rural road improvement is high in terms of reducing transportation times,
increasing the number of journeys/amount of traffic on the road, generating more economic activities in the villages,
allowing more representation of traders to the village, and also improving access to local hospitals and schools.
Better access to local hospitals and schools is rated higher than other benefits of rural road improvement. People also
perceived that road improvements help reduce the cost of transportation, but the degree of impact was perceived
to be relatively low. About 25 percent of the respondents reported that road improvements have not reduced
transportation costs significantly. This is because the benefits from improved roads have been offset by increase in
fuel prices that have caused transportation cost to increase.

A
 s better road conditions facilitate more arrival of traders to the village, almost all respondents agreed that more
traders coming to the village creates more competition and that this has enabled villagers to negotiate better prices.
About 16 percent of respondents find more arrival of traders helps farmers a lot to in getting better prices for their
agricultural products.

 able F.9 illustrates the benefits of rural road improvement as perceived by villagers in quantity measures, in terms
T
of time and cost per journey. In general, people in all surveyed villages experienced shorter travel time, compared to
the time before the road improvement. Farmers spend a less time travelling the same distance since the road was
rehabilitated. In travelling by motorbike to the nearest market from the village, villagers spent on average just half
the time they used to before the road was rehabilitated. Among all surveyed villages, the reduction of travelling time
ranges between 40-60 percent when the road is upgraded.

      verall, the cost of travel/ transportation was also reduced. Unlike the case with travelling time, not all villages
     O
     experienced a similar cost reduction. While villagers in Damnak Kanseng village (Pursat) and in Puchrey Chang village
     (Mondulkiri) find the cost per journey by motodup to their nearest market is reduced about 50 percent, farmers in
     Choim Tamao Keut village (Kampong Cham) and Samreth village (Kampong Speu) see almost no difference between
     travel cost before and after road improvement. In some villages, farmers even reported higher costs of transportation
     since the road rehabilitation. However, people explain that the higher cost of transportation is explained by the
     increased price of fuel despite the road improvement.

     Main issues. As discussed above, the improvement of rural roads yields a number of benefits to local villagers and
     these benefits improve peoples’ livelihoods. Despite this, villagers also observed some problems associated with
     road rehabilitation. The main problems from the viewpoint of villagers include poor quality of road, for example,
     because of a very thin gravel layer. About 80 percent of the respondents agreed that quality of the road rehabilitation
     is still limited and about 38 percent of the respondents were concerned about the lack of ongoing maintenance of
     the road.

     I
     n relation to the concern over the maintenance of the road, villagers indicated that the roads are continually damaged
     by overloaded trucks. Better roads encourage more traffic. Respondents also stated that rains further speed up the
     deterioration of the road, especially during the wet season.

      oor road quality and speedy deterioration of road quality determine the sustainability of the road and the benefits
     P
     that people enjoy. When asked whether the benefits of road improvement will be sustainable, fewer than half of the
     respondents are optimistic that the benefits will stay with them. Only 30 percent of the respondents in irrigation
     villages agreed that roads would be destroyed even more quickly in these villages. In some cases, people do not
     believe that the benefits from road improvement will last longer. Only 17 percent and 3 percent respectively of the
     respondents in Puchrey Chang and Chuntul Maek villages think that the road will continue to benefit villagers.

Conclusions

 nalysing farmer perceptions on public interventions (in particular, the extension services, irrigation, and rural roads),
A
it is suggested that all three types of intervention do have positive impacts in improving the livelihoods of rural
farmers and tend to complement each other though rural road improvement is rated highest according to farmers’
perceptions. Besides their impacts on farm production and price, extension, irrigation, and rural road improvement
are noted to have generated more jobs in the community, and thus extend the positive impacts to employment and
wages of local labourers who are among the landless and land-poor households.

F
 armers find extension helps increase their farm yields by about 20 percent, which increases household incomes.
Although yields increase in irrigation villages appears higher (40 percent), it represents the combined effect of both
extension and irrigation, which means irrigation adds value to the gain from extension and vice versa. The combination
of the effect of extension and irrigation on yield would mean farmers could earn about 20-40 percent higher incomes
from their farm products per crop, if the price of farm products was held constant. However, this is subject to the
variation of production costs. The evidence suggests that while farmers may have to pay fees for water from irrigation,
farmer perceptions suggest that adopting extension advice does not necessarily increase farm production costs.

 armers also rate highly the benefits from rural road improvement. Road rehabilitation tends to add further value
F
to extension services and irrigation. Besides reducing travel time and costs, road improvement facilitates more
economic activities and allows more traders to come to the village. Farmers perceived that the arrival of more traders
to their village helped them to negotiate better prices for their farm products.

     T
      able G.1 presents examples of various CBA analysis of extension, irrigation and rural roads sectors from Cambodia.
     Some very high figures have been calculated, notably for extension activity and especially when this takes place
     at a local scale. In some cases, these probably do reflect actual performance, especially where well focused, and
     efficiently run programs generate direct benefits. In other cases, the high BCRs may have been achieved by ignoring
     the overhead costs involved in managing programs and projects. Irrigation BCRs are also highly variable and are
     strongly affected by the design of the schemes being rehabilitated.

Annex H: Geographical Variation in Effectiveness


 ase studies and project documents suggest that there is a wide variation in the performance of public expenditure in
C
different locations in Cambodia, reflecting the physical potential, the social and economic conditions and the degree
of spatial amenities. Partly in response to this diversity, the Government could use different approaches on their
expenditures in different locations. There are some general patterns that could be expected to apply.

   (a)	Extension is likely to be most effective in areas where existing crop yields have not yet achieved their full
   
       potential. The potential would ideally be calculated from soil quality and from the availability of land and water,
       which could be calculated from soil and land use maps. The gap between actual and potential yields is likely
       to be higher in high potential areas, simply because potential yields are higher. However, this is a simplification
       as there are also extension messages that are designed for more extensive rainfed production, which can also
       provide good returns if existing yields are very low.

        (b)	 For irrigation, the BCR is dictated primarily by whether there are good sites for irrigation. Whilst some good sites
        
             for new irrigation will exist, the highest returns are normally provided when existing schemes are rehabilitated.
             An illustration of the potential variation in irrigation performance is given by the data in the commune database
             on the actual and potentially irrigable areas for each commune, combined with information on actual yields for
             irrigated and non-irrigated cultivation.

        (c)	 For rural roads, the performance of public expenditure is affected by the length of rural roads, the current state
        
             of the roads, the population served and the level of agricultural production. A commune with relatively short
             lengths of road currently in poor condition, with high population and good economic potential will have the
             highest BCRs for rural roads.

 he figures above should be treated as illustrative. The preliminary indication from the figures suggests that there
T
seems to be a relatively higher concentration of potential spatial benefits for extension expenditures in the Northwest
(including Tonle Sap region. For irrigation, the spatial variation seems to suggest that the highest potential returns
on irrigation expenditures comes from main rice growing areas in Northwest (Tonle Sap region) and Southwest (i.e.
the “rice belt”). This result makes an intuitive sense as rice is a main focus of irrigation investments. For rural roads,
the potential is again scattered across much of the country, reflecting the wide variation in circumstances, although
the maps seem to support the assumption that returns to road investments are highest in areas of high agriculture
potential and high population densities (with some outlying areas in Northeastern Cambodia). The maps suggest that,
in view of the scattered range of circumstances, Government prioritisation should focus on establishing procedures
that assess the returns to each individual intervention rather than on attempting to establish regional priorities.

     (SNC) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The SNC includes a Vulnerability and
     Adaptation (V&A) Assessment. The Climate Change Department in the Ministry of Environment has conducted
     a substantial analysis of climate change projections as part of the preparation of the V&A for Cambodia. This has
     included compilation of past data and analysis using the PRECIS model and analysis of 14 Global Climate Models

     for parts of the South and East. Reductions have typically been by about 2 mm/yr. In the wet season, there has been

     rainfall projections for each scenario are presented in Figures I.3 and I.4, showing the seasons across and the periods
     down the array. Red colouring indicates that most GCM models predict a decrease in rainfall and blue colouring
     indicates that most models predict an increase.

     Key conclusions are:
     
       •	   under the high emissions scenario, dry season rainfall will probably decrease and wet season rainfall increase
             in all periods;
       •	   the probabilities of change for dry season are higher than for wet season;
       •	   the wet season may start later; and
       •	   with the low emissions scenario, trends are similar but with lower probabilities, except that wet season
             rainfall may decrease from 2050.

     will change by 2099. Figure I.5 shows the projections for the high emissions scenario. The figure suggests that there

annual rainfall of 40 mm and by having 5 fewer rainy days. Thus, if total wet season rainfall were to increase by 2mm
per year, the frequency of drought would decrease by 12.5 percent (i.e. 1 drought day per year) after a period of
20 years.

Impact on agricultural productivity. The V&A uses historical climate and rice production statistics to estimate that
every additional 10 mm of wet season total rainfall adds 6,500 tons (or about 0.1 percent) to rice production. This
is used to calibrate the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) model so that the impact
of changes in rainfall can be simulated. The analysis was undertaken in 9 rice growing areas, where the required

     soil information was available. With total rainfall increasing by between 1 and 2 mm/year in the South and East,
     production in these areas may increase by 1 percent over 50 years as a result of the increasing rainfall pattern. In the
     North, rainfall may decrease by a similar amount, resulting in an equivalent reduction. The net effect of total rainfall
     changes on rice production is therefore likely to be small.

      he impact of changes in flood and drought frequency may be more important than changes in total rainfall, in view
     T
     of the opportunities for public expenditure to support the development of new varieties and increased water storage
     to deal with this increased variability. The analysis of flood and drought days suggests that, over 50 years, drought
     days may decrease by about 25 percent in the South of the country, with the opposite trends in the North.

     L
      osses from drought and flood vary greatly, but have been about 5.5 percent of total production over the last decade,
     equivalent to about 400,000 tons per year, with a total value of about $80 million. If losses were proportional to the
     number of drought and flood days, then this could increase by 25 percent, or $20 million over the next 25 years.
     Reducing these losses already provides opportunities for public expenditure and these opportunities will be increased
     as a result of the increased frequency of flood and drought events.

     T
      he PRECIS analysis for the V&A also allows an exploration of the changes in seasonality of rainfall. The analysis
     suggests that there will be changes in the start and duration of the wet season. Because temperatures are sufficiently
     high at the end of the wet season to allow most crops to mature, there would be limited impact on crop production if
     the wet season started and finished later, especially if light-insensitive varieties are used. Therefore, the main effects
     of seasonality are the loss of production that would occur if the wet season became shorter. The V&A analysis
     suggests that wet seasons could shorten by at least a month in many regions, although this effect could be reversed
     after 2050 in the low emissions scenario.

     n most crop growing regions, the wet season will still be sufficiently long to allow for one rice crop to be grown,
     I
     especially if short maturing varieties are used. Thus, the main loss of production would come from the inability to
     double crop. In 2007, late wet season rice was grown on over 500,000 ha, or about 25 percent of total rice area with
     total value of $200 million. Much of this would be under threat from a shortened growing season. In addition, a large
     part of the vegetable crop is grown as a second wet season crop and this would also be greatly affected by a reduced
     wet season. There are therefore strong benefits to be gained by breeding and extension for shorter growing varieties
     and for investment in water storage that will allow crops to mature beyond the end of the rainy season.

     Implications for public expenditures. In theory, the production changes due to climate change are marginal. There
     are substantial additional benefits to be gained from production of new crop varieties that are adapted to new climate
     conditions. The order of magnitude of these benefits can be illustrated by considering the implications of crop varieties
     that are able to withstand an additional week of dry period during the growing season. If varieties could be developed
     that were able to survive one additional day of drought or flood, they would reduce average losses from drought from
     about 5.5 percent to about 5.0 percent of total production, which would be worth a total of about $8 million if all
     farmers were able to benefit from the seeds. Given the current unit cost of varietal development of about $1 million,
     the BCRs for improving the drought and flood resilience are high, provided that widespread adoption takes place.

     I
     n practice, much of the benefits of improved drought and flood resilience will come from a gradual diffusion of
     adoption. However, the extension services can accelerate this process. They can also generate substantial additional
     benefits associated with helping farmers adapt to climate change, especially through changes in cultivation practices
     and cropping choices.

 eturns to irrigation are also likely to increase as a result of the increased importance of storing water to protect
R
against increased drought and flood frequency and a shortened wet season growing period. If irrigation water were
used to ensure the survival of a crop during a shortened rainy season the benefits from that irrigation water would be
about twice the benefits gained from standard wet season supplementary irrigation.

T
 he marginal increase in frequency of flood events will increase the frequency of major repairs and the importance
of designing rural roads to survive floods, which may add some additional costs to rural road rehabilitation. However,
the effects of these factors on the overall benefits of rural roads will be small, compared to the effects on research,
extension and irrigation.

this appears to be a gap in the Cambodian NAPA.

C
 urrent expenditure patterns are determined by a complex political and economic process. This process is driven by
a range of objectives, including the reduction of poverty and promotion of growth. Adaptation to climate change will
require some adjustment of expenditure allocation, but the proportion of expenditure that needs to be switched to
activities that promote adaptation depends on national circumstances.

n a country like Cambodia, where the pattern of climate change is both more mixed and more uncertain than in
I
some countries, it is common to argue that expenditure priorities should go to ‘low regret’ options that combine
standard national goals with adaptation, thus leading to low regrets if climate change projections will not materialize
as projected. The low regret policy recognises the possibility that adjustments in favour of climate change expenditure
could be too great.

 o date, climate change activities have focused on the definition of specific projects under the NAPA and the PPCR,
T
rather than on potential adjustments in expenditure patterns. Realignment of capital expenditure can be achieved
through dedicated financing of projects that have some climate change motivation. Donor funding procedures are
already in place to ensure that part of donor funding is sensitive to climate change needs. Government financed
development expenditure is driven by strong political and economic concerns. These are focused on importance
of immediate economic growth, as a means of generating the resources that could be used for more sustainable

     environmental management in the future. These priorities include a relatively high importance for irrigation, which
     will be consistent with climate change adaptation. The low priority assigned to research and extension, however, is
     not consistent.

      he budget processes for recurrent spending also need to take into account the implications of climate change.
     T
     In particular, climate change will increase the importance of funding routine research and extension activities and
     irrigation maintenance.

     The PER analysis provides some guidelines on the target performance that NAPA activities should be expected to
     
     achieve. In particular, it suggests that activities associated with research and extension should be able to achieve
     BCRs of over 3.0. Those involved in irrigation should achieve BCRs of similar levels, especially when they are focused
     on providing protection from possible crop losses as a result of an early end to the wet season. Rural roads are largely
     unaffected by climate change and do not feature in NAPA proposals.

Annex J: A Proposed Outline for a Possible Approach towards Developing
Agriculture Sector SWAp

 ector Wide Approaches (SWAps) have been used in a number of countries as a way of providing greater Government
S
ownership, strengthening policy dialogue between donors and the Government, with resulting changes in policy
environment, improving coordination within the donor community, thereby reducing transaction costs, and ensuring
better continuity of funding.

 ull SWAps involve donors providing funds, alongside Government funding, for a whole sector, against a coherent and
F
agreed policy framework, and a set of common implementation arrangements. In order to maximise local ownership,
funds are ideally channelled through the Government budget, relying on Government procedures for expenditure
approval and reporting. SWAps are normally implemented against a costed work program, including targets and
performance indicators and donors often base some disbursements on achievement of key targets or milestones in
the work program.

nternationally, the SWAp modality has worked quite well in social sectors (i.e. health and education), including
I
Cambodia, where the public services provided tend to be relatively homogeneous (and pure public goods) and largely
under Government control.

 he Cambodian experience of the education sector SWAp has revealed two important lessons. First, effective,
T
coherent and agreed policy and strategy framework can provide the instrument for Government and donors to work
more effectively together. Secondly, the donor community is still concerned with fiduciary risk and is not ready at
this stage to move to a full SWAp with resources being channelled and managed entirely through the Government
budget system. In the education sector SWAp, only one donor, the EU, has engaged in providing sector budget
support as part of its engagement in the SWAp, and the majority of resources continue to be channelled through
parallel arrangements including a basket fund.

SWA
     ps tend to work less well in agriculture, which is private sector by its nature and involves a large heterogeneity in
its functionality, which put it often outside Government and donor control (i.e. relationship between public expenditures
and sector growth rates). The institutional framework is more complicated, with value chain functions (production,
input supply, distribution and trade), which is being carried out by the private sector. In this case, the private sector is
more critical than the public sector in terms of the overall functioning of the sector.

A
 ll the signs are that a full SWAp, including the use of Government financial management arrangements, is unlikely
to be possible in any sector in Cambodia until the general improvements in PFM reforms, including reporting and
accounting procedures that allow departmental spending to be properly monitored, are more deeply embedded.
Whilst PFM reform procedures are leading to improvements, there is still a long way to go before donors can be
persuaded to have their resources fully managed through Government systems.

I
n the case of agriculture and irrigation, it would also be unrealistic to expect a SWAp to be put in place in the
foreseeable future. However, some of the benefits of SWAps could be achieved through developing a partial SWAp
in one or more priority functional areas, especially in ones which are more public goods in their nature. These could
be supported by a Joint Fund (sometimes known as a pool or basket fund), financed by willing donors, and managed

      mechanism, but would allow donors to retain some control of financial approval, reporting and review.

      A
       partial SWAp supported by a Joint Fund should provide many of the benefits of ownership, coordination and
      continuity that are provided by a SWAp, and would help prepare for the possibility of a full SWAp later. At present,
      sectors where a partial SWAp could be appropriate and feasible are research and extension, and perhaps also irrigation
      (from the point of improved efficiency of public spending). This PER shows that agricultural extension has been
      already heavily supported by the donor community in recent years, and there may be a scope for improved efficiency
      from better coordination of donor spending, as well as coordination of work between Government extension services
      and donor funded projects.

key features for a potential partial SWAp operation in the areas of research and extension and irrigation efficiency. The
details of the design of a partial agriculture sector SWAp, would need to be worked out through a dedicated exercise.
The context for a SWAp is currently quite complex as the PFM reforms move forward, at a deliberate but rather slow
pace. It would be thus important to fully understand the shape, pace and progress of PFM reforms (particularly for
policy and budget planning, program budgeting and the use of BSPs, procurement, financial reporting, monitoring
and audit) which would impinge on the design of a SWAp activity.
