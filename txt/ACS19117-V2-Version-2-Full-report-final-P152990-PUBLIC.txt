p.7). Further evidence comes from the OECD’s
Survey of Adult Skills conducted in 2011-2012
across 22 countries and from the secondary
analysis of data conducted by Hanushek et al.
Data from this survey suggests that an increase
of one standard deviation in literacy proficiency
is associated with an average increase of 8%
in hourly wages whilst the corresponding
increase for an increase of one standard
deviation in numeracy proficiency is 17.8%
(OECD, 2013b, p.224).


Secondly, in recognition of the importance of
mathematical skills in a competitive global
economy, many high-income countries whose
students perform at or around the international
average are growing increasingly concerned
about the gap between the mathematical
achievement of their students and that of their
peers in the high-flying economies of East Asia.
However, the situation is far worse for nations in
SSA where, as shown elsewhere in this report,
standards in mathematics are currently
extremely low in both relative and absolute
terms. International data for countries in SSA is
limited but that which is available makes for
disturbing reading. For example, in TIMSS 2011,
Grade 8 students from Korea, Singapore and
Chinese Taipei scored, on average, more than
600 for mathematics – far above the TIMSS
scale centre point of 500. All three participants9
from SSA scored at least one standard
deviation below the international average
(Botswana [397], Ghana [331], and South Africa
[352]) (Mullis et al. 2012 pp. 42-43). For SSA, the
achievement gap in mathematics is so large that
Beatty and Pritchett (2012) predict that it would
take of the order of 130 years for countries in
SACMEQ to reach the current average levels of
the OECD if business continues as usual (Beatty
and Pritchett, 2012, Table 5).



9.	 Ghana met the sampling criteria for Grade 8 students but its average score of 331 placed it at the bottom of the international rank order. Both Botswana and
 	  South Africa tested Grade 9 students and so their scores are not directly comparable with those of Ghana or other TIMSS participants.

Table 3.3:	      SACMEQ levels and behavioural descriptors for mathematics

   Level 1: Pre numeracy
   Applies single-step addition or subtraction operations. Recognises simple shapes. Matches numbers and pictures. Counts in whole numbers.


   Level 2: Emergent numeracy
   Applies a two-step addition or subtraction operation involving carrying, checking (through very basic estimation), or conversion of
   pictures to numbers. Estimates the length of familiar objects. Recognises common two-dimensional shapes.


   Level 3: Basic numeracy
   Translates verbal information presented in a sentence, simple graph or table using one arithmetic operation in several repeated steps.
   Translates graphical information into fractions. Interprets place value of whole numbers up to thousands. Interprets simple common
   everyday units of measurement.


   Level 4: Beginning numeracy
   Translates verbal or graphic information into simple arithmetic problems. Uses multiple different arithmetic operations (in the correct
   order) on whole numbers, fractions, and/or decimals.


   Level 5: Competent numeracy
   Translates verbal, graphic, or tabular information into an arithmetic form in order to solve a given problem. Solves multiple-operation
   problems (using the correct order of arithmetic operations) involving everyday units of measurement and/or whole and mixed
   numbers. Converts basic measurement units from one level of measurement to another (for example, metres to centimetres).


   Level 6: Mathematically skilled
   Solves multiple-operation problems (using the correct order of arithmetic operations) involving fractions, ratios, and decimals.
   Translates verbal and graphic representation information into symbolic, algebraic, and equation form in order to solve a given
   mathematical problem. Checks and estimates answers using external knowledge (not provided within the problem).


   Level 7: Concrete problem solving
   Extracts and converts (for example, with respect to measurement units) information from tables, charts, visual and symbolic
   presentations in order to identify, and then solve multi-step problems.


   Level 8: Abstract problem solving
   Identifies the nature of an unstated mathematical problem embedded within verbal or graphic information, and then translates this
   into symbolic, algebraic, or equation form in order to solve the problem.

findings are particularly relevant here.


First, across participating countries, absolute
levels of achievement are low. PASEC2014
defines three positive levels of mathematical
achievement for both the early primary and late
primary populations. Each level has a detailed
‘Description of Competencies’ and the
boundaries between levels are systematically
linked to the IRT-score scale. The ‘Sufficient
Competency Threshold’ lies between Levels 1
and 2. Students who fall below this threshold

25.	 In the absence of better measures, examination pass rates are often cited as indicators of educational quality and of changes in national levels of achievement.
 	   For example, in the Ugandan Certificate of Education, it was reported that “performance in Mathematics dropped significantly” because the proportion of candi
 	   dates gaining the highest division fell from 4.1% in 2013 to 1.8% in 2014 (Ahimbisbwe, P., 2015). However, other plausible explanations include an increase in the
 	   difficulty of the questions and/or the effect of unintentionally setting slightly higher standards.
26.	 For the purposes of this study, examination boards in six countries were asked by World Bank representatives to supply basic statistical information for their main
 	   examinations in Mathematics. Two boards in Nigeria provided aggregated data but not the subject score distributions and grade thresholds requested. All other

Over the past 20 years, many countries in SSA
have started to implement national assessment
programmes. In order for these to provide
high-quality data for the purpose of strategic
planning, stringent technical standards must be
met. Therefore there is a need for countries to
develop the necessary technical capacities and
to implement rigorous quality assurance
procedures in order to ensure that assessments
are fit for purpose and that conclusions drawn
on the basis of qualitative evidence are sound.


Regional and national assessments conducted
in the past were not well-designed for
detecting, with precision, relatively small
improvements in learning outcomes. As a result,
there is little reliable evidence as to whether
mathematical standards in SSA are improving,
are stagnant, or are declining. Some
assessments – most notably SACMEQ - are now
establishing more secure baselines but others
will need to adopt far more sophisticated
psychometric techniques if they are to provide
reliable information as to the direction of travel.

     	    resigned themselves to failure, without truly attempting all of the questions” and that “many of the children showed signs of anxiety whilst attempting the 		
     	    worksheets, shuffling awkwardly in their seats, glancing at their peers with worried expressions and making negative comments about the difficulty of the current
       	  task” (Ashby, 2009, p.9).

      	   schools “to share their world-class approach to Maths teaching and help further raise standards in the subject” (United Kingdom, 2015). Anecdotal reports
      	   suggest that the exercise has “ encouraged (British) teachers to change the way they approach lesson planning to develop a deep understanding and fluency in
      	   Mathematics” (ibid). but no systematic evaluation as to the impact on student learning has yet been carried out.

The general consensus is that the availability
of textbooks is a key determinant of learning
outcomes especially in developing countries
(Fuller, 1987). UNESCO uses the
student:textbook ratio as a key indicator of the
quality of schooling (UNESCO, 2015a) and the
World Bank holds that, apart from the
provision of qualified and committed teachers,
making textbooks available to all students is
likely to be a more cost-effective way of
raising learner achievement than any other
input (Fredriksen and Brar, 2015). This is
particularly relevant in the case of
mathematics education in SSA because not
only are textbook shortages significant in
many countries, but the textbook remains the
main, if not only, teaching tool for many
teachers. It is suggested that the provision of

the basic skills in numeracy. At higher levels, in
many countries in SSA, low take-up rates and/
or high failure rates in high-stake examinations
are indicators of a mismatch between
the curriculum (as reflected in examination
syllabuses) and the achievement levels
of candidates.


Whilst poor delivery of the curriculum impedes
the progress of learners regardless of gender,
there are additional factors which disadvantage
girls to a greater extent than boys. Some of
these stem from unhelpful views on the
potential of girls to master mathematics whilst
others relate to the use of classroom teaching
strategies that do not encourage girls to
engage and make the best use of their potential
in this critical subject area.


Evidence suggests (Ma, 1999) that the most
effective teachers of mathematics have not
only great subject knowledge but also a
profound understanding of fundamental
mathematics. She suggests that in China, “to
give a student a cup of knowledge, the teacher
needs a bucketful of knowledge” (cited in
Goldenberg, 2007). Is it possible for countries
in SSA to move closer to this approach to the
teaching and learning of mathematics?


Evidence as to the impact of textbooks and
other learning materials on mathematical
achievement is mixed. However, there is strong
evidence to suggest that if teachers can be
persuaded to implement assessment for
learning in their classrooms (and are supported
in doing so) then outcomes will improve.

         Most candidates were able to identify the missing terms in the sequences given. Part (a)(i) was found to be the easiest
         sequence to work out. A few high performing candidates interpreted this sequence in a number of unexpected ways. Although
         their approaches were more complex, the responses which they gave were mathematically correct and they were rewarded
         accordingly. These candidates started bt determing the L.C.M. of the denominators before they could identify a familiar pattern.

        This multiple-choice question from the 2011 mathematics assessment asks students to answer a subtraction problem involving
        two 4-digit numbers. The problem requires students to regroup twice to obtain the correct answer of 1,247 (Choice B). Students
        were not permitted to use a calculator to answer this question.

        Seventy-four percent of fourth-grade students answered this questio correctly. The most common incorrect answer (Choice
        D), selected by 13 percent of the students, resulted from not doing any regrouping and just subtracting the smaller number
        from the corresponding larger number at each place value. Choices A and C, while selected less frequently, represent different
        regrouping errors.

      Developing and delivering technological
      solutions for implementation at scale is both
      technically demanding and expensive. As a
      result, few such initiatives are solely owned or
      controlled by national governments. Many rely
      on external sources of funding from
      international NGOs and/or philanthropic
      groups. Governments may also need to form
      partnerships with for-profit companies
      including, for example, software developers
      and the providers of internet services and
      mobile networks. Such arrangements may in
      the longer-term raise questions as to
      intellectual property rights and have
      implications for sustainability.


      The sustainability of technological solutions is
      of concern especially in the resource-poor and
      often insecure context of SSA’s schools. The
      problem is generally less serious in e-learning
      programmes where teachers and/or learners
      access materials through their own digital
      devices and in m-learning programmes where
      TLM’s are delivered through a mobile phone
      (e.g. Elimu kwa Teknolojia). However,
      sustainability is of major concern in
      programmes which require schools to be
      equipped with highly specialised and/or
      expensive equipment (e.g. Digital School in a
      Box and Tablet-based Learning). In this case,
      many fundamental questions have to be asked
      including: Who within the school is to be
      responsible for the safe keeping of the
      equipment? How will the hardware be
      maintained and what happens if something
      goes wrong with the software? How will
      obsolete equipment be replaced and who will
      pay? The long-term sustainability of
      programmes designed to enhance learning in
      SSA through the use of educational
      technologies is an area worthy of
      further research.

to check that their knowledge is up-to-date.


The minimum entry requirement for
prospective primary school teachers is a
qualification gained after four years of
secondary education (i.e. equivalent to
O-level). Somewhat surprisingly, it was
reported that a pass in mathematics at this
level is not a requirement. Both colleges for
the preparation of primary teachers reported
that in the current academic year they were
“undersubscribed and many places were left
unfilled”. All respondents agreed with the
statement “we face problems attracting high
quality applicants to train as teachers”.


During the initial three-year teacher training
programme for primary school teachers, the
colleges reported that just one to two hours
per week are dedicated to the subject of
mathematics. This is far fewer than the level
reported in other countries in our study.

The colleges reported that trainee primary
school teachers are typically aged 20-23 on
admission. The minimum entry requirement is a
qualification gained after 13 years of education
(i.e. equivalent to A-level). In all cases a pass in
mathematics is said to be required. Two
colleges said that they were undersubscribed
for the current academic year and that it was
difficult to attract sufficient applicants. The
other college said that supply and demand
were roughly balanced. All colleges agreed with
the statement “we face problems attracting
high quality applicants to train as teachers”.


During the initial three-year teacher training
programme for primary school teachers, up to
four hours per week only are dedicated to the
subject of mathematics. Trainees undergo a
short practicum (between two to four weeks) in
each of the first two years and a longer
practicum (between 8-12 weeks) in the third
year. In all colleges, trainees are required to
pass examinations at the end of their first year.

employs about 185 tutors. Relatively few (up to
12) of these are specialists in mathematics and/
or mathematics education. The minimum
qualification required for tutors is a first degree.
The colleges preparing primary teachers
require their tutors to have some teaching
experience at the primary level. The other
college also requires its tutors to have prior
teaching experience. All three colleges said that
their tutors are required to participate in some
form of continuous professional development
but none requires its tutors to periodically
refresh their skills in a school environment or to
undergo any form of periodic appraisal.


During the initial three-year teacher training
programme for primary school teachers, three
to four hours per week are dedicated to the
subject of mathematics. In all colleges, trainees
are required to pass examinations at the end of
their first year but the reported failure rates
were extremely low (-3%). Whilst
acknowledging that our sample is small and
probably not representative, the responses to
the attitudinal part of the questionnaire were
not encouraging. None agreed that “teaching in
primary schools is a highly respected
profession” and all agreed that they faced
difficulties in “attracting high quality applicants
to train as teachers”.
