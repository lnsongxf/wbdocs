    Guiding principles
    The whole architecture of the food safety regulatory system needs
    to be built upon the following key elements:


                     •	 Food safety is not ensured by adhering to external, visible rules such as statutory
                        legislation or other elements such as private standards requirements – they cannot be
                        enough. Food safety results from a constant attention to processing specific hazards
                        and how they relate to products.

                     •	 Problems will occur, since there is no fail-proof system. It is essential to build the system
                        around rapid detection of contamination and outbreaks and appropriate reaction,
                        including recalls and swift and effective communication.

                     •	 Food safety results from consideration being given to the entire food chain. No part of
                        it can be viewed in isolation because all are essential to total product safety.

                     •	 Regulatory and enforcement resources are limited, as are private sector resources, so
                        there should be risk evaluation and analysis. The focus should be on critical risks that
                        are both product and process specific, rather than on trying (and failing) to address
                        everything, everywhere, all the time. A food safety regulatory system needs to provide
                        for:
                       •	 risk assessment – the process of identifying food safety hazards, assessing likelihood
                          of occurrence and severity, and evaluating the significance;

                       •	 risk management – the coordinated and economical application of resources to mini-
                          mize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of food-borne incidents;
                          and

                       •	 risk communication – the process of ensuring that the logic, outcomes, significance,
                          and limitations of the risk assessment are clearly understood by all stakeholders.


                     •	 Harmonization of rules and measures with international standards is essential for
                        implementation of a scientifically sound system.

                     •	 Transparency in decision making enhances the consumers’ and trade partners’ trust in
                        the food safety system.

                     •	 Everyone has a role to play in ensuring food is safe, including food business operators,
                        their employees, regulators, and consumers. The concept of shared responsibility with
                        responsibilities should be clearly defined.

    Fundamental pillars
    Food safety reform should be based on eight
    fundamental pillars:


    Pillar 1               Food safety should be secured along the entire food chain (plough to plate, farm to
                           fork, stable to table) thus covering all potential hazards emerging from primary production,
                           processing, transportation/distribution, retail, catering, food service and home use of food.
                           One of the issues is that each link in the food chain has limited or no ability to control other
                           links in the chain. Good regulation and enforcement can help to address this. Production of
                           raw materials, all inputs and outputs in food production, and all materials coming into contact
                           with food should be covered by regulatory frameworks. Regulations should be implemented
                           and enforced in line with food law and enforcement codes of practice.

    Pillar 2               Regulation by itself cannot ensure food safety. The overarching principle of effective and
                           efficient food safety regulation is that regulation by itself cannot ensure or deliver food safety.
                           It is only one of several elements in the food safety system. In most countries engaging in
                           reform, the pre-existing situation is very much the opposite: everyone (consumers, regulators,
                           businesses) assumes that safety is something “externally imposed” by rules and enforcement
                           (effectively or not, and very often not effectively).

                     Coordination, cooperation, and collaboration among these institutions are essential, as is fluid
                     communication. Building a single food safety agency (if this approach is taken) may never be
                     enough, because this agency could never consolidate all the functions of veterinary medicine
                     and human health care, with which it needs to have a constant interface. There is no such
                     thing as an agency that would really cover all aspects of food safety even if it purports to do so.
                     Conversely, national governments that have food safety responsibilities spread among several
                     different departments or agencies may encounter issues of overlap and potential communica-
                     tion difficulties. It is critical to the effective management of food safety as a public health issue
                     that whichever approach is taken, the benefits and deficits of each approach are recognized
                     and understood. Certainly, having oversight of issues at government level, such as the follow-
                     ing, as part of a combined strategy is beneficial:

                     A collaborative relationship between the food industry, academia, national, and non-gov-
                     ernmental and intergovernmental organizations is needed to improve food safety and public
                     health protection.
