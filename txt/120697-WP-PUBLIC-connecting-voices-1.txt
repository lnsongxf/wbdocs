Building Trust & Institutions
                                         Governments and institutions must have the trust of citizens if they are
                                         to deliver services and achieve positive development outcomes. With-
                                         out such trust, citizens could disengage from the state. Enhancing
                                         transparency, accountability, and participation helps build trust. This is
                                         why the World Bank’s Financial Management unit in MENA decided to
                                         launch the Connecting Voices of MENA initiative, or, as we like to call it,
                                         CV MENA. CV MENA, more details next page, is a regional partnership
                                         that promotes improved financial management practices in both the
                                         public and private sectors. Its aim is to support the demands of citizens
                                         throughout the Arab World for better governance, a voice in public
                                         affairs, and social and economic inclusion. By fostering greater trans-
                                         parency, accountability, and participation, CV MENA hopes to promote
                                         greater investment in the region. CV MENA plans to take advantage of
                                         the windows of opportunity for change that are now open in the region.
                                         It will support capacity building in the area of financial management,
                                         facilitate the development of a professional community, and support
                                         the sharing and transfer of knowledge both within countries and across
                                         the region as a whole.

                                         The CV MENA journey started in April 2013 with a Boot Camp in Leba-
                                         non—"Control, Audit and Inspection in the Middle East"—with partici-
                                         pants from Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Morocco. Another Boot Camp in
                                         Egypt covered "Good Practices in Supreme Audit Institutions." Then, our
                                         two main events, or Exchanges—“Public Financial Accountability in a
                                         Changing Environment” in Abu Dhabi, and “ Strengthening Accountancy
                                         as a Foundation for MSME Sector Growth and Job Creation” in Jordan—
             Hisham WALY                 drew nearly 500 participants from across the region. CV MENA is not
                                         just about training; we work with our clients on specific issues, con-
     Manager, Financial Management       straints, and bottlenecks to find together the solutions that best fit the
            MENA, The World Bank         local context. We do not try to impose so-called “best practices” or
                                         “pre-packaged solutions,” but rather we aim to be responsive to regio n-

                                         To help communicate beyond those who attend CV MENA events and to

                                         ago we launched a virtual magazine on our CV MENA website. Now we
                                         are taking the magazine one step further. This is the inaugural print
                                         edition of the magazine; 5,000 copies are being distributed around the
                                         MENA region and to select locations across the globe. The print edition
                                         of CV MENA Magazine will be published four times a year.

                                         This magazine is designed to share knowledge about public financial
                                         management and corporate financial reporting, and to feature current
                                         and relevant news, articles, and books from around the region and the
                                         world. We plan to share this information with financial management

The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote
transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. To become a member of OGP, partici-
pating countries must endorse a high-level Open Government Declaration; deliver a country action plan developed with public consultation, and
commit to independent reporting on their progress going forward. Since 2011, OGP has grown from 8 countries to the 62 participating countries,
including Jordan in MENA.

The Open Budget Initiative is a global research and advocacy program to promote public access to budget information and the adoption of
accountable budget systems. International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the initiative with the Open Budget Survey—a com-
prehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether governments give the public access to budget information and opportunities to partici-
pate in the budget process at the national level. The IBP works with civil society partners in 100 countries to collect the data for the Survey.
The first Open Budget Survey was released in 2006 and is conducted biennially. To easily measure the overall commitment of the countries
surveyed to transparency and to allow for comparisons among countries, IBP created the Open Budget Index (OBI) from the Survey.

CVMENA: From your experience in supporting SAIs, what would you
say are the key challenges SAIs face today?

Mona: There is no doubt that the SAI is a key player in a country’s public
financial management system, providing comfort to parliaments, citi-
zens, and others that the government is managing their finances well.
The reality in many countries that SAIs lack the independence, authori-
ty, skills, and resources to carry out thorough audits and to report the
results freely and in a timely way. But during the last few years, there
has been high demand for greater accountability, especially from such
unconventional parties as citizens, the media, and civil society organiza-
tions. The power of the people has never been stronger than it is today
in MENA, and there is huge pressure on the region’s SAIs to step up to
the challenge and work on strengthening their value in improving peo-
ple’s lives. The complexity becomes greater when the government is far
behind in terms of strategic planning, performance or results-oriented
budgeting, accounting and reporting, and transparency.


CVMENA: What are the key challenges facing development partners
that are interested in helping SAIs?

Mona: The main challenge continues to be sustainability! Is the capacity
that has been or is to be developed sustainable? How to ensure that the
advances made are not lost or even reversed after the cooperation
ends? How to ensure that the knowledge gained is absorbed and sys-
                                                                                     Mona EL CHAMI

Questions like these are usually related to how ready the SAI is to
change and how aware it is of the critical need to get its house in order,
define its priorities, complement its staff skills with additional expertise,
improve its communications strategy, and protect its credibility and
relevance.


CVMENA: What advice would you give your colleagues from the Bank
or other development partners when planning to support SAIs ’ institu-
tional capacity building?

Mona: SAIs’ ownership and management, leadership, commitment, and
flexibility are definitely ingredients for successful operations. In addition
to guaranteeing all of that, I advise them to collaborate with INTOSAI,
the regional professional bodies, and other development partners to
ensure complementarity of resources and programs. I would also advise
them to target both the SAIs’ organizational capacity (planning, moni-
toring and evaluation, etc.) and their professional audit capacity, and
not to forget the capacity of the SAI to deal with the external environ-
ment. Always start with an assessment (or use a current available as-
sessment) to measure performance; and when enhancing audit meth-
odologies, ensure that pilot audits are conducted, audit manuals are
revised, and a structured program of training is maintained.




The International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) operates as an umbrella organisation for the external gov-
ernment audit community. For more than 50 years it has provided an institutionalised framework for supreme audit institutions to promote devel-
opment and transfer of knowledge, improve government auditing worldwide and enhance professional capacities, standing and influence of mem-
ber SAIs in their respective countries. INTOSAI is an autonomous, independent and non-political organisation. It is a non-governmental organisation
with special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations.

The MENA MSME Facility comes under the umbrella of the Arab World
Initiative (AWI). It is supported by two trust funds, one managed by
the IFC, and another managed by the World Bank.

The activities covered by the trust fund are expected to contribute to a
sustainable improvement in inclusive (region, gender, youth) MSME
development in the MENA region through improving the business
environment, building the capacity of financial institutions and en-
hancing the capacity of MSMEs. This will ultimately contribute to job
creation, poverty reduction and overall inclusive economic growth.

Meet Gabriella
Gabriella became involved in international development quite by
accident. As a recent graduate of the University of Dayton, Gabriella
participated in a summer service program that placed her in rural El
Salvador assisting a small women's cooperative, MIBERLIM. The ob-
jective of this summer was to support MIBERLIM in strengthening
their accounts to prepare them for receiving small grants from local
and national governments. What resulted was a change in her life's
direction. Since that summer in Berlin, el Salvador, Gabriella has been
active in the fielf of financial sector development.

The Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) Initia-
tive is a joint World Bank/IMF program developed in the wake of the
financial crises of the late 1990s to strengthen the international finan-
cial architecture. The initiative includes 12 modules that focus on
standards and codes areas, including accounting and auditing, which
are key to a country’s risk assessment and economic framework. The
global financial community considers the use of internationally recog-
nized standards and codes necessary to provide a framework to
strengthen domestic institutions, identify potential vulnerabilities, and
improve transparency. Ultimately the ROSC Initiative aims to enhance
countries’ resilience to shocks, support their risk asses sment, and
strengthen important pillars of the market economic system. It contrib-
utes to greater national and international financial stability by review-    Presented by

“
The title of the discussion now is “Public Fi-
nancial Accountability in a Changing Envi-
ronment.” Obviously this is a very diplomatic
way of saying “in an environment of extreme
political change.” This is really what we're
talking about. And even though Iraq has not
gone through political change or extreme
political change in the last two years, we feel
we have been going through political change
for the last 10 years. So some countries are
newer to this than others. The political
change that has happened in the last few
years has brought with it a number of very
good things, and a number of perhaps not
such good things.

But certainly what it has brought with it is a
tidal wave of civil society activism and youth
activism, which it is going to be very difficult
for any government from now on to ignore or
to suppress. And what this wave of civil soci-
ety is demanding is what is broadly called
democracy. But if you really unpackage the
term, what they’re looking for is responsible,
accountable government, and participation.
Obviously they're also looking for jobs and so
on; we have an ever-growing youth bulge in
the MENA region, with very many unem-

The first two decades of the 21 century have witnessed an influx of innovations and reforms in public financial management. The current wave of
reforms is markedly different from those in the past, owing to the sheer number of innovations, their widespread adoption, and the sense that they
add up to a fundamental change in the way governments manage public money.

This book takes stock of the most important innovations of the past two decades—fiscal responsibility legislation, fiscal rules, medium-term budget
frameworks, fiscal councils, fiscal risk management techniques, performance budgeting, and accrual reporting and accounting. Not merely a hand-
book or manual describing practices in the field, the volume instead poses critical questions about innovation —what issues and challenges have
appeared along the way, including those associated with the global economic crisis; and how the ground can be prepared for the next generation of
public financial management reforms.



Decisions about "who gets what, when, and how" are perhaps the most
important that any government must make. So it should not be remarkable

Among the major challenges also facing the sector are non-conducive legal
and regulatory frameworks, poor financial infrastructure, information
asymmetry, and a weak judicial and legal system. Moreover, there are non-
financial challenges: lack of adequate business development services, en-
terprise managerial and marketing skills, advanced technology, and skilled
labor. All this hinders the development of the SME sector in the MENA re-
gion.
