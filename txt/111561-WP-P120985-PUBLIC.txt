Component leaders at CS the following general issues were covered:
    -     Change of management on the Consortium side
          From October 2015 Dieter Sarreither took over as new President of Destatis from Ro-
          derich Egeler, who has been strongly involved in the KAZSTAT project. Mr. Sarreither
          will continue to monitor the project on the Consortium side.

-   Contract revision
    A supplement to the Twinning Contract has been signed in February 2015 for the re-
    duction of the project budget by 1,500,000 US$ on the basis of savings from imple-
    mented project activities. In the meantime, projections of total project expenses indi-
    cate that due to several factors the budget is likely to exceed the now reduced con-
    tract value. These factors include a higher number of study visit participants and a
    significant number of additional activities/conference participations financed from the
    contract budget. For this reason it has been decided that the Consortium will provide
    updated figures on expected project expenses and the contract will be revised ac-
    cordingly as soon as the necessary changes are clear. It is not planned to remove ac-
    tivities from the work plan. The higher number of participants in study visits and the
    implementation of additional activities have been agreed because of their benefits to
    the project, particularly for enabling a closer coordination between divisions in areas
    where more than one division is affected.
-   Work Plan
    The project partners agree that the procedure of revising the Work Plan before the
    half-yearly project management meetings should be upheld. The respective other
    partner should be informed of any ongoing revision.
-   Terms of Reference
    CS has submitted terms of reference for 19 activities to be implemented in 2016 out
    of a total of 69 planned activities. Outstanding documents should be sent by the end
    of November 2015 in order to facilitate planning.
-   Future events
-   A seminar for honoring 95 years of Kazakh statistics will be organized by CS on 4
    November 2015 and will be used to showcase the progress of the project work to a
    wider audience in Kazakhstan. HLPM6 is planned to take place in April 2016 in Ger-
    many. The final conference will be organized in Astana in November 2016.

Notes on further planning

In 2013, as part of sub-component A1 "Improvement of interactions between the state bod-
ies" CS received a consultation mission aimed at revision of existing agreements (joint or-
ders).
Prior to the completion of the KAZSTAT project, CS will make amendments and additions to
the existing legal acts regulating the issues of interaction with the state bodies, which will
allow maximal use of administrative data.
In 2014, under the sub-component A1 "Improved communication between the public authori-
ties" realized a study visit on the theme “Inter-agency cooperation in the use of administrative
data for statistical purposes”
Together with Division of classification and informational technologies, Department of statis-
tical activities planning estimated the proportion of administrative data use (number of rec-
ords from administrative sources) in the production of statistical information for 2013 (in the
framework of the method of estimations of Statistics Finland). As a result of the calculation,
the proportion of data used amounted to 90.3%.
In 2015, as part of component A1 "Improved communication between the public authorities.",
CS plans to hold consultations with the involvement of local consultants (Companies). The
Committee, together with the Institute of Legislation under the Ministry of Justice of the Re-
public of Kazakhstan, decided to establish a working group comprising representatives of
governmental agencies.
To review existing legislation and to develop a common position, the Committee facilitated
meetings with representatives of state bodies on improvement of legislation in the field of the
state statistics. Based on the results of the workshops a joint decision was made that the
Committee has to submit proposals for amendments and additions to the Law on State Sta-
tistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan, as well as to the current legislation of Kazakhstan deal-
ing with matters of state statistics in the framework of codes and laws that govern the public
authority and its agencies (Protocol were signed, comparative table of the proposals of state
bodies was drawn up).
Currently, CS is in the process of local consultants’ selection, these consultants shall provide
expert assistance to improve legislation in the field of state statistics. CS decided to attract
legal consulting company and not a separate consultant to ensure coverage of all relevant
issues.

Recommendations
                                                                                                    19
After becoming familiar with the system of maintaining the reference metadata and quality
indicators at the ISTAT, we consider it useful if the practices studied are applied for creating
the module „Quality“ in the Metadata Information System of the Committee for Statistics, Min-
istry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
1.     The Division for Planning Statistical Activities together with sectoral divisions should
       develop quality indicators.
2.     The Classification and Information Technologies Division should set the objectives for
       module development in the Integrated Information System „e-Statistics“ to assess the
       quality of statistical surveys and products based on the requirements established by
       the Division for Planning Statistical Activities.
3.     The Division for Planning Statistical Activities should develop the quality reports struc-
       ture for setting objectives in the Integrated Information System „e-Statistics“.
4.     The Classification and Information Technologies Division together with the Law Divi-
       sion and the Division for Planning Statistical Activities should consider including
       „glossary“ and „vocabulary“ into the regulatory documents of the Committee for Sta-
       tistics, Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
5.     The Classification and Information Technologies Division together with the Law Divi-
       sion and the Division for Planning Statistical Activities should study the issue of com-
       piling a common vocabulary for statistical terminology, metadata and quality of statis-
       tical processes at the Committee for Statistics.
6.     The Division for Planning Statistical Activities should design an annex to the Guide-
       lines for the Documentation Quality within the Quality Management System „Recom-
       mendations for Quality Reporting“.
7.     The Division for Planning Statistical Activities should design an annex to the Guide-
       lines for the Documentation Quality within the Quality Management System „Inst ruc-
       tions for Statistical Product Quality Assessment“.
8.     The Division for Planning Statistical Activities should consider arranging methodologi-
       cal audits using the ISTAT practices.



A Consulting mission (A5-KAZ-5) on the topic “Development of tools of quality mainte-
nance (GSBPM)" has been carried out in September 2015 by an expert from Statistics Ice-
land.
The expected outcome of this mission was the following:


1. The first version of CS organization specific adaption of the Generic Statistics Business
   Process Model (GSBPM) has been developed. This version is in the local language and is
   closely analogous to the GSBPM.




                                                                                              20
2. The Committee’s quality management documentation by developing a structure for pr o-
   cess mapping and documentation using the CS GSBPM and basic approaches according
   to ISO 9001 and ISO 10013 has been updated.
3. At least one employee with basic knowledge and skills will be able to use standard proce-
   dures for describing the process of statistical information production by public authorities,
   and will be able to continue process mapping and documentation after the consultant has
   left.
4. Some understanding of the connections between GSBPM, Generic Statistical Information
   Model (GSIM), and the Single Integrated Metadata Structure (SIMS) has been gained.
5. At least three different processes for three different statistical products have been
   mapped, including references to the GSBPM and quality indicators from the SIMS.


Conclusions
On the strategic level it was felt that it would strengthen CS’s quality system if the responsi-
bility of its implementation would be moved to a separate department. It would be ideal if the
head of this new department would be part of the top management team. The role of a quali-
ty management department would be to facilitate the implementation of the QM system to-
gether with the management team at CS.
Also on a strategic level, it was felt that a better vision for the quality management system is
needed. The vision should be communicated by training and on occasions when top man-
agement and middle management are communicating to employees. The vision should be
written as text and be shown on a schematic drawing showing the components of the quality
management system and how they are interrelated.
In the coming months (and even years) lots of time and effort will be devoted in to process
mapping. It is important for everyone involved never to forget why this is being done and how
this is a part of a bigger system, that is to say the QM system.
On a more tactic level it was felt that the people in the working group for quality need more
support to be fully self-sufficient in supporting their colleagues at CS in the process mapping
that lies ahead. In the coming years, CS needs to have quality professionals that are able to
help with the process mapping and quality implementation in general. This includes educat-
ing and training of other employees, including employees in the regional offices. It is im-
portant to understand that the quality professionals should not be made responsible for pro-
cess mapping in the production process; their role is rather to plan the work, structure it, help
and facilitate. It needs to be clear where the responsibility of documentation lies, but it could
be the role of a quality professional to come up with suggestions on how this responsibility
can be organized. At the same time as process mapping is structured around the GSBPM,
responsibilities need to be organized around the organizational chart.

Recommendations and next steps

Recommendation 1:


                                                                                              21
The future vision for CS and its quality system should be revisited to make it more clear how
it is supposed to look like in few years. What are the components of the quality system and
how are they interrelated? It is recommended that the quality system is based on the PDCA.
Recommendation 2:
It should be considered if creating a separate department, dealing with quality management,
should be established and if this would strengthen the implementation effort of the quality
system. The role of the quality department needs to be very clear. Doing recommendation 1
first would help in defining a clear role description for this new department.
Recommendation 3:
The process mapping needs to continue. It is recommended that the structuring and the or-
ganization of the process maps are done according to CS´s high level process map and the
GSBPM. However, the responsibilities of creating the process maps need to be organized
according to the organizational chart. The overall structuring and planning of the process
mapping is an activity that needs to take place soon.
Recommendation 4:
Since it is the responsibility of the production units to map up their own processes, they will
need help and support. This could be one of the responsibilities of a quality department. The
support can be in the form of education, motivation, training, and facilitation. The people giv-
ing this support need to have knowledge and experience in process mapping.
Recommendation 5:
To make process mapping quicker and easier, some kind of a process mapping tool, like
Microsoft Visio, should be considered.
Recommendation 6:
It is recommended that in future study visits, CS considers to go to the statistical offices in
Turkey and Estonia to study their use of the GSBPM.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Currently CS is working on the issue of facilitating methodological audits base on the ISTAT
experience shared during the SV.
CS has also prepared a plan of GSBPM implementation. It was already approved by the Pro-
tocol.




                                                                                                  22
Notes on further planning

CS is planning to design guidelines for the development of modules in the integrated infor-
mation system "e-Statistics" to assess the quality of statistical observations and products.
Continue development of the common vocabulary of statistics terminology in CS.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the results of activities carried out since the beginning of implementation of the
Project on the Design and Development of a Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing, the
following tasks have been completed under the study visit B1-SV-0 (October 2012) and ex-
pert missionB1-KAZ-1 (December 2012):
1. In 2013, technical documentation for the CAPI system creation was prepared, the CAPI
system was designed and a pilot project was implemented.
2. In view of modifications in the CAPI operation scheme, the improved Terms of Refer-
ence for the CAPI design and implementation (hereinafter - ToR) was reviewed and agreed
with the authorized IT development body and approved by the Deputy Chairperson of the
Committee for Statistics under the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakh-
stan on October 30, 2014.
3. Based on the ToR, a Schedule of Activities on the CAPI Design and Implementation for
2014-2015 was prepared and approved by the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Sta-
tistics on November 26, 2014.
4. In this regard, contract agreement KZSTAT/NCB-04 “CAPI Design and Implementation”
was extended on December 22, 2014 to prolong the cooperation with service providers.
CAPI is one of the data collection methods, so the system involves only data collection. Data
is stored, processed and distributed using the e-Statistics IIS. In this regard, it is provided for
the integration of CAPI with the e-Statistics IIS, i.e. the introduction of CAPI as part of the e-
Statistics IIS. For telephone surveys, CAPI will use the e-Statistics classifications, meta de-
scriptions and data from the previous reporting period.
The initialization of communication between CAPI and the related systems of e-Statistics will
be carried out automatically upon the request from a related system.

Scheme of interaction between CAPI and e-Statistics

CAPI is being designed. In particular, forms for price statistics and household sample sur-
veys have been designed as part of data collection sub-system design.

                                                                                                       25
The Data Collection Preparation and Control Subsystem (Workstation) for household sample
survey has been designed for launching a pilot. A CAPI (Workstation) portal has been de-
ployed at the Internal Intranet Portal of e-Statistics. To date, data on household sample sur-
veys for Quarter I of 2015 has been entered in the Data Collection Preparation and Control
Subsystem (Workstation).
Following the data entry, data is verified, i.e. is verification of compliance with the data col-
lected and processed during Quarter I by the current software. As soon as verification is
completed, data for Quarter II and III of 2015 will be entered, as well as the system will be
improved based on the feedback from users.
Data Collection Preparation and Control Subsystem (Workstation) for price statistics has
been designed in accordance with the task assignment. The specialists of Price Statistics
Division have pre-tested the software operability. Pilot is planned to be launched in early Oc-
tober.
CAPI has been integrated with the e-Statistics systems to:
   – use statistical classifications used in the forms;
   – provide access for the specialists of the Committee and its territorial offices to the Work-
   station by deploying the Workstation at the Internal Portal in the form of a portlet;
   – transfer data from Tablet PC via the Workstation to the primary data base (have been
   tested) in the .xml format;
   – obtain the description of forms in the .xml format;
   – obtain the list of surveyed households for collecting data on household survey.
Based on the results of activities carried out since the beginning of the CATI Development
Project, the following tasks have been completed under the study visit B1-SV-1 KR (May
2013) and expert mission B1-KAZ-2 (September 2013)
1. Technical Specification for Purchasing Services to Design Terms of Reference for CATI
Creation was prepared, reviewed and agreed with the Committee for Communication, IT de-
velopment and Information under the Ministry of Investments and Development of the Re-
public of Kazakhstan (in letter No. 03-06/3094 dated June 19, 2014) and the World Bank.
2. The service provider was selected and the contract “Preparing Project Documents for th
CATI System” No. KZSTAT/CQ-05 dated November 26, 2014 was signed. Since it is neces-
sary to clarify the scheme of operation, the contract was extended until June 1, 2015 by
Supplementary Agreement No. 1 to Contract KZSTAT/CQ-05 dated March 30, 2015
3. The service provider undertook pre-project study and produced Study Report dated Feb-
ruary 05, 2015.
4. After the pre-project study, the Service Provider proposed the variants of the CATI archi-
tecture and the concerned divisions of the Committees jointly defined the most appropriate
variant of the CATI architecture. Moreover, positions of interviewers’ and supervisors’ work-
places were defined up to the oblast level. The CATI operation scheme also includes integra-
tion with e-Statistics which is similar to the integration of CAPI in e-Statistics (Fig. 1).



                                                                                              26
5. Based on the above decisions, the Terms of Reference “Computer Assisted Telephone
Interviewing of the Committee for Statistics under the Ministry of National Economy of the
Republic of Kazakhstan” were prepared.
6. The ToR was reviewed and agreed with the authorized IT development body (Committee
for Communication, IT development and Information under the Ministry of Investments and
Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan, hereinafter- CCITDI) and approved on August
04, 2015.
7. Technical Specification for Purchasing Services for CATI has been prepared and sent to
the CCITDI for reviewing and agreeing (letters by the Committee for Statistics No. 41-10-
27/1574-И dated August 12, 2015 and No. 41-10-27/4210 dated September 17, 2015 after
receiving a number of comments).
Due to the delay in reviewing the ToR by the authorized IT development body and ToR ap-
proval in August of the current year, time frames for the implementation of the Action Plan for
the CAPI Design and Implementation in the Committee for Statistics under the Ministry of
National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan (hereinafter – the Plan)are being revised.
In this regard, the World Bank was requested to postpone the consultation mission and con-
duct it after the pilot survey (the preliminary date of consultation mission B1-KAZ-4 on CAPI
is Quarter II of 2016).

Notes on further planning

The consultation mission B1-KAZ-3 on CAPI is scheduled for October 2015. The mission will
be based on the results of the pilot price collection in Astana and Almaty cities and collection
of household survey data in Astana city using CAPI.
For Quarter IV 2015, it is planned to select a service provider for creating CAPI and start the
corresponding works after reviewing the technical specification for purchasing services for
CAPI

B3     Updating hardware and software

Implemented activities

In 2014, the SPSS software have been purchased for statistical processing (10 licenses) and
transferred to subject-matter divisions for practical use.
Following the Procurement Plan for 2014, the following peripheral equipment has been pur-
chased and delivered to the central office and territorial units: 330 multifunction printers,
15 copiers, 500 laser printers, 18 color laser printers and 69 laptops
A tender for purchasing personal computers and UPSs for the central office and territorial
units took place in early 2015. The result is that 1,550 PCs and the same number of UPSs
were purchased and delivered (the total number includes the equipment for the central office
and oblast departments of statistics).

Notes on further planning

With regard to purchasing of statistical analysis software: In coordination with the National
Accounts Division, it is planned to study the market for the given category of the software
with a view to select the best possible product both in terms of its capabilities and capacity to
meet the requirements of statistical analysis and in terms of purchasing cost.




                                                                                              29
B4     Development of communications network and telecommunication channels

Implemented activities

In 2014, the CS network hardware was updated. Pre-commissioning works were completed.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Call prompter switches and server hardware have been purchased in the purpose of im-
provement of informatics infrastructure for e-Statistics IIS and modernization of local compu-
ting network and server hardware of the central office. Based on the experts’ recommenda-
tions from South Korea, new network hardware has been installed according to approved
architecture of the CS local computing network.
To the moment, networking equipment (high-performance core switches and safety equip-
ment) is supplied and installed in the racks. Transition to the mentioned equipment has not
yet done. This is due to incomplete network splitting (the network with the Internet traffic and
confidential data networks). At the moment, works are carried out to move services requiring
connection to the Internet on the site of the National Information Technologies JSC under the
contract for the provision of Collocation services. Server for CAPI Information System has
already been transferred. The DNS-server for the stat.gov.kz domain is currently being set
up. Upon completion of the set up, test switching to new networking equipment can be per-
formed. If switching is successful, it would then be considered that the modernization of net-
working infrastructure of the central office is completed.

Notes on further planning

It is planned to update the main network and server hardware of the CS territorial bodies in
2015.
In this regard, data sheets for the mentioned equipment were prepared and sent for re-
view/reconciliation.

Findings and results

A Training Course (C2-KAZ-6) on “Inspirational Leadership through Periods of Change” has
been conducted in June/July 2015 in Astana by two experts.
This training course was the first of a series of three designed to address a number of specif-
ic Leadership and Managerial issues and challenges identified during the earlier project pro-
grams. The main course objectives were to provide participants with an opportunity to: de-
velop strategies to help address current and future leadership and managerial challenges
that they face; develop managerial and leadership skills with a greater focus on performance
related implementation within Committee for Statistics; enhance internal and external com-
munication, team working and relationships with all client groups; enhance their ability to an-
ticipate and respond to the changing environment as it affects them and those around them;
                                                                                               34
increase self-awareness of their impact on statistician and non-statistician client groups and
enhance confidence in exercising leadership behaviours in the above context; and to develop
a network of support. Prior to the start of the training programme, the participants were asked
to identify specific work place managerial and leadership challenges that they are facing in
the workplace. These were then used as a focus for discussion and during the various input
sessions throughout the course.

Recommendations and next steps

This was the first time that many of the participants had been exposed to this type of course
content and to the training processes used throughout the course. There was a considerable
amount of learning that took place and participants considered and identified various actions
that they could implement back in the workplace. For that to happen it is important that they
have support from colleagues, peers group members, managers and HR. Internal or external
support might also be considered in terms of a future facilitated recall of the group to look at
implementation issues and on-going challenges. We will provide a process as part of the
second course in September that will address implementation successes and blockages.
We would usually expect a post event questionnaire to be sent to participants 3-6 months
after the course to evaluate the impact of the training at levels 2-4 of Kirkpartick’s evaluation
model. We will undertake this review / evaluation process in September.

Trainers’ Recommendations

•      It is important to ensure on-going support and challenge is provided to those who
       have undertaken the training. This can take many forms from HR and line manage-
       ment support through to peer support and recall groups to discuss learning implemen-
       tation and on-going challenges (possible ‘fly on the wall’ style developmental activi-
       ties).
•      Whilst there is now a cadre of people within the Committee on Statistics who have
       been exposed to a range of common experiences and learning, focused on manage-
       ment and leadership, it is essential to create a critical mass to maintain momentum.
       Ideally participants will be able to cascade the ideas and learning from the course to
       others within their work teams. This process might need to be supported internally
       through HR or externally. If required we can offer processes to facilitate this cascade
       of learning during the course in September.
•      During the training sessions a number of the participants said that they had found the
       inputs insightful and interesting. It might therefore be useful to introduce and support
       a range of informal information sharing seminars between business areas about good
       management and leadership practice. This would provide participants an opportunity
       to promote their business areas; and to practice and help to share examples of good
       practice and new ideas across business areas. It is important that any such initiative
       be informal and supported by HR. For example, a series of lunch time seminars could
       be provided by participants talking about how various managerial and leadership ap-
       proaches have reduced staff turnover; increased sharing of ideas; improved perfor-
       mance through feedback etc.
                                                                                            35
•      There has been and still is a considerable turnover of staff possibly brought about
       through uncertainty around the reorganisation; a lack of opportunities/training; and
       low motivation through some of the existing cultural and managerial / leadership
       styles and norms. As with all organisations, change of processes, skills and culture
       take time. It is important that any new approaches are role modeled throughout the
       office and that any changes are seen as non-optional. Further inputs on change man-
       agement in September will help provide the knowledge and skills required to ensure
       change is communicated effectively, owned and understood by those involved.
•      A number of opportunities for cross functional working and ideas sharing were identi-
       fied during the course. Such an approach could be further enhanced by the creation
       of a clear and visible set of organisational and business area ‘vision and values’.
       These would need to be created, owned, understood and acted upon throughout the
       Committee on Statistics. We will explore these areas in more detail during the Sep-
       tember course.
•      At one stage we were invited to recommend one or two participants from the earlier
       ‘Presentational, facilitation and consultation skills for Statisticians’ course, who might
       be suitable to provide training for new members of staff. We suggested that a suitable
       approach might be to invite previous participants to apply for such work and to ask
       them to present their reasons, including their strengths, to a panel of HR members
       who can then choose the best applicant. Applicants need to be made aware of the
       benefits of undertaking such work. If it is perceived as something that they have to do
       in addition to their usual day jobs then there may be little incentive for them to apply.
       Highlighting what the personal benefits / incentives might be for undertaking such a
       function may ensure a healthier number of potential applicants.


A further Training Course (C2-KAZ-7) on the topic “Change management and strategic
leadership" has been conducted in September 2015 in Astana by two experts.
This training course was the second in a series of three designed to address a number of
specific Leadership and Managerial issues and challenges identified during the earlier project
programmes undertaken by Petteri Baer, Duncan Miles and Denis Greer. The course was
designed to allow participants the opportunity to:
    Create a mission, vision and values statement for their business
    Plan an effective implementation strategy for their mission, vision, values
    Identify key organizational barriers and challenges to success (achievement of Kazstat
    vision) and ways of over-coming them
    Design an effective communications strategy to cascade their mission, vision, values
    Identify their attitudes and current effectiveness in supporting and challenging their peo-
    ple
    Manage anxious and difficult situations more effectively
    The course appears to have achieved its main aims and objectives. In addition to the
    written objectives there was an unwritten one to review learning since the previous
                                                                                              36
   course and to explore implementation of learning successes and blockages. Following
   earlier feedback the course was designed to allow plenty of opportunity for group discus-
   sion and exercises. It was also designed to explore a wide range of topics, tools and
   techniques to allow for efficient methods of HR management, which help to achieve good
   results in staff motivation, engagement and performance. The challenges and risks asso-
   ciated with the use of these tools and techniques and approaches were also explored.

Trainers’ Recommendations

   It is important to ensure on-going support and challenge is provided to those who have
   undertaken the training. This can take many forms from HR and line management sup-
   port through to peer support and recall groups to discuss learning implementation and
   on-going challenges. It would be good to ask participants to report back on the actions
   that they have taken since attending both of the courses and for them to comment upon
   the impact of those actions in terms of output and performance.
   Whilst there is now a cadre of people within the Committee on Statistics who have been
   exposed to a range of common experiences and learning, focused on change, manage-
   ment and leadership, it is essential to create a critical mass to maintain momentum. Ide-
   ally participants will already have cascaded the ideas and learning from the course to
   others within their work teams. We have one further course scheduled for 2016 and it
   might be an opportunity to cascade some of the inputs learning and frameworks to the
   participants’ deputies or to other ‘key players’ within the office.
   There has been and still is a considerable turnover of staff. Exit interviews, if not already
   used, could be undertaken to identify comprehensive reasons for that turnover. These
   could be used to identify key factors causing the turnover and help people develop strat-
   egies to reduce the turnover. As with all organizations, change of processes, skills and
   culture take time. It is important that any new approaches are role modeled throughout
   the office and that any changes are seen as non-optional.
   We need to agree dates and course content for the final course due to take place in
   2016. If the next course is to target the existing group of participants then we will need to
   seek their input in terms of course content. There are a number of input sessions that
   could be included under the original planned course title ‘Leadership through periods of
   change and modernization within an Analytical Organization', however, we want to mini-
   mize any overlaps and maximize the learning opportunities.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

The Division of Registers is updating the statistical business register in terms of assigning
codes of the Classification of Economy Sectors.

Notes on further planning

In order to update the business register in terms of assigning codes of the Classification of
Economy Sectors, the Division of National Accounts is planning to request a list of legal enti-
ties from the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan (MoF) with a breakdown by
level of the budget and administrator of budget programs financed by the state budget.
Together with the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) it is planned to update the codes of
the Classification of Economy Sectors on financial sector entities/organizations. In addition, it
will be necessary to verify the Classification of Subsidiaries of the NBK.

C3-SV-19

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the results of the activity, recommendations were prepared for the participating
countries on producing mirror migration statistics and conducting comparative analysis of
population migration between countries. To date, the Committee has conducted a compara-
tive analysis of statistical data on migration (external migration) between Kazakhstan and
Russia, and revealed inconsistencies in the number of arrivals from Kazakhstan to Russia for
permanent residence and vice versa. Moreover, it should be noted that issues of migration
accounting fall within the authority of statistical body and some other concerned bodies, in-
cluding the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan, so in the future it is
planned to strengthen the interaction with state bodies on this issue.

Notes on further planning

The knowledge acquired will be used to improve the methods of measuring migration in the
country and prepare methodological guidelines for collecting migration statistics in 2016.


C3-SV-24
CS experts participated in the “Workshop on Child Disability Measurement” (C3-SV-24) in
July 2015. The aim of the workshop was to strengthen countries' capacities for child disability
data collection, data analysis, data use and data dissemination using methods that are dif-
ferent in comparability across countries and groups of disability. UNICEF and Washington
Group on Disability Statistics have been developed a package of training activities in the field
of measuring child disability.
The activity's program has been very informative, discussion of disability's definition, planning
and selection of toolkit for data collection as well as improvement of coordination between
different institutions at national level have been actively conducted. Much useful information
from the developed countries' experience about work done and problems arisen in the fields
reviewed has been acquired. Totally, the presentation material provided and information col-
lected will be useful for further work on development of child disability statistics.
In perspective, it is necessary to study a new survey module on child functioning and disabil-
ity developed by UNICEF and WG on Disability Statistics for use in surveys and censuses.
The module reflects current thinking around disability and can produce internationally compa-
rable data.




                                                                                              39
Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

This activity made it possible to discuss the survey module on child functioning and disability
that has been designed by UNICEF and the Washington Group on Disability Statistics. The
survey covers children aged 2-17 years and assesses restriction of activities in speech and
language, hearing, vision, learning, mobility and motor skills, emotions and behavior.
The other countries’ experience in conducting surveys on disability in general gives the
opportunity to revise and implement new approaches to conducting disability surveys.
Methods of analyzing disability statistics are used by the Committee to prepare the draft Final
Report on Sample Survey on Quality of Life of Persons with Disabilities by Gender which
was carried out by the Committee in 2014. Based on the results of this activity, the
specialists of the Committee consider output data by type of locality, gender, disability group,
type of restriction, age, etc.

Notes on further planning

In the future, it is planned to consider the possibility of using a new survey module designed
by UNICEF and the Washington Group on Disability Statistics in surveys and censuses. This
module reflects the modern vision of disability problemsin the light of the social model and
will help to collect comparable data at the international level.


C3-SV-25

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the results of this activity, recommendations were prepared for improving statistical
accounting of migration. The Division is currently analyzing the completeness and quality of
the formulated indicators and preparing draft terms of reference for the improvement of the
local software package “Migration” to ensure the quality in data entering and processing.

Notes on further planning

The knowledge acquired will be used to improve methods of measuring migration in the
country, prepare methodological guidelines for collecting migration statistics in 2016 and
design a toolkit for Census 2020.

A Study Visit (C3-SV-1) of CS experts on “Best international techniques of improvement of
professional skills” has been carried out in April 2015 to the German federal statistical office
Destatis.

Activity aim was to design and develop a continuous training system: training, retraining and
advanced training of the Committee’s staff in accordance with international methodologies
and best practices.

Objectives:

1. Obtain recommendations regarding the elaboration of a training and skill improvement
   system for the staff of the Committee and territorial authorities.

2. Obtain recommendations to determine the estimated need for Committee’s staff skills
   improvement.

3. Provide assistance in designing and introducing a skill improvement strategy.

4. Elaborate recommendations to strengthen activities performed by HR Unit in the area of
   staff skills improvement.

As part of the Study visit staff of the Committee and territorial authorities was familiarized
with the following aspects based on Federal Statistical Office’s (FSO) experience:

1.     Internal organizational structure of FSO.

2.     Organizational process for training and skills improvement in FSO (internal and exter-
       nal workshops).

3.     Theoretical and practical basics on introduction of new methods for staff manage-
       ment, training and skills improvement.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (D1-KAZ-4/5) on the topic “Developing procedures for more efficient
updating of the business register" has been carried out in July 2015 by two experts from the
Turkish statistical institute TurkStat.
The aim of the mission was to improve the quality of the information contained in the statisti-
cal business register (SBR) to produce high-quality statistical information and use it for statis-
tical purposes besides generating the necessary statistical units as KAU, LKAU and Enter-
prise Groups in Kazakh Business Registers. Moreover, the methodological guidelines of Ka-
zakh Business Registers were evaluated by Turkish experts. The mission’s objective is to
provide methodological and practical assistance to update the current methodological provi-
sions, improve the mechanism of interaction between the SBR and administrative sources,
and improve the statistical infrastructure through the application of international methodolo-
gies and data quality standards.


The results of the mission are summarized in the following:
    Turkish SBR system was illustrated and SBR studies carried out in Turkey were clarified,
    Information regarding general overview of modules in SBR software was gained,
    The process of data flowing between the administrative bodies and national business
     registers was comprehended,
    How records are received from other sources and how they are integrated with SBR ta-
     bles were comprehended,
    Updating methods of business surveys into Business Registers data were examined,
    Recommendations on the current interaction between the SBR of the Agency of Statistics
     of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the administrative sources were given,
    Practical recommendations on developing and improving the methodology for updating
     the information using administrative data were granted,
    Practical recommendations on developing new procedures for updating the statistical
     business register based on the information provided by the tax authorities were illuminat-
     ed,

   Assistance in preparing effective proposals to improve the current rules that regulate the
    procedure of using administrative data, and use the administrative accounting data in ac-
    cordance with the world practice, including proposals regarding the missing indicators,
    and use administrative accounting data for this purpose were provided,
   Recommendations on how to create appropriate conditions to ensure integration with
    other government bodies’ information systems for statistical purposes were supplied,
   The information on business demography methodology was explicated,
   Recommendations with regard to creating links between enterprises and local units, local
    units and local kind-of-activity units, respectively were provided and exercised,
   Regarding KAU and LKAU, the practical recommendations were given by exercises and
    illustrations,
   The methodological guidelines by Kazakh experts were examined and discussed with
    respect to its standards and performance for providing user needs,
   The methodological guidelines by Kazakh experts were recommended to get improved,
   How to decide nationality, group head, share/control links and relationships etc. of EGs
    were mentioned theoretically and illustrated with concrete examples and exercises.


It was good to observe that Kazakh BR has already started with international standards and
norms in terms of statistical units’ definition and their variables. Moreover, for these guide-
lines, current recommendations were stated:
 As enterprise groups are started to be composed in BR, first methodological guideline
  which is maintaining of statistical business registers will be updated with the process of
  enterprise group methods.
 Since the second guideline which is about updating of BR System was not in English lan-
  guage, it was recommended to have an English version in future.
 For the second guideline, the process of how to apply demographic continuity rules to
  statistical units could be illuminated in it.
 International guidelines written by Eurostat or other statistical authorities were recom-
  mended to be followed at least in their Russian versions.
 In order to enhance the know-how potential of BR team, it was recommended to send BR
  staff to the trainings, internships etc. to the Eurostat or other MS where possible.
 Independently from the determined objective of mission, it was also agreed that Kazakh
  BR team can develop a quality report for its product.

     The following results were obtained during the activities held under the Strengthening the
     National Statistical System of the Republic of Kazakhstan Project (KAZSTAT):
     1. A new procedure have been established for information exchange between the National
        Database ‘Real Estate Register’ maintained by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of
        Kazakhstan and the Information System ‘Statistical Housing Stock Register’ which is the
        component of the integrated e-Statistics IIS.
     2. Online interaction was implemented between the National Database ‘Real Estate Regis-
        ter’ maintained by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Infor-
        mation System ‘Statistical Housing Stock Register’, which is the component of the e-
        Statistics IIS.
     3. Additional output tables have been prepared for a new indicator ‘Wall Materials’ of the
        Annual Bulletin “On Housing Stock”.
     4. Methodological Guidelines for Maintaining Statistical Housing Stock Register (SHSR)
        have been improved (No.11 dated December 31, 2014).
     5. Based on recommendation provided by the international experts in 2015, new attributes
        “empty or under abeyance” have been added into bulletins of house/apartments situation.
     6. Based on recommendation provided by the international experts in 2015, terms of refer-
        ence have been approved for updating the SHSR data on the number of households and
        the number of persons living in them using the household sample surveys Т-001 and Д-
        002.
     7. Guidelines for Downloading Data from the Employment Sample Survey Т -001 into the
        SHSR IS have been approved and sent to the territorial agencies (June 2015).
     8. The data from the 2014 household sample surveys Т-001 and Д-002 on the number of
        households and the number of persons living in them has been loaded into the SHSR IS.
     9. Based on the guidelines prepared, data on the number of households and the number of
        persons living in them (Т-001) has being loaded into the SHSR IS since July 2015 at the
        territorial level.
     10. Additional attributes for individual houses and residential premises (apartments) have
         been designed for the output tables of the Annual Bulletin “On Housing Stock”.
        After studying the international experience under the KAZSTAT Project, the training
        workshops have been conducted according to the Plan of workshops for the regional sta-

     Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

     Activities held under the Strengthening the National Statistical System of the Republic of Ka-
     zakhstan Project (KZSTAT) made it possible to improve methodological documents and
     Rules of information exchange with administrative sources:
     Methodical Guidelines for Maintaining Statistical Agricultural Register No.9 dated December
     30, 2014 have been improved. A new section was included to describe the SAR statistical
     units; the transition to a single identification code of the entities (Individual Identification
     Number and Business Identification Number) took place; editorial changes have been made
     in accordance with the current legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan;
     A new procedure have been established to regulate information exchange between the
     Committee for Statistics under the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakh-
     stan and the Committee for Construction, Housing, Utilities and Land Resources Manage-
     ment the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in terms of obtaining
     information about the agricultural lands (December 2014);
     Electronic Household Accounting Books have been introduced in rural akimats instead of the
     hard copies of Household Accounting Books. This was made to improve the quality of agri-
     cultural statistics and reduce burden on rural akims when completing Household Accounting
     Books and producing output data.

     Notes on further planning

     A new Statistical Agricultural Register Information System is being implemented under the e-
     Statistics IIS.
     The Procedure for Information Exchange with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of
     Kazakhstan is being revised to obtain data on livestock population by entity.
     All the above activities are very useful for further development of the Statistical Agricultural
     Register maintained by the Committee for Statistics.
     The foreign countries’ experience in SAR maintaining will be considered in further improve-
     ment of the SAR.

     Findings and results

     A Consulting mission (D5-KAZ-4) on the topic “Development of Classifications and Stand-
     ards" has been carried out in June 2015 by an expert from the French statistical office
     INSEE.
     The project e-stat was launched in 2011 by the government of Kazakhstan in order to renew
     the statistical system of Kazakhstan. According to these requirements of building an up to
     date statistical system, the Information and Computing Centre developed an IT system
     known as CLASS for the management of all statistical classifications in force in the Commit-
     tee for Statistics. All staff members from the Committee for Statistics in Astana have access
     to the CLASS system so that it ensures harmonised dissemination and use of the valid ver-
     sion of each classification.
     The purpose of the visit was double:
     -   study the classifications and their methodology as they are in France, in order to improve
         the knowledge of each participants in the field of classification management (from drafting
         a new classification up to its implementation in the statistical system),
     -   provide recommendations on improving the “Classification and Standards” information
         system.

     Conclusions

     The classification system which has been set up presents very sound aspects in respect to
     the classifications themselves and also in respect to the IT system. The will to stick to inter-
     national standards regarding classifications is clearly visible and results either in the classifi-
     cations themselves (description, structure and content) or in the methodology which is ap-
     plied (consultation and approval process, implementation plans and dissemination).
     This can also be seen in the CLASS system for the management of the various classifica-
     tions and their different versions. Its use among the Committee for Statistics shows the
     strong commitment to harmonised and shared use of common tools for statisticians. The
     CLASS system is a rather recent tool and has not yet experienced more sophisticated
     changes. Amending the CLASS system with new features allowing new tasks such as intro-
     duction of multiple splits, combination of items or automation of development of transition
     keys is a very challenging goal. To meet success, it is absolutely necessary that IT special-
                                                                                                     52
ists and classification experts work together: amending the CLASS system is not only a
computing specialist matter as concepts and principles underlying classifications are part of
the issue. The stated goal to amend the CLASS system can be seen as part of a broader
outlook and reminds of initiatives promoting dissemination and sharing of statistical data and
metadata and leads to links with SDMX experiments.
Recommendations and next steps
I would like to stress on two main issues: keeping up with international standards and im-
proving the current management system.
Keeping up with international standards. In order not to lessen the strength of the achieved
system and to maintain relevance of the classifications, it is necessary to be aware of all the
recent development in classifications, to monitor international and European progress. Ka-
zakhstan having reached sound understanding in the field of classifications could be the driv-
ing force in the region. Building an effective network on classifications would both allow im-
provement on classification knowledge and also bring more efficient answers to translation
issues as all Russian speaking countries face the same language issue. A way to work to-
ward this goal could be done through workshops gathering countries of the region or from the
Eurasian Economic Union or even other participants. These meeting could be done with the
support of an EU member state and/or a representative of the classification team of Eurostat.
Improving the “Classifications and Standards” information system needs further studies to be
carried out. Switzerland has a very sound knowledge on linking classifications, metadata and
data dissemination, it is also a leading country in the SDMX domain. It would be very useful if
a study visit involving both classification and IT experts could be organised within the Swiss
Federal Office. Enhancing standards being part of the twinning project, it would probably be
advantageous to associate to this project metadata and SDMX experts. To make the study
visit more profitable, it could focus only on the maintenance of one classification: in my view
the activity classification would be the best candidate. The study visit should allow to know
how the Swiss colleagues manage their national version of NACE (it is the NOGA), how they
elaborate correspondence tables and transition keys and how far this process is automated.
In case the process is not automated, it could help to know the reasons preventing automa-
tion. From a broader point of view, it would also be worth to get familiar with the contribution
of SDMX to classification management so that it may be an opportunity for the automation of
building transition keys.

     Findings and results

     A Training Course (D8-KAZ-3) on “International practice of seasonal adjustment and for-
     mation of time series” has been conducted in June 2015 in Astana by an expert from the
     Turkish statistical office.
     Statistics committee of Kazakhstan aims to produce seasonal adjusted figures of main eco-
     nomic indicators. This consultancy visit was the first to introduce related staff with basic con-
     cept of seasonal adjustment. In the visit, the basic definitions of seasonal adjustment were
     explained and tools to perform it were introduced. At the end of the mission, the staff became
     the possibility to practice seasonal adjustment with recommended software.
     Conclusions
     In this consultancy visit, TRAMO&SEATS method and TRAMO&SEATS for Windows soft-
     ware are recommended for seasonal adjustment of official statistics and the expert started to
     explain their details. In the next visit the following topics will be discussed.
     Recommendations and next steps
        • Preparing Kazakhstan calendar effect regressor, re-adjustment for Kazakshtan specific
          calendar effect
        • Preparing the final raw dataset for the production of official seasonal adjusted indica-
          tors
        • Defining update strategies and revision period
        • Quality Assessment of Seasonal Adjustment: Advanced diagnostics
        • Direct vs. Indirect Seasonal Adjustment of aggregates
        • Relationship among price, volume, and value, temporal consistency with the annual
          accounts
        • Organizing Seasonal Adjustment in the Committee.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

An employee of the Division of National Accounts has prepared a file with calendar effects in
the format required, and sent it to experts of the Turkish Statistical Office on June 30, 2015.
Staff of the Division of National Accounts is trying to make seasonal adjustment on their own
(not considering a calendar effect) in TRAMO&SEATS program in order to reinforce the ma-
terials learned and to get practice.
Prior to the upcoming mission, the Division staff will prepare dynamic time series based on
the data available to conduct seasonal adjustment procedures.
Besides, works to design the Methodology for Seasonal Adjustment have been started; it is
planned to approve it in 2016.

Notes on further planning

It is planned to continue the examination of TRAMO&SEATS program, as not all indicators
and functions have been considered.
It is planned to draft the Methodology for Seasonal Adjustment and forward it to the expert of
the Turkish Statistical Office for approval prior to mission in 2016.
It is planned to carry out seasonal adjustment of SNA indicators independently, and agree
upon with the expert. Data will be prepared for publication with consideration of experts’ re c-
ommendations.

     Findings and results

     A Consulting Mission (D9-KAZ-7) on “Estimation of simple and composite indicators of
     business activities of enterprises” has been conducted in August 2015 in Astana by an expert
     from the German statistical office Destatis.
     The aim of the mission was to give an overview of the international experience of developing
     leading composite indicators (CLIs). Moreover the expert should give recommendations for
     the methodology of building a system of leading indicators of business activity. The expert
     was told at the beginning of the mission that the reference series shall be given by Gross
     Domestic Product (GDP). The expert explained the situation with respect to CLIs in Germa-
     ny. Up to date material from the Ifo Institute, Munich, the Centre of European Economic Re-
     search (ZEW Mannheim), the Company of Consumption Research (GFK Institute) and the
     economic business indicators from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) were shown and
     discussed. Also the OECD - CLI for Germany was presented and, following the international
     literature from the OECD (handbook on constructing composite indicators), several steps (10
     steps) to calculate CLIs were discussed. A focus was drawn on the data preparation and the
     selection process of variables to be included in a CLI. Also an intensive discussion of the
     several methods that could be used was performed. The relevant working staff at CS showed
     strong interests in all fields of the discussions. The expert also worked on practical examples
     with survey data for Kazakhstan. The expert showed examples in a graphical presentation
     where the Ifo index was sometimes wrong in detecting turning points of the German GDP.
     After that the expert collected several data for Kazakhstan from the working staff at CS. A
     practical example how to manage time series efficiently was performed. All 10 steps from the
     OECD recommendations in order to achieve new results were shown. All work progress of
     these practical examples was presented to the working staff. It was shown that with the
     help of multivariate analysis and the toolkit of several methodological approaches (Correla-
     tion- and Regression Analysis) that form international standards for calculating CLIs, espe-
     cially for the calculation of the weights of the components, the derivation of a first projection
     of a CLI with the reference series trend adjusted GDP could be managed. The resulting pre-
     liminary and narrow CLI showed significant properties to the economic business cycle
     measured by GDP. It has a statistical lead of one quarter but is by no means suitable as an
     end product. It can only serve as the outcome of a practical example meant to demon-
     strate the production process. Further work has to be carried out.


                                                                                                    60
On the last day a step-to-step presentation was given on how to improve the practical exam-
ple and to make use of the detailed methods. Also basic discussion about seasonal adjust-
ment procedures and theoretical guidelines on this topic were also presented.

Recommendations and next steps
1) The published results for the survey variables should be based on an index. This has the
   advantage that the figure 100 is the balancing line which is due to international stand-
   ards.
2) It is a precondition for the construction of CLIs to work with econometric software. There-
   fore it is in the short run recommended that the relevant staff at CS come in touch with it.

3) The questionnaire of the survey statistic is widely organized with respect to the fields of
   interest. It could be possible to dispense with question No. 6 (concerning the questions
   what the firms are doing in order to improve their competitiveness). Taken together the
   questionnaire is completely structured to generate leading information on business activi-
   ties.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

10.    The published results on survey variables shall be based on an index. The advantage
       is that the figure “100” is an equalizing line stipulated by the international standards;
11.    A mandatory requirement to build a separate business unit is to work with economet-
       ric software. Therefore, it is recommended that CS staff addresses this issue in the
       short term;
12.    A statistical survey questionnaire is widely held with respect to areas of interest. It is
       possible to exclude the question No. 6 (concerning the questions related to what
       companies do to improve their competitiveness). In general, the questionnaire is fully
       structured for the production of basic information on economic activities;
13.    Experience in applying econometric software has been acquired;
14.    New primary data/test to be included (except the survey results).
15.    Competency of the Division of Structural Statistics;
16.    The Committee for Statistics has forwarded Technical Specifications to purchase
       software to the authorized body for approval. Upon completion of all necessary pro-
       cedures, it is planned to hold a tender for the purchase of software;
17.    After the acquisition of the software, it is planned that experts from the Statistics Ko-
       rea will conduct training. In addition, the staff of the Division of National Accounts will
       practice working with functions/options that have been studied during the mission;
18.    Staff of the Division of National Accounts has started working with the selection of
       primary data.

     Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities
     1. It has been adopted and previously agreed with the management to optimize the existing
        logo of the Committee, reduce the number of fractions/elements in the circle diagram to
        four, and half the number of rays. The proposed optimization will allow maintaining the
        current logo, recognizing the government authority, and alongside with that it will reflect
        the spirit of the times. In particular, it will increase the resolution of the logo in any size
        and image quality, including the “online” browsing via smart-phones and tablets. It has
        been offered to leave the right part of the logo more volume, thereby maintaining the fo-
        cus on the statistical content of the logo.
     2. The color palette of the logo elements has been defined in the standards PANTONE, R-
        G-B, C-M-Y-K, HTML (blue PANTONE 7461С, R-G-B 246-190-0, C-M-Y-K 100-6-2-10,
        HTML 0086BF; yellow PANTONE 7408С, R-G-B 246-190-0, C-M-Y-K 0-29-100-0, and
        HTML А6BE00).
     3. The font Calibri has been chosen as corporate; this font has been recommended by ex-
        perts because of the favorable interpretation of numbers and text in any font size, as well
        as its tightness, which is important in the presentation of volume tables in any font size
        and format of the publication, but this font shall be used with its size increased a little.
     4. The industrial color palette has been determined in standards PANTONE, R-G-B, C-M-Y-
        K, and HTML.
     5. The general initial template of a publication cover has been designed.
     6. Experts’ recommendations on technical performance/design of tables and diagrams have
        been taken into consideration in the process of preparing publications.

Notes on further planning
An additional consultation mission E1-KAZ-7 has been scheduled for April 2016 and local
training E1-KAZ-8 for September 2016.
However, in the framework of project management the Committee offered in September
2015 to involve not one expert for the upcoming mission, as it was specified in the Project
Implementation Plan, but two experts; as previously involved experts have a different focus:
a designer and an expert in the area of disseminating statistical information and working with
users. The World Bank representatives have expressed their readiness to satisfy our re-
quest.
Upon completion of missions, it is planned to design the “Guidelines for Using the Corporate
Style” as well as to improve the “Guidelines for Designing Publications with a Detailed Elabo-
ration of Design Rules (Brand Book) in Order to Maintain a Unified Stylistics Format” and
“Standards for Formatting ARKS Newsletters and Express Information”.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (E1-KAZ-10) on the topic “Developing Regional Statistics" has been
carried out in June 2015 by an expert from the German statistical office Destatis.
The aim is to study the international experience in developing regional statistics, get theoreti-
cal knowledge and practical recommendations in the field of methodological and practical
aspects of developing regional statistics. Development of the regions and efficient use of
resources across the country, taking into account the criteria of sustainable development,
creates new potential information needs. Social and economic policy of local and central
government agencies requires informational support from official statistics.
The mission addressed the topic regional statistics for the first time. It focussed on issues
concerning the further development of regional statistics for better public awareness and im-
proving the user-relations policy. Representatives of all regional offices attended the meet-
ings as well as staff from central subject matter units. Regional user needs and the possibili-
ties to cope with them were addressed by the regions representatives. Legal, organisational
and financial aspects as well as the related constraints were discussed in comparison to the
situation in other countries. Strategies to develop regional profiles and a variety of dissemina-
tion formats were considered.
A considerable amount of figures and indicators are already available on regional level and
are published in the Internet, but additional regional requirements, for example further dis-
aggregated data, cannot be met. A user-friendly and comprehensive dissemination, including
metadata and quality documentation, taking aspects of statistical literacy into account, is cur-
rently not given within this publication channel. Concluding, a fundamental decision is neces-
sary, if a regional statistics policy/strategy shall be developed or if the current procedures
shall be continued.




                                                                                              65
Conclusions

A decision has to be taken whether regional statistics should be developed in a way that it is
more than making national indicators available on a regional level.

Approach 1: The decision is taken to stick to the current situation.

  Recommendation 1: In this case it is necessary to adapt the regional indicators to the
  users needs continuously – either add what is recommended and verified or delete what is
  not necessary anymore. The necessary actions can be taken during the preparation of the
  annual programme. The collection of the regional statistics user needs could be included
  in an annual user survey.
  Recommendation 2: Also without setting up a special regional statistics policy the calcula-
  tion of more sophisticated/context-based indicators using already existing data should be
  focused, especially in the social area.
  Recommendation 3: User-friendly explanations and metadata have to be integrated in the
  dissemination platform, since this documentation is currently not available to the general
  public or is not directly linked to the data.

Approach 2: The decision is taken to develop a concept/strategy for regional statis-
tics.

  Recommendation 1: The coordination role for the development process must be taken by
  the central office. A team/group has to be defined which is responsible for the develop-
  ment of a concept/strategy/policy for regional statistics including a pilot implementation.
  This team should include staff of the regional offices.
  Recommendation 2: The approach towards a concept should be orientated on general re-
  gional profiles (comparing regions), special regional profiles (what is special for one region
  or a cluster of regions), overarching issues (poverty, inequality, …). For each topic a s e-
  lection and development of indicators is necessary.
  Recommendation 3: Guidelines for dissemination must be developed. Especially, expla-
  nations taking didactical aspects into account focussing on the development of statistical
  literacy are desirable. Illustrative formats – like info-graphics and inter-active Internet ap-
  plications should be taken into consideration.
  To set a up a more flexible regional structure
  Recommendation 4: All data related to a province should be available on single data level
  in the regional statistical offices (possibilities of linkage included). By doing this, a pre-
  condition is fulfilled that the field of working areas in the regional offices can be widened
  and a good regional statistical service can be offered.
  Recommendation 5: The responsible authorities should consider an amendment of the
  statistical law to make a more flexible user-oriented work possible. Further the law rele-
                                                                                              66
  vant for revenues earned by the statistical authorities should be amended to make the
  revenues usable within the official statistics budget.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Given the federal structure, the German experience in most cases has turned out to be un-
acceptable to the state statistical system in Kazakhstan. In addition, it has been decided to
consider the topic of regional statistics development with regard to expanding the list of sta-
tistical indicators by oblast/rayon decided directly with industry international experts in the
framework of subject-matter sub-components.

E1-KAZ-1/3 User Relations, Including Mass Media and Public Relations

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the results of the consultation mission E1-KAZ-1 and local training E1-KAZ-
3,“Guidelines for User Relations, Including Mass Media and Public Relations” have been
prepared and approved.
In addition, the following expert's recommendations have been introduced:
   -   News and press releases are now available at the top of the Committee’s home page;
   -   A separate section “Press Service” has been created on the Committee’s website;
   -   A calendar of press releases with specification of release dates is available in the
       section “Press Service”;
   -   Press releases are also available with release dates;

                                                                                            67
   -   Archives of press releases are available by year and have a search function by date
       and throughout the text;
   -   Subheadings “activity announcement” and “briefing materials” have been created;
   -   Briefing topics cover not only the issue of the overall socio-economic development,
       now the briefings are theme-based, issues related to demographics, crime, inflation,
       etc. are considered;
   -   A link to a more detailed source has been added to summary press releases on the
       Committee’s website;
   -   A section “photo and video gallery” has been created on the Committee’s website;
   -   The call center of the Committee that is to date combined with the press service has
       been launched in 2015;
   -   The responsible staff has been chosen in subject-matter divisions and telephone
       numbers have been determined to switch a call, if necessary;
   -   A reference note has been designed (requirements for Committee’s call center oper a-
       tors upon contact with users)
   -   On the basis of the Committee’s call center, the formation of the database of user
       questions and monitoring of frequently asked questions has been initiated;
   -   When responding to official and electronic requests by users, all the information re-
       quested is provided not depending on the user group; along with that, a source of this
       information is specified on the Committee’s website, there is also an option to obtain
       more detailed information (on a sample and database) for a fee;
   -   Instead of the contact form on the home page of the Committee’s website, the call
       center’s e-mail is available in addition with an option to send questions and requests
       via the Chairperson’s blog;
Implementation of other recommendations is possible subject to availability of additional re-
sources, for example, an option to edit texts of press releases by the press service, etc. The
available resources are not enough to work intensively with the users, including the mass
media.

E2       Dissemination and marketing of statistical information

Implemented activities

There were no missions or study visits in this sub-component during the reporting period.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the results of the missions held under this sub-component in 2013-2014, the
“Strategy of Communication and Dissemination of Official Statistics” is being designed; it is
planned to complete this document in 2016. According to international expert’s recommenda-
tions:
“Currently, the strategy of communication and dissemination of the National Statistical Inst i-
tute (NSI) is based on electronic distribution and structure of the NSI website. Thus, the Sub-
component E.2 shall be closely linked to the Subcomponent E4. Improvement of the Web
Portal.”
The Division of Information Technologies has been involved to design this document, which
is responsible for the implementation of Subcomponent Е4. Improvement of the Web Portal.
Besides that, the following expert’s recommendations have been introduced:
     -   Websites of territorial departments of statistics have been modernized since 2015 in

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the consultation mission, experts of the Division of Statistical Activities Planning
have presented an office memo on the name of the Committee’s Chairperson for the second
time. This memo contained data on the need to introduce this practice in the Committee.
Based on the results, the following has been decided:
1. The Division of Finances and Document Support shall provide room to arrange the op-
   eration of the pre-test lab;
2. The Division of Classifications and Information Technologies shall design terms of refer-
   ence to purchase the equipment required according to knowledge obtained during con-
   sultation missions and based on materials previously provided by the Division of Statisti-
   cal Activities Planning (technical specifications of the equipment);
3. The Division of Finances and Document Support shall provide for (include) the purchase
   of equipment and software package as well as staff training in the Plan ofPublic Pro-
   curement for 2015 as part of KAZSTAT Project.
However, due to lack of suitable premises in the Committee to equip the pre-test laboratory it
was decided to temporarily accommodate the lab at the premises of the Department of Sta-
tistics of Astana city.
All documents necessary to design terms of reference to purchase the equipment required
have been forwarded to the Division of Classifications and Information Technologies as well.
Currently, the Division of Classifications and Information Technologies is agreeing upon the
terms of reference to purchase the equipment required with the Informatization and Commu-
nications Committee.
Now, premises to open the pre-test lab have been chosen. All documents necessary to de-
sign terms of reference to purchase the equipment have been prepared. The equipment pur-
chase has been nearly concurred by the Informatization and Communications Committee.
The concept of the pre-test lab operation has been formulated. Terms of reference were pre-
pared and forwarded to the Division of Classifications and Information Technologies for con-
currence on May 25.
It is planned to purchase the equipment for the pre-test lab till the end of October this year
and carry out a pilot till the end of 4th quarter of 2015.

Notes on further planning

The Committee for Statistics and DESTATIS agreed to conduct a second expert mission in
autumn (November-December) of 2015. During this mission, it is expected to exercise con-
trol over specific preparatory stages of the first pilot testing in the fourth quarter of 2015. Re-
ports based on the results of this pilot testing, in turn, shall be assessed by DESTATIS ex-
perts (also via e-mail consultations). It is expected that the experience gained during the im-
plementation of the pilot project will be used as a basis for the second pre-testing scheduled
for early 2016. Subsequently, it is recommended to perform an overall self-assessment of the
pre-test lab workflow in order to change the final structure of further regular preliminary tests.
The self-assessment shall be performed within the Committee for Statistics.
Upon completion of the self-assessment and with consideration of the actual needs and the
possible introduction of the gaze direction-tracking device, it might be considered to hold a
third expert mission in 2016.

The Division of Information Technologies has been involved in the process of designing
“Strategy of Communication and Dissemination of Official Statistics”. Together with the Pu b-
lications and Information dissemination division IT and classifications division was able to
implement following expert’s recommendations:
     -   Websites of territorial departments of statistics have been modernized since 2015 in
         the area of introducing a unified structure;
     -   All statistical information is published on the website of the Committee, which in-
         creases the ability of the Google search to lead users to our website;
     -   Committee website contains archives of all materials published in previous years;
     -   Notifications on releasing key statistical publications are posted on the home page of
         the Committee’s website;
     -   To introduce the concept of open data, a working group for database de-identification
         has been established; this working group will also design guidelines for database de-
         identification;
     -   A link to a more detailed source has been added to summary press releases on the
         Committee’s website;


Achieved improvement of the web-portal of the CS:
     •   E-statistics online reporting. In 2014 – total # of online reports accounted to 821 619.
         During 1-3 quarters 2015 it is 531 663, expected figure by the end of the year is 1 000
         000 reports submitted online. Number of forms available for online submission - 130
         out of 155.
     •   Number of web-site visitors in January – August 2015 increased by almost 700 000
         visitors compared to the same period of 2014.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F1-KAZ-7) on the topic “Non-Financial Corporations Sector (S 11)
and Household Sector (S14)” has been carried out in May 2015 by two experts from the
Czech statistical office.
In accordance with the plans of the Committees NA Department the mission was aimed at
the compilation of full sequence of accounts for Non-financial corporation sector (S.11) and
for Households sector (S.14). These plans require a wide range of input data and also some
particular conceptual adjustments or extrapolations. The Kazakh NA Department uses a
couple of sets of data sources for compilation of each account of these institutional sectors.
Their mutual consistency is not always assured because these accounts are compiled sepa-
rately.
The main effort was focused on the discussion about the source data used and about the
disposable data sources which could or should be used. This discussion was necessary for
the correct understanding of surveyed data with regard to the Kazakh financial accounting
rules. Based on the information gathered it was possible to prepare instructions how to com-


                                                                                                      75
pile the full sequence of accounts for the Non-financial corporation sector (S.11) in accord-
ance with SNA 2008.

Conclusions

1.     Data source table is ready and filled with figures from structural statistics. When data
       for individual entrepreneurs will be added, first stage in compilation process will be
       achieved. This is the most crucial point in NA compilation process. Then data will be
       transferred into prepared sectoral tables and tables by activities and by institutional
       sectors.
2.     Additionally in following missions all necessary adjustments will be provided and allo-
       cated into institutional sectors of the economy
3.     Organization of the work within NA Department is fragmented by accounts. There is
       no appropriate communication between experts. We agreed with Kazakh colleagues
       on some changes of the organization of their work in Prague last year. Our recom-
       mendation now is to wait with the changes. We expect some results of the project as
       experimental results. Then we will provide some recommendations how to change or-
       ganization of their work.
4.     An expected result of project has changed from particular improvements to the fully
       integrated system of national accounts. Fully integrated SNA is the only way how to
       have highly developed NA statistics. To build up this system takes years in the future.
       The first experience within the project could only open the way to this development.
       Organization of the project in the NA subcomponent in the previous years was con-
       centrated only on particular improvements and some results are not in line with new
       approach (not sufficient). Some further improvements into results from carried out ac-
       tivities (missions) during the project in last years are needed.
5.     Business structural statistics seems to be developed; more intensive cooperation with
       NA Department is needed.
6.     SBS forms should be adjusted to fulfill all needs of National Accounts.
7.     NA staff needs to have more knowledge about business accounting rules; some train-
       ings could be helpful.
8.     To create developed National Accounts statistics it is needed to have more staff. Na-
       tional Accounts statistics then could provide very detailed and appropriate information
       about economic development of the country and transactions between main groups.
       Sophisticated data from NA then could be used for economic policy and development.


A further Consulting mission (F1-KAZ-39) on the topic “Formulating and Estimating Non-
Observed Economy (NOE) indicators” has been carried out in May 2015 by the Czech spe-
cialist in that field.
The mission was the sixth mission on Non-Observed Economy (NOE) estimation. In accord-
ance with the Terms of Reference (ToR), the aim of activity was to improve the methodology

                                                                                            76
for measuring the non-observed economy by economic activities (based on the approaches
developed by the OECD and Eurostat).
The objectives of the consultation were:
    -   to discuss the current algorithm (sequence) of measuring non-observed economy for
        each separate component in accordance with the international classification of non-
        observed economy;
    -   to define the areas of improvement of the current estimates of non-observed econo-
        my.

Conclusion

As was mentioned in previous Action Reports, there is no single methodology for NOE esti-
mations in all countries. Each country has specific conditions for the NOE activities. So, NOE
estimations are about data analysis. It is possible to describe a methodology for the NOE
categories, but some data sources for the estimations could end up in following years. Next,
it is important to find additional data sources. Finally, a rewriting of the methodology is need-
ed. The estimation of the NOE should continually improve, based on advancements in the
estimation methodology and data sources for full coverage of the economy in the NA system.

Recommendations and next steps

•       The NA department staff must be stabilized. The current situation in the NA depart-
        ment is not sustainable. A lot of very good experts who were trained during the pro-
        ject left. The experts should be motivated.
•       The organizational structure of the NA department in the CS is not well organized.
•       The estimation of the NOE in Kazakhstan is about 25 % of GDP, which is quite a high
        share in international comparison. In this case, there should be at least one special-
        ized expert for the NOE estimations only in the NA department.
•       All governmental institutions should use same classifications. For example, the Tax
        Authorities should use same branch classification as the CS (NACE rev. 2). Other-
        wise, the estimations of the NOE category N.6 will not be accurate by branches.
•       It is required to develop a policy of revisions in the NA department. The policy of revi-
        sions includes also calendar with dates when and what will be revised in future. It al-
        lows a preparation for professional public to explain the data changes. Obviously, the
        big revision is planned every five years, which is enough time for collection of a lot of
        methodological changes.
•       Total estimation of the NOE in Kazakhstan in 2013 was preliminarily estimated by the
        new methodology (N1-N7) to be around 25.5 % of GDP. It doesn’t include the NOE
        from statistical reason. The results confirm the NOE estimations made by the old
        methodology, which are higher (28.6 %), but it includes the NOE from statistical rea-
        son (1.4 %). It is recommended to use the Eurostat methodology for the NOE estima-
        tion (N1-N7), which is more practicable, understandable, clear and internationally
        comparable.
                                                                                           77
•      Imputation of the non-response into the survey results is really current work of the
       structural business statistics departments. It’s not a part of the NOE. The CS experts
       could ask experts from other countries. The consultant will try to find a manual in
       which it is described. Some paragraphs on the topic (mentioned above) are in the
       OECD publication Measuring the Non-Observed Economy: A Handbook. It means
       that the NA basic data without the NOE adjustments should be increased (GDP with-
       out NOE will be in 2014 higher about 1.1 % and in 2013 higher about 1.4 %). Then
       the share of total value added from the NOE on GDP will be lower than about 28 %. It
       should be well explained to the professional public.
•      As described in previous Action Reports, four categories applicable to Kazakhstan
       were identified from the 7 NOE categories (N1, N2, N3 and N6). The other categories
       (N4, N5 and N7) are not relevant for Kazakhstan. For example, tips in restaurants
       (N7) are already included in restaurant bills in Kazakhstan.
•      There could be one more part of the NOE in Kazakhstan with significant impact on
       GDP: musicians at weddings. We discussed it, but the estimation was not finalized.
       The production from the activity could be estimated by number of weddings during
       year multiplied by average costs for the musicians. Inclusion into NOE category will
       be based on two questions: Are they registered? Should they be registered?
•      We discussed possibilities about one more mission to the NOE in the NA department.
       One more mission to the NOE on trade was planned, but the mission was cancelled
       due to the recommendation that the NOE estimations should be made in the NA de-
       partment. The main topics for the final mission to the NOE could be (1) a final de-
       scription of the NOE estimations, (2) the analysis of results from the methodologies in
       time series (that the methodology works on data sources during the years), (3) de-
       tailed description of NOE estimations made by the structural business statistics de-
       partment and (4) preparation of explanation of the new NOE methodology to the pro-
       fessional public. The final mission depends on the NA department needs and time
       availabilities.


A Consulting mission (F1-KAZ-10) on the topic “Government expenditure" has been car-
ried out in June 2015 by two experts from the German Federal Statistical Office
Destatis.
Aim of the mission was to improve estimations of the Gross Domestic Product by using the
expenditure method in current and constant prices on a quarterly and annual basis in ac-
cordance with the methodology SNA-2008, other international recommendations as well as
in accordance with the practical experience of a Consortium country, further to give recom-
mendations in accordance with the international standard SNA-2008 on estimating indicators
of final consumption expenditures in the public administration sector in current and constant
prices and on using data of the state budget in the GDP estimations by using three methods
(the expenditure method, production and income method).

1) Travel expenses: reclassification from compensation of personnel (D1) to intermedi-
   ate consumption (P2) in the future (cf. 6.222 e) of SNA 2008).
2) Social transfers in kind (D63) (e.g. all drugs or surgeries that are free of charge for pa-
   tients in Kazakhstan) should be separated from intermediate consumption (P2) in the
   future (cf. 8.141 of SNA 2008).
3) Introduce the perpetual inventory method (PIM) for consumption of fixed capital
   (P51c) of general government sector (S13) in the mid-term (including for Research &
   Development and military weapons). In our opinion it would be useful to introduce
   one single method to calculate the consumption of fixed capital for the total economy
   (S1). It should be checked if this matter could be dealt with during the mission on cap-
   ital account.
4) Revision of the distinction between individual and collective consumption according to
   the guidelines of the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG): the
   functions of other services from government in the field of health, culture, education
   and social protection (COFOG groups 07.6, 08.6, 09.8 and 10.8); tourism (COFOG
   group 04.6) and information services (COFOG group 08.3) have already been shifted
   and implemented during the mission into collective consumption; however R&D of
   higher education institutions can only be shifted from individual to collective consump-
   tion once R&D of higher education institutions (which is collective consumption) will
   have been estimated (cf. recommendation n° 11)).
5) In the mid-term it should be envisaged to complete the breakdown of functions of
   government by COFOG level II (COFOG groups).
6) The budget lines that are assigned to taxes on products in Kazakhstan are generally
   in line with SNA recommendations. In case of doubt, recommendations were given by
   experts after discussion with National Accounts experts of Committee for Statistics
   (see handout 6.1 with final classification).
7) The list of budget lines that are assigned to taxes on production in Kazakhstan was
   improved after long discussions with colleagues from Committee for Statistics. It was
   recommended by experts to distinguish in the future between taxes and fees as sales
   from on non-market output (ESA code P.131) as recommended in both SNA and ESA
   (see handout 6.2 with final classification).
8) The list of budget lines distinguishing between subsidies and transfers is mainly in
   line with SNA guidelines. Only in a few cases changes were made (see handout 7.1
   with final classification).
9) It should be envisaged to further refine the price deflation method by introducing a
   price deflation by transactions.
10) Experts recommend to book weapon systems (as defined in 10.87 of SNA 2008) as
   gross capital formation in the future to be in line with the SNA 2008 guidelines.
11) Research & Development: experts recommend to withdraw R&D from final consump-
   tion expenditure of general government in the following cases:
       a. Purchased R&D (external R&D according to the OECD Frascati Manual): re-
          classification from intermediate consumption (P2) to gross capital formation
          (P51).
                                                                                           79
           b. R&D produced for own final use (internal R&D): reclassification from non-
              market output (P13) to output produced for own final use (P12), which means
              that in the future (P12) will be reducing final consumption expenditure of the
              general government sector (P3) and will be added to the gross capital for-
              mation (P51).
           However, recommendation n°11 can only be started once data on R&D expendi-
           ture of government entities will be collected regularly. Therefore, this recommen-
           dation can only be implemented in the mid-term.


A further Consulting mission (F1-KAZ-38) on the topic “Compilation of the balance of pro-
duced assets" has been carried out in July 2015 by two experts from the Czech statistical
office.
Key task of the mission was to estimate stock of produced assets and to compile balances.
Consumption of fixed assets was also supposed to be estimated and questions regarding the
estimation of imputed rent were answered.

Recommendations and next steps

   CS experts should prepare time series of gross fixed capital formation by type of assets
    in sufficient length, appropriate price indices for employed years and information about
    average service life of assets.
   CS experts promised to collect information that could be used for calculation of stock of
    AN.114 Weapons systems.
   CZ experts are ready to provide feedback to material on Research and Development
    when it is prepared in English version.


A Consulting mission (F1-KAZ-8) on the topic “Compilation of the entire sequence of ac-
counts for General government sector" has been carried out in August 2015 by two experts
from the Czech statistical office.
The mission focused on general government sector (S13) and has covered both methodolog-
ical discussion and practical compilation of accounts. During the mission, the full sequence of
accounts for S13 has been compiled covering units of the highest importance. The recom-
mendations made by the experts are formulated with respect to the capacities and the needs
of the Committee on Statistics.
As the first step, the delimitation of general government was widely discussed. As the ex-
perts were informed, S13 covers units directly involved in the State Budget. In the course of
the mission, the number of units classified in S13 was extended by the units playing a key
role in the fiscal management in Kazakhstan. However, data sources are weak in some cas-
es; this fact is reflected in the recommendations. Further expansion of general government
sector should remains an open issue.
Secondly, the sectoral accounts have been compiled in the entirety with concurrent analysis
of the discrepancy between non-financial and financial accounts. It has been emphasized
                                                                                        80
that the balance (B.9) can deviate from the State budget balance due to reasons which can
be clearly identified (mainly different concepts of revenues and expenditures, delimitation of
sector). Close cooperation with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has been repeatedly reiterated
mainly as to data sources and structure of data.

Conclusions

General government sector in Kazakhstan should be extended by other public units carrying
out on the non-market basis. Different rules are applied in the case of non-financial and fi-
nancial corporations, as discussed during the mission. This should be checked by the CS-
staff in the future. Already during the mission it was recommended by the experts to reclassi-
fy public pension fund to general government sector.
It seems to be urgent to discuss with the MoF the structure of metadata which are provided
to the CS concurrently with the budgetary data. At the same time, the MoF should provide
the CS more detailed and complete balance sheets (compared to the GFS reports) for budg-
etary organisations and for other government units if possible (mainly the funds).
Although some data were missing at the time of the mission (e.g. opening stocks), a com-
plete set of accounts was finished at the end of the mission. The level of discrepancy seems
to be acceptable for the moment.


A Study Visit (F1-SV-12) of CS experts on the topic “Current practice of CZSO for compila-
tion of supply-use tables and input-output tables” has been undertaken in August 2015 to the
Czech statistical office CZSO.
During the study visit, the structure of input-output tables in Czech national accounts has
been presented; in-depth methodological knowledge and practical skills in the area of gener-
ating input-output and supply-use tables of the Czech Republic in current prices and previous
year prices have been obtained. Particularly, current practice of generating input-output and
supply-use tables in buyer’s prices and basic prices and related information sources have
been presented. Current practice of generating input-output and supply-use tables for do-
mestic and imported products has been examined. Current practice of preparing a matrix of
intermediate consumption and output, the practice of compiling gross fixed capital formation,
changes in inventories, values, final consumption expenditure of households in the context of
CPA and COICOP international classifications, import and export of goods and services has
been presented. The experience in the area of balancing supply-use tables and using RAS
method has been presented as well. Models of generating supply-use tables in current prices
by sector per sector and product per product have been examined.
Committee’s staff has examined the experience in the area of using price indices on double
deflation. Approaches of the Czech Republic applied to re-estimate supply-use tables in pre-
vious year prices in Excel format by using the double deflation method have been studied as
well:
   Generating the “output” in previous year prices;
   Generating the “use” of products in previous year prices;


                                                                                           81
   Generating a supply-use matrix in basic prices: matrix of product taxes and subsidies,
    matrix of trade and transport margins in previous year prices;
   Generating a supply-use matrix for imported and domestic products, which are presented
    in basic prices, in previous year prices.
Inter-linkages between sector accounts and supply-use tables have been presented. Rec-
ommendations to change formats of tables in Kazakhstan and introduce controls with sector
accounts have been provided.
Based on study visit results, the following activities will be carried out.
 The process of generating input-output and supply-use tables in buyer’s prices and basic
    prices will be improved;
   The process of making experimental estimations to generate supply-use tables, which
    were prepared in basic prices and buyer’s prices (in two-digit level product and industry
    classifications), in previous year prices by using the double deflation method will be im-
    proved;
   Final consumption of households in the context of Classification of Products by Economic
    Activities and Nomenclature of Goods Items to o the Classification of Individual Con-
    sumption by Purpose will be generated;
   Re-export will be separated.



A Consulting mission (F1-KAZ-19) on the topic “Estimation of GDP by income" has been
carried out in August 2015 by two experts from the Czech statistical office.
The mission was devoted to the income method of estimation of GDP, especially to the item
Compensation of employees and employment. The main focus was devoted to the consistent
classification of the items concerning compensation of employees and employment with the
classification of the items used by the production approach to the estimation of GDP. Since
national accounts are presented as integrated system, some findings and conclusions go
beyond the compilation of Generation of income account.
Discussions were mainly focused on the used source data about Compensation of employ-
ees and about employment in Kazakhstan and about the available data sources which could
or should be used. This discussion was necessary for the correct understanding of surveyed
data with regard to the Kazakh financial accounting rules and to the rules of classification of
units in business register. Based on the information gathered it was possible to prepare in-
structions how to compile Generation of income account and how to include the data on em-
ployment into the system of sector accounts in accordance to SNA 2008 and fully consistent
with other accounts.

Conclusions
    1) Data source table is ready and supplemented with figures from Labour force statistics
       (LFS) and Labour cost statistics (LCS) on employment and with data for individual en-
       trepreneurs. Data were transferred into prepared sectoral tables and tables by activi-
       ties and by institutional sectors.

                                                                                             82
   2) Necessary adjustments were proposed to prepare breakdown by activities and by in-
      stitutional sectors of the economy.
   3) Labour statistics seems to be developed; more intensive cooperation with NA De-
      partment is needed.
   4) Subsidiaries of the enterprises are allocated into institutional sector in the Business
      register according to the parent unit. This approach is inappropriate, it should be
      changed.
   5) LFS and LCS forms should be adjusted to fulfil all needs of National Accounts, espe-
      cially in connection with employment expressed in full-time equivalent (FTE) and
      wages and salaries in kind.
   6) Existing methods of NOE (N1,N6) estimates should be improved and also taken into
      account in institutional sector breakdown.

Recommendations and next steps
First of all Balance of Labour (according instructions given during mission) should be com-
piled. Compare data only in totals, not by activities to avoid sampling error from LFS. We
recommend to provide analyses of data about labour and then to distribute unofficial em-
ployment data into activities (fixed structure for next 3-5 years). Analyses could be done for
last 3 years, comparing data from business statistics and LFS.
Moreover estimates for non- observed economy need to be improved, especially categories
N1 and N6.
   1. Percentages applied (from tax controls) for misreporting by the producers to be calcu-
      lated as a 3 – year move average. Results for one year are affected by the structure
      of tax controls.
   2. Take data from SBS statistics for small and medium size enterprises and apply aver-
      age percentages of misreporting by the producers.
   3. Then to calculate labour productivity (GVA/ per employee) for small enterprises.
   4. As a result of Balance of Labour the number of unofficial employees and self-
      employed will be provided.
   5. Self-employed put into Household sector and apply on them labour productivity.
   6. Employees put into Non-financial corporations sector and apply on them labour
      productivity. Then estimate wages and salaries using average wages for small enter-
      prises.
   7. Calculate labour productivity for official self-employed (within Households sector) and
      compare this productivity with productivity from small enterprises. Difference would be
      considered as Non- observed economy – non-declared incomes, category N6.
   8. Gross operating surplus from misreporting in non-financial corporation sector should
      be transferred to the Households via D.42 – Distributed incomes of corporations.

A further Consulting mission (F1-KAZ-41) on the topic “Compilation of accounts for finan-
cial corporations and financial accounts" has been carried out in September 2015 by two
experts from the Czech statistical office.
This mission builds on previous missions “Non-Financial Corporations Sector S11 and
Household Sector S14” and “The compilation of the entire sequence of accounts for General
government sector (S.13)”.
The aim of the mission was to show the way how to create the system of national accounts
for sector of financial institutions. The whole work can be divided into several steps:


1/ studying the existing data sources in the Financial Corporations Sector S12
2/ recommendations related to data sources
3/ generating a sequence of national accounts in Financial Corporations Sector S12
4/ recommendations to “Methodology to Account Central Bank Services”, “Methodology to
Account Second Tier Banks Financial Services”, “Methodology to Account the Output of Fi-
nancial Intermediation Services”, “Methodology to Account Pension Funds Services”, “Meth-
odology to Account Insurance Services”
5/ recommendations made in line with SNA 2008, which have to be considered when gener-
ating a full sequence of accounts of the Financial Corporations Sector S12.
The mission was not only with staff of the Division of National Accounts, but also with two
experts from the National Bank of Kazakhstan.

Conclusions
The main goal of this mission, to show the way, how to compile national accounts for finan-
cial institutions, was achieved.
Sectoral table for S12 (SEK12_13e.xlsm) was created.
Units classified to S12 were divided into eight groups of units:
   1. NBK of Kazakhstan (SS12_NB.xlsm);
   2. Tier II Banks (SS12_CB.xlsm);
   3. Insurance companies (SS12_IC.xlsm);
   4. Pension funds (SS12_PF.xlsm);
   5. Brokers/Dealers (SS12_BRO.xlsm);
   6. Investment managers (SS12_IF.xlsm);
   7. Organizations engaged in certain types of banking operations (SS12_OFI.xlsm);
   8. Other units - microcredit organizations, leasing companies, pawnshops etc.
      (SS12_SBS.xlsm, SS12_MKO.xlsm).
       For each group separate SS table was created. To all SS tables resources data (prof-
       it and loss statements and balance sheets) were added. All items in resources data
       were given SNA codes.
                                                                                        84
      SS tables for NBK, Insurance companies and Tier II Banks were completed. It means
      that sheet with full sequence of national accounts was filled by links to data resources for
      each items. Then the result column of national accounts for these groups were put to part
      for resource data in sectoral table. These tables are a model for completing other SS ta-
      bles.
      CZ experts went through all submitted methodological lists describing calculation of out-
      put for NBK, Tier II Banks, FISIM, Insurance companies and Pension funds. CZ experts
      found out that methodological lists are not fully in accordance with methodology of SNA
      2008 and made a number of recommendations that need to be done.

Recommendations and next steps
 1.     Verify the completeness of resources data for financial institutions - CZ experts didn´t
        have an opportunity to look to business register and see the complete list of units clas-
        sified to this sector.
 2.     According to obtained instructions fill data sources by the codes of SNA in the rest SS
        tables (other financial intermediaries, microcredit organizations, SBS).
 3.     Under the prepared model in SS tables for NBK, Insurance companies and Tier II
        Banks create links to the data sources according to filled codes of SNA in other pre-
        pared SS tables.
 4.     Together with structural statistic create new separate output of resources data for units
        that are not licensed by NBK, but classified to S12 in business register (leasing com-
        panies, pawnshops, financial auxiliaries …). Create separate SS table for these units,
        according to instructions for non-financial institution.
 5.     Fill the SEK table for financial institutions by the data sources from created SS tables.
 6.     Change calculation of the output for central bank, commercial banks, FISIM, insurance
        company and pension funds under the presented recommendation by experts.
 7.     Closely cooperate with central bank on obtaining supplementary information about
        missing data, which NBK can provide and cooperate with central bank on creating new
        data sources for missing information.


A Consulting Mission has been carried out in September/October 2015 by a German ex-
pert on the topic “Forming a revaluation account for financial assets” (F1-KAZ-29).
The aim of the consultation was to make familiar the participants from the Committee on Sta-
tistics and from various other institutions with the methodology of the 2008 System of Ac-
counts (2008 SNA) in the context of compiling the revaluation account and the other changes
in the volume of financial assets and liabilities account. Specific focus was on how (1) to treat
valuation changes and volume changes in the context of securities issuances and holdings;
(2) to move from stocks at the beginning of a period to stocks at the end of a period by dis-
tinguishing between transactions, revaluations and other changes in the volume of financial
assets and liabilities by residency and institutional sector and subsector – specifically of fi-
nancial and non-financial corporations and of general government; and (3) to identify the ap-
propriate statistical sources, methods and balancing techniques for the reduction of the exist-
                                                                                               85
ing discrepancies vertically (between net lending (+) /net borrowing (-) compiled for the capi-
tal account and for the financial account) and horizontally (between financial assets or
changes in financial assets and liabilities or changes in liabilities).
Intensive work focussed on the analysis of the current practice of compiling the revaluation
account and of the other changes in the volume of financial assets and liabilities account by
institutional sector. Much time was devoted to identify the available statistical sources used,
to give advice on the comprehensive compilation of these accounts also in the context of the
financial account and balance sheet in terms of sector and financial instrument breakdowns.
Based on the 2008 SNA the recommended classification of securities by category, sub-
category and sub-position was discussed. The available statistical sources in the Stock Ex-
change JSC, the Central Securities Depository JSC, and the Integrated Securities Registrar
JSC were evaluated to derive a comprehensive set of data for the financial account, the re-
valuation account and the other changes in the volume of financial assets and liabilities ac-
count. The corresponding statistical treatment was also discussed for the following financial
instrument categories and sub-categories: monetary gold and special drawing rights, curren-
cy and deposits, loans, other equity and investment fund shares or units, insurance, pension
and standardized guarantee schemes, financial derivatives and employee stock options, and
other accounts receivable and payable.

Conclusions
    There is a need and also some room to improve the quality (the coverage, the account-
     ing rules, and the timeliness) of the current set of sectoral annual financial accounts,
     revaluation accounts, and other changes in the volume of financial assets and liabilities
     accounts and financial balance sheets.
    One significant improvement of these accounts but also of the capital account will be
     achieved by integrating the data, which will be requested from and be delivered by the
     NBK, the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange JSC, and the Central Securities Depository
     JSC, and the Integrated Securities Registrar JSC.
    There is also a need to draw up a full and consistent set of government accounts on an
     accrual basis (current, capital and financial account, other accumulation accounts and
     balance sheet). For the time being the coverage of government data is incomplete.
     Moreover, substantial efforts need to be made to transform the cash data into accrual
     data.
    It has to be checked again whether all national accounts compilers and data providers
     apply the same registers (for general government, financial corporations, and non-
     financial corporations). Some discrepancies may be due to the use of different regis-
     ters.
    National accountants have to identify the reasons for the existing major discrepancies
     in net lending (+)/net borrowing (-) by sector and to reduce these discrepancies before
     publishing sectoral accounts

Consultation mission F1-KAZ-7 “Sector of Non-Financial Corporations S11 and Household
Sector S14”
Employees of the Division of National Accounts have prepared data on individual entrepre-
neurs by economic activity for 2013 (based on data taken from the business register, tax
revenue): the number of employed workers, the gross output and the number of individual
entrepreneurs. Prepared data has been sent to experts of the Czech Statistical Office for
inclusion into sector tables.
In connection with the expiration of deadlines to revise statistical forms for 2016, amend-
ments and supplements recommended by Czech experts to the statistical forms 1-ПФ “Re-
port on Financial and Economic Activities Performed by an Enterprise” and a 2-МП “Report
on Activities Performed by Small Enterprises” will be introduced by the Division of Structural
Statistics in the process of revising the forms next year.


Consultation mission F1-KAZ-39 “Designing and Estimating Non-Observed Economy Indi-
cators (NOE)
   An employee who was responsible for NOE estimations (and GDP by using the pro-
    duction method) has quit. A competition to fill in the vacant position has been an-
    nounced.
   Changes on the number of staff of the Division of National Accounts are not foreseen.
    Currently, the number of Division employees is 23 persons, and there are three vacant
    positions under a competition.

    one specific person. Estimations will be made by employees that are involved in GDP
    calculations by using the production method.
   A letter on the need to use an updated version of the Common Classification of Eco-
    nomic Activities (NACE, ver. 2) has been forwarded to the State Revenue Committee
    (Tax Committee) of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan (MoF). How-
    ever, staff of the State Revenue Committee (Tax Committee) of MoF has informed that
    they will not be able to switch to the updated version of the classification due to lack of
    additional budget funds to elaborate the software.
   Unfortunately, the Division has no experience in the area of designing a policy of revi-
    sion and changes introduction; no experience in this field has been studied. It is neces-

        perimental estimations in general government sector at constant prices based on data
        for 2013. Each output component has been separately deflated (intermediate con-
        sumption, labor compensation, fixed capital consumption). Currently, the obtained re-
        sults are being analyzed, and a search is performing for the most appropriate price in-
        dices or other alternative deflators.
9.      Implementation of recommendations on weapons systems will depend on obtaining the
        necessary information from the Ministry of Defense of RoK.

Study visit F1-SV-12 “Compilation of Supply-Use Tables and Input-Output Tables”
Following the results of mission F1-KAZ-34 the international expert gave recommendations
on usage of two methods of generating SUT at current prices and prices of the previous
year.
The first method is method of rolling settlement. At first, SUTs at current prices are generated
and balances. Then, the tables are deflated and at the end, values at fixed prices are bal-
anced. This method was used in Kazakhstan.
The second method is method of simultaneous settlement. SUTs at current prices and at
prices of previous year are balanced simultaneously.
For the purpose to apply the second method, in the course of study visit F1-SV-12 in terms of
improvement of calculations while generating SUT at prices of the previous year in excel
program, the Committee staff received a set of excel files of Czech statistical office.
Further, the Department staff plan to use order and algorithm of excel files of Czech statisti-

Consultation mission F1-KAZ-19 "Estimation of GDP by Income"

Upon the activity's results, making changes in estimations of the GDP by income is sched-
uled. In particular, breakdown of the GDP components by economy sector will be changed.
For example, people employed by individuals shall be transferred from the households sector
to the non-financial corporations’ sector. Probably, share of economy sectors will be re-
allocated. In addition, wages and salaries in kind are planned to be added with specific indi-
cators from statistical report 1-Т "Labor Report". Moreover, estimates of employment will be
compiled in equivalent of full employment that will considerably influence on the final results.
In addition, labor-force balance sheet will be changed in estimation of the GDP by income.
Making-out a labor-force balance sheet requires additional data sources. In this regard, it is
necessary to make analysis of data sources for the missing components of labor-force bal-
ance sheet and then make-out a balance sheet itself.
The experts' recommendations for changing estimation of the GDP by income will be taken
into account when improving the Methodology for compiling a generation of income account
in the current accounts.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F2-KAZ-2) on the topic “System of structural statistics indicators.
Developing a statistical toolkit. Recommendations for estimating gross value added (GVA)
indicators based on enterprises’ financial statements” has been carried out in May 2015 b y
two experts from the German statistical office Destatis.
The aim was to give practical training to acquire in-depth knowledge in the field of improving
the system of structural statistics indicators in accordance with the System of National Ac-
counts (SNA) requirements, improving the statistical toolkit in structural statistics. The main
purpose of the consultation was further the evaluation and preparation of an additional sur-
vey for “entrepreneurs”. Together with a survey in structural statistics for ent erprises having
more than 100 employees and secondly, enterprises having less than 100 employees this
third survey only for entrepreneurs is quite important because of their outstanding role in
some economic branches in Kazakhstan. In former times for Gross Value Added (GDP) cal-
culations results from subject statistics have been used but with no specific information about
intermediate consumption. Therefore the decision to have an own survey for entrepreneurs
in order to get this specific information is also important for SNA purposes. The questionnaire
was intensively studied, discussed and some proposals were given to increase the transpar-
ency and understanding.

Conclusions

The main purpose of the consultation at the SC was the preparation of the new survey for
individual entrepreneurships. It will fill the gap of not having enough economic information
about private households being self-employed and also having market activities with turnover
and costs. In some areas in Kazakhstan this economic activities are quite significant adding
a good part to GVA. The questionnaire is sufficient to ensure full information about calculat-
ing production value and intermediate consumption for purpose of GVA calculation in the
department of national Accounts. The Department of National Account should therefore use
all information from the Department of Structural statistics, namely turnover and information

about costs. It is advisable to stick to one information source and not to mix up different
sources.
It is the task of the Department of Structural Statistics to control and monitor the answers of
the respondents with respect to plausible results. It should be tested, on the level of econom-
ic branches (NACE 2 digits), if negative GVA in a simple derivation (turnover minus sum of
material costs) appears. With the help of contacting the respondents and reassuring the an-
swers or comparing the answers with other sources of statistical information the Department
of Structural Statistics should proof the stability and significance of their results.
Recommendations and next steps
5. Activate the new questionnaire for individual entrepreneurs. Consider the recommenda-
   tions of additional questions, f. e. NACE classification.
6. Calculate the full range of simple-GVA figures (NACE 2 digits) in order to check the relia-
   bility of the answers of the respondents.
7. For the Division of National Accounts it is recommended to use all information from the
   structural statistics division and not to mix it up with information coming from subject sta-
   tistics.
8. A random sampling (3 %) should be a reliable value to start with.


A further Consulting mission (F2-KAZ-10) on the topic “Developing an algorithm for esti-
mating labour productivity. Identifying sources of information to estimate labour productivity”
has been carried out in May 2015 by an expert from the German statistical office Destatis.
After the first missions in 2013 and 2014, the aim of the mission was to familiarize the CS
staff with further methodological requirements of labour productivity calculations. It was made
clear that in all international comparisons, labour productivity aggregates of National ac-
counts are used. Beginning with yearly figures and based upon two concepts:
GDP in current or real terms as a relation to labour input measured in persons employed;
GDP in current or real terms as a relation to labour input measured in hours worked of the
employed persons.
Not only with respect to the whole economy but also for the different economic branches, in-
depth methodological practice should be outlined in order to discuss the path of productivity
over time in Kazakhstan. The expert presented and explained the concepts for calculating
labour productivity that are common in Germany and also give the basis for international
comparisons. Empirical data for Kazakhstan was examined together with data from other
departments (Labour department), and Labour productivity on the basis of hours worked was
also discussed.
Taken together, all data sources to calculate labour productivity for different branches on an
annual basis are available. Moreover this data is also given quarterly but has to be checked
for plausibility on the basis on the outcomes of productivity calculations.

From the Department of Labour statistics, data for hours worked are available in annual as
well as in quarterly frequencies. Also they are available in a NACE classification. They have
been used to calculate figures for labour productivity. This work should be done in the De-
partment of National Accounts. The purpose of presenting labour productivity on the basis of
hours worked is that it also covers part time work, vacation effects and sick-leave effects.
The respective concepts were explained. For Kazakhstan at the moment there is no correc-
tion for yearly working days or part time work. This phenomenon does not seem to exist
widely in Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, the calculations should be completed with it.
Moreover, the mission has familiarized the CS staff with the concept of total Factor productiv-
ity (TFP) and its calculation within a simple framework. Whereas in general, econometric
programs like “E-views” are used to obtain results for TFP, a simple approach with the help
of Excel calculations was used. CS staff mentioned that there is a question concerning the
influence of technical progress. Therefore the calculation of TFP results, for which labour
productivity figures and data for the capital stock were given, was chosen to explain.

Conclusions, recommendations and next steps

1)   Productivity calculations should come from the department of National Accounts. It is
     strongly recommended that when publishing the results of calculations of labour
     productivity for different branches (NA aggregates), it should focus only on economic
     branches having a significant share of the economy as a whole (Agriculture, producing
     industry, manufacturing industry, construction, services). The calculations however can
     start on a deeper NACE level, but what the practical experience in Germany also
     shows is that the more detailed the results are carried out, the more singularities occur.
     In Germany, productivity results are published in an A11 classification of NACE.
2)   To make calculations for the department of NA more effective and less time consum-
     ing, it should moreover be granted that data supplies from other divisions (labour statis-
     tics) should be used (hours worked). Productivity calculations should come from the
     department of National Accounts, as they are responsible for the macro level. Produc-
     tivity calculations from the department of structural statistics can only cover parts of the
     economy (like medium and large enterprises). This is not comparable to other labour
     productivity figures for other countries. This only makes sense in a second step for na-
     tional questions or plausibility checks.
3)   With respect to calculations of Total factor productivity (TFP), it could be quite difficult
     from a statistical point of view to judge econometric outcomes and approaches dealing
     with these questions. In Germany, only the leading economic research institutes (Ifo,
     München; DIW, Berlin, a.o.) work on these calculations. They calculate TFP figures on-
     ly based on a time span of over 10 years. In quarterly frequencies, these calculations
     do not make sense as the structure of the economy is in the focus. Moreover there are
     no calculations for TFP for economic branches in Germany from these institutes for the
     same reason. International Organizations like the OECD present some results for TFP
     for economic branches. To do this would mean that the capital stock data for Kazakh-

     stan has to be disaggregated into branches. Moreover, the weighting factor (alpha= the
     distribution relation between wages and profits) has to be calculated for the specific
     branches. It also means that the use of an econometric program is important because
     of the estimation attitudes of the relevant equations. The Federal Statistical Office
     (Destatis) does not calculate results for TFP. These results are carried out with the help
     of econometric programs like E-views. Moreover, it should be clear that the theoretical
     approach (Solow residual) goes beyond the duties of statistical work.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the recommendations given as part of activities under Subcomponent F2-KAZ-2, a
statistical toolkit for structural statistics has been designed in accordance with international
requirements and allows improving the quality of the generated information and it is possible
to compare it at international level. Seven statistical reporting forms have been reviewed and
significantly reduced according to international recommendations.
As part of the implementation of the international experts’ recommendations, a new form for
the sector of individual entrepreneurs, which is currently being under approval by the Ministry
of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan, has been drafted. It is planned to carry out this sur-
vey in 2016. The new survey will be conducted to determine the cost structure of individual
entrepreneurs for SNA estimations.
During consultation missions under Subcomponent F2-KAZ-10, the Division staff has
assessed labor productivity in dynamics for 10 years by activity based on hours worked
according to experts’ recommendations. In addition, preliminary estimations multifactor
productivity have been made on a basis of the so-called approaches “growth rate
accounting” or “Solow residual”. Further works on multi-factor productivity have been
transferred to the Division of National Accounts.
In addition, staff of the Division has prepared the draft methodological guidelines on labor
productivity, the approval of which is scheduled for the 4th quarter of 2015. These methodo-
logical guidelines have been designed to estimate the productivity of medium and large en-
terprises to monitor government programs; besides, they contain a section on estimations of
labor productivity on the economy in general made by the Division of National Accounts in
accordance with international requirements.

Notes on further planning

In 2016 as part of the scheduled mission under Subcomponent F2-KAZ-2, the results of the
pilot survey of individual entrepreneurs on the cost structure will be summarized and ana-
lyzed. The obtained results will later be used in the system of national accounts to estimate
the intermediate consumption of the sector of individual entrepreneurs.

Findings and results

A Training mission (F3-KAZ-2) on the topic “SME indicators” has been carried out in Au-
gust 2015 by an expert from the Russian statistical office.
It was recommended to provide appropriate training for Kazstat experts in order to implement
convenient and reliable procedures for preparing stratified samples and subsequent analysis
and tabulating of SME survey results including estimation of sampling errors. It should allow
to increase the value of SME statistics and reduce workload on experts involved in the pro-
cess.
The purpose of the training is to increase quality of SME statistics in Kazstat by means of the
following improvements in the sampling surveys’ processes:
    Reduce the time needed for the preparation of stratified samples for SME surveys and
     increase reliability of the process by use of standard IBM SPSS Complex Samples soft-
     ware tools.
    Accompany all the survey results by their sampling error estimates that significantly in-
     crease the value of SME statistics.
    Easily derive any needed breakdowns of SME indicators along with error estimates tak-
     ing into account complex sampling plans.
    Quickly discover the limits for possible breakdowns of the SME survey indicators, for ex-
     ample, whether the accuracy level is sufficient to publish SME statistics on district
     [район] level.
    Automate regular operations on processing SME surveys based on SPSS Syntax feature
     to reduce time for data processing, analysis and tabulating.
As a result of the training, Kazstat’s experts acquired skills in preparing complex samples for
SME surveys and analysis of survey results taking into account sampling plans in order to
provide correct statistics and accompany it by sampling error estimates. It should help them
effectively produce correct statistical results from SME survey data for any needed break-
downs of indicators by use of convenient standard tools.

Recommendations and next steps

   1. Prepare samples and analyze SME survey results by means of convenient standard
      tools of IBM SPSS Statistics and SPSS Complex Samples available in Kazstat. It will
      permit to minimize efforts needed to produce SME surveys statistics and guarantee
      its correctness.
   2. Accompany all the indicators derived from SME surveys by their error estimates. It
      will significantly enrich SME statistics as well as allow identifying the limits for depth
      of breakdown of statistical indicators based on acceptable levels of sampling errors.
   3. It is advisable to automate regular operations for producing SME survey statistics with
      taking into account sampling plans based on use of SPSS Syntax that permits to
      seamlessly automate the whole process starting from getting data from data sources
      to obtaining tabulated statistical reports.
   4. To use direct connections of IBM SPSS Statistics to the needed data sources in da-
      tabases instead of ordering of downloads of data files. It will significantly increase of
      cooperativeness of the statistical reports and bring much more flexibility to statistical
      data analysis.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

In order to evaluate key performance indicators of small and medium-sized enterprises and
the contribution of the SME sector into the country’s economy in the past year in a ccordance
with the individual international recommendations, the Methodology of Estimating Indicators
of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises has been approved.
Certain work has been performed to improve the quality of data generated on sample sur-
veys of small enterprises by the Division of Structural Statistics together with the Division of
Registers.
Experts have offered using standard software IBM SPSS Complex Samples in the process of
carrying out sample surveys. A training to use this software in the process of preparing for a
sample survey and analyzing the obtained data has been held.

Notes on further planning

Further planning of works under this component is possible only after implementation of ac-
tivities scheduled for 2016. Yet there is no agreement either on the topics of activities initially
included in the program document, nor on terms of their implementation.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F4b-KAZ-2) on the topics “Introduction of export and import price
indices based on actual transactions, and ‘issues’ of price indices for agriculture” has been
carried out in May 2015 by a price statistics expert from Statistics Finland.
Purpose of the mission was to develop import and export price indices, that shall be com-
piled based on actual transaction prices collected from enterprises. Currently unit value price
indices are compiled. Unit value indices may contain severe bias, and thus foreign trade
price indices are subject to improvement.
During the mission, several topics were discussed concerning import and export price indi-
ces: data collection, conducted pilot survey, concepts, statistical forms and instructions,
product group and enterprise sampling, unit value prices, hybrid index, imputations, editing
and validation, calculation, weighting and methodological manual. In addition to im-
ports/exports, some issues related to price indices of agriculture were discussed.
KAZSTAT has progressed on this project component, and conducted a pilot survey to evalu-
ate the statistical form and possibilities of collection price data from enterprises. Results were
promising. In addition, methodology has been developed. Data collection, sampling, weights
and calculation will meet international standards, if implemented according to the current
plans. It is recommended to carry on, and compile and publish “real” price indices for foreign
trade in the future. Inevitably, this will require new data collection from enterprises. As a re-
sult, burden for enterprises will of course increase. However, as foreign trade indices are
used, for example, in constant price calculation in National Accounts, GDP growth rates shall

be of better quality. Use of unit value indices poses a threat, not only for foreign trade price
indices, but also to GDP calculations.

Recommendations and next steps

•       KAZSTAT should carry on the development of compiling Export and Import Price In-
        dices (XPI and MPI) based on real transactions collected from enterprises.
•       The current plan of calculating and publishing indices only on a national level - Ka-
        zakhstan as a whole, no regional indices - is supported.
•       The conducted pilot study on Q1/2015 proved the possibility of collecting prices from
        enterprises. Feedback from enterprises was noticed and statistical form and instruc-
        tions were adjusted accordingly.
•       If it is not possible to collect prices for some reason, then sometimes it is possible to
        use unit value prices calculated in as detailed level as possible from Customs data.
        Study whether these unit value prices are reliable or not, or consider possibility of
        leaving the product out from the sample if it is not significant.
•       Regarding price indices for agriculture, some issues were discussed and recommen-
        dations for improvement given.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

The following actions were taken to implement proposals for the F4b-KAZ-2 activity:
1) The Methodological Guidelines for Constructing Export and Import Price Indices was ap-
   proved by Order of the Chairperson of the Committee for Statistics No.124 dated August
   20, 2015 and registered by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Sep-
   tember 16, 2015 under the number 12063.
2) The terms of reference were prepared to design software for:
    -   selecting importing/exporting enterprises by region for the forthcoming survey starting
        from January 2016;
    -   generating a scheme to weight foreign trade indices including the grouping by the
        EEU member countries, CIS and other countries;
    -   processing primary data and obtaining output indicators.
Moreover, the software for constructing industrial producer price index and price index of
purchasing the products by industrial enterprises was modified to use another source of input
information - export and import price indices and their merger with the domestic market price
indices.

Notes on further planning

The last consultation mission will take place on October 19-23 with participation of two Finn-
ish experts. The mission will be combined with a three-day workshop to be carried out for
regional specialists. All preparations have been completed, the participants have been de-
termined.
At the end of 2015, it is planned to complete the sampling of export/import goods and enter-
prises for each region.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

To implement the proposals provided for activity F4е-KAZ-6, changes and amendments were
made to the processes of the software that have been previously designed for generating a
weighting scheme and calculating price indices for agricultural products at all levels of ag-
gregation.

Notes on further planning

This mission was the last activity for improving price indices for agricultural products under
Subcomponent F4е.


A Study Visit (F4e-SV-6) of CS experts on the topic "Experience in building price indices in
construction sector in line with the international practice” has been carried out in May 2015 to
the Italian statistical office ISTAT.
The aim of the study visit was acquiring the methodological recommendations and practical
skills in building price indices in construction sector in line with the international standards by
the CS staff. The objective was studying international experience in building price indices in
construction sector through the example of the EU countries.
The training program consisted of theoretical and practical aspects of building price indices
used in Italy in three main areas:
    -   price statistics in construction sector;
    -   price statistics in the field of industrial enterprises;
    -   import price statistics.
According to the study visit’s results, the Division of Price Statistics shall:
Take into account Italian experience in data sources for price indicators, sampling basic en-
terprises, methods used and practice of price information collection, forming schemes of
weighting and their updating.

The following activities shall be implemented to introduce value index of construction sector:
1. Studying indicators of Form 2-КС “Report on putting objects into commission” for their use
   in order to detect the types of new construction facilities and their statistical characteris-
   tics. Making analysis by indicators of construction and investment statistics in dynamics
   and by regions.
2. Detecting characteristics of a “typical” model of housing construction in the republic and
   by construction areas (regions) to transfer the materials to technical expert in construction
   sector engaged to develop facility cost estimates of “typical” models of housing constru c-
   tion based on statistical data.
3. Identifying the possible data sources to estimate cost of renting truck transport and
   equipment used in construction together with the technical expert in construction sector.
4. Using prices of manufacturing enterprises and imported receipts of construction materials
   in estimating price indices of construction value and price index of construction by ele-
   ments of the technological structure based on the acquired experience and international
   experts’ recommendations provided throughout the mission in Kazakhstan. Using pur-
   chase prices of the construction materials by construction organizations in building price
   indices in construction sector during the period before launching new data source into es-
   timation process.
5. In addition the approaches used in Italian statistics for collecting primary data, forming
   sampled populations and their updating in the process of forming price indices of produc-
   ers of industrial products and export and import prices indices shall be taken into account.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

The following actions were taken to implement proposals for the F4e-SV-6 activity:
1) Data on residential houses commissioned in 2011-2013 was analyzed by region and re-
public (based on the complete database of data provided by individuals and legal entities)
according to the following attributes:
       - floor and usable area of residential houses;
       - the number of apartments by number of rooms;
       - the number of residential houses by the degree of improvements;
       - the number of residential houses by material of walls;
       - the number of residential houses by number of floors.
A similar, but more detailed analysis is currently carried out based on the data describing the
residential houses commissioned by the construction companies in 2011-2014.

Notes on further planning

This was the second activity held under Subcomponent F4e “Construction Price Indices”.
The second consultation mission F4e-KAZ-3 of the international expert is scheduled for Feb-
ruary 2016.


A Consulting mission (F4e-KAZ-1) on the topic “Improvement of CPI” has been carried out
in September 2015 by a price statistics expert from Statistics Finland.
The aim of this mission was to discuss the current procedures and obtain recommendations
on the compilation of the CPI, based on the Finnish experience as well as recent recommen-
dations provided by international organizations.
The consultant discussed the procedures and methodologies used in compiling the CPI, and
attempted to build an overall picture of the production process of the CPI in Kazakhstan.
Several admirable features were found. The CPI staff is highly motivated, competent and
eager to find places for continuous improvement. A new production system for electronic
price collection and data management has been built and is now in a testing phase. The new
system will be implemented into production after a successful pilot study.
The procedures of the CPI compilation largely follow good practices. However, the expert
recommends CS to study the possibility of having more flexibility in price collection between
different regions, to better adapt to the different circumstances in different regions. There are
significant differences for example in the climate in different regions, which affects the sea-
sonality of certain products. It is recommended to study the possibility of introducing an ap-
propriate methodology for the treatment of seasonal products, either variable weighting or
price estimation, while also taking into account the varying seasons in different regions. Fur-
thermore, the expert recommends to study the possibility of compiling regional weights, to
better estimate the impact of a certain region on the national index.
In the expert’s view, the current index calculation procedure seems rather complex. CS sp e-
cialists are encouraged to study the possibility of simplifying the calculation procedure.
CS plans to update the classification of the CPI to the new 5-digit COICOP. The consultant
advised to implement the update along with the planned base year update. She also advised
to use the chance to thoroughly go through the items in the market basket, and verify that
they are placed in the correct COICOP classes. The expert also supports the idea of includ-
ing newly significant items in the market basket, along with the base year update.

Recommendations and next steps

The expert recommends
-   to study the possibility of compiling regional weights;



PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                                Page 107
KAZSTAT Twinning Arrangement



-   to study the possibility of having more flexibility in the price collection methods between
    different regions, e.g. collecting the prices of water according to the regional tariff struc-
    ture;
-   to implement an appropriate methodology for the treatment of seasonal products, taking
    into account the varying seasonality in different regions of the country;
-   to study the possibility of simplifying the calculation procedure of the CPI;
-   to update the market basket and implement the new 5-digit COICOP along with the next
    base year update. Updated market basket should include all newly significant items. In-
    clusion of owner-occupied housing should be considered;
-   to review the outlet sample.



A further Consulting Mission was carried out in August 2015 on the topic “Agricultural Pric-
es” by an expert from the Turkish statistical institute TurkStat (F4e-KAZ-6). The report is not
yet available.

CS experts participated moreover in a Study Visit (F4e-SV-3/4) on Price Statistics in June
2015 in Paris and Wiesbaden. The report is not yet available.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

A mechanism was designed to monitor primary data by establishing the range of price
changes for each group of consumer goods within the CPI and industrial products within the
PPI. The directory of status of goods was complemented with new statuses of goods.
A directory of price change reasons was designed. Moreover, format and logical controls are
provided for the respondents who enter data in the online mode.

Notes on further planning

The improved Methodological Guidelines for Monitoring Consumer Goods and Services
Prices will be approved in the fourth quarter of 2015 in the prescribed manner.

Findings and results

Two Consulting missions (F5-KAZ-1 and F5-KAZ-5) on the topics “Studying the current
situation and preparing recommendations to formulate industrial statistics indicators and es-
timate the physical volume index of industrial output” and “Estimating the physical volume
index of industrial output” have been carried out in June/July 2015 by two experts from the
Italian statistical institute ISTAT. The results of the missions have been combined in one re-
port.
Mission F5-KAZ-5 was aimed to discuss and find out practical solutions to make Kazakhstani
industrial statistics volume index close to the international standards. Three themes, in par-
ticular, were deeply discussed: i) about weightings, the comparison between the present Ka-
zakh method for deriving weights (bottom-up method, based on the value of production col-
lected at District level) and the one of value added (top-down method, where weights at a
lower level are derived by detailing value added – at 4 digit level of NACE – through appro-
priate value of production coefficients); ii) the inclusion of new products as it is carried out at
present in CS and as it should be whether the index compilation were chain-linked. Discus-
sions among the CS specialists and the Italian experts converge to identify the present Ka-
zakh IPI compilation method closer to a rolling base than a chain-index; iii) about data collec-
tion, on one side the presence among respondents of individual entrepreneurs and house-
holds and, on the other side, the absence of a standard system to check data.
During mission F5-KAZ-1 other aspects have been highlighted. The one of dissemination
and publishing was relevant: current practices in United Nations and European countries
(hereafter UN–EU) have been presented by Italian experts. CS colleagues provided infor-
mation about disseminating IPI and industrial statistics in general. Press releases and web
sites have been compared and discussed. Data collection practices were shortly compared
too: at present, it seems CS data collection is still mostly paper based.
Based on the information received, the Italian experts will provide punctual recommendations
applied to the main mission themes. Most of these will be included in the IPI practice survey
manual that will be enclosed to the simulation results. Others are included in annexes of the
report.

Conclusion

•      At present, CS IPI survey mainframe is aimed to provide information for domestic
       users only. Although Kazakh IPI is rather consistent with UN–EU standards, to allow
       international comparisons the indicator has to be recompiled. Both Italian experts and
       CS colleagues agreed about planning a follow-up mission to assess the work planned
       and to comment results;
•      The Kazakh IPI survey was analysed and compared with the UN–EU standards.
       Where and how to modify the present IPI mainframe has been focused during the
       meeting; the aim of IPI simulation is to provide empirical results also by detailing
       methods and practices adopted. CS colleagues will provide data to the Italian experts
       to run the IPI simulation. IPI data should be provided until the end of July 2015.

Recommendations and next steps

•      a follow-up activity on IPI. This one is strongly recommended;
•      an activity mainly focused on Producer price indices and Input/Output prices on con-
       structions should be carried out. This recommendation origins from technical evalua-
       tions occurred while discussing meeting themes;
•      detailed lists of recommendations are included in Annexes 7 and 8 of the report.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the recommendations provided, pilot estimation of Industrial Production Index is
carried out using gross value added as a weight.
Since the beginning of the KAZSTAT Project, the Methodological Guidelines for Formulating
the Scope and Values of Industrial Statistics Indicators was reviewed and approved in 2013.
Statistical Classification of Industrial Products has been amended. The Classification was re-
approved on December 13, 2014.

Notes on further planning

For the theme “Examining the current status and preparing recommendations for formulating
industrial statistics indicators to estimate the physical volume index of industrial output”, one
consultation mission is scheduled for October 2015 and two consultation missions are
scheduled for 2016.
As part of the ongoing activities, it is planned to prepare a draft methodology for calculating
Industrial Production Index based on international standards.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F6-KAZ-4) on the topic “Services to analyze the current status in
Kazakhstan, draft recommendations for non-financial asset indicators, produce data in econ-
omy sectors, improve the statistical toolkit and formulate indicators in accordance with a
model scheme (algorithm)” has been carried out in May 2015 by an expe rt from the Italian
statistical institute ISTAT.
The activity’s aim was to increase the quality of formulated investment indicators by impro v-
ing the methodology for carrying out a statistical survey in line with international recommen-
dations. The activity’s objective was to provide methodological and practical assistance in
updating current methodological provisions for formulating investment statistics indicators
based on the internationally accepted system of accounting such indicators; obtain practical
skills in formulating investment statistics indicators based on a model scheme (algorithm) of
analysis and receive recommendations on further work in these areas. Moreover, a discus-
sion on further activities to introduce SNA-2008 recommendations regarding non-financial
asset indicators (capital investments) is required.
Specific recommendations were given in the course of the mission to update the current
methods adopted for formulating investment statistics. Less complex improvements include
the imputation of non-responding units and deflation; more complex changes that cannot be
implemented in the very short run are modifying the questionnaire, the method adopted for
estimating industry breakdown and the process for detection and treatment of erroneous
data.
Examples of the algorithms to implement mean and ratio imputation of unit non response and
to implement deflation using asset specific price indexes were provided in Excel files. Gen-
eral guidelines on the design of a new questionnaire were discussed. CS colleagues showed
great interest in the selective editing approach and in the procedure that ISTAT uses for the
detection of potential influential errors in investment data from firm surveys.

Also a general discussion of two of the main changes regarding gross fixed capital formation
in the SNA2008 (Research and Development and Databases) was given. CS colleagues
showed great interest in the methodology for estimating GFCF in databases and in R&D, but
because of time constraints, it was not possible to provide detailed guidance and specific
recommendations on these topics.

Recommendations and next steps

In order to increase the quality of investment indicators estimated using the survey on Capital
Expenditure, I suggest several activities that differ in terms of complexity of their implementa-
tion. Two activities that have a lower level of complexity are the following ones:
i)     Revising the deflation method using asset specific price index where available
ii)      Revising the method adopted for non-response and document it. It is suggested to
start from the simplest methods as ratio imputation or random donor imputation. As a second
best approach, even a mean imputation would be an improvement with respect to the current
imputation method based on the lowest value of respondents.
A second group of activities that have a higher level of complexity are the following ones:
iii)   Refining of the method for detection and treatment of erroneous observations, adopt-
ing a selective editing approach.
iv)     Revising the questionnaire increasing the asset details and including at least some of
the information that is very useful to national accounts (e.g., the breakdown of investment
between expenditure in new goods vs. major maintenance; purchase of goods provided by
other firms vs. investment produced for own final use and purchase of new goods vs. pur-
chase of second hand assets). For the preparation of the new questionnaire, I suggest that
CS colleagues should be informed in detail on the business accounting rules and practices in
Kazakhstan (e.g. what is the asset detail that is required in Financial Statements? What is
the accounting treatment of financial leasing? Is there any difference in accounting rules re-
lated to the legal status or the size of the firm? Etc.).
v)      Revising the method for the industry breakdown, asking the firm only for the industry
breakdown for social investment, while productive investment should be attributed to the in-
dustry in which the local unit that made the investment is classified (the implementation of
this recommendation requires that the questionnaire is modified accordingly).
Finally, as a strategic goal in the long run, I suggest that CS should check if investment data
or variables that are highly correlated with investment are potentially available from adminis-
trative data sources. The availability of such variables could then allow CS to introduce fur-
ther refinements in the methods used for detection and treatment of erroneous and missing
data using administrative variables as auxiliary variables, with the goal of increasing the qual-
ity of the data, reducing the statistical burden on respondents and reducing the costs of pro-
ducing investment statistics.

CS experts participated in Study Visits in May 2015 on the topic “Estimation of the physical
volume index of construction” in the Russian statistical office Rosstat (F6-SV-5) and in Sep-
tember 2015 on the topic “Construction Statistics indicators” in Germany (F6-SV-4). Reports
are not yet available.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the results of the consultation mission (F6-KAZ-4) on the theme “Analysis of the
current conditions in the Republic of Kazakhstan; providing recommendations regarding indi-
cators of non-financial assets; producing data by sector; improving statistical toolkit and de-
signing indicators in accordance with model scheme (algorithm)”, pilot calculations are car-
ried out using the mean value to adjust for non-responses from enterprises.

Notes on further planning

Under this subcomponent, a study visit (F6-SV-3) “Practical introduction of the 2008 SNA
recommendations regarding non-financial asset indicators and data production in economy
sectors” (Czech Republic) is scheduled for October 2015.
A consultation mission (F6-KAZ-6) “Analysis of the current conditions in the Republic of Ka-
zakhstan; preliminary recommendations regarding indicators of non-financial assets; produc-
ing data by sector; improving statistical toolkit and designing indicators in accordance with
model scheme” is scheduled for March 2016.
Based on the results of the activities, it is planned to prepare Methodological Guidelines for
Formulating Indicators of Investment Activities.

Findings and results
A Consulting Mission was carried out in September/October 2015 on the topic “Energy sta-
tistics: renewables” by experts from France (F7-KAZ-10).
Energy statistics is a new responsibility for the CS experts. Besides, Kazakhstan will organ-
ize the next World Exposition in 2017, and has decided its theme would be “Future’s energy”.
The Kazakh statisticians thus expect to be asked more and more questions on energy statis-
tics in the next months, especially on renewables, which was the central issue dealt with dur-
ing the mission. Kazakhstan also intends to increase energy efficiency in 2016, and to be-
come a leader in the region for that matter. As the CS team is new on the topic of energy,
they were also very much interested in getting information about the French energy statistics
system in general, total production and total primary energy supply, and final consumption.
The five days of the mission were thus aimed at giving a comprehensive overview of the
French energy statistics system, with a focus on renewables but also households surveys. All
the questionnaires designed and used for energy statistics were transmitted to the Kazakh
experts during the mission.
The adopted Strategy Kazakhstan 2050 and other strategic program documents set ambi-
tious targets concerning the power sector. One goal is to reach a 50 percent share of renew-
able and alternative energy by 2050. Renewables are thus going to be developed at a very
large scale. Statisticians must be able to measure their development.

Conclusions
Following the re-organisation of the energy statistics in Kazakhstan, the streamlining of ener-
gy statistics and energy balances is clearly under way. International methodology and rec-
ommendations developed by Statistics department of UN, the IEA and Eurostat are used as
guidelines for future surveys, which is a very positive step to achieve a comprehensive and
consistent system of energy statistics. The IEA has for instance appraised the growing quali-
ty of the KZ energy balance.
Regular contacts with the energy industry as well as with academics would help designing
sound and user-friendly surveys, as well as ensure a thorough capacity-building.

KAZSTAT Twinning Arrangement




Recommendations and next steps
The mission’s main recommendations are as follows:
   SURVEY DESIGN
   -   In order to ensure that the survey questionnaires are well understood and can be
       filled correctly by respondents, the mission recommends that each new (or former)
       questionnaire must be tested with a few companies (a figure of ten to twenty seems
       fair). This also provides a measure of the time which is necessary to gather infor-
       mation and fill the questionnaire, allowing a control of the respondent burden.
   -   Limiting the respondent burden is a key issue for statistical offices. As of today the
       surveys in Kazakhstan survey all companies. The mission recommends that a sample
       frame be established, which would for example survey all big companies, but only a
       sample of the smaller ones. A follow-up mission in France, with the Ministry of Energy
       and Insee, could focus on sample design for business surveys.
   -   Once samples are designed, the Kazakh Statistics Committee could also enforce
       “negative coordination” of samples, thus ensuring that once a small or medium size
       company has been surveyed during the calendar year, it cannot be sampled for an-
       other survey the same year.
   -   Having examined the questionnaires that have been designed by our Kazakh col-
       leagues, the experts recommend that the CS take better advantage of their internet
       data collection system, by adding filter questions that parameter and adapt each set
       of questions to the activity of the companies surveyed, and by programming data
       consistency checks that prevent respondents from editing wrong answers. A follow-
       up visit to France could allow the Ministry of Energy experts to show concretely such
       filters and data checks.
   IMPROVEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES
   -   In order to obtain good quality energy statistics, training is essential. Statisticians
       should be trained in order to keep informed about state of the art methodology. They
       also should receive proper training about their topics, in order to be able to design
       relevant and user-friendly surveys and discuss with companies, especially when con-
       tacted to understand how to fill in the questionnaires. The mission thus recommends
       that Kazakh statisticians have access to a specific training about the energy sector,
       more specifically the oil and petroleum products industries, the natural gas industries,
       and the renewables industries.
   -   Organizing regular visits to energy plants is also a very fruitful way of increasing
       competency, according to the French experience.
   -   The Kazakh CS intends to design and launch a households’ survey on energy con-
       sumption and renewables production by households. The French mission experts
       have provided examples of questionnaires in use, but could only provide general in-


PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                               Page 115
KAZSTAT Twinning Arrangement



        formation on sampling. They thus recommend that a follow-up study visit of Kazakh
        experts to France dedicates one day on sampling frames and design for households
        surveys, with Insee and Ministry of Energy experts.
    KEY ISSUES THAT COULD NOT BE DEALT WITH
    -   There was no time left to deal with energy efficiency indicators during the mission.
        Besides, the two French experts were not really knowledgeable about this issue.
        They thus recommend that during the next mission, a day at least should be dedicat-
        ed to energy efficiency indicators with ADEME, which is the French administrative
        body responsible for the European project ODYSSEE-MURE.
    -   The Kazakh CS intends to work on the System of Economic and Environment Ac-
        counts, and more specifically on Physical Energy Flow Accounts in that framework.
        As there was no time left to deal with this topic during the mission the experts rec-
        ommend that during the next mission to France a day should be dedicated to a dis-
        cussion with the Ministry experts responsible for SEEA and PEFA.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

In 2014 according to recommendations of international experts it has been developed meth-
odological recommendations on Fuel and Energy balance which includes international
standards on energy statistics, list of indicators, which is characterize development of fuel
and energy market of the country which is comparable on international level. In 2015 there
CS continued work on improvement of toolkit survey on energy statistics, which will help to fill
international questionnaires and will reduce the burden on business. All duplicated forms and
indicators will be canceled. This work will be finished in 2016.
Currently interdepartmental working group on energy statistics has been formed.
In 2016 methodological recommendations of IEA on energy efficiency indicators will be im-
plemented to the national practice. CS needs expert consultation for implementing energy
efficiency indicators. During the consultation of Mr. Roland Mertens there was discussion on
program project ODYSSE-MURE, developed by French Ecology Agency. One of the devel-
opers of the "Energy Efficiency Indicators: Fundamentals of Statistics", published by the IEA
is this agency, Mr. Dider Bosseboeuf and Mr. Bruno Lapiollone. Since the Committee is
planning to write guidelines for energy efficiency, there would be desirable to provide rec-
ommendations on energy efficiency calculations.

Notes on further planning

A continuation of the energy subcomponent should be taken into consideration in order to
ensure the project objective in the subcomponent.
In the framework of World Bank there has been considered additional activities on energy
statistics: in 2015 CS will facilitate training for territorial statistical offices with participation of
Mr. Mertens.

Findings and results

A Study Visit (F8-SV-5) of CS experts on the topic “Methodological and Organizational As-
pects to carry out the Agricultural Census” has been undertaken in May 2015 to the Federal
State Statistics Service of Russia, Rosstat.
The aim of the activity was to acquire knowledge and recommendations for preparing and
conducting census of agriculture, forming all the census' documentation, primarily question-
naires and guidelines, as well as applying different methods of collecting and processing
information. The objective of the study visit was to acquire methodological, theoretical and
practical knowledge of carrying out preliminary and basic activities for arrangement of agri-
cultural census.
In accordance with the Terms of Reference the program's main part was aimed at activities
for studying experience in conducting agricultural census in Russia through the example of
2006 All-Russia Census of Agriculture and pilot census-2012. The materials related to 2016
All-Russia Census of Agriculture (hereinafter - ARCA) were studied. Different aspects of ag-
ricultural census were reviewed from its preparation to publication. The presentations were
followed by discussions of the questions arose.
The issue of public awareness campaign was widely presented. The system of special pro-
jects that took an enormous importance in popularization and necessity of ARCA conduction
shall be particularly noted. The ROSTAT also presented the issue of training employees col-
lecting information on the census objects through the example of ARCA-2006 and ARCA-
2016. The training videos were demonstrated.
The ROSTAT staff particularly noted the role of a pilot census. For example, after a pilot
census in 2004 it was revealed that the census of agriculture cannot be conducted without
adoption of the Federal Law "On All-Russia Census of Agriculture". Based on the findings of
a pilot census in 2012 it was decided to use tablet computers (in separate districts or cases -
machine-readable document forms).

Recommendations Based on Study Visit Outcomes:

•      Russian colleagues have repeatedly emphasized the complexity of the process to
       hold the agricultural census in 2 stages. Their recommendations: organize this work
       in one step, if possible;
•      The Division of Production and Environment Statistics and Division of Registers shall
       use materials provided by Russian colleagues and take their recommendations into
       consideration when arranging and holding the agricultural census;
•      The Division of Production and Environment Statistics together with the Division of
       Registers shall prepare the procedure to formulate lists of entities that are subjects to
       the agricultural census and approve it in the established order;
•      The Division of Classifications and Information Technologies together with the Divi-
       sion of Production and Environment Statistics and the Division of Registers shall de-
       sign a corresponding module in IIS „e-statistics“, where it will be possible to generate
       preliminary census lists. In turn, this module will be integrated with internal modules
       (IS Agricultural Register, IS Statistical Business Register, IS Statistical Housing Stock
       Register), and with external information systems, if necessary;
•      The Division of Classifications and Information Technologies together with the Divi-
       sion of Production and Environment Statistics shall design software package for pro-
       cessing data and obtaining agricultural census outcomes;
•      It is required to carry out additional activities on data processing and statistical infor-
       mation quality assurance.


A further Study Visit (F8-SV-3) of CS experts on the topic “Development of Agriculture St a-
tistics (Methodology and Practice of Conducting Sample Surveys in Crop and Livestock Pro-
duction)” has been undertaken in June 2015 to the Polish statistical office in Warsaw.
The aim of the activity was to improve the quality of indicators generated for agriculture sec-
tor statistics by modernization of the methodology based on international recommendations.
The objective of the study visit was to acquire theoretical and practical knowledge of the
methodology for conducting sample surveys in the agricultural sector based on the standards
accepted in the international practice.
Under the study visit theme, the staff of the Statistical Office of Poland held the training on
the following issues:
-   Basic information on the agricultural sector and directions of the development of agricul-
    tural statistics in Poland as well as general information on agricultural statistical surveys.

-   Methodological and organizational aspects of conducting household surveys in June
    2013 (preliminary work, including the CATI method, use of administrative data, use of
    agricultural census data in the inter-census period).
-   Key methodological aspects (forming sample population, extrapolation to general popu-
    lation, appearance of non-typical units (non-responses)).
-   Statistical survey related to crop (methodologies, survey organization, sample surveys,
    assessments, system of reporting, data collection and design).
-   Statistical survey related to livestock (methodologies, survey organization, sample sur-
    veys, assessments, system of reporting, data collection and design).
-   Cooperation with external institutions, data dissemination.
-   Eurostat requirements related to generating statistical surveys data.
-   Preliminary activities for structural SURVEY 2016 and agricultural census 2020 - use of
    administrative sources’ data.
-   Use of modern technology in agricultural surveys and LUCAS survey.
During the study visit, the data collection methods were discussed including processing and
generating of the sample data on agricultural statistics as well as statistical toolkit for statisti-
cal surveys in crop and livestock production.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the results of these study visits, the following activities have been have been im-
plemented:
- Working Groups for Organizational and Technological Support and Outreach Activities for
  Agricultural Census in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2015-2019 have been established;
  No.116 dated August 5, 2015;
- Draft documents have been prepared for the “Methodological Guidelines for Determining
  the Rate of Load on Persons Engaged in Collecting Data on the Units of Agricultural Cen-
  sus” and “Methodological Guidelines for Preparing a List of Units of the 2017 Agricultural
  Census”;
- Meeting of the Working Groups for Organizational and Technological Support took place
  on September 23, 2015 to discuss the procedure of preparing a list of units of agricultural
  census and approve it in the established manner;
Based on the results of the study visit and previous expert mission “Improving the Methodo l-
ogy of Sample Surveys in Crop and Livestock Production”, the division e ngaged in sampling
has analyzed the proposals provided by the Danish expert for improving the sample design
for agricultural surveys. The results of the analysis will be taken into account when preparing
a package of new methodological documents. A draft of new methodological guidelines for
conducting sample agricultural surveys is being prepared.

Output of Agricultural Products (Services) has been prepared and is currently being reviewed
and agreed.
Based on the results of the previous study visits and consultation missions by international
experts on the theme “Implementing Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing in Agricu l-
tural Sector”, a plan of actions for CATI implementation, including pilot survey, has been pr e-
pared and approved. Two existing Statistical Forms 2-сх and А-008 have been adjusted to
use them in the pilot project on CATI implementation. In particular, draft descriptions of elec-
tronic questionnaires have been prepared based on these forms and in accordance with the
recommendations provided by the Poland experts. The draft questionnaires, including the list
of validations and a scheme of questions, were sent to the system developer. A Draft Meth-
odological Guidelines for Conducting Telephone Interviews in Agricultural Sector have been
prepared and is currently being reviewed and agreed.

Notes on further planning

Based on recommendations provided in 2015, preparatory activities for pilot and main cen-
sus will be carried out. Eventually, statistical toolkit, regulatory and legal acts will be designed
and approved, the guidelines and guidance materials for the staff engaged in census will be
prepared, software for entering and processing data using tablet PCs, as well as for pro-
cessing materials and obtaining census results will be designed in 2015-2016.
For the theme “Improving the Methodology of Sample Surveys in Crop and Livestock Pr o-
duction”, two more expert missions are planned for 2016. Based on the result of theme mi s-
sions, the Methodological Guidelines for Conducting Sample Surveys in Crop and Livestock
Production will be prepared and introduced since 2017.
For the theme “Improving the Methodology of Estimating Gross Output of Agricultural Pro d-
ucts (Services)”, it is planned to approve the methodology in Quarter IV, 2015 and start using
the approved methodology in the estimations in 2016.
Final consultation mission “Implementing Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing in Agri-
cultural Sector” with participation of Poland experts to discuss the results of the pilot project
and further work on the CATI implementation was postponed to April 2016. Eventually,
“Methodological Guidelines for Conducting Telephone Interviews in Agricultural Sector ” will
be prepared and approved. The preliminary period to implement the methodology is after the
second half of 2016.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F9-KAZ-1) on the topic “Services to design methodological guide-
lines for formulating primary indicators of environment statistics to build a System of Envi-
ronmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)” has been carried out in May 2015 by an expert
from Statistics Finland.
Focus of the mission was on developing methodology and compiling environmental account-
ing to Kazakhstan by applying the UN SEEA framework on environmental accounting and
European Union application on the SEEA.
Questionnaire form of the CS on environmental expenditures and payments is improved and
extended to cover all activities included into international classification of environmental pro-
tection activities. The experts of the CS have compiled accounts on environmental taxes for
years 2011-2013 according to the detailed division of taxes by tax type included into the UN
SEEA framework and EU regulation on environmental accounting. The next step is to allo-
cate these taxes to economic activities that actually pay the taxes, starting from examining
data of monetary supply and use tables. The CS has also started to develop accounting
methodology on environmental goods and services sector.
Recommendations and next steps
It is recommended, that the focus of developing methodology and implementing environmen-
tal accounting in Kazakhstan in the next 1 – 3 years should be on physical flow accounts for
emissions to air, solid waste and water, and monetary flow accounts on environmental ex-
penditures and payments, environmental taxes, and environmental goods and services. De-
veloping and implementing these accounts by economic activities are also among priority
aims for environmental accounting in European Union and in United Nations.
The next step on environmental taxes is to allocate these taxes to economic activities who
actually pay the taxes. This can be done mainly based on other data and statistics already
existing in the Committee of Statistics and Tax Committee. The work could be started by ex-
amining data of monetary supply and use tables, which can be used in estimating the data
on environmental taxes by economic activity. It is also important to identify connections be-

tween tax revenues according to Government budget and taxes according to National ac-
counts.
The focus on accounts for environmental goods and services should for the start be on those
economic activities, who’s main purpose is to produce environmental goods and services,
and activities such as agriculture, where data availability on production of environmental
goods and services is good. European Union countries experiences and lists of shares of
environmental goods and services in other economic activities could be used to estimate the
shares in economic activities in Kazakhstan.
In the next 4-5 years other focus areas of environmental accounting could be economy-wide
material flow accounts that combine data on all physical flows at aggregated level. Accounts
for the most important natural resource stocks (mineral, energy, water) would expand imple-
mentation of the SEEA in Kazakhstan to cover all main environmental natural resource
stocks and flows.
Data from environmental accounts could be combined and to some extent presented in the
form of hybrid tabled linking physical and monetary information. The starting point would be
at highly aggregated level, e.g. at 1-digit level of the NACE Rev.2 classification of economic
activities. However, activities inside C manufacturing, E water supply and waste manage-
ment, and H transportation and storage may be very different with respect to environmental
and economic importance to national economy of Kazakhstan. Therefore it is recommended,
that disaggregation of these activities at applicable level would be considered. For each
module of environmental accounting compiled by economic activity (emissions to air, solid
waste, water, taxes, expenditures, goods and services) the same kind of disaggregation may
not be very relevant, and the relevance for Kazakhstan should be evaluated by economic
activity and by modules of environmental accounting.
Translation for the most important parts of Eurostat manual on environmental goods and
services sector is recommended.
A further Consulting mission (F9-KAZ-4) on the topic “Environmental indicators, identifica-
tion of respondents and survey methods” has been conducted in September 2015 by an ex-
pert from Statistics Finland.
The purpose of the mission was to discuss the classifications, methods and data collections
for environmental statistics and accounts in Kazakhstan. During the mission, the compilation
of accounts on environmental taxes was discussed. The consultant presented releases of the
accounts in Finland. Recommendations on the compilation of accounts on environmental
taxes were developed. The compilation of environmental goods and service sector (EGSS)
statistics and the application of CEPA and CReMA-classifications in them were also dis-
cussed and recommendations for the development of surveys and possible changes in ques-
tionnaire forms were formulated.
The experts of CS and the consultant also planned the contents of the Methodological rec-
ommendations for the compilation of primary data required for building an environmental
account of the System of National Accounts. It is recommended that the document will ex-




PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                              Page 122

plain the strategy of CS on environmental accounting. In the document only three types of
accounts will be presented as examples.
 In Kazakhstan, the focus will in the near future be on eight types of flow accounts: air emis-
sions, water, waste, environmental expenditure, energy, environmental goods and service
sector (EGSS) and environmental taxes. This strategy are well in line with international priori-
ties and would include the modules currently existing in EU regulation on environmental eco-
nomic accounts except material flow accounts for which data do not exist in Kazakhstan at
the moment.

Recommendations and next steps

Accounts on environmental taxes
It is recommended that accounts on environmental taxes will be based mainly on two data
sources: the national budget and enterprise statistics of CS. The total sums of tax revenues
could be taken from National budget. The allocation of taxes paid by different activities can
be done on the basis on data from enterprise statistics. Taxes can be divided to pollution,
energy, traffic and resource taxes by the definitions of OECD and Eurostat.
In Kazakhstan the only energy tax seems to be the CO2-tax. This is understandable, because
Kazakhstan is such an energy rich country. Pollution taxes are paid related to air emissions,
wastewater emissions and solid waste. Taxes on paid both as directly linked to emissions
and as a penalty for exceeding existing environmental norms. Also traffic taxes and resource
taxes exist in Kazakhstan.
Environmental goods and service sector (EGSS) statistics
It is recommended that supply and use tables of national accounts are the starting point of
the statistics. By these accounts the output, intermediate consumption, value added, import
and expert of EGSS can be calculated. The CPA-classes in supply and use tables will be
divided to classes with 100 % of EGSS, 0 % of EGSS and 0 – 100% of EGSS. The share of
EGSS will be defined on the data of these enterprises and international experiences, which
exist e.g. from Finland, Germany and Canada.
It is recommended that for the form 1 (R&D) an extra column will be added on research on
renewable energy in section 7.
It is recommended that in the form 2 (services) will be inserted a 3rd column “volume of pro-
duced environmental and natural management services in section 2. The instructions to fill
this column will include definition taken from SEEA handbook and maybe examples of the
classes.
It is recommended that the data for production state administration for environmental protec-
tion will be taken from the report on the performance of national budget.
It is recommended that forestry in Kazakhstan can be considered 100 % environmental
goods and services, because commercial cuttings do not exist all activities are done for natu-
ral resource management purposes.

It is recommended that for organic farming will be classified products of those farms that do
not use chemical fertilizers nor herbicides. Data of this can be found from questionnaire
forms for agricultural production.
The breakdown of activity data to CEPA/CReMA-classes can be done on the basis of data of
the production of those enterprises.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Methodological guidelines for Formulating Primary Indicators to Build a System of Environ-
mental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) with the SNA and a draft CREMA classification have
been developed.
Based on the Green Growth Indicators (OECD Guidelines), preliminary list of green economy
indicators for the Republic of Kazakhstan has been prepared.
Based on the recommendations provided during the previous missions on SEEA, the CS
specialists determined the environmental taxes for Kazakhstan. Environmental accounts for
the 2011-2013 taxes were compiled in cooperation with the National Accounts experts using
the detailed breakdown of the taxes included in the UN SEEA and the EU Regulation on En-
vironmental Accounting.
Forms for nationwide survey on environmental statistics have been reviewed for 2016.

Notes on further planning

For the topic “Designing a classification of environmental protection indicators by activity and
cost using the CEPA classification”, one study visit (F9-SV-2) is planned in Q I, 2016 and one
expert mission (F9-KAZ-5) is planned in Q IV, 2016. Partner countries have not been identi-
fied yet. Our proposal is to consider the possibility of cooperating with the Czech experts.

Findings and results

A Training mission (F10-KAZ-2) on the topic “Trade statistics surveys / best international
practice” has been conducted in September 2015 by an expert from Statistics Denmark.
This mission was the third (and last) mission in the field of trade statistics in the project. The
first two missions, as well as a study visit to Statistics Denmark, have covered all the main
steps in the statistical production process for trade statistics – sampling and estimation, data
collection, survey forms, data validation and editing, index calculation, use of administrative
data and quality management. This mission summed up the recommendations in all these
fields, based on international guidelines as well as best practices from Statistics Denmark
and other EU countries. The mission was arranged as a training seminar with participation of
trade statistics staff from regional statistical offices as well as from the central office. Partici-
pants also included staff from the business register and from price statistics.

Conclusions

The achievements of the project are many and include

    -   Simplified forms for monthly and annual survey
    -   Design for new sample survey for individual entrepreneurs
    -   Progress on agreement with tax authority on access to VAT data
    -   Specifications for new data editing program to check for significant errors (outliers)
    -   Work on seasonally adjusted series using Demetra
    -   Methodological guidelines.

Recommendations and next steps

This was the last mission, but the work on improving trade statistics does not end here. In
November, some of the staff of the central office will participate in an expert mission on the
Business Register. Also in November, regional staff will again come to Astana to learn more
on the new set of methodological guidelines. This workshop will also cover the topic of sea-
sonal adjustment.


PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                                    Page 125

The new methodological guidelines are based on international recommendations and on
inspiration from the Danish short-term statistics on trade. The implementation of the guide-
lines is planned to be from 2016. This will require a lot of work, in central as well as regional
offices. Among other things, it will affect data collection when a sample-approach is taken
(rather than a census).
It is recommended that the methodological guidelines allow some room for flexible adapta-
tion in the regions, as their business structures vary a lot. Also it is recommended to evaluate
and, if necessary adjust, the guidelines after the first 1-2 years of practical implementation.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

The result of the implementation of activities under this mission is the increased level of pro-
fessional knowledge of the Committee’s staff and territorial statistics divisions’ specialists.
In addition, taking into account that the mission was the final one, the draft “Guidelines for
Formulating Domestic Trade Statistics Indicators with Consideration of International Recom-
mendations” (the Guidelines) was presented to the attention of the audience and expert.
They were designed based on the experience of the Statistics Denmark in domestic trade
statistics according to the results of previous missions, as well as in accordance with “Inter-
national Recommendations on Retail and Wholesale Trade Statistics” prepared by the United
Nations Statistical Commission.
During the presentation, issues were discussed with regard to draft methodological guide-
lines, in particular, adaptation of approaches used in Danish practice in the area of carrying
out sample surveys, validation and editing/aligning of data with the national practice of data
formulation. During the discussion, the expert also provided recommendations to formulate
indicators of domestic trade statistics, which will be introduced into guidelines.

Notes on further planning

The training was the last activity under Component F10 “Trade and Commodity Markets Sta-
tistics”.

Findings and results

A Study Visit (F11-SV-2) of CS experts on the topic “Development of Service statistics” has
been undertaken in July 2015 to German statistical offices in Bonn, Wiesbaden and Hanno-
ver.
According to the Terms of Reference, the staff of the Committee for Statistics got familiarized
with:
- Current international practice of carrying out sample surveys of services statistics in Ger-
  many;
- Software used in a statistical process and their functionalities;
- Development of the process of working with the Index of Service Production (ISP), inter-
  national and European recommendations for ISP estimation;
- German online questionnaires;
- Description of the process of carrying out surveys in Germany and time planning related.
Based on study visit results, it is recommended:
   1. To introduce German experience into the process of preparing a sampling population
      using the sample rotation principle.
   2. To introduce German experience in the area of data adjustment based on EU and
      Destatis recommendations into national practice.
   3. In cooperation with the Division of Price Statistics to consider generating price indices
      required for the Division of Price Statistics to estimate the physical volume index by
      types of activities of commercial services in line with international practice studied by
      specialists of the specified divisions in Destatis and based on Destatis experts’ con-
      sultations.

       ta and improve its quality.
    5. Prepare methodological guidelines to improve services statistics with consideration of
       German experts’ recommendations obtained during consultations and the study visit.



A Consulting mission (F11-KAZ-9) on the topic “Introduction of Communication Statistics
Indicators” has been conducted in September 2015 by a Spanish expert.
Main purpose of this mission was to review the international experience concerning the for-
mulation of communication indicators, including methodology and terminology, as well as
revise indicators in the forms of the CS in accordance with international standards.
Communications is a very important sector for the country, growing rapidly, especially in ref-
erence to mobile telephony and Internet. Therefore, statistics of the sector of communica-
tions are very relevant. They provide the necessary information for adequate policy making,
investment, market research and monitoring, progress assessment and regulation. In particu-
lar, administrative data on communications provide an overall picture of the market and its
development. In this regard, the Committee of Statistics (CS) is in charge of collecting admin-
istrative data of the communication and postal services. They do it through four question-
naires. These forms contain the indicators required by the communication authorities and
users, however, there are issues concerning statistical definitions, which impacts the quality
of statistical surveys and formulation of communication statistics indicators.
During this mission, the international standards on communications and postal indicators
were discussed and the forms to collect information were revised and reviewed in order to
introduce new indicators and remove indicators and categories that are not necessary.

Conclusions

   While there is room for improvement, the general status of administrative data on com-
    munications and postal services collected by the CS is very good; forms are very com-
    plete and CS is in a position to report almost all the required information demanded at the
    international and national level, including key information required to calculate Global In-
    dexes, in a timely manner and with adequate quality.
   Questionnaire forms need to be updated i) with new indicators and ii) by removing indica-
    tors and categories that are not any more relevant at the national and international levels.
   There seems to be a good coordination between CS and the Committee on Communica-
    tions (CoC) in the sense that the latter is always accessible when staff from CS require
    information about indicators and methodologies or any matter related to the communica-
    tions forms. On the other hand, CS provides all the information required by the CoC in a
    timely manner. Nevertheless, there seems to be a need for more coordination in order to
    revise methodologies, update forms and provide regular capacity building so that CS staff
    is always up-to-date with terminology and technical definitions.

   There is a good communication with data providers (operators and businesses from the
    communications and postal sectors) who usually provide the required information in the
    timeframe provided. This is however also the result of the legal basis accompanying this
    exercise. It is advisable to conduct regular encounters (for instance, once a year or bien-
    nially, depending on how frequently changes are incorporated in the forms or the meth-
    odologies) with providers of information in order to discuss methodological issues or un-
    clear matters when providing the data.

Recommendations and next steps

•   Discuss the proposals for updating the questionnaire forms, including assessing rele-
    vance of indicators and revision of definitions, with main users of information.
•   Revise document containing methodology and definitions of indicators provided to oper-
    ators for completing the forms. Definitions should be reviewed, clarifications and meth-
    odological recommendations should be added when missing.
•   In order to make information on revenues comparable at the international level, CS
    should be able to report revenue excluding interconnection rates. For this, a proposal to
    collect this information separately in the form has been included.
•   Revise and update, when necessary, the name of some identified indicators in the Sta-
    tistical Classification of Services.
•   Trainings or working sessions involving providers, producers and users of information
    should be held once a year or biennially in order to define and explain new indicators
    and shortcomings when providing data for already established indicators.
•   Technical experts from the Committee on Communications who could also provide ca-
    pacity building trainings to staff from CS on the technologies and the way in which infor-
    mation should be collected in the context of Kazakhstan.
•   Cooperation and coordination with the Committee of Communications should be in-
    creased. Definitions of indicators and possible methodological issues in the collected in-
    formation should be discussed and agreed. CS should be properly informed about the
    relevance, meaning for policy purposes and need of collecting the information. The co-
    ordination should be well established, as to be able to reply to international demands on
    methodological issues and concerns about the data.
•   In case of inconsistencies with the information, the Committee of Communications
    should identify them and discuss with CS how to correct them.
•   Work with the Regional Commonwealth in the field of Communications (RCC) in order to
    revise and update RCC’s questionnaire on communications, as well as to update defin i-
    tions and methodology.
•   Find out what institution collects information on annual foreign investment and whether it
    can be provided for the sector of telecommunications.

•   Establish who are the main users of postal and currier services’ indicators and revise
    together the relevance of the indicators collected.
•   Encourage operators to collect information on data traffic, which is necessary for the
    monitoring and management of their network. This information should be collected at the
    access point of the network that is as close as possible to the end user.
•   Continue encouraging operators to provide additional explanations (in the form of notes
    to the data) when there are high increases or decreases in the data from one year (or
    month) to another, which are not self-explanatory.
•   Encourage operators to use the software prepared to fill in the information asked in the
    questionnaire forms, since this should optimize and make more efficient the work of CS.
    And also in view of the paperless government policy aimed for 2017.
•   The form on technical infrastructure and quality issues could be directly collected by the
    CoC, since it is very specific information for monitoring the quality of the network and
    services provided.
•   Register and participate in the ITU Expert Group on Telecom/ICT Indicators (EGTI)
    http://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/ExpertGroup/default.asp. It is recommended that not only
    CS participates actively, but also CoC and RCC.
•   Participate in the meetings of the EGTI (held usually in September or back-to-back with
    World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Symposium (WTIS)).
•   Check the conclusions of the EGTI meeting in Geneva. There may be additional chang-
    es to the indicators currently discussed.
•   Participate in the next World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Symposium (WTIS) to
    be held in Hiroshima, Japan, 30 November to 2 December, 2015.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Based on the knowledge acquired, methodological guidelines to formulate services statistics
indicators will be designed in 4th quarter of 2015 in line with international standards.

Notes on further planning

The survey toolkit for services statistics was revised in 2015. To lower the respondent bur-
den, the volume of services delivered will be formed in software by type of activities per-
formed by an enterprise.
Training on services statistics will be held October 19-23, 2015 for specialists of territorial
statistical authorities; methodological guidelines will be prepared.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F12-KAZ-1) on the topic “Improvement of ICT statistics indicators /
best international practice” has been carried out in May 2015 by an expert from the Statistical
Consulting Service Devstat.
The aim of the mission was: to improve the system of indicators that characterize the devel-
opment of the ICT sector in line with the international standards (Eurostat, UNCTAD, ITU)
and national requirements. The objective of the activity is to provide methodological and
practical assistance in updating the current methodological guidelines for formulating ICT
indicators based on the internationally recognized ICT statistical indicators recording system;
improve the quality of ICT statistical surveys in households; and review the statistical toolkit.
The activities carried out included:
•      becoming familiar with the current system of formulating statistics indicators of ICT
       use in households in Kazakhstan (home-based preparation and discussions during
       the mission);
•      presenting the international experience in defining and formulating statistics indicators
       of ICT use in households using the example of the consultant country (package of
       materials, including questionnaire forms and guidelines for completion of the forms);
       share guidance materials, methodologies for defining and formulating statistics indica-
       tors of ICT use in households used in the consultant country ;
•      providing practical recommendations for improving the statistical toolkit on a national
       level in line with the international standards.
The main results of the mission are:
•      Better knowledge of CS of international standards in the measurement of access and
       use of ICT by households and by secondary education institutions
•      Reformulated questionnaire on ICT access and use by households and individuals

       tors in the use of ICT in secondary education.


A Consulting mission (F12-KAZ-2) on the topic “Methods of conducting surveys in ICT sta-
tistics” has been carried out in June 2015 by two experts from the German Federal Statistical
Office Destatis.
The aim of the mission was to analyse the Kazakh survey on ICT usage in enterprises as
well as the existing system of ICT indicators in order to identify measures for improvement to
better monitor new developments of ICT in Kazakhstan and to meet international standards.
The activity aimed at discussing and redeveloping the Kazakh questionnaire and at examin-
ing further relevant topics such as sampling design, plausibility checks, extrapolation, data
quality (standard errors) and publication. However, redesigning the questionnaire currently
used by CS took much more time than originally expected and was therefore the main com-
ponent of the visit. Since a comprehensible and feasible questionnaire is the elementary
base for conducting a survey in a good quality, a detailed adaption of the indicators and re-
lated questions was necessary.
During the action the German experts already identified several further aspects with need to
improvement to enhance the Kazakh system of ICT statistics and the quality of the data. For
example the introduction of a shortened questionnaire for very small enterprises like in Ger-
many would be reasonable as well as a general limitation of the number of questions. Since
the user needs on ICT indicators are increasing constantly it should be taken into account to
introduce fix and annually changing flexible modules in the questionnaire and thus not to
overload the survey. This approach is successfully implemented in the European ICT sur-
veys since 2005. Furthermore it seems that there is currently too little time for developing a
feasible questionnaire, to carry out proper plausibility checks and to evaluate data quality in
the CS ICT section. These aspects should be discussed during one of the next expert mis-
sions.

Conclusions

The revision of the Kazakh model questionnaire on ICT usage in enterprises was very suc-
cessful. The questions have been adapted to international standards. Different modules have
been presented that could be used within a flexible system of the questionnaire. Besides,
instructions were presented that could also be included in the new questionnaire in order to
improve the understanding of the questions.

Recommendations and next steps

The discussions with our Kazakh colleagues revealed that the revision of the questionnaire
was urgently needed. However, further steps have to be taken to improve the conduction of
the survey. During the next study visit in Bonn, the time line for the survey should be ana-
lysed. Besides, survey sample, plausibility checks, extrapolation, data quality (standard er-
rors) and publication are important issues also to be covered within the next study visit.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Consultation mission (F12-KAZ-1) “Improvement of ICT Statistics Indicators/Best In-
ternational Practice”.
The result of the activities implementation under this mission is the increased level of profes-
sional knowledge of Committee’s staff in ICT statistics.
With the participation of the independent expert, Jose Cervera, the form H-020 “Question-
naire for Surveying Households on the Use of Information and Communication Technologies”
has been modernized. Recommendations to consider the Register of Housing Units (Hous-
ing Stock Register) as the sample toolkit have been obtained. All his recommendations have
been taken into account. Results on the statistical form will be obtained March 6, 2016 after
the reporting period. Currently, the form is being under approval.
The statistical form 1-inform “Report on the Use of Information and Communication Technol-
ogies in Secondary Education” has been reviewed as well. Indicators of this form have been
compared to UNESCO international standards. Recommendations to analyze in cooperation
with the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan an opportunity to
collect current administrative data from secondary schools to produce ICT key indicators in
education have been obtained. If all indicators may be found in administrative registers, the
Committee will reduce the number of statistical activities. If the statistical load is reduced, this
experience shall be demonstrated as a successful practice of modernization and reduction of
the need to gather answers and lower expenses on data collection. This recommendation
has been analyzed and the form has been successfully cancelled.

Notes on further planning

It is planned to carry out a study visit in the near future to Spanish Statistical Office to famil-
iarize the staff of the Committee for Statistics with Spanish experience, which includes the
responsibility of the National Statistics Institute for data collection and production of statistics,
and the National Observatory of Telecommunication and Information Society as the main
user. Visits to the territorial office to better understand the management process and poten-
tial issues in fieldwork (taking into account the technical complexity of the concepts contained
in ICT questionnaires) might be included as well.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F13-KAZ-1) on the topic “Provision of methodological and practical
assistance in the field of Foreign Trade Statistics” has been carried out in June 2015 by two
experts from the German Federal Statistical Office Destatis.
The expert mission’s aim was to support the methodology applied and practical work related
to external trade statistics conducted by the Committee for Statistics. During the discussions
relevant Germany's experience in Intra-EU trade and Extra-EU trade as the European Union
member state was provided. The information provided was discussed in comparison with the
situation in Kazakhstan in order to provide consultations and recommendations for improving
the quality of Kazakhstani external trade statistics.
As a member state of the Eurasian Economic Union Kazakhstan has been one of the three
founding states of the Customs Union - Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan - since July 2010;
Armenia has been included as a member state of the Customs Union since January 2015.
The statistical methods of recording international trade among countries of the Customs Un-
ion are similar to the methods used in the European Union (survey of enterprises/primary
statistics). Therefore, the consultations were considerably aimed at the methodological and
technical aspects of preparation of the Intra-EU trade data. During the joint discussion with
Kazakh counterpart these aspects were compared with a special situation in Kazakhstan and
we tried to find the possibilities for qualitative improvement of the methodology for covering
bilateral Kazakhstan trade with the Customs Union member states.
Other important aspects related to international trade have also been discussed. On this is-
sue the customs legal and technical matters and relative circumstances of statistics prepara-
tion were provided in detail. In 2017 the State Revenue Committee will delegate powers of
preparing external trade statistics to the Committee for Statistics and it will be responsible for
trade statistics with the Customs Union and other countries. After such transformation the
customs import and export registered forms will become data sources. External trade statis-
tics will also include special economic zones of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The customs
registration forms will be further checked by customs bodies. The Committee for Statistics

will send such data adjustments to the participants of international trade; so detailed infor-
mation about customs formalities and methods is really necessary. Taking into account on-
coming year of 2017 and future distribution of authority the numerous recommendations
were provided to be prepared to next tasks. It is strictly recommended to contact with Kazakh
customs timely in order to obtain necessary knowledge by the Committee's staff.

Recommendations

Currently, it has not yet been exactly determined what and in what scope the tasks of statis-
tics preparation and statistical control will be delegated from the customs bodies to the
Committee for Statistics. Reconciliations and specific agreements related to this issue are
still necessary.
In Kazakhstan in external trade with the Customs Union member states it is not envisaged
exemption of enterprises from submitting statistical report as how in the EU in Intrastat sur-
veying based on the current regulations in Europe. In case of the enterprises' responses
missed the missing information will be submitted on the basis of assessment. Based on the
available data of tax bodies it is necessary to detect distribution and depth of assessments
and re-estimations. The assessment method used in Germany will show the opportunities of
taking the final results of not-received data into consideration. Reduction of statistical load on
enterprises-respondents have not yet been the subject for considerable discussions in Ka-
zakhstan. However, certain simplifications (for example, threshold for respondents' exemp-
tion by size, as well as simplification of submitting the statistical information) should be re-
viewed, but so as not affect greatly the results' quality.
In 2017 the State Revenue Committee will delegate powers of preparing external trade sta-
tistics to the Committee for Statistics and it will be responsible for trade statistics with coun-
tries out of the Customs Union. As the customs import and export registered forms will be-
come data sources in-depth knowledge of customs activity is necessary. Growth of intensive
cooperation with Kazakh customs bodies is a good presupposition for future implementation
of activities related to external trade statistics. Use of data submitted by tax bodies for the
purpose of survey and data control is necessary for statistical profile of external trade statis-
tics. Alternative data sources to provide and improve data quality have also to be used if
possible. Customs bodies provide all import and export data, therefore it is necessary to de-
velop methods to exclude the transactions not related to categories of external trade statis-
tics.
As for data quality it is recommended to create and document quality standard in Kazakhstan
similar to the European Union's quality concept. Quality of data submission could also be
improved by good user's manuals for the systems of statistical reports' submission. The
German "Guidelines for Intra Trade Statistics for the EU Member States" could serve as an
example; Kazakhstani colleagues also showed open interest to these guidelines.
One more opportunity for data re-verification can be presented based on comparison of mir-
ror data of Kazakhstan bilateral trade with Germany for 2014. Tables with results of the Fed-
eral Statistical Office of Germany had been developed and presented by counterpart during



PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                                 Page 137

the discussion. They should be added by mirror statistical data of external trade of the Re-
public of Kazakhstan with Germany. The reasons of data discrepancy will be discussed dur-
ing the study visit to Germany.



CS experts participated in a Study Visit (F13-SV-1) in August 2015 on the topic “Foreign
Trade Statistics” to the German Federal Statistical Office Destatis.
During the study visit the staff of the Committee for Statistics has reviewed the current inter-
national practice of conducting surveys and formulating indicators for external and mutual
trade statistics. Based on the visit's program, methodological materials and surveys' toolkit
for external and mutual trade statistics have been provided.
According to the study visit's results, it is recommended for the Division of Statistics of Ser-
vices and Energy to:
1. continue using administrative sources for generating mutual trade statistics in accordance
   to international standards;
2. continue formulating register of participants of foreign economic activity based on admin-
   istrative sources and business-register taking into account experience of the EU and
   Destatis together with the Division of Registers;
3. enhance a list of indicators formulated for external and mutual trade statistics based on
   integration of trade and business registers according to requirements of international
   methodologies;
4. develop "The Methodological Recommendations in the field of International External
   Trade Statistics" based on the Destatis experts' recommendations acquired during con-
   sultations and the study visit;
5. prepare the Guidelines for using mutual trade statistics by territorial statistical bodies and
   respondents while completion of form 1-ТС taking into account the EU and Destatis’ ex-
   perience.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

The result of the study visit implementation under this mission (F13-SV-1) is the increased
level of professional knowledge of Committee for Statistics’ staff in foreign and mutual trade
statistics.
During the study visit, the experience of formulating statistics of foreign and mutual trade in
EU and Germany was presented. German foreign trade statistics is produced in the statisti-
cal office in Wiesbaden. Surveys are carried out, work is performed with the respondents,
and data is produced and processed in this office.
According to foreign trade statistics (Extrastat), the data is formed based on customs decla-

According to mutual trade statistics (Intrastat), there is a statistical threshold and therefore
only respondents with the volume of foreign trade activities of over 500 thous. EUR are in-
cluded into survey.
The EU basic requirements to carry out surveys are the regulations: No. 471/2009; No.
92/2010; No. 113/2010.
In accordance with the EU Regulation No. 471/2009, countries are required to keep a regis-
ter of foreign trader operators according to Intrastat.
In a pilot mode, EU countries start working on the exchange of microdata on Intrastat with
the authorized bodies of partner countries.
SIMSTAT system, which is an exchange of microdata (at the level of enterprise’s data) with
authorized bodies of partner countries, began to operate in EU in a pilot mode. This work is
done to reduce the burden on respondents. It is planned to use the export data of a partner
country in the future as an import for an EU partner country.
In Destatis, an annual “mirror” comparison of the data is performed with the data of partner
countries at the 8-digit level of commodity codes. The data is thoroughly checked, compared
to administrative sources, if necessary, changes are made. In addition, requests on extreme
values are obtained from Eurostat, which are checked and, if necessary, changes are made.
To qualitatively fill in the data on Intrastat, Destatis is designing the Intrastat Guidelines,
which includes instructions and explanations to fill in the tools on mutual trade statistics.
At the end of the study visit, possibilities for further cooperation between Destatis and the
Committee for Statistics on the foreign trade statistics were discussed.

Notes on further planning

Activities under this Component will be completed in the Q4 2015. Based on the results of
the activities, “Methodological Guidelines to Keep Statistics of International Commodity
Trade” will be designed in December 2015 with consideration of international standards and
recommendations.

   -   development of the Methodological recommendations for formulating tourism statis-
       tics indicators (including methods for conducting sample surveys, inner tourists cov-
       erage survey) (the Decree of the Agency dated December 20, 2013).
Currently, the CS cooperation with Mr. U. Shperel, an expert of statistical office, is being con-
tinued. Statistical forms of tourism statistics was sent to Mr. Shperel to make recommenda-
tions for further statistical toolkit modernization for 2016. Having acquired recommendations,
the Committee for Statistics will review further toolkit improvement for tourism statistics sur-
veys.
Committee of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan with the assistance of Consortium
conducted a Study visit on April 27-30, 2015 to Shanghai. It was a training workshop in
Shanghai to study the experience of Expo-2010. CS was particularly interested in the experi-
ence of China because EXPO - 2010 in Shanghai was the most effective in term of ROI. Dur-
ing this SV CS experts were able to have discussions with their Chinese counterparts (EXPO
SHANGHAI GROUP - Organizers of the Expo in Shanghai). These discussions covered is-
sues such as organization of EXPO and calculation of visitors of the exhibition.
According to the results of the visit Energy and Services Statistics Division sent a letter to the
Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, where CS proposed to hold a series of activities for the EXPO-
2017 in Astana:
   -   CS included questions about the upcoming EXPO-2017 into tourism statistics forms
       (household survey and visitors) for Astana city.
   -   In 2016 and 2017 CS will facilitate sample surveys on Expo-2017 and the survey re-
       sults will be made available to relevant authorities and JSC NC "Astana EXPO-2017".
Based on international best practice JSC NC "Astana EXPO-2017" has to seek funding to
purchase special system of turnstiles, which will allow an accurate count of the number of
visits during the Expo-2017.
Currently CS revised statistical forms for 2016. As part of this work, Energy and Services
Statistics Division included questions about the upcoming EXPO - 2017 in Astana to the tour-
ism statistical forms (household survey and visitors).

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F16a-KAZ-4) on the topic “Provision of methodological and practical
recommendations regarding the survey titled "The quality of life of persons aged 18 and over
with a disability, with regard to gender aspects“ has been carried out in June 2015 by an
expert from the Italian statistical institute ISTAT.
The main objectives of the consultation mission have been to provide methodological and
practical recommendations regarding the survey titled "The quality of life of persons aged 18
and over with a disability, with regard to gender aspects" for analyzing the preliminary re-
sults, improving the questionnaire for adults and for the final report.
The following main topics and activities have been addressed:
•      data collection on disability in the country: limitations and opportunities
•      implementation of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
       (ICF) in surveys
•      main characteristics of the survey: background information, sample frame and design,
       questionnaire design, field work
•      analysis of the preliminary outcome tables

•       review of the questionnaire used with people aged 18 and older
•       recommendations for the final report
•       methodological aspects related to the preparation of the survey, the training of inter-
        viewers, and the monitoring process of the survey
•       review of the main recommendations agreed and assessment of the results obtained
        during the consultation versus expectations.

Recommendations and next steps

Some key recommendations provided by the expert for the next steps:
    -   to analyze the results of the surveys taking into account the suggestions elaborated
        during the consultation mission, and where justified by the new results, carry out fur-
        ther detailed analysis;
    -   to identify the main indicators for each topic and link them to the UNCRPD articles
        covered in the questionnaire;
    -   to review all documents reporting difficulties during the field work, in administering the
        interview and experienced by the respondents;
    -   to adopt the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as the
        conceptual framework in the revision of the questionnaire and the international disa-
        bility measure proposed by the UN Washington Group on disability statistics;
    -   to review the suggestions proposed regarding changes in the questionnaire, taking in-
        to account that the final questionnaire should be easy to administer and its length
        should be balanced considering the response burden, the mode of data collection
        and the fulfillment of the survey goals;
    -   to test the questions and the new questionnaire before launching the new survey;
    -   to develop a detailed methodological manual and provide training that will also ad-
        dress specific issues on disability and interaction with persons with disability besides
        specific aspects related to the instrument, mode of data collection and activities to
        carry out before, during and after the field work;
    -   to develop protocols to monitor data collection activities, with strategies aimed at cor-
        recting identified problems;
    -   to work in order to solve the problem with the sampling, so to be able to get survey
        results that are representative of the general target population.
    -   to consider carrying out a survey in the general population, with an appropriate ques-
        tionnaire, to estimate the prevalence of persons with disabilities using the WG meas-
        ure in order to compare data internationally and obtain information comparing per-
        sons with and without disability in all aspects related to the UNCRPD, and ultimately
        to monitor its implementation in the country.

A Consulting mission (F16a-KAZ-6) on the topic “Domestic violence statistics“              has been
carried out in August 2015 by two experts.
This mission of Henrica Jansen involved the preparation and conduct of a capacity building
workshop aimed in particular at representatives of Regional (Oblast) statistical offices. These
participants were the regional supervisors for a national violence against women survey. Fol-
lowing the training, they were expected to be responsible for properly training and supervis-
ing their regional teams of interviewers, in order to achieve high quality data while at the
same time ensuring full safety of all participants (interviewers and respondents).
At the end of the workshop it was clear that most participants accepted and understood the
challenges that a violence against women survey brings with it and that they felt quite confi-
dent about training and supervising interviewers in their own regions. Even though this work-
shop was successful, the expert had the impression that duration was relatively short and
there is a risk that the knowledge gained may not be fully transferred to the next level, be-
cause the regional interviewer training will be done by different trainers in different sites.
One of the crucial recommendations deals with making sure that the questionnaire is exten-
sively reviewed and tested and subsequently discussed and fine-tuned during interviewer
training, to eliminate any mistakes and formatting issues and improve the cognitive meaning
in all language versions, before it is printed.
The IT consultant (Maria Karla Floresca-Rarick) helped in developing, testing and fine tuning
the data entry application and trained the regional data processing staff in the system so that
they can train the data entry people in the regions in a consistent way. The IT consultant
also helped with setting up procedures such as backing up, uploading and merging files to
prepare the raw data before submission for analysis.

Conclusions

The training was fairly long in comparison with other trainings for surveys and unusual be-
cause it emphasised sensitization, ethics and safety. Ideally part of the training should serve
to fine-tune the cognitive wording of the questions in the questionnaire, while at the same
time eliminating mistakes and formatting issues. This had not been possible since the ques-
tionnaires had already been printed.
Because the training of interviewers did not take place at the same time but takes place as a
next step, there is a risk that the knowledge gained may not be fully transferred to the next
level. This is because the regional interviewer training will be done by different trainers in
different sites. Further it is likely that the regional interviewer training will be shorter than the
supervisor training. Therefore there is the risk that interviewers will not fully learn all the skills
and attitudes to achieve safe and easy disclosure of violence from the part of the respond-
ents.

Recommendations and next steps

Training of interviewers

      When fieldworkers are insufficiently trained and do not have the right attitudes you
       risk getting low prevalence rates because it needs the right training and attitudes to
       get good rapport with respondents and good disclosure. Interviewers need be able to
       get women to talk about things they feel embarrassed about and are ashamed off and
       that is not easy. They also need to keep the women safe and well. And this needs to
       be practiced extensively with roleplays reflecting many different situations. Interview-
       ers should also know how to react to and support women who need help and they
       need to learn self-care. Training is the single best investment in achieving quality da-
       ta.

Data entry

      Increase number of training days to at least 12 to 14 days so that we would have
       more flexibility in adjusting our schedule according to the participants' pace during the
       workshop. In addition, this is also to accommodate the data entry application testing
       if application is being developed there. That way, the participants will have more time
       to familiarize themselves with the application and help the IT team find inconsisten-
       cies within the program.
       If possible have the interviewers and supervisors attend the same workshop on the
       same dates. This way we minimize miscommunications/misinterpretations of the
       questions and other relevant aspects while conducting the interviews. This is espe-
       cially true when KAZSTAT decide to use the CAPI system, an electronic-based sur-
       vey rather than a paper-based one.
       Further, the printing of the final questionnaire (for paper-based surveys) should be
       done after the supervisor and interviewer training has finished. This is to accommo-
       date all the revisions on the questionnaire that are encountered during the training,
       which also makes developing the system better, more accurate, more consistent.

Field work

      Staple the questionnaires so that the pages cannot fall apart
      Close supervision and retraining especially during first weeks

Data analysis and report writing

      To assist in the analysis plan a generic analysis plan with dummy tables were shared.
       The analysis syntaxes for the generic UNECE questionnaire (available on UNECE
       website) are expected to be a useful reference for the analysis.
      In my view Jessica Gardner could be an excellent expert to assist with this part of the
       work. I myself may be able to provide some support ‘on the side’ if feasible.
      An action plan should be made how to effectively use the data for policy and plan-
       ning. Recommendations should be formulated with the involvement of all stakehold-
       ers.


A Consulting mission (F16c-KAZ-1) on the topic “Accounting of natural population move-
ment" has been carried out in September 2015 by an expert from the German Federal statis-
tical office Destatis.
The aim of this mission was to review the methodology of statistics of natural population
movement in Kazakhstan to see if improvements can be suggested.
First, it can be stated that the statistics of natural population movement is well developed in
Kazakhstan. The workflow of the statistics is quite similar to that in Germany. The single sta-
tistics (births, marriages and divorces) in some cases collect significantly even more objects
than in Germany:
However, in the view of the expert there are some details that could be improved. These im-
provements are seen especially in increasing use of IT technology.
Some other desirable changes cannot be brought about by the Statistical Office itself. Here,
the support of other, higher-level institutions (e.g. ministries) is required.

Recommendations and next steps

The recommendations can be found in the report in the To–do list.
In the opinion of the external expert there are two other problems in relation to statistics of
natural population movement which should be reviewed:
   A The plausibility checks in every single statistics,
   B Difficulties and imaginable solutions in the process of transition from natural popula-
   tion movement statistics to a population register.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Currently, interaction is implemented with state bodies and holders of administrative register-

based systems with the aim to produce migration and vital statistics. Specialists of Registers
Division analyze the received data on a monthly basis: verification of statistical cards of arri-
val/departure, registration of acts of civil status (birth, death, marriage and divorce), verifica-
tion of soft and hard copies received from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of
Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Notes on further planning

Knowledge and experience gained during the study visit will be useful for further develop-
ment of statistical registers and population statistics in Kazakhstan.


A Study Visit (F16c-SV-5) of CS experts on the topic “Studying the Experience of Advanced
Countries in the area of Preparing to Carry out a Population Census by Applying a Tradition-
al Method with the Use of Population Register and Housing Stock Data as well as Techno-
logical Innovations” has been undertaken in June 2015 to the National Statistical Institute of
Bulgaria.
The activity aim was to study planning, preparation, carrying out, processing, making analyti-
cal generalization and publishing the results of the Census-2020 according to UN recom-
mendations as well as to ensure that its outcomes are comparable based on demographic,
geographic, economic, educational, migration, ethno-cultural and housing conditions and
other parameters with the previous census data at regional and national levels as well as
internationally.
The objective was to acquire theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the area of perform-
ing preparatory and basic works to arrange and carry out a census including the pilot one
based on the example of advanced countries.
The staff of the Division of Social and Demographic Statistics of the CS have acquired theo-
retical knowledge and practical skills in the field of collecting, processing, analyzing and dis-
seminating data of the Population and Housing Stock Census-2011 in the National Statistical
Institute of Bulgaria (NSI). As part of this activity, useful information on the NSI’s experience
in the area of carrying out a population and housing stock census by applying “electronic”
and “traditional” has been provided.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Recommendations provided during the study visit are currently being implemented. In partic-
ular, amendments to the Law on State Statistics are being preparing in cooperation with the
Legal Division to include provision on administrative responsibility of individuals for the re-
fusal to provide information during the censuses.
Moreover, the specialists of the Social and Demographic Statistics Division are preparing the
methodological and organizational provisions on conducting a National Census in 2020.

Notes on further planning

Recommendations provided during the study visit will be used to prepare for pilot and main
census in 2020. The preparation will include designing and approval of statistical toolkits,
regulatory and legal acts, software for data entering and processing.


Further Consulting missions (F16c-KAZ-3/4) on the topic “Services to prepare methodo-
logical guidelines for improving migration records” have been carried out in May 2015 by an
expert from the German Federal Statistical Office Destatis and an expert from Statistics Nor-
way.
The purpose of the mission was counseling on evaluating and possibly improving migration
statistics in Kazakhstan. A special focus was dedicated to finding a suitable “method mix” of
data sources and means of statistical data collection to be used for migration statistics in
Kazakhstan. Currently, administrative data sources - paper-based statistical forms - are used
to compile immigrants into Kazakhstan, emigrants from Kazakhstan and internal migrants
within Kazakhstan. In the near future it is planned to have these paper-based statistical forms
replaced by event records from the new Central Population Register (CPR). Surveys were
also discussed as a means to fill the gap left by both paper-based statistical forms and CPR
records.
The work of the German consultant was supported and complemented by contributions from
Kåre Vassenden from Statistics Norway, an expert for the Norwegian Central Population
Register.
From the point of view of the consultant the statistical authorities in Kazakhstan handle mi-
gration statistics properly and by the book. There are no recognizable shortcomings, and,
therefore, there is no need for specific recommendations. The consultant was, however, un-
able to determine whether or not migration records in Kazakhstan are complete, i.e. whether
or not it is possible to emigrate from Kazakhstan or to immigrate into Kazakhstan or to mi-
grate within Kazakhstan without becoming subject of migrations statistics. Furthermore, the
consultant could not fully establish which means and procedures are used for “cleaning” da-
ta, i.e. for handling missing, inconsistent or obviously wrong information items in the statisti-
cal forms. That incorporates some potential risk with respect to the overall data quality.
The introduction of the Central Population Register (CPR) will have substantial implications
on how migrations statistics are compiled in Kazakhstan. There may be more or lesser cases
of external or internal migration recorded when migration records are taken from the CPR in
the future. Therefore, the Kazakhstan Statistics Committee may want to evaluate the poten-
tial changes triggered by using the new data source e.g. by compiling migrations statistics in
Kazakhstan in a parallel way – traditional and register-based – for a limited time span or with-
in a limited regional area. By comparing the results of both means of compilation the authori-
ties will learn the potential consequences of migrating from traditional to register-based sta-
tistics with respect to the number of migration events and the migrants’ demographic chara c-
teristics.



PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                                Page 149

From the current point of view, there seems no need for a German expert to further advice
on migration statistics. Should migration statistics in Kazakhstan be compiled from records of
a fully functional CPR in the future, however, additional CPR-specific consultancy may be
needed.
The Norwegian consultant worked together with the German consultant most of the time,
except the last 2-3 hours of the workshop. In this session the participants from the Commit-
tee of Statistics (CS) asked questions about the Norwegian administrative registers and the
production of population statistics in Statistics Norway.
The main topic of the week was migration, but some discussion was about the overall regis-
ter systems and population statistics in general. The fact that the Norwegian Population reg-
ister contains both migration data and data usually found in civil registers contributed to a
mixed focus on migration and other demographic data.
During the last extra session of the workshop the Norwegian consultant answered questions
about the formation of families and households in the Norwegian data, the registration of
employment status, Norwegian guidelines for the register data, Population censuses and
other issues. Among other things, the consultant described the close connection between
stock and flow statistics in the Norwegian population statistics system.
Due to the situation of administrative registers in Kazakhstan the CS has established a Sta-
tistical Population Register (SPR), however still as a trial version. There is a Central Popula-
tion Register owned by the Ministry of Interior, but the overcoverage is substantial. There are
plans for improving the CPR with input from the forthcoming Population census 2020.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

From the consultant’s point of view, the migration statistics in Kazakhstan is produced car e-
fully and according to the established regulations. There are no obvious deficiencies and
therefore there is no need in special recommendations. Currently, there is no need to involve
the German expert for further consultations on migration statistics. If afterwards migration
statistics in Kazakhstan is to be based on population registers, it may be necessary to con-
duct a consultation specifically on population registers.

Notes on further planning

Recommendations provided during the study visit will be taken in consideration when prepar-
ing a questionnaire for the pilot census which is planned to be carried out in Kazakhstan in
2018.


A Consulting mission (F16d-KAZ-4) on the topic “Improving methodology for formation of
health statistics and development of indicators" has been carried out in July 2015 by two ex-
perts from the German Federal statistical office Destatis.




PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                               Page 150

The activities performed during the expert mission at the Committee of Statistics of the Re-
public of Kazakhstan concerned monetary and non-monetary health statistics. In the area of
monetary health statistics, the German experts demonstrated the allocation of the Kazakh
report on the volume of services provided in the field of health care and social services to
international spending categories. In the area of non-monetary health statistics the Kazakh
report on activities of sanatoriums, consistency checks in German hospital statistics and the
calculation of indicators with respect to international standards were discussed.
In the experts opinion the scope of the statistics and indicators collected and calculated by
Kazstat are sufficient with regard to international standards. There are no additional data
collections necessary. However, some improvements and changes in the questionnaires
should be made to enhance the information obtained from the questionnaires (see recom-
mendations). A more thorough investigation of the Kazstat methodology would be necessary
to ensure that the Kazakh indicators are in accordance with international standards.
In the experts’ perception, there are some ambiguities concerning the responsibility concern-
ing international data collections between the Committee of Statistics and the Ministry of
Health and different data sources seem to be available at both institutions. The experts en-
courage both institutions to deepen their collaboration on those matters.

Recommendations and next steps

   Expand questionnaire A to the international HF, HC and HP categories according to the
    Excel-file template provided by the experts.
   The number of medical and non-medical staff measured in full-time equivalents should be
    collected in the report on the activities of sanatoriums and providers of rehabilitation.
   Include patient-based questionnaire collecting diagnoses according to ICD10 in report on
    the activities of sanatoriums and providers of rehabilitation.
   As agreed during the consultation in Astana, a possible second expert mission should
    consider the non-monetary health indicators calculated by Kazstat in more detail and as-
    sess if their methodology and formulae are in accordance with international standards.
    Therefore Destatis should be provided with a list of the indicators, their formulae and
    methodology (in English).

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

The Committee has revised the Statistical Form “Report on Activities of Health Resort Institu-
tions” (Index: 1-Health Resort): indicators have been changed based on the recommenda-
tions provided by international experts. Following the recommendations provided by the ex-
perts, a new indicator “Average Length of Stay of Patients in Health Resort Institutions” will
be included.
As part of this mission, the Committee is preparing methodological guidelines for non-
monetary indicators that will be considered in detail during the second consulting mission.

Notes on further planning

This theme includes two consultation missions in which the priority is to get recommenda-
tions for expanding the healthcare indicators with due consideration of the international expe-
rience and available administrative data based on the analysis of the system of health care
indicators formulated by the Committee. The specialists of the Ministry of Health and Social
Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan (MHSD) have been involved in these activities.
The Committee in cooperation with the MHSD is elaborating indicators that further will be
included in the methodological guidelines for formulating health care indicators under the
KAZSTAT Project.
In the long term, it is planned to obtain statistical indicators for producing the data on the
number of medical and non-medical staff measured in the full-time equivalent using the sta-
tistical forms on the activities of health resort institutions.


CS experts participated in a Study Visit (F16c-SV-4/D2-SV-5) on the topic “Statistical Popu-
lation Register” in August 2015 in Norway. A report has not been made available yet.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F17-KAZ-16) on the topic “Consultation services to develop a meth-
odology for formulating working time indicators” has been carried out in May 2015 by a Ge r-
man expert.
The aim of the activity was to prepare proposals and practical recommendations for the for-
mulation of working time indicators in line with the international recommendations on labour
force statistics. The mission objectives had been to provide methodological and practical
assistance on the revision of the questions on working time in the current Labour Force Sur-
vey (‘Employment Survey’) questionnaire and on the formulation of working time indicators in
line with the international recommendations.
During the mission, the data sources for working time statistics in Kazakhstan were re-
viewed: the quarterly (in future: monthly) Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the annual and
quarterly Labour Reports and establishment sample surveys. The international recommen-
dations on statistics of working time and of time-related underemployment, which are current-
ly in force, were presented: the Resolution concerning the measurement of working time
adopted by the 18th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) in 2008, the
Resolution concerning the measurement of underemployment and inadequate employment
situations adopted by the 16th ICLS in 1998, and relevant parts of the Resolution concerning
statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization adopted by the 19th ICLS in 2013.
The questions on working time and time-related underemployment were reviewed, which had
been suggested by the first mission on labour market indicators (F-17-KAZ-8) in June 2014
for inclusion in the revised LFS questionnaire. Proposals were made for improving the word-
ing of the questions and for supplementing them with a module of in-depth questions on the
various components of hours actually worked and of time to be excluded from hours actually
worked. The expert recommends that the revised LFS questionnaire be tested and finalised
in due course, so that the new LFS questionnaire can be introduced as from the beginning of
2016.




PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                              Page 154

The expert and his Kazakh counterparts from the Labour and Standard of Living Statistics
Division met with the Structural Statistics Division of the Committee of Statistics (CS) to dis-
cuss the needs for data on working time as an input to the measurement of labour productivi-
ty.
The working time indicators currently formulated by the CS were examined and the interna-
tionally recommended indicators on working time and time-related underemployment were
explained. On the basis of the relevant international recommendations, a tabulation plan
consisting of 47 statistical tables on working time was developed during the mission. A tabu-
lation plan for data on time-related underemployment still needs to be developed during a
future mission on working time indicators.

Recommendations and next steps

An English language version of methodological guidelines on basic labour market indicators,
which have formulated by the CS, should be prepared and made available to the expert.
The Labour and Standard of Living Statistics Division of the CS should amend the wording of
question Q33 (number of hours actually worked in the main job during the reference week) of
the revised LFS questionnaire, as recommended in the present action report.
Using a sub-sample of the households, which are included in the old LFS sample or the new
LFS sample, the revised LFS questionnaire should be tested in due course. The results of
the test should be analyzed and the LFS questionnaire be finalised accordingly. The aim is
to introduce the new LFS questionnaire, which has been developed during the project
‘Strengthening of the National Statistical System of the Republic of Kazakhstan 2012-2016’,
as from the beginning of 2016 (i.e. before the end of the project).
A module with in-depth questions on each of the four components of hours actually worked
(direct hours, related hours, down time, and rest time) should be designed for the inclusion in
the LFS from time to time. The module should also include questions on the various types
of time to be excluded from hours actually worked.
Data on working time obtained from Labour Reports and establishment sample surveys
should be compared with the corresponding data on working time obtained from the LFS.
The internationally recommended working time indicators, which have been presented during
the expert mission and in the present action report, should be computed for Kazakhstan to
the extent that data are already available.
The Labour and Standard of Living Statistics Division of the CS should provide data on total
hours actually worked by (i) branch of economic activity (industry) and (ii) type of institutional
unit to the Structural Statistics Division.
To the extent that data are already available from the current LFS, or once these data be-
come available through use of the revised LFS questionnaire, statistical tables on working
time should be prepared according to the tabulation plan, which is attached as Annex 5 to
the present action report. The tables should be reviewed in cooperation with the expert.

A tabulation plan for data on time-related underemployment should be developed during a
future expert mission on the topic.
On the basis of the elements discussed during the expert mission and included in the present
action report, the Labour and Standard of Living Statistics Division should design methodo-
logical guidelines relating to the measurement of working time. The guidelines should be
reviewed during a future expert mission on the topic.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities and notes on
further planning

The employment sample survey questionnaire for 2016 has been revised. In particular, ques-
tions concerning working hours have been modified; methodological recommendations have
been included from the Resolution Concerning Statistics of Work, Employment and Labour
Under utilization adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians.
In view of the increase in the total number of questions in the questionnaire due to inclusion
of new questions concerning working hours, a decision was taken to single out new ques-
tions concerning working hours in a separate module and include it in the survey starting
from 2017.
The Labor and Living Standard Statistics Division will estimate working-hours indicators at
the request of the Structural Statistics Division and the National Accounts Division to esti-
mate labor productivity and make other calculations.
Be the end of Quarter III of the current year, the methodological guidelines for working-hours
indicators will be prepared and approved; the draft methodological guidelines have been
prepared and are being reviewed.


A further Consulting mission (F17-KAZ-9) on the topic “Labour market indicators” has been
carried out in June 2015 by German experts.
The expert mission was the second one undertaken on the topic ‘Improvement and extension
of labour market indicators’. The mission objectives had been to provide methodological and
practical assistance in formulating labour market indicators, including decent work and infor-
mal employment indicators, based on the international recommendations on labour force
statistics. During the expert mission, the 17 main statistical indicators of decent work devel-
oped by the ILO, as well as the seven additional and two context indicators for the dimension
‘employment opportunities’, were reviewed. Data sources and computation methods were
discussed for all of these indicators.
The questionnaire on decent work, which is attached to the labour force (employment sur-
vey) questionnaire once a year during the last quarter, was reviewed. Proposals were made
to improve the decent work questionnaire and to reduce the number of questions considera-
bly. Concerning the remaining questions, a decision needs to be taken as to whether they




PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                               Page 156
KAZSTAT Twinning Arrangement



should be kept as a separate module attached to the labour force survey (LFS) or be inte-
grated in the main LFS questionnaire.
Parts of the revised main LFS questionnaire were reviewed again during the expert mission,
and suggestions were made to improve them. As part of the review, the classification by sta-
tus in employment of persons employed on civil/service contracts was clarified. The revised
LFS questionnaire should be tested and finalized in due course, so that the new LFS ques-
tionnaire can be introduced as from the beginning of 2016 (i.e. prior to the end of the project).
On the basis of the revised LFS questionnaire, the classification by labour force status was
reviewed and corrected. In this connection, clarification was provided on the classification by
labour force status of persons on child-care leave or education/training leave.
The data processing procedures for the identification of persons employed in the formal ver-
sus informal sectors, and in formal versus informal jobs, should be corrected as suggested
during the first expert mission on the topic.

Recommendations and next steps

An English language version of the methodological guidelines on basic labour market indica-
tors, which have been formulated by the CS, should be prepared and made available to the
experts.
The 26 decent work indicators, which have been listed in Annex 5a of the report, should be
computed for Kazakhstan with relevant breakdowns (e.g. sex, urban/rural area, etc.).
The decent work questionnaire should be revised and shortened according to the experts’
suggestions. The CS should decide whether the remaining questions should form a separate
‘LFS-Module on Decent Work’ or be included in the main LFS questionnaire.
Annex 8 attached to the present Action Report should be completed by the CS, i.e. the CS
should adjust its own new English version of the revised main LFS questionnaire prepared in
June 2015 (see Annex 7) to the version, which the experts had prepared for the action report
on their first mission (F17-KAZ-8), and which is attached to the present Action Report as An-
nex 6. In doing so, the CS should also take into account the corrections indicated in Annex 8
and the other suggestions made in the present Action Report.
Using a sub-sample of the households, which are included in the old LFS sample or the new
LFS sample, the revised main LFS questionnaire should be tested in due course. The staff of
the Labour and Living Standard Statistics Division should participate in the test and conduct
some of the interviews. The results of the test should be analysed and the LFS questionnaire
be finalised accordingly. The aim is to introduce the new LFS questionnaire, which has been
developed during the project ‘Strengthening of the National Statistical System of the Republic
of Kazakhstan 2012-2016’, as from the beginning of 2016 (i.e. before the end of the project).
The CS should correct Table 5 (see Annex 11 of the report), which cross-classifies status in
employment with the type of production unit (formal sector, informal sector, households) and
the formal vs. informal nature of the job, according to the recommendations made by the



PROGRESS REPORT No. 5                                                                Page 157

experts during their first mission. The results should be discussed with the experts during
their next mission.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

In the publication Decent Work 2015 to be prepared in February 12, 2016 according to the
Plan of Statistical Activities, a list of decent work indicators will be expanded based on the
recommendations provided by the international experts.
All recommendations provided by the experts will be taken into account when revising a de-
cent work module for 2017.
Tables are being adjusted in the publications on informal employment based on the expert
recommendations concerning the employment status by type of production units (for-
mal/informal sector, households).
Methodological guidelines for Labour Market Indicators have been sent for translation; as
soon as they are translated, they will be sent to the experts.

Notes on further planning

Improvement of the employment questionnaire will be continued to include all the recom-
mendations provided by the experts and ensure that the formulated indicators meet the in-
ternational standards to the fullest extent.
By mid 2016, the decent work questionnaire will be revised based on the recommendations
provided by the experts; the module with questions concerning working hours will be finalized
for being included in the 2017 survey.
In 2016, a sample for monthly employment survey will be improved by including a quota
sampling method to be used in the surveys for additional modules and in a monthly overlap-
ping.

Findings and results

A Consulting mission (F18-KAZ-6.4) on the topic “Statistical analysis of survey results,
methods of building multidimensional indicators” has been carried out in June 2015 by the
Swedish expert for household surveys.
Kazakhstan has a well organised continuous survey measuring the welfare of 12 000 repre-
sentative households with a rotating sample. The survey can also be used as a vehicle for
broader aspects of standard of living through add-on modules. So far modules have included
Quality of life, Time use, Availability of education and Health services and Social involve-
ment. There is, however, a need to give a more comprehensive picture of the living condi-
tions as a supplement to economic indicators.
Current and future development of multidimensional survey indicators were presented and
discussed. A recent Swedish official investigation for future living condition indicators and the
EU-SILC were used as references.
An inventory of available indicators in Kazakhstan showed that most relevant indicators are
or soon will be available for analysis of welfare and poverty in a broader perspective. The
supply of welfare services is already covered by an annual report. A broad well-
being/satisfaction perspective will be presented in August.
A rapid training in the use of XLSTAT-PLSPM was given using the not cleaned data from the
well-being/satisfaction module. Sampling design and the “middle class” were also discussed.

Conclusions

CS already has most of the relevant indicators to make multi-area analysis of welfare, pov-
erty and well-being. It is not recommended to try to use area-specific thresholds or composite
indices. The existing annual report on the supply of living condition support should be sup-
plemented with a comprehensive well-being report every third or fourth year. Later a report
could be compiled showing all three dimensions of living conditions: the supply-access to

resources-impact as well-being; different areas/components of life; and sustainability over
time. A program for future modules should be harmonised with the reporting program.

Recommendations and next steps

Welfare/well-being frameworks
After discussions about the OECD, Swedish and other frames, it was concluded that com-
prehensive presentation of welfare/well-being in Kazakhstan should be based on the well-
being/satisfaction module, supplementing the annual public service supply report. The
measured indicators will be grouped similar to the other frames, particularly the OECD frame.
The current module measures both service performance and quality of life.
Not covered in the current well-being module is the employment situation and sustainability
of well-being over time (capital in column 2). The well-being module covers both satisfaction
with public services and the personal impact. No frame is covering mobility (possibilities to
travel), access to information, equality/fairness and freedom of choices. The current and fu-
ture modules can be useful tools to monitor the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy.
The indicators can also be grouped from a personal perspective: Self, family and friends,
home and environment, work/school, and society (public and private services).
The data should be presented by sex, age groups, regions and economic status.

The middle class
A “middle class” should be defined by clear criteria. Often mentioned criteria are combina-
tions of income, education and occupation. The classifications are often called Socio-
economic level or Socio-economic background, but the preferred name seems to be Socio-
economic status (SES). There are no international standards for such classifications, but EU
has developed the European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC). Work is going on to
adjust the classification to the new ISCO-08.

Sampling design
The planned mission on sampling design should aim to make the design as efficient as pos-
sible and therefore look for alternative designs, as the design is not only depending on theo-
retical aspects, but as much on field organisation, logistics, access to updated frames, etc.
Most countries have long traditions of making surveys and are mentally “indoctrinated” in
certain logistics/field-organisation. To make the sample design more efficient, it is important
to discuss or test different solutions, e.g. one stage sampling.
Besides alternative designs depending on different logistics and rotation schedules, one-
stage sampling could be discussed. The design effect in this type of surveys is often at least
2-4, meaning that a two-stage sample needs 2-4 times as big a sample to give the same
precision. Statistics Sweden has for a long time been using local interviewers and one-stage
sampling. Even if it sometimes involves travelling more than 300 km to a household, it has

proven to be more efficient than cluster sampling. It is again a question of balancing theoreti-
cal sampling with the logistical alternatives. The most efficient solution should be found.
There are two main reasons to use two stage sampling: logistics and the age of the frame.
Updating all areas are costly, but if the quality of the population register is adequate it could
be used as a reliable frame. Rural areas in Kazakhstan is less populated than northern Swe-
den, so it may not be cost efficient to use one stage sampling in rural areas. An alternative
would be to use one stage sampling in urban areas and two-stage sampling in rural areas.
Clustering can also be done when the sample for the full year is drawn to minimize travelling.
As mentioned in earlier reports, the reference period for non-durables could be reduced from
4 x 2 weeks to 4 x 1 weeks. Many countries have only one week as reference period, many
have two weeks and some four weeks. Very few have eight weeks. Quarterly visits with one
week reference period would be sufficient and give higher reliability than the semi-durables
and durables, particularly if each monthly week can be represented for each household.

Alternatives can be tested on current data to estimate the outcomes.
As soon as the well-being data are cleaned, further analysis with XLSTAT-PLSPM are rec-
ommended to present the satisfaction on different areas of life and living conditions and their
contribution to the total well-being. In the meantime, the consultant will make further analysis
on the anonymised raw data to propose specific settings in the program. The results will also
be used to discuss and program future modules and included indicators, with less relevant
indicators removed.

Status of implementation of recommendations from project activities

Well-being/life satisfaction data that is necessary to complement economic indicators for ob-
taining a more comprehensive picture of living conditions were published in August of the
current year in the bulletin “Quality of Life”. The publication provides subjective evaluation by
the respondents of the level of life satisfaction, living conditions, health, financial situation,
the quality of dwelling they live in, free time availability, satisfaction with the public services in
healthcare and education sectors, and other aspects of quality of life.
Based on the results of the survey, a press release was published with a brief analysis of the
main obtained data.

Notes on further planning

Based on the recommendations provided, it is planned to use the results from the Quality of
Life module in the estimation of multidimensional indicators, in particular, of the quality-of-life
index.

Findings and results

During the reporting period, four project management activities were carried out. The aim of
the activities was to monitor the project’s progress and to discuss further planning of the pro -
ject activities.
It was agreed that the missions and study visits for 2016 should be scheduled by the end of
this year. CS will provide the necessary terms of reference as soon as possible. Destatis is
going to provide the updated work plan after the HLPM in September.
Based on a projection of costs anticipated, Destatis asserted that another 300.000 USD
might be necessary to fund all activities. CS and Destatis expressed their willingness to
amend the contract accordingly if the pre-calculations remain valid.
