Notes: The figures are elasticities of FGT poverty measures (P0, P1, P2) with respect to Gini inequality index. The change of Gini is done via the following transformation of
the actual income structure: 1. shift of all incomes by a fixed amount (lump-sum transfer); 2. Normalize incomes to bring the mean of the new distribution to the mean of
the original distribution (tax on incomes).
