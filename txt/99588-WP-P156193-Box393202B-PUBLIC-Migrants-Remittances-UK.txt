    Foreword


    Overview of remittances
    DFID recognizes the importance of remittances to developing countries, in particular for
    those in poverty. It recognizes that remittances may finance food, housing, health and
    education and also sometimes investments. The UK is keen that remittance costs are low
    and remittance channels also need to be secure and legitimate. For this, an open and
    competitive market of reliable players and participation of both banks and money trans-
    fer operators is essential as is clear information and rights for remitters. DFID supports
    work both in the UK but in particular abroad both on regulation and with the market
    players.


    The importance of Somalia remittances and the diaspora
    Worldwide remittances to Somalia account for approximately half of Somalia’s gross
    national income and exceed the amount the country receives in humanitarian aid, devel-
    opment aid, and foreign direct investment combined. The Somalia Diaspora in the UK
    remits approximately $500 million per year. 90% of the remittances are used to buy
    food, healthcare and fund education.


    Support to the UK-Somali remittance corridor
    The UK Government established the UK-Somali Safer Corridor Initiative (“SCI”), which
    combines a series of both measures in the UK and Somalia to support the flow of remit-
    tances through more transparent, legitimate, and traceable channels, in a way that could
    reduce the risk of use for illicit purposes.
        Actions taken in the first mile (UK) are aimed at improving the compliance standards
    of UK-based Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), thereby giving greater confidence to the
    financial sector. The UK has liaised with the market players in the second mile (Dubai)
    which is regulated by the UAE authorities. At the third mile (Somalia) DFID is supporting
    the Somalia Government regulation and supervision of the remittances sector through
    a trusted Agent, as part of a longer term program to support the formalization of the
    financial sector in Somalia.
        Throughout 2014 and 2015 the UK Government has monitored developments in the
    UK-Somalia remittance corridor closely and maintained regular contact with UK com-
    mercial banks, SOMSA members, money remitters, the Somali community and other
    stakeholders.

            The DFID funded survey into remittance sending behavior that was carried out
        by Developing Markets Associates for the World Bank Project Greenback 2.0, is thus
        an extremely useful piece of research for DFID and helped inform the Safer Corridor
        Initiative.

    Executive Summary

    Overview of the project
    Project Greenback 2.0 is a project led by the World Bank, aimed at supporting the devel-
    opment of an efficient and transparent remittances market. Project Greenback 2.0 was
    launched in Turin, Italy in 2013 and Montreuil, France in 2014.

    Following the crisis affecting Somali money transfer operators’ access to bank accounts
    in the UK, the World Bank has been supporting UK authorities in the UK-Somalia Safer
    Corridor Initiative. It is within this context that a survey of migrants residing in London
    was commissioned to DMA to investigate the level of financial inclusion and the remit-
    tance sending practices.

    The survey collected 602 in-depth interviews of migrants from Bangladeshi, Ghana-
    ian, Romanian and Somali communities. The survey looks at the economic and financial
    profile of migrants, as well as their financial behaviors. There is an emphasis on sending
    remittances and access to financial services.


    Demographic breakdown
    The vast majority of the sample declared to be legally residing in the UK, either as a Brit-
    ish citizen or, in the case of Romanian respondents, as a European Union national. The
    range of education achieved varied across the sample, however 40 percent of respon-
    dents across all four community sub-samples had completed some secondary schooling,
    while 21.2 percent had a bachelor’s degree or equivalent, and 14 percent had achieved
    a masters or PhD level of education. The vast majority of the sample reported being in
    permanent employment, although a significant portion of Romanian men reported being
    contractors or freelance.


    Income, savings and financial inclusion
    Differences arise across the subsamples with regards to income. Romanians declared the
    highest average individual income (with 48.7 percent reporting a monthly net income
    of greater than £1,500), while Somalis declare the lowest average income in the sample
    (with 70.6 percent reporting a monthly net income of less than £1,500). As noted in
    Turin, the relatively better economic position of Romanians could be attributed to hav-
    ing acquired EU citizenship in 2007, which may ease their integration. On a positive
    note, the majority of respondents reported that their income has become more constant
    and secure since their arrival in the UK.

    In general, the data collected points to a relatively high level of financial access for
    interviewed migrants, with 95 percent of respondents being banked. The respondents
    reported high usage of formal financial services and products, including 53 percent or
    respondents using online banking. While the majority of Romanian, Ghanaians and Ban-
    gladeshi respondents reported being able to save some of their income each month,
x                                                                         A Greenback 2.0 Report




     67 percent of Somali respondents reported not being able to save some of their income
     each month. This may be connected to the relatively low individual monthly incomes of
     Somali respondents, and the relatively high amount of remittances sent home on a regu-
     lar basis.


     Remittance habits
     With regards to sending remittances, 53.8 percent of respondents reported sending
     cash through a money transfer operator. 26.5 percent of respondents use bank trans-
     fers, with much smaller proportions sending cash to an account, cash in hand or using
     prepaid cards. The majority of respondents send remittances each month, and while the
     cost of the transaction is an important consideration, 41 percent of respondents cited
     the speed of the service as a crucial factor when choosing a service. Ease of use and the
     security of the channel were also cited significantly by respondents.

     In reporting transaction costs, many respondents only reported the fee. While respon-
     dents may consider foreign exchange rates when sending remittances, the majority of
     respondents did not report the foreign exchange margin or other costs when asked how
     much they were charged for sending remittances. This illustrates that there is a role for
     greater awareness and tools that allow remitters to better understand and calculate the
     costs incurred when sending money.

     In the context of recent bank derisking, which has affected money transfer operators’
     access to banking services, this does not seem to have had a large effect on changing
     remitters’ method of sending. This was particularly evident in the Somali community,
     where 94.4 percent of respondents reported that since they arrived in the UK, their
     main method of sending remittances has not changed. However, the ability of migrants
     to continue sending remittances through efficient means and to use their operator of
     choice remains a concern.


     Conclusions
     Overall the survey provides insights into how the remittance market currently functions
     in the UK and migrants’ access to financial services. Based on the findings there are a
     few areas that would be worth further investigation:

     •	The differences in average monthly income levels across communities

     •	Perceptions of sophisticated financial tools such as insurance, and how to increase
       uptake

     •	Specific interventions for the Somali community where tools and techniques for
       increasing savings could be implemented

      In parallel with the main survey presented in this report, a survey was carried out on diaspora entrepre-
       neurs in London to better understand their payment habits and use of financial services.

      Diaspora communities residing in London were surveyed from February to May 2015 as a continuation
      of remittance related research for Project Greenback 2.0 that focused on Bangladeshi, Ghanaian, Roma-
      nian, and Somali communities. This note provides a high level overview of the results obtained from the
      SME survey.

   2. Business
   Respondents were asked some questions about their businesses. Almost half (48 percent) of respon-
   dents started their business between 2000 and 2009 and 43 percent started their business since 2009.
   The most reported business sectors across the sample included retail, restaurant/cafes, and personal
   services (such as salons, barbers). This may reflect the relative ease of accessing entrepreneurs in retail
   and shop settings in comparison to other settings, rather than a true indication of the sectors diaspora
   entrepreneurs are involved in.


                                             What type of business do you run?

   When asked how many employees the business has, the average number reported is 4.7, and when
   asked if employees are primarily from the same diaspora group, the response was fairly even, with 48.9
   percent stating yes and 51.1 percent stating no.

   The average annual turnover reported by respondents is £756,188.20, while the median average turnover
   is £84,500. Additionally, the average profit margin reported is 31 percent.


                                       Are there any links between your business
                                            here and your country of origin?

Thirty-four percent of respondents reported a link between their businesses in the UK and in their coun-
try of origin. When asked to describe the link, several reported the import of goods for sale in the UK
while others reported that their country of origin provides a customer base/market for their business.


3. Financial services
The survey also enquired into the respondents’ use of financial services for their businesses.


                                     What nancial products do you use for your business?

The vast majority of respondents reported using some type of financial services for their business,
mainly in the form of a current account. Only 8 percent of respondents reported not having a bank
account for their business, with the main reason being that it is not needed.


                   If you do not have a bank account for your business, why do you not have an account?

answers.

   reflected in majority of respondents reporting that they financed the start-up of their business through
   personal savings.

   Conclusion
   The survey, which was conducted over a wide range of communities, shows that in many ways diaspora
   SMEs are not noticeably different to other SMEs. In particular:

   •	The majority of migrant SME entrepreneurs are over 35 years old.

   •	They are highly educated with at least half having a degree and a quarter a Master’s degree.

   •	Most SMEs have employees, some are from their own community but an equal number are not.

   •	Around a third of respondents have direct links with their country of origin.

   •	Most SMEs surveyed have banking relationships and use mainstream services.

   •	Most SMEs were established using the owner’s personal funds or through borrowing from family and
     friends. As might be expected, there is little evidence that borrowing from a bank was used to estab-
     lish a business.

•	A third of respondents are looking to raise further finance, with around half looking to do so via banks
  and other formal financial products

•	These businesses require greater levels of international payments than other community groups. They
  utilize mainstream bank-operated payment facilities as the norm. Their use of international money
  transfer services is quite limited for business payments.

Diaspora SMEs in London are incredibly diverse, and this paper has given a snapshot of the insights
gained from the short survey undertaken. A deeper analysis of specific sectors that entrepreneurs work
in or the potential barriers migrant entrepreneurs face in accessing formal financial services could pro-
