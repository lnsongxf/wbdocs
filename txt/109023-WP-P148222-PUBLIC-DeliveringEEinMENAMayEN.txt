Executive summary
Reductions in energy intensity in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) have
lagged behind those in other regions. From 2000 to 2012, the energy intensity of
lower-middle-income countries worldwide fell by 2.5 percent a year, while the av-
erage intensity of MENA countries in the same income bracket rose by 0.4 percent.
Upper-middle-income countries worldwide saw energy intensity fall by 0.5 percent
a year over the period, while those in MENA fell by only 0.1 percent. Among
high-income countries, energy intensity fell across the globe at 1.6 percent a year,
in contrast to its increase in the MENA region of 0.9 percent.
    The potential for greater energy efficiency (EE) is huge across the region. Re-
alizing this potential would benefit resource-rich countries and those needing to
import fuel. The current low level of oil prices presents an opportunity for many
of them to act. While the benefits of EE are widely recognized, persistent barriers
obstruct the necessary investments and behavioral and operational changes. Given
market imperfections, a lack of information, insufficient technical skills, and weak
incentives EE has been insufficiently pursued. The rationale for supporting EE
implementation is clear. The challenge is delivering it.
    Many MENA countries are adopting or drafting national energy efficiency ac-




                                                                                           Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
tion plans. Such initiatives have raised the efficiency of industrial processes, motor
vehicles, appliances, equipment, buildings, power plants, and distribution systems.
But the scale remains small, with approaches intermittent and piecemeal, often
driven by the most urgent national priorities rather than a long-term strategy.
    The potential for savings from EE is estimated at 21 percent of projected total
primary energy supply in MENA countries by 2025. Nearly three-quarters of these
savings are from greater efficiency in end-use sectors—219 of 300 million tons of
oil equivalent (Mtoe). Of those sectors, the industry sector offers the largest scope
for energy savings over the projected period, contributing just over one-fifth of the
total potential savings. The residential sector holds the second largest potential,
followed by transport and then commercial and public services (referred to simply
as ‘services’) and finally agriculture. The share of industry shrinks slightly over time
as the potential for energy savings rises faster in the electricity supply sector.
    For many countries in the region, electricity shortages—often connected to the
cost and availability of imported fuel—are key motivators for raising EE. Relieving
these shortages requires balancing more expensive supplies with demand from sec-
tors most responsible for raising electricity use; i.e. industry, residential, and ser-
vices. As a result, this report primarily deals with EE in these electricity-intensive
                                                                                                          9
end-use sectors, and to a certain extent with power generation. It does not cover
the agricultural or the transport sectors.

Industry
Energy prices in the industry sector are widely subsidized, though less so than for
the residential sector. Therefore, industrial customers are somewhat more moti-
vated to reduce energy costs. Utilities and service providers such as energy service
companies (ESCOs) are well suited to undertake EE programs because the in-
                   dustry sector needs technical expertise and trained personnel. Utilities, with their
                   knowledge of customer-demand patterns, can identify EE opportunities that bene-
                   fit customers and the utility. Public-sector EE agencies rarely have the expertise to
                   undertake EE in this sector, but can serve as facilitators and support implementing
                   agencies in accessing resources and incentives.

                   Services
                   Customer motivation for EE in commercial and public services depends on energy
                   prices and their energy spending compared to other costs. Few prices for commer-
                   cial customers are subsidized, but energy bills may constitute only a small portion
10
                   of their operating costs. Public service customers are also seldom motivated to
                   undertake EE measures because their energy costs are part of fixed budgetary al-

                   locations. Long-term improvements in the efficiency of buildings in the services
                   sector—including public and commercial buildings, schools and hospitals—are per-
                   haps best achieved through building codes and standards and through appliance
                   performance standards, whether for new or existing buildings.
                       Compliance with regulations accounts for an estimated two-fifths of EE mea-
                   sures in Europe, and three-fifths of countries surveyed globally have established
                   mandatory or voluntary new-building codes. In the short term, MENA’s ESCOs
                   and utilities can undertake energy audits to identify retrofit options for reducing
                   energy use in buildings. Utilities and ESCOs are also well suited to undertake EE in
                   street lighting and public services such as water pumping, where end-users general-
                   ly lack technical expertise and are not motivated to lower operational costs. Public
                   sector agencies can monitor compliance to ensure that program goals are met and
                   to undertake customer education programs.

                   Residential
                   This diverse sector, with multiple consumer preferences and motivations, is the
                   most challenging for EE, especially in countries where energy prices are subsidized.
                   Regulations, a principal mechanism to promote EE, could target the development
                   of appliance labeling and performance standards. Minimum efficiency standards
                   are important, but so is labeling that promotes voluntary actions. Regulations can
                   also phase out inefficient equipment such as incandescent lamps in the residen-
                   tial and other sectors. Utilities are well suited to undertake lighting retrofits and
                   weatherization programs (insulation for facilities, for example) in the residential
                   sector, given their relationship to the customer and their ability to charge custom-
                   ers through utility bills. Public agencies are well suited to monitor programs and to
                   undertake customer awareness and education programs, critical for implementing
                   programs in the residential sector.
                       Given diverse market dynamics and policy and regulatory frameworks, wide
                   implementation of EE in MENA energy markets will not be easy. Countries in
                   other regions that have faced similar hurdles can provide useful lessons for the
                   MENA region. While it is unlikely that MENA countries will be able to address all
                   barriers, it is important to align the interests of stakeholders and help move their
                   economies toward lowering the intensity of energy use in sectors with the greatest
                   potential for EE.
                       The need is growing for MENA countries to develop mechanisms for financing
                   (often through domestic financial institutions) and for delivery (through utilities).
                   The delivery mechanisms must reflect the requirements of different sectors. The
                   mechanisms must also operate within an integrated framework, grounded in a strong
enabling environment of clear and competent policy, regulatory and institutional
structures, and supported by relevant financing mechanisms.
    The five main categories of a good enabling environment for energy efficiency are
    >	 Policies and regulations.

    >	 Institutions and organizations.

    >	 Finance and incentives.

    >	 Capacity and awareness building.

    >	 Information and reporting.

    Within this enabling environment, countries need to develop viable business
models that meet the objectives of stakeholders. For instance, households facing
subsidized energy prices may not be motivated to purchase relatively expensive EE
appliances, but commercial and industrial consumers that cross-subsidize residen-
tial consumers and pay higher tariffs may be motivated to undertake EE measures
to reduce production costs. This poses a challenge for utilities that would like to
increase sales to higher-paying customers and reduce sales to subsidized consumers.
Governments may wish to replace existing subsidies with funding EE for subsidized
consumers. Balancing these competing and at times conflicting objectives of stake-
holders will be a major challenge to undertaking EE in MENA countries.
    Putting in place a robust framework to deliver on EE measures will require
substantial planning and resources—and more critically, political willingness to set
targets and implement EE programs. The key elements of the framework would be

common to all MENA economies, but each country will have to develop its own
roadmap suited to its energy, economic and market conditions, as well as their
national EE action plans.
    The full report offers options tailored to subregions in MENA (Maghreb,
Mashreq and Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC]),1 and in some instances to specific
countries. Here we summarize the options in more general terms.

Policies and regulations
The success of any EE policy depends on the degree of government commitment,
level of program ambition, and the stability of public support. Experience shows
that well-designed policies include clearly defined targets supported by an overar-
ching EE legal and regulatory framework. A bottom-up approach is better for set-
ting national targets because the potential for EE improvement varies considerably
by sector. It is imperative that the sectoral targets for EE are appropriate on energy
intensity, specific energy consumption, and percentage reduction. Targets are most
effective—and much easier to implement—when stakeholders participate from the
earliest stages. This requires placing EE units in key sectoral ministries that can
recommend suitable targets and mechanisms to a central unit.
    MENA countries at the early stages of EE policy development may also find it
                                                                                         11
effective to introduce realistic and quickly demonstrable (initially short- and medi-
um-term) goals and targets to help achieve public support and stakeholder buy-in.
Aligning the interests of stakeholders and demonstrating results in a short time
helps to sustain activity.
    Energy subsidies and other forms of price distortion encourage consumers to un-
dervalue energy and diminish the financial incentive to adopt EE measures. For con-
sumers to understand the benefits of EE, the price they pay for energy consumption
                   must reflect costs. Subsidies are distortive in all countries, particularly to net energy
                   importers such as Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia. In recent years,
                   several MENA countries have embarked on subsidy reforms, and energy importers
                   are making considerable progress.
                       Phasing out energy subsidies will cost consumers. As a result, reforms will have
                   to secure public support. It may be important to introduce EE incentive programs
                   supported by defined funding sources, as such measures can help consumers re-
                   duce their energy usage and hence the financial burden of the subsidy reform. It is
                   also important to include social safety net programs and other mitigation mecha-
12
                   nisms to support the poor and vulnerable.
                       Governments should issue new regulations to support new EE policies, includ-
                   ing rules that provide energy performance standards and enforcement mechanisms.
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   Internationally, appliance labeling (especially lighting, refrigerators, air condition-
                   ers, and water heaters), buildings, and industrial equipment and processes have
                   delivered results at low cost. A number of Arab countries have already adopted
                   standards and labels for appliances, and a few have adopted building codes. The
                   task is to enforce them.

                   Institutions and organizations
                   Successful delivery of EE requires strong leadership from government and other
                   institutions. Their roles and responsibilities must avoid duplication of tasks. Based
                   on experience across many regions, EE programs should be commercially oriented,
                   responsive to the needs of target sectors, demand driven, and flexible. A central
                   body should coordinate these new programs to provide a principal hub for all
                   stakeholders. Depending on the characteristics of a particular market, it may be
                   appropriate to assign these responsibilities to a dedicated state agency or agencies.
                   Conversely, where the majority of programs will be delivered by utilities, the utili-
                   ties regulator may be more suitable.
                       Having a dedicated energy agency or agencies with the authority to deliver
                   EE policies and the responsibility for achieving goals has been highly effective
                   internationally. However, it is also important to ensure that the new EE policies
                   and activities match with those of other public and private agencies. The utilities
                   regulator can also provide an effective channel for delivery of EE programs, as it
                   can introduce a range of sectoral EE initiatives through utilities’ mandates and
                   incentives programs, as well as supplier obligation schemes. Internationally, there
                   are many examples of successful regulation programs to incentivize utilities, based
                   on a long-term EE strategy for each economic sector and identifying near-, mid-,
                   and long-term measures.
                       Clear responsibility for monitoring and verifying results is also necessary to
                   confirm compliance with program requirements and to provide evidence of in-
                   dividual, sectoral, and national benefits from the EE programs. Data gathered is
                   useful in evaluating the effectiveness of EE programs and helping them adapt to
                   changing markets.

                   Finance and incentives
                   Financing is one of the main barriers to wide implementation of EE, especially in
                   developing countries with inadequate public funds and little access to commercial
                   sources. Yet regardless of economic and structural differences among countries,
                   multiple approaches that combine public and commercial financing, as well as fis-
                   cal and economic incentives, will likely be essential. Financing mechanisms must
match the needs of end-use sectors—one appropriate for industry may not work for
the service or residential sectors.
    The implementation mechanisms for deploying EE will also to an extent dic-
tate the financing mechanism best suited for an end-use sector—for instance, while
utility-driven EE programs can leverage the ability of utilities to finance programs
through the rate basis (which may increase rates for all or a segment of customers),
programs targeting low-income households may need a different approach. In the
long run, as markets mature, commercial financing options are critical to create a
sustainable market for EE services.
    Some barriers are common to all countries – weak recognition of energy sav-
ings from efficiency investments, small projects, and a lack of information and
capacity to manage EE project finance. However, developing countries also have
their own barriers, including low capital market development, governance issues,
small markets for EE, high capital costs, and higher perceived national risk for
investors.
    Countries at an early stage of development of capital and EE markets need to
incentivize and provide finance. Financial instruments must reflect the country’s
needs and its commercial and financial markets. In countries with weak capital
markets, investment in EE comes primarily from public finance through grants and
concessional loan instruments. Incentives may also be in the form of parafiscal
measures, such as reduced duties on energy-efficient devices that cannot be manu-
factured domestically. As development picks up, the proportion of EE investment
supported by commercial finance usually grows.
    Governments typically have the greatest success with public finance when they




                                                                                        Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
have been integrated into wider national action plans and programs, developed in
collaboration with the business and financial communities, and tailored to address
local investment risks and market constraints.
    The suitability of a finance option will depend on several key market charac-
teristics. One important element is the cost-reflectiveness of energy prices, a major
factor that measures the level of energy subsidy. Electricity market liberalization
also matters—that is, whether there is active supply-side competition over electrici-
ty companies or they are largely state-owned monopolies. More general factors are
the level of capitalization within the market and the level of functionality within
the banking system. In the design of public finance, an exit strategy should be
available for occasions when the EE market develops enough for private financial
markets to take over financing.

Capacity and awareness building
Effective implementation of EE policies requires all stakeholders to be aware of the
benefits of improved EE, necessitating strong and well-targeted communication
strategies. In addition, the organizations and institutions directly involved in im-
plementation need the internal capacity to deliver the programs, including dedicat-
ed, trained individuals with the expertise to develop and deliver the sector-based      13
programs sustainably.
    Targeted efforts to build capacity are therefore an integral part of the enabling
environment, and should include education initiatives to meet the requirements of
all stakeholders. Although the overall objective of capacity-building initiatives and
training programs is to promote EE and create awareness of the benefits and the im-
portance of reducing energy use, each sector has its own requirements. For example,
within the industrial sector companies, ESCOs, utilities, equipment manufacturers,
                   energy agencies, and commercial banks all need to understand why investment in
                   EE is important.
                       Capacity building and training for consumers, project developers, and lenders
                   are also necessary to promote EE in the service sector, as its consumers gener-
                   ally have little information about the benefits of improved EE and the best op-
                   tions open to them. A strong public sector strategy would have clear rules and
                   standards for public procurement and activities to establish public buildings as
                   role models. More generally, capacity and awareness building initiatives can
                   ensure that the market for EE products and services develops with credibility
14
                   and integrity. Certification programs would provide assurance to consumers
                   and build their confidence in EE investment. These programs should include
                   manufacturers of EE equipment and appliances, as well as service providers
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   and equipment installers.

                   Information and reporting
                   Developing a new EE policy is the first step toward energy savings and improved
                   social welfare. To encourage continued investment, governments will need to pro-
                   vide evidence of the national economic benefits from existing policies and raise the
                   profile of EE in the country as a whole.
                       Reliable and robust measuring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) systems and
                   program evaluation help ensure that EE policy goals are met. The data collected
                   through the MRV systems can also communicate the effectiveness of current ini-
                   tiatives. A standardized data gathering methodology, including metrics like cost-ef-
                   fectiveness, is crucial. Baselines must be set for energy consumption and efficien-
                   cy against which to measure outcomes of interventions; whether site-specific or
                   sector-wide. The existing data gathering and reporting systems in many MENA
                   countries are likely to benefit from internationally used systems such as the In-
                   ternational Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), which
                   can be adapted to specific country situations.
                       Another crucial piece of the enabling environment is timely and accurate provi-
                   sion of information to consumers. This can include periodic real-time information
                   on energy costs, and possible steps to reduce it. Metering systems are highly reali-
                   able, and have been effective internationally at gathering information on energy
                   use and monitoring energy savings.
                       Countries relatively advanced in their EE efforts can benefit from introducing
                   more-targeted programs aimed at well-defined sets of energy consumers to stimu-
                   late demand for EE services. This would help to build the environment needed to
                   sustain a functioning market that could be served by ESCOs and other dedicated
                   providers of efficiency services. The goal would be to create an EE market that
                   would gradually require less public support and eventually rely mainly on commer-
                   cial activity.
                       MENA countries at earlier stages of developing their approaches to EE may
                   find it effective to adopt relatively modest targets against which demonstrable gains
                   may be quickly made, with the aim of fostering the public support and stakeholder
                   buy-in needed to proceed with more ambitious activities. Countries with heavily
                   subsidized energy prices might wish to focus on attaining EE gains first in the
                   public sector and through regulatory means, while gradually introducing energy
                   subsidy reforms. These countries may also find it productive to launch national
                   campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of EE, and build public support
                   for lifting energy subsidies.
    Countries can carry out several of these steps on their own, but to be most
effective, some steps would benefit from concerted action, such as harmonization
of standards and labels for energy-consuming appliances and equipment. This ap-
proach would enhance the integration of markets and provide strong incentives to
improve the supply chains for more efficient equipment.
    Much can also be gained by continuing information exchanges on what has
worked, taking into account national circumstances, such as the balance of oil
trade and energy prices and subsidies. Policy and institutional frameworks that
scale up EE investments will develop, even as groundwork begins for gradually
addressing issues of energy pricing and subsidies, which link to broader socioeco-
nomic development policy.

Introduction

Background
Clients in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) created this project in re-
sponse to a longstanding and growing demand for support in improving energy
efficiency (EE). Reductions in energy intensity have lagged behind those in other
regions (World Bank and IEA 2015; Portale and de Wit 2014). From 2000 to 2012,
for instance, the energy intensity of lower-middle-income countries worldwide fell
by 2.5 percent a year, while the average intensity of MENA countries in the same
income bracket rose by 0.4 percent (Figure 1). Upper-middle-income countries
worldwide saw energy intensity fall by 0.5 percent a year over the period, while
those in MENA fell by only 0.1 percent. Among high-income countries, energy




                                                                                            Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
intensity fell across the globe at 1.6 percent a year, in contrast to its increase in the
MENA region of 0.9 percent.
    The potential for better performance, which would benefit both resource-rich
countries and those needing to import fuel, is therefore huge in all sectors across the
region. While the benefits of EE are widely recognized, the necessary investments
and changes are obstructed by persistent barriers—market imperfections, lack of
information and awareness, insufficient technical skill, and weak incentives. The
rationale supporting EE implementation is clear. The challenge is delivering it.
    The MENA region is, of course, not unique in its extensive potential to increase
EE, and the experience of other countries with similar ranges of energy intensity
and per capita energy use are worth exploring for ideas on scaling up EE invest-
ments (Figure 2). Even developed countries known for high levels of EE are con-
stantly finding new ways to improve their performance. The International Energy
Agency (IEA) estimates that better EE could reduce growth in the global primary
energy demand to 1.1 percent a year from 2012 to 2040, down from 1.9 percent
a year from 1980 to 2011 (IEA 2014a). An earlier similar scenario (IEA 2012)
showed that even significant policy efforts targeting energy savings could still leave
untapped four-fifths of the technical potential in the buildings sector and more
than half of the potential in industry.                                                     17
    Many such unused resources in developed countries already enjoy robust en-
abling (policy, regulatory and institutional) environments. Other studies confirm
countries’ efforts to confront this EE challenge: a survey of 85 countries showed
that more than 90 percent had national agencies responsible for EE, just under half
had national or sectoral targets for EE, and most had enabling environments and
established, dedicated EE institutions (WEC 2013).2 Nonetheless, much potential
for energy savings remains unrealized.
                       National energy efficiency action plans (NEEAPs) are being adopted or drafted.
                   Such initiatives have raised the efficiency of industrial processes, motor vehicles,
                   appliances, equipment, buildings, power plants and transmission and distribution
                   systems. Numerous activities supported by international financial institutions
                   (IFIs) and development organizations have had positive outcomes, but the scale
                   remains small, with approaches intermittent and piecemeal, often driven by the
                   most urgent national priorities rather than a long-term strategy.
                       Lessons are apparent from high- and middle-income countries in other regions
                   that have successfully delivered EE at scale. Exchanges among countries in the
18
                   MENA region on what has worked—taking into account national circumstances,
                   such as the balance of oil trade and energy prices and subsidies—have been effec-
                   tive. Policy and institutional frameworks required to scale up EE investments can
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   be reinforced, even as groundwork is laid for gradually addressing issues of energy
                   pricing and subsidies, which are intimately linked to broader socioeconomic de-
                   velopment policy.
                       The most recent effort by the Bank Group to inform a strategic approach was
                   the 2009 Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) report, Tap-
                   ping a Hidden Resource: Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa.
                   That report laid out the rationale for and benefits of EE, analyzed the linkages
                   between energy prices and EE, and explored at a conceptual level the institutional,
                   policy, and financial building blocks to harvest EE potential.
                       In recent years, the Bank Group has also supported MENA countries to pro-
                   duce national-level analyses addressing various aspects of EE. Other organizations
                   have generated much data and analysis—the Mediterranean Solar Plan, publications
                   by the Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE),
                   the Project on Energy Efficiency in the Construction Sector in the Mediterranean
                   (MED-ENEC 2013) and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for
                   Western Asia (UN ESCWA).
                       In addition, regional EE work, and global initiatives are also generating in-
                   formation of relevance to the MENA region. In particular, the Bank Group is
                   launching a survey of Readiness for Investment in Sustainable Energy (RISE), an
                   initiative patterned after the Doing Business survey of the International Finance
                   Corporation (IFC), to gauge the environment for private investment activity that
                   could contribute to attaining the goals of UN Sustainable Energy for All (World
                   Bank, 2014d).

                   The main objective of this report is to provide an intermediate step toward building
                   more energy-efficient economies in the region. The present study complements the
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   2009 ESMAP report by providing a quantitative basis for sectoral targeting and
                   focusing on delivery mechanisms. Taking advantage of the results of the RCREEE
                   and preliminary results of the RISE Survey, the report is able to assess the areas
                   where countries in MENA can gain most from the EE potential and build an en-
                   abling environment for enhancing EE. Finally, the report draws on lessons learned
                   on EE from other middle-income and high-income countries and brings in per-
                   spectives that can serve as beneficial for the MENA countries.
                       The report focuses primarily on the three most electricity intense end use
                   sectors: the industry, services, and residential sectors. For many countries in the
                   MENA region, electricity shortages—often connected to the cost and availability
                   of imported fuels—are key motivators for raising EE. Relieving these shortages re-
                   quires balancing more expensive supplies with demand from sectors most responsi-
                   ble for raising electricity use. While the RCREEE study examined energy use in all
                   sectors (including energy supply as well as the transport3 and agriculture end use
                   sectors), the delivery mechanisms for EE vary greatly, and given limited resources,
                   it was necessary to focus on a few priority sectors only. Improving efficiency in the
                   electricity supply sector is typically part of a national effort to reform the power
                   sector—an approach that differs fundamentally from that for end use consumption
                   sectors. While scenario results for the electricity sector appear for comparison in
                   this chapter, the analysis is focused on the three identified priority end use sectors.
                       The needs and circumstances of MENA countries vary greatly, and some ma-
                   terial presented in this regional report may be applicable to just a few countries,
                   while some are germane to all. It deserves mentioning, that a great deal of work on
                   EE has proceeded in past decades in some MENA countries, while in others efforts
                   began more recently.
Chapter 1 seeks to provide a quantitative basis for considering EE priorities. It
draws primarily on a set of scenarios prepared by the RCREEE (2014) that con-
sider prospects over the next 10 years for energy use by sector in 17 economies,4
as well as the technical potential for reducing energy demand through greater EE.
This analysis is concerned primarily with electricity end uses, which are particular-
ly urgent in MENA. Chapter 1 also presents the results of an initial application of
the RISE survey to MENA countries, with the intent to generate ideas that could
contribute to developing well-founded strategies for increasing EE in the three
identified priority end use sectors: industry, services, and residential.




Chapter 2 presents a comprehensive, integrated framework to support EE. Coun-
tries are best able to deliver EE at scale by taking a portfolio approach compris-
ing policies, institutions, information processes, technical capacity, and financing
issues. This chapter explores the variety of enablers that increase the possibility
of technical and financial activities to undertake efficiency investments. As other
studies have dealt with enabling conditions more broadly, this chapter focuses on

financing options for scaling up EE investment.



Chapter 3 draws on examples from other regions of how energy savings have al-
ready been delivered through mechanisms involving two classes of agents—energy
utilities and domestic finance institutions—whose participation is key to scaling up
EE. Drawing on a report by the Regulatory Assistance Project (Allen and Crossley
2014), this chapter presents detailed experiences from six countries.




Chapter 4 combines the information in the previous three chapters, and offers op-
tions for how to enhance EE in the MENA region. These options are considered
first within the integrated framework of the broader enabling environment for EE.
Although the key elements of the framework are common to all MENA economies,
the report recognizes that each country will need to develop its own roadmap that
considers its unique energy, economic, and market conditions. This chapter then
considers the potential for EE in the three identified priority end use sectors and
                                                                                        21

sures to stimulate discussion among stakeholders.

Energy use and the potential for 
energy savings in MENA
MENA has abundant energy resources that account for 52 percent of the world’s
proven oil reserves and 47 percent of proven natural gas resources (BP 2015). The
region also has substantial renewable energy resources, especially solar, although
differences among countries’ resource endowments are considerable. The relative
abundance of fossil energy in some countries has resulted in widespread neglect of




                                                                                          Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
EE and renewable energy.
    With many countries in the region growing rapidly, demand for energy is cer-
tain to rise, and better management and efficient use of energy resources will be
necessary to sustain growth. As part of this study, the Regional Center for Renew-
able Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE 2014) assessed the outlook for energy
consumption in the MENA region through 2025 and the potential for saving en-
ergy through greater EE. The RCREEE prepared scenarios and estimates drawing
on the latest available data and publicly accessible studies, a simple econometric
model and business-as-usual assumptions. (See appendix 1 for a summary of data
and methods, which are explained in detail in RCREEE 2014).5
    The scenarios benefited from review and guidance by an advisory group with
members drawn from MENA countries. Data and results were checked extensively
with experts in the region. Two workshops were held in September 2014, one in
Beirut and one in Marseille, during which stakeholders were invited to comment
on the draft scenarios, and a workshop was held in Tunis in March 2015 to seek
additional input on the report as whole. RCREEE’s second detailed examination
of EE developments in the MENA region, Arab Future Energy Index (AFEX) 2015,
provided additional information reflected in this chapter (RCREEE 2015).
    This chapter provides a synopsis of the assessment undertaken by the RCREEE           23
(2014) and identifies the three end use sectors (industrial, residential, and services/
tertiary6) for developing enabling environments and implementing programs to re-
alize the potential for energy savings.
                          Trends in energy supply and demand

                          Energy supply
                          Use of all primary energy sources grew between 2000 and 2012. Total primary en-
                          ergy supply7 in the MENA region in 2011 amounted to about 580 million tons of
                          oil equivalent (Mtoe), an increase of more than two-thirds from about 350 Mtoe in
                          2000 (figure 1.1). At the beginning and end of the period, oil accounted for roughly
                          half of region-wide primary energy use.
                              The use of natural gas surged over the same period, growing in volume by over
24
                          90 percent, and its share in primary energy increased from 41 percent in 2000 to
                          47 percent in 2011. For comparison, from 2000 to 2011, oil use rose by somewhat
WORLD BANK GROUP




                          less than 60 percent, while its share in primary energy fell from 54 percent to 50
                          percent. These trends will likely continue, with both fuels continuing to provide the
                          great majority of the region’s energy needs, and the relative share of gas gradually
                          rising.
                              Total electricity generation in the region rose from 428 terawatt-hours (TWh)
                          in 2000 to 925 TWh in 2012. About 59 percent of electricity in the MENA region
                          comes from natural gas and 40 percent from crude oil and oil products. Less than
                          0.2 percent came from renewable energy sources in 2012 (RCREEE 2014).8

Energy consumption

Total energy consumption in all sectors came to just above 400 Mtoe in 2012. This
is a steep rise from less than 220 Mtoe in 2000. In 2000 industry accounted for the
largest share, just ahead of transport (figure 1.2). However, by 2011 that order had
reversed as transport edged slightly higher. Over the same period, the share of final
energy use from the residential sector also edged up slightly, and the share of the
services sector use doubled. The largest change in structure was a substantial drop
in the share of non-energy use, such as fossil fuel for petrochemical feedstocks.
    The region’s final energy consumption in 2020 is predicted to grow to more
than 620 Mtoe, an almost 60 percent increase over 2011, with a minimal change
in sectoral shares, as all economic sectors are likely to expand. Total electricity
generation will likely rise by about three-fourths to more than 1,500 TWh in 2020.
    In 2025, projected final energy consumption will be just above 860 Mtoe, a
120 percent increase since 2011. Electricity generation will likely grow even more,
by nearly 140 percent over the same period, typical as countries industrialize and
become wealthier. The sectoral distribution of energy consumption is likely to be
very similar to its quantity in 2020 (see figure 1.2).

                       In the recent past and in projections, three countries clearly dominate the re-
                   gional energy picture: Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt (figure 1.3). These ac-
                   counted in 2011 for 32 percent, 12 percent, and 16 percent of energy use, respec-
                   tively. By 2025, these shares will be approximately 33 percent, 17 percent, and
                   13 percent. The UAE is one of the fastest-growing countries in the region, with
                   consumption more than tripling from 2011 to 2025. Oman will probably grow at a
                   similar rate, and Qatar even faster, quadrupling during the same time.

                   Projected energy savings

                   Regional
                       The technical potential for avoided energy consumption through greater de-
                   ployment of available EE technologies and measures in MENA countries was es-
                   timated in a static analysis in the base year, which for most countries was 2012.9
                   On this basis, projections of energy savings were prepared for 2020 based on a
                   simple extrapolation, assuming no change in availability or performance of effi-
                   ciency technologies. Although this is, in one sense, a conservative assumption, in
                   fact it mimics the deployment over an eight-year period of currently available tech-
                   nologies. Given the widely varying lifetimes of energy-using equipment in different
                   applications and sectors, this is a reasonable central assumption. For 2025, tech-
                   nical potential for energy savings was estimated by extrapolating from the 2020
                   estimates, but introducing adjustment factors to account for new EE targets and
                   the NEEAPs adopted in 12 out of the 16 countries analyzed.
                       The potential for savings from EE in 2020 will be about 22 percent of projected
                   total primary energy supply and about 21 percent in 2025—the drop resulting from
the growing share of primary fossil energy converted to electricity.10 The estimates
include potential energy savings in the electricity supply sector (generation, trans-
mission, and distribution), which accounts for more than one-quarter of the total,
and in end-use sectors, which account for most potential savings region-wide (ta-
ble 1.1). The purpose of this analysis is to provide a starting point for evaluating the
relative size of savings among sectors. However, a deeper analysis of the technical
potential for energy savings may produce somewhat different results.

consumption.



In the region as a whole, nearly three-quarters of the potential for energy savings
from greater efficiency—219 of 300 Mtoe in 2025—is in end-use sectors. Among
end-use sectors, the industry sector offers the largest scope for energy savings over
the projection period, contributing just over one-fifth of the total. The residential
sector is next largest, followed by the transport sector and then commercial and
public services sector and finally the agriculture sector. The share of the industry
sector shrinks slightly over time as the potential for energy savings rises faster in
the electricity supply sector.
    The electricity supply sector—generation, transmission, and distribution—holds
the largest potential for energy savings among these sectors (table 1.1). Total elec-
tricity generation in MENA countries in 2025 will likely be just above 2,000 TWh,
up from 925 TWh in 2012. The potential for savings through EE in the electricity
supply sector is about 46 percent of total generation, or nearly 82 Mtoe in fuel
savings. About 85 percent of that vast potential for savings could come from better
power generation technologies, with the remainder from improvements in trans-
mission and distribution systems.
    For many countries, the electricity supply sector has been the first target for EE                             27
investments, often in the course of reforming state-owned power sectors. Many
MENA countries will address efficiency opportunities in this sector as a matter of
course. Therefore, as earlier noted, this sector is not a focus of this report, which
is concerned mainly with end-use sectors, where delivering efficiency has proven
repeatedly to be much more challenging.
                   National
                   The potential for energy savings varies widely among MENA countries (table 1.2),
                   due in large part to significant differences in economic structure, relative wealth,
                   size, technological capacity and resource endowment. The highest potential in ab-
                   solute terms for EE is in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt, which have the largest
                   economies in the region. Relative to their total primary energy supply, Bahrain
                   and Qatar, which have strong and relatively efficient economies, as well as Tunisia,
                   which has already undertaken substantial EE programs, will probably gain corre-
                   spondingly less from EE than other countries in the region.
28                     Only a few countries in the MENA region have so far made sustained and well-re-
                   sourced efforts to improve the efficiency of energy consumption. For the other coun-

                   tries, taking advantage of the potential energy savings will require strong commit-
                   ment, considerable investment, robust program planning, tenacious implementation
                   and effective monitoring and verification systems. Incentives to deploy efficiency
                   measures go hand-in-hand with reforms to make energy prices more cost-reflective.

    In Saudi Arabia, which is by far the largest energy consumer and thus has the
greatest potential savings, the electricity supply sector can deliver over a quarter of
potential energy savings in 2025, mainly through raising the efficiency of power gen-
eration by switching from oil to gas. Reducing transmission and distribution losses
would contribute only about one-tenth as much in energy savings. The residential
sector could supply about one-fifth of energy savings, primarily through electricity
efficiency, and the transport sector a similar share, from greater fuel efficiency.
    This contrasts with the UAE, the second-largest contributor to potential regional
energy savings, where projected growth in industrial output means that a large share—
nearly 40 percent—of energy savings comes from that sector. Industrial activity is large
in proportion to population, accounting for more than two-thirds of energy use. The
UAE has a thriving services sector that will continue growing, accounting for the sec-
ond-largest share of savings potential, 18 percent.                                                                                                    29
    Egypt, with the third-largest energy savings potential and the largest population
in the MENA region, is facing a different growth trajectory than the energy-export-
ing Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The industry sector, already the
country’s biggest energy user, would contribute over one-quarter of total savings.
The services sector now consumes slightly more than half the amount of energy
than the industry sector does—but its consumption is projected to double over time,
while industry’s consumption will increase by about half of its present amount.
                       With so many options for the electricity-intensive services sector, its contri-
                   bution to savings would be similar to the industry sector. The size and growth
                   prospects of the residential sector mean that it would also contribute substantially
                   to savings. The roles of the transport and electricity supply sectors are correspond-
                   ingly smaller than in other MENA countries.
                       The effect of the economic structure on efficiency potential is particularly ap-
                   parent in West Bank and Gaza. With very little industry and commerce, over 60
                   percent of the efficiency potential is in the residential sector, and most of the rest
                   is in transport.

                   Governments should also consider some other factors when setting priorities:
                       The industrial sector generally pays higher prices for energy than other sectors.
                   It would benefit from targeted policies to improve EE and productivity. Energy-in-

                   tensive industries also generally have the financial and human resources to adopt
                   EE measures.
                       The residential sector typically presents a significant opportunity for energy
                   savings, but customers have the least incentive given the subsidized price of en-
                   ergy in MENA countries. How to create incentives for improving EE? Alongside
                   longer-term efforts to address energy pricing, programs with near-term results
                   are important, such as introducing efficient lights and appliances through market
                   transformation programs, and public support for the purchase of efficient devices
                   and the disposal of obsolete equipment. Introducing and enforcing such standards
                   can be challenging in their own right, and require time and resources to stimulate
                   customer awareness.
                       A segment of the services sector, commercial services (i.e. excluding transport,
                   which is sometimes rolled into accounts of services), often cross-subsidizes resi-
                   dential customers and for this reason has an incentive to reduce energy use. Com-
                   mercial services can be targeted through building codes and regulations to improve
                   the efficiency of its energy use. Program effectiveness will depend, however, on the
                   enforcement of regulations and on price incentives for customers to improve their
                   efficiency.
                       Another segment is state- and municipal-owned facilities, which contain siz-
                   able potential for EE, but they have the smallest financial incentive to undertake
                   relevant measures. Much like the energy generation sector, governments would
                   also benefit from improving efficiency in public-sector facilities such as schools,
                   hospitals, water pumping, street lighting and so on.




                   Recent progress in energy efficiency
                   Most MENA countries have taken significant steps to improve the environment for
                   EE. Table 1.4 captures the most significant national developments, based on the
                   most recent region-wide survey of EE policy activity (RCREEE 2015). In recent
                   years, six countries have adopted NEEAPs or equivalent comprehensive national
                   plans to address EE, bringing the total to 12. Most of the 16 countries in the table
                   have achieved significant accomplishments in advancing sectoral regulations and
                   measures.

    As a step toward the inclusion of MENA countries in the global RISE survey
mentioned in the Introduction, a number of the survey’s EE indicators were ap-
plied to the 16 countries analyzed in this report. When the full analysis is com-
pleted, it will be possible to consider the accomplishments of MENA countries in
comparison to more than 90 other countries. This report has information on about
one-third of the detailed sub-indicators that will be in the full RISE report.
    Moreover, the RISE survey measures only the presence of factors, generally un-
der the control of policy makers, which have been shown to be effective in many
countries in enabling investments in EE. It is not possible to measure in any way,
that is comparable across countries, the relative effectiveness of a given factor. The
RISE survey is a snapshot of conditions prevailing in 2015. The survey is designed
to be undertaken biannually, with its full value emerging over time as it tracks trends
in indicators. Below we review some of the key features that the first phase of the
survey illuminates.
    At the broadest level, most MENA countries already have in place national tar-
gets and/or plans for EE, and most also have specialized agencies authorized to
carry them out (Figure 1.4.a). These are fundamental “infrastructure”, but are by no
means sufficient for carrying forward successful EE initiatives.
    A fundamental basis for EE is information about energy consumption. Without
knowing whether one is consuming more or less, there is no incentive to conserve.
Electric utilities in all countries in the region already provide such information to
consumers, though with variation in means of communication, periodicity, and other
details (Figure 1.4.b). Only about half of the countries, though, have utilities that also
provide information on energy-saving opportunities to customers

    Governments have the most direct impact in creating markets for EE investment
in the arena of public services—for example, government buildings, street lighting,
and water supply. Mandates on public entities to implement EE are thus important,
and a range of adoption is evident across MENA countries (Figure 1.4c). All 16
countries allow local administrations to enter into multi-year contracts (a funda-
mental condition for ESCOs to function). A majority also have EE-specific policies
in place, including obligations for public buildings to save energy and, more rarely,
obligations for public services to save energy, or procurement rules mandating the
purchase of EE equipment. Only Qatar and Tunisia have the full range of such mea-
sures in place.
    Large energy consumers, mainly industrial facilities, are key influences on EE
in most countries, and so it is particularly important to gauge the conditions in this
sector. Nearly half of the countries in MENA have enacted mandates of some sort
on this class of consumer (Figure 1.4.d). Six countries have also enacted incentives
and/or other measures to stimulate uptake of efficiency.
    Energy performance standards and labels are a proven, cost-effective way to in-
troduce efficiency for energy-using appliances, equipment and vehicles. Enforceable
penalties for non-compliance increases their effectiveness. About two-thirds of the
surveyed countries have adopted at least some of these (Figure 1.4.e).                       33
    Energy use in buildings is expected to be a key driver of future energy demand in
the MENA countries, so building energy codes is crucial. Adoption of such codes is
about as widespread as EE standards and labels (Figure 1.4.f). The scores on this in-
dicator are relatively high, which is encouraging, as setting and implementing energy
codes for buildings is much more difficult than for discrete devices, and the prospec-
tive growth in energy demand from buildings is very large. Enforcement will be the
key to benefiting from the promise of energy savings that building energy codes offer.

                   Energy prices and subsidies
                   Many MENA countries have price controls and subsidies that result in retail ener-
                   gy prices that do not reflect the full cost of supply. While such policies can achieve
                   important socioeconomic development goals, there are numerous unwanted ef-
                   fects (box 1.1; World Bank, 2014b). Fully and even partly cost-reflective energy
                   prices provide important incentives for adopting EE measures. Thus, reducing en-
                   ergy subsidies and other measures confronting consumers with more cost-reflec-
                   tive prices are typically central elements in national strategies to encourage greater
                   efficiency.
36                     Recent developments in oil prices present a challenge to MENA countries to
                   maintain a commitment to greater EE, both to those that depend on oil import

                   revenues, and those that are net importers and consequently face less immediate
                   pressure from oil import bills (box 1.1).

                   Box 1.1. Energy subsidies: hidden costs

                    The MENA region has 5.5 percent of the world’s population, 3.3 percent of the world’s
                    GDP—and just under 50 percent of the world’s energy subsidies. The well-known
                    negative impacts of energy subsides are felt even more acutely throughout the MENA
                    region than in other parts of the world and have been correlated with, among other
                    events, slow economic growth.

                    Energy subsidies crowd out public spending on health, education, and overall
                    investment. Egypt, for example, spends seven times more on fuel subsidies than it
                    does on health.

                    Below-cost retail prices also encourage higher levels of energy consumption. This can
                    contribute to a variety of negative results that range from unemployment, air pollution,
                    and water depletion to an increase in road accidents caused by traffic congestion. In
                    some circumstances, these results can exacerbate socioeconomic instabilities.

                       Phasing out energy subsidies, although necessary, must be done gradually and
                   carefully, respecting social norms. Unintended impacts on vulnerable populations
                   and sectors will have to be mitigated (World Bank 2014c). In any case, energy price
                   reform is by no means the only way to encourage EE (Schwanitz and others 2014).
                   It is just one necessary measure among many (discussed further in chapter 2).
                       To a certain extent, regulatory and administrative steps—such as enforcement of
                   energy performance standards for appliances, equipment and vehicles—can deliver
                   EE in the absence of price reforms. But without progress in achieving cost-reflec-
                   tive prices, much of the technical potential for EE will remain financially unat-
                   tractive and out of the reach of both public and private stakeholders.
                       The International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2014) estimates that energy subsi-
                   dies in MENA countries amounted to 8.6 percent of regional GDP, more than in
                   any other region, and accounted for about 48 percent of global energy subsidies
                   in 2011. About half the subsidies are for oil products, the rest for electricity and
                   natural gas.
                       As expected, energy-exporting countries subsidize energy more than non-ex-
                   porting countries, but the IMF estimates that energy subsidies are greater than 5
                   percent of GDP in two-thirds of MENA countries, varying from less than 1 percent
                   in Morocco to more than 11 percent in Iraq. ESMAP (2009) estimates that average
energy subsidies in MENA exceeded 20 percent of government spending in 2006,
ranging from 4 percent in Qatar and Morocco to about 40 percent in Syria and
Libya. RCREEE (2014) found that electricity prices in Kuwait have not changed
since 1966 and customers pay about 5 percent of the cost of producing electricity.
    While subsidies are distortive in all countries, they are particularly damaging
to net energy importers such as Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia.
RCREEE (2015) reports that energy subsidies in Egypt were about $16 billion in
2012, accounting for more than 20 percent of the budget.
    Many countries in the MENA regions have embarked on subsidy reforms, in-
cluding Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Yemen. All of the reforms so
far have had some good foundational elements, but not all have received the same
attention in implementation. Most have lacked strong communication campaigns,
resulting in lower levels of acceptance than could have been fostered. Some pro-
grams have lacked mitigation mechanisms to support the poor and vulnerable.
Because of these and other factors, energy subsidy reforms are advancing in some
MENA countries but losing ground in others. The current global oil price environ-
ment may offer an opportunity in some countries for proceeding with energy price
reforms (box 1.2).



Box 1.2. Lower oil prices: an opportunity to strengthen price signals

 Following four years of relative stability at around USD 105 per barrel, oil prices have
 declined sharply since June 2014 and will likely remain low for a long time. The recent




                                                                                               Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
 plunge in oil prices has been driven by (i) several years of surprisingly rapid growth in
 unconventional oil output, (ii) weakening global demand for oil, (iii) a significant shift
 in OPEC policy, (iv) reduction of some geopolitical risks (alongside the emergence of
 others), and (v) an appreciation of the US dollar.

 The decline in oil prices will lead to significant real income shifts from oil exporters to
 oil importers. While the positive impact for oil importers could be more diffuse and
 take some time to materialize, the negative impact on exporters is immediate, and in
 some cases exacerbated by financial market pressures.

 Although the loss in oil revenues will strain public finances for exporters, lower oil
 prices offer an opportunity to implement structural reforms. For net oil importers
 especially, the lower prices offer a window for reforming fuel and electricity prices in
 the region with lower adverse fiscal impacts than in other scenarios. Fiscal resources
 released by lower fuel subsidies could be used to rebuild fiscal space or reallocated
 toward other programs.

 The low-price environment also offers time in which to organize public education
 campaigns to raise awareness, and to put in place social protection mechanisms to
 support sensitive populations when market prices eventually rise and, as a result of
 subsidy and tariff reforms, are passed on to energy consumers. It also provides time to       37
 add energy efficiency measures to ensure that consumers pay lower bills in the future.

                       According to RCREEE (2015), estimating subsidies related only to electricity is
                   difficult given the lack of both reliable data and transparency in reporting systems.
                   Since West Bank and Gaza is the only economy in the region with market-based
                   prices and consequently has the highest electricity prices, the RCREEE report uses
                   electricity prices in West Bank and Gaza as a benchmark to estimate the implied
                   subsidy in other economies. The implied electricity price subsidies for the resi-

                   For customers in the commercial sector, electricity price subsidies range from 12
                   percent in Jordan to 96 percent in Kuwait (figure 1.6), and in the industrial sector

                   from 34 percent in the UAE to 98 percent in Kuwait (figure 1.7). (Outliers are Jor-
                   dan and Morocco, where prices are subsidized by only 2 percent and -4 percent,
                   respectively, relative to West Bank and Gaza). In Egypt, it is estimated that electric-

                   ity used by the residential sector is heavily subsidized, resulting in a cost recovery
                   ratio of 31 percent.
                       Gradually phasing out subsidies is critical not only to motivate customers to
                   undertake EE initiatives, but also to reduce the burden of subsidies on govern-
                   ment budgets and reduce energy imports. Some MENA countries have progressed
                   recently. Egypt, for instance, has embarked on a five-year plan to phase out elec-
                   tricity subsidies and plans to increase tariffs annually until 2018 and completely
                   phase out subsidies by 2019. Jordan also embarked on a five-year agenda to reform
                   electricity prices in 2013 and plans to increase rates annually until 2017. Tunisia,
                   too, introduced an electricity reform plan in 2014 and has periodically revised rates
                   upward.

                   Summary
                   To realize the enormous potential for EE in MENA countries by 2020 and 2025
                   current policies need to be well implemented. A comprehensive analysis, which
                   optimizes the uses of renewable energy alongside energy savings initiatives, would
                   be very useful, although the development of more targeted policies will require
                   further data, measured over a longer timeline.
                       The results of the analysis in this chapter indicate the increasing need for
                   MENA countries to develop mechanisms for financing (often through domestic fi-
                   nancial institutions) and delivery (through utilities). The delivery mechanisms must
40                 reflect the requirements of different sectors and be implemented on a wide scale.
                   The mechanisms must also operate within an integrated framework, grounded in a

                   strong regulatory and institutional environment, and supported by relevant financ-
                   ing mechanisms. Finally, the successful delivery of EE must include capacity- and
                   awareness-building initiatives and an effective information infrastructure.
              2
Strengthening the enabling 
environment for energy efficiency
MENA countries face rising energy demand as their economies grow. The region is
projected to require more than 3 percent of GDP for investing in energy infrastruc-
ture by 2030, compared with about 1 percent in most other countries (Hormann
and others 2012). Some Gulf states are facing shortages during peak periods, and
the gap between supply and demand is growing. Increased adoption of EE mea-
sures in the MENA region could reduce energy demand by a quarter to a half in
2030, which would greatly reduce the need for energy resources to meet domestic
demand.
    Wide implementation of EE in MENA energy markets—with diverse market
dynamics and policy frameworks—will not be easy. But many countries have faced




                                                                                             Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
similar hurdles in their quest for EE, and there are lessons to draw from their expe-
riences. While it is unlikely MENA countries will be able to address all the barriers
to EE, they must take steps that help move their economies toward lowering the
intensity of energy use in sectors with the greatest potential, and assist stakeholders
in institutionalizing EE.
    Achieving EE goals is not easy, and countries are best able to succeed at scale
when they take a portfolio approach, establishing a robust environment that mit-
igates barriers and allows organizations involved in delivery to find efficient busi-
ness models. There is no one “best” enabling environment or list of essential condi-
tions. These vary over time and by country, sector and delivery mechanism. More
than one feasible approach may exist in any given situation. Even so, a variety of
enablers makes it more likely that the technical and financial activities to under-
take efficiency investments will take place, even if the details vary.
    The five main categories of a good enabling environment for energy efficiency are
    >	 Policies, planning, and regulation.

    >	 Agencies and institutions.

    >	 Information and communication.
                                                                                             41
    >	 Technical capacity.

    >	 Financing and incentives.

    Figure 2.1 gives examples of the possible elements in each category. Not all are
necessary in all situations or in a given country. It is perfectly possible, for instance,
to pursue EE without an EE law—but in many countries such a law makes it much
easier to deliver EE.

                   Countries need to develop viable business models that meet the objectives of stake-
                   holders. For instance, households facing subsidized energy prices may not be moti-
                   vated to purchase relatively expensive EE appliances, but commercial and industri-
                   al consumers that cross-subsidize residential consumers and pay higher tariffs may
                   be motivated to undertake EE measures to reduce production costs. This poses a
                   challenge for utilities that would like to increase sales to higher-paying customers
                   and reduce sales to subsidized consumers. Governments, which bear the burden of
                   energy subsidies, may wish to replace funding subsidies with funding EE for subsi-
                   dized consumers. Balancing these competing and at times conflicting objectives of
                   stakeholders will be a major challenge.
                       Customer financing of EE hinges on rational energy prices, which motivates
                   customers to adopt cost-effective EE measures, but subsidized energy, as in many
                   MENA countries, blurs that motivation. In the context of the challenges faced by
                   MENA countries in monetizing the benefits of EE, reliance on customer-initiated
                   implementation of EE is less likely to deliver desired results given distortive energy
                   price subsidies. EE programs spearheaded by state agencies and utilities are likely
                   to provide more benefits than other (private) approaches in the near to medium
                   term. As countries reform their energy markets, the interests of stakeholders will be
                   better aligned, and the motivation to implement EE could shift to end users.
                       Such a robust framework will require substantial planning and resources—and
                   more critically, political willingness to set targets and implement EE programs. The
                   key elements of the framework would be common to all MENA economies, but
                   each country will have to develop its own roadmap suited to its market conditions,
                   as are their national EE action plans.
Enabling framework
Studies examining the implementation of EE in multiple countries consistently
identify the need for an enabling framework. IEA (2014b) notes that policies and
prices drive the EE market. In the absence of policies, ad hoc EE based on a
plethora of stakeholder preferences is not a reliable way to achieve national goals.
While rational energy pricing is critical to motivate stakeholders to adopt EE, other
barriers such as the lack of knowledge, awareness, technology, expertise, financing,
and regulation also need to be surmounted (box 2.1).

Box 2.1. Regulators’ promotion of EE

 Coupled with clear policies, regulations are a principal mechanism to promote EE.
 Regulators in many countries, such as the United States, Brazil, India, South Africa,
 and Thailand, have mandated the implementation of EE by utilities, state EE agencies,
 and customers. They have also required utilities to treat EE as a resource to meet
 customer demand before they approve new generation capacity.

 Integrated resource planning requires utilities to consider cost-effective EE and
 DSM measures, helping create a market for EE services and spawning new private
 businesses to run EE projects, as with the energy savings scheme in New South Wales,
 Australia (chapter 3). Regulators oversee the performance of utilities and gather
 detailed information to approve the rate basis and tariffs chargeable to customers,
 giving them leverage and an opportunity to promote EE.

 Regulators can also promote building codes as well as standards for appliances. The




                                                                                          Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
 key challenge here is to guarentee that they are enforced and periodically revised and
 updated to ensure relevance and progressively improve efficiency of energy use in the
 marketplace. Regulations are effective when they are consistently applied and the
 regulatory process is transparent and provides certainty to stakeholders.

The Policy Framework
Formulating enabling policies is not an easy undertaking and requires strong po-
litical commitment and aligning varied stakeholders’ interests. Countries also must
consider competing factors to ensure the framework’s stability while periodically
revising it.11 Factors that could either positively or negatively affect the develop-
ment of enabling policies, include:

        Country characteristics. Many developing countries with small domestic en-
        ergy resources may seek greater energy security or lower energy bills. In con-
        trast, more developed economies may be motivated by environmental issues.
        Developed countries do not face the same economic or fiscal challenges of
        less developed economies.                                                         43


        Resource availability. Energy resource constraints or endowments, and
        country energy intensity, can affect motivation for EE. While MENA coun-
        tries with abundant energy resources may be motivated to implement EE
        and reduce energy intensity so they can export more resources, energy-poor
        countries are motivated by energy security and the need to reduce spending
        on fuel imports.
                         Political and administrative system. Centralized systems of government
                         generally are better at formulating national policies and have control over
                         implementation. Countries with devolved systems may have little control,
                         which can allow local administrations to experiment with approaches suit-
                         able to their particular circumstances.

                         Energy market structure—regulated or deregulated. Countries with deregu-
                         lated markets, such as many Organization for Economic Co-operation and
                         Development (OECD) countries, have to depend more on market-based
                         mechanisms and regulatory mechanisms, while many developing countries
44
                         with more regulated markets may be able to achieve EE goals through com-
                         pliance-driven mandatory regulations.
WORLD BANK GROUP




                         Private participation. Countries with private utilities may have to take a
                         different approach from those where most energy utilities are public and
                         perhaps vertically integrated.

                         Energy prices and subsidies. Energy prices are a key driver for EE policies
                         and regulations to be successful. In countries with subsidized energy prices,
                         there is little customer motivation to implement EE, and policies and regu-
                         lations may have to be developed to motivate and incentivize energy utilities
                         and other stakeholders to undertake EE.

                         EE potential and targets. The estimated potential for cost-effective EE in
                         different sectors of an economy, and the barriers to realizing this potential,
                         greatly influence policies and regulations. It is important to establish sec-
                         tor-specific energy demand and energy savings targets and to include incen-
                         tives (or penalties) for achieving targets (or not).

                         Cost-effectiveness of programs. The cost-benefit criteria for EE programs
                         influence EE policies and regulations. The cost-effectiveness of EE programs
                         is typically evaluated based on a utility’s avoided cost of adding capacity,
                         but with restructuring of the energy sector and deregulation, many utilities,
                         especially in the United States, are now using the market price for the cost
                         of purchased power as the basis for avoided-cost calculations (Barbose and
                         others 2009).

                         Consistency with other legislation and goals. EE policies should be consis-
                         tent with other laws and targets, including energy security goals and plans
                         to cut emissions.

                   Institutional framework
                   A robust enabling framework requires institutions or agencies with authority,12
                   good governance, and resources. One of the key aims of establishing a dedicated
                   institutional framework for EE is to get stakeholders to define the implementa-
                   tion mechanisms for delivering EE. A World Bank study of EE agencies in 27
                   countries categorized their structural, organizational, and functional elements into
                   seven models (ESMAP 2008). A subsequent report examined how the governance
                   of institutions affects EE implementation (Sarkar and Subbiah 2010). These stud-
                   ies showed that, regardless of the regulatory approach to energy markets and the
public or private nature of activity, EE delivery requires an institutional structure
with dedicated agencies (box 2.2). Weak institutions can defeat the best-designed
policies and regulations. For instance, an institutional structure that fails to coor-
dinate among all EE stakeholders cannot mobilize resources and build consensus.
    No single approach works across all countries. There seems to be a tendency for
state agencies to be set up under the authority of laws and regulations. State agen-
cies mandated to undertake or facilitate EE are better able to coordinate with other
government agencies, policy makers, and other stakeholders. State ownership also
allows the agencies and institutions to take a broader view of the EE markets based
on the country’s energy policy objectives, which is important for identifying appro-
priate interventions and directing resources effectively.


Box 2.2. Institutional structures for EE

 A dedicated agency for EE can help identify and develop EE programs for market
 sectors based either on the potential for EE or on other strategic interests. If there are
 multiple agencies responsible for EE, their areas of authority and relationship should
 be well understood and accepted. The agency can help forge relationships with other
 external stakeholders, such as equipment manufacturers, suppliers, and financial
 institutions, and with internal stakeholders, such as ministries and public and private
 agencies. Some MENA countries have established dedicated agencies responsible for
 coordinating EE, and indeed, agencies in countries such as Tunisia and Morocco have
 gained deep experience in this.

 OECD and non-OECD countries, found that most countries have established dedicated
 agencies to address implementation of EE. The agencies are set up at the national or
 regional level (or both) and are either public or public-private agencies (depending on
 the requirements of the marketplace). Establishing a dedicated agency, or multiple
 agencies, is critical to ensure that state-sponsored or -promoted programmatic EE-
 related activities are coordinated by an agency dedicated to achieving EE policy goals
 and targets. This is all the more critical in countries that are just embarking on wide
 implementation of EE and where markets have little experience with EE.
    The World Bank has long studied the institutional structure and importance of
 good governance of institutions to deliver EE (ESMAP 2008; Sarkar and Subbiah
 2011). These two reports provide compendia on country context, enabling framework,
 mission and objectives, goals and targets, key activity areas, funding mechanisms,
 management structure staff and budget, and lessons from the experiences of 29 EE
 agencies around the world. The studies conclude that multiple factors, some just
 discussed in the text, influence the selection of a suitable institutional framework, and
 that EE implementation and financing mechanisms may change as countries move
 toward competitive energy markets.
    Institutionalizing the widespread and scaled-up implementation of EE in a
 country is neither easy nor quickly achieved. The World Bank and others that have
 championed EE for a long time and have examined implementation frameworks                    45
 stress the need for a robust and balanced policy, institutional, and financial framework
 for implementing EE (Sarkar and Singh 2010). The studies found that aligning the
 interests of stakeholders and developing market-driven programs that leverage the
 strengths of public and private agencies are critical to implementing an EE strategy, as
 is demonstrating results in a short time frame.
                   Monitoring, reporting, and verifying
                   Reliable monitoring, reporting, and verifying systems are essential for meeting EE
                   policy goals. As many developing countries have weak systems, it may be best for
                   them to use internationally recognized systems such as the IPMVP, adapting them
                   as necessary. It is common for such countries to have independent third-party eval-
                   uation of EE programs. One of the first steps, however, is to put in place smart me-
                   tering systems to gather data on energy use and monitor energy savings. Once again,
                   energy utilities are well positioned to do this. Data from individual EE projects may
                   then be collated at program level by utilities or public-sector EE agencies to track
46                 progress toward EE targets. Utilities or EE agencies should also conduct customer
                   load surveys to understand energy consumption patterns over a day and seasonally.

                   Capacity building
                   Capacity building and training should be an integral part of an enabling frame-
                   work, and should target all principal stakeholders, including policy makers, EE
                   agencies, utilities, energy service companies (ESCOs), appliance manufacturers
                   and vendors, and financial institutions. The focus should be on building their long-
                   term capacity to ensure that they can undertake EE programs sustainably. Customer
                   awareness and education programs are equally important.



                   Financing mechanisms for EE programs
                   Financing is one of the main barriers to wide implementation of EE, especially in
                   developing countries with inadequate public funds and little access to commercial
                   financing. Yet regardless of economic and structural differences among countries,
                   multiple approaches that combine public and commercial financing, as well as
                   fiscal and economic incentives, are crucial. The financing mechanisms must be
                   further matched to the needs of end-use sectors—one appropriate for industry may
                   not work for the services or residential sectors.
                       The implementation mechanisms for deploying EE will also to an extent dic-
                   tate the financing mechanism best suited for an end-use sector—for instance, while
                   utility-driven EE programs can leverage the ability of utilities to finance programs
                   through the rate basis (which may increase rates for all or a segment of customers),
                   programs targeting low-income households may need a different approach. In the
                   long run, as markets mature, commercial financing options are critical to create a
                   sustainable market for EE services (figure 2.2). The advantages and disadvantages
                   of various financing mechanisms, public and commercial, are in table 2.1.

                   Public financing
                   Public financing was an early driver for EE programs and has stimulated demand
                   in many countries. It can involve direct investment subsidies from the government
                   budget, fiscal incentives (including tax and duty rebates), and other concessional
                   mechanisms.

                   Investment subsidies. Direct subsidies generally aim at specific customer segments
                   and specific EE technologies or appliances and serve as a temporary measure to
                   stimulate demand or expand penetration in the marketplace. Subsidies may also be
48                 given to equipment manufacturers to lower the cost of production or to promote
                   research and development. They may be developed in conjunction with specialized

                   funds such as guarantee funds or revolving funds that seek to lower the cost of
                   financing.
                       The World Energy Council (WEC) (2013) notes that many OECD countries
                   introduced investment subsidies in the 1980s to help customers retrofit old equip-
                   ment and buildings. Subsidies were also provided to manufacturers of efficient
                   equipment. These early subsidy programs generally benefited large clients, failing to
                   promote investments among medium and small industries and households. Indeed,
                   large clients may not have needed subsidies anyway (i.e. receiving program benefits
                   without actually needing them in order to change behavior, or “free riding,” which
                   programs should be designed to forestall). But countries learned, revising the sub-
                   sidy programs to prevent abuse and to target customers needing them most.
                       Subsidies should be targeted in two ways: (1) to specific EE technologies, to
                   promote investments that can alter customer behavior (demand or energy use) and
                   bring cost-effective benefits to customers and utilities, and (2) to constrained cus-
                   tomer segments that need the subsidies the most. Subsidies should also be tempo-
                   rary, initially promoting customer or manufacturer investments in EE and lowering
                   the cost of EE technologies in the long run, and then being phased out.

                   Fiscal incentives. These seek to reduce the cost of financing EE programs through,
                   for example, tax rebates on EE equipment, import duty concessions, tax holidays,
                   tax credits for households, and accelerated depreciation for commercial and in-
                   dustrial customers on EE appliance purchases. Such incentives lower the cost of
                   investing in EE and improve the rate of return.
                       Many countries provide import duty or sales tax concessions for buying EE ap-
                   pliances such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), which used to be very expen-
                   sive (WEC 2013). Tax rebates and credits for such purchases are widely used in
                   developed and developing countries. Fiscal incentives typically cost less than direct
                   subsidies and are less subject to abuse, but require robust tax collection systems. Em-
                   pirical evidence of the fiscal impacts of such programs is sparse, but suggests positive
                   outcomes. A study of public funding for wall insulation retrofits in the UK found
                   evidence of strong net benefits to government finances (Rosenow and others 2014).

                   EE funds, concessional loans, lines of credit, revolving funds and risk mitigation
                   products. In many developing countries, commercial financial markets are less de-
                   veloped and financing is scarce or expensive. To overcome this hurdle, customers
                   could obtain favorable loans to promote investments in EE. Concessions could
                   lower the interest rates or offer longer loan-repayment periods and make low-
                   er-cost financing available to customers. Customers would, however, still have to
                   meet the due diligence requirements of the financial institutions.
    Commercial financial markets in developing countries often lack capital, and
banks prefer to lend on large projects and against collateral requirements too
onerous for many small customers. Concessions could thus also be targeted at the
commercial banks to incentivize them to make financing available for smaller proj-
ects—typical of EE projects—and lower their risk of default. Lower-cost credit lines,
first-loss facilities, and dedicated EE funds can help reduce the cost of financing
for commercial banks.
    The benefit of shifting the subsidy or incentive scheme from the customer to
commercial banks is that it leverages the strength of financial institutions that can
conduct due diligence, and can appraise projects and customers’ eligibility for fi-
nancing, lowering the potential for default. In the longer run, it is desirable to
strengthen and incentivize financial players to support investments in EE. But as
with all incentives and subsidies, programs should be designed with a clear exit so
banks do not just depend on concessions to extend financing for EE (which can
distort financial markets), but develop a portfolio of EE projects on their own as
they gain experience.
    The World Bank/IFC, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) and
national agencies have developed financing instruments to support commercial
banks in financing EE through lines of credit, revolving funds, risk mitigation prod-
ucts, and other financial mechanisms.

ESCO financing
In many countries, ESCOs are integral to EE delivery, providing cost-effective
commercial EE programs more sustainably than is possible through subsidies or
concessional financing (which are more appropriate at earlier stages of building
markets). ESCOs make money through shared-savings or guaranteed-savings
contracts for projects financed in a variety of ways. An ESCO, for example, may
provide an energy savings guarantee that the customer may use as collateral to se-
cure a commercial project loan. The energy savings guarantee agreement from the
ESCO serves to demonstrate to the bank that project cash flow will be sufficient to
cover debt repayment. The ESCO guarantee contract lowers the bank’s view of the
risk, and may even help in negotiating a lower interest rate.
    The earliest model of ESCO financing required the ESCO to borrow funds. This
approach lowers the financial risk to the customer since the debt resides on the ES-
COs balance sheet. Customers pay in accordance with the terms of the performance
contract and can benefit by treating payments as operational expenses, which may
have positive tax implications and not affect customers’ borrowing capacity. ESCOs
could finance projects from their own equity, but this would limit their ability to fi-
nance multiple projects simultaneously, confining the scale of their activities.          49
    ESCOs typically obtain financing from commercial banks and structure perfor-
mance contracts to ensure that they obtain an adequate return on their investment.
Financing through commercial banks can, however, be expensive, especially in de-
veloping countries where the markets have low liquidity and the cost of financing
is high. Even more challenging are short loans in many developing countries, where
typical repayment periods are three to five years, less than a performance contract.
So even if the return on investment in the EE project is high, commercial financing
                   may not be an option, especially where tariffs do not reflect costs. Another chal-
                   lenge in developing countries is that few commercial banks provide project finance
                   loans, where projected cash flow serves as collateral. Instead, banks usually require
                   fixed collateral for a large proportion of the loan amount, limiting the ESCO’s abil-
                   ity to finance multiple projects.
                       ESCOs in developing countries may thus need access to financing from other
                   sources, such as public funds, dedicated EE funds, IFIs, and donor agencies. Public
                   agencies and IFIs may support commercial banks through credit lines or revolving
                   funds and risk mitigation products, which help lower the cost of financing. Utilities
50
                   can also finance ESCOs. However, these are interim sources of financing that can
                   stimulate the demand for ESCOs and help stakeholders gain experience in the
                   ESCO model.

                       In the long term, sustainability of ESCOs typically requires that they seek fi-
                   nancing from commercial banks, which in turn assumes a high degree of liquidity
                   in commercial markets and a stable, predictable enabling environment.

                   The United States was one of the earliest countries to require utilities to implement
                   EE measures (Allen and Crossley 2014). Utilities in countries such as the United
                   States, Australia, Brazil, and South Africa have run EE programs with financing
from customers through, for example, a public benefit charge or otherwise in-
creased customer tariffs (see box 2.1). Such systems require tight regulations and
strict enforcement.
    Utility-driven EE programs are one of the best approaches in countries where
customers have low motivation to implement EE. Such programs can channel
incentives and rebates, leverage commercial financing and private sector partic-
ipation, and recover costs through customer billing systems. Public EE agencies
and utilities can leverage the strengths of ESCOs to ensure that only cost-effective
programs are funded based on guaranteed performance targets. In countries with
more developed financial markets, commercial financing and ratepayer-funded
programs, coupled with fiscal and economic incentives, may be a better approach
to financing EE.




Delivery mechanisms
The main issues in developing a country’s EE delivery mechanism include ener-
gy savings targets, the savings objective (peak load or energy, or both), resourc-
es needed, source of funding, customer sectors targeted, types of programs and
cost-effectiveness, incentives to be provided and program cost recovery.

Utility delivery of energy efficiency
Utilities are an obvious candidate to deliver long-term EE programs in the market-




                                                                                           Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
place given their role as energy providers, their technical knowledge and trained
human resources and their relationship with customers—the end-users of energy.
(Appendix 2 expands on these points.) Utilities, while keen on increasing revenues
through more sales, also are eager to lower the cost of supplying energy and to
reduce the need for investments in new generation, transmission and distribution
capacity. Wide implementation of EE provides that opportunity. In countries with
subsidized energy prices and a rapidly growing demand for energy, the motivation
for utilities to undertake EE would be stronger in saving both capacity and energy.
    Utility-driven programs can target large numbers of customers and help create
a market for EE, which in turn may spawn new business opportunities. Such pro-
grams are generally funded by ratepayers through a surcharge on utility bills. Because
regulated utilities are required to provide detailed data and reports on operational
performance and spending, there is a high level of transparency and reliability in the
spending and benefits of implementing EE programs. As most utilities in the MENA
region are state owned, the monetary benefits of EE also accrue to the state. Further
benefits include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved health and well-being
of populations, and wider energy access in resource-poor countries.
    Yet utility-driven EE programs will not sprout automatically: they require a poli-
cy, regulatory, and institutional framework and an energy-price tariff that reflects the
                                                                                           51
cost of supplying energy (IEA 2013b). Subsidized electricity prices in several MENA
countries are a challenge to customer uptake of EE. Without price reforms, innova-
tive financing mechanisms and incentives will have to motivate customers (box 2.3).
The utility stands to realize greater benefits, however, because EE will reduce the
implicit subsidy burden. The lack of customer motivation to invest in EE also ripples
through and can affect the availability of EE equipment in the marketplace.
                   Box 2.3. Reforming energy prices and subsidies in China

                    MENA countries greatly subsidize energy prices (see chapter 1), raising government
                    expenditures, encouraging wasteful energy use, and discouraging private EE
                    investment. IMF (2014) identified multiple barriers to subsidy reform, including
                    political unwillingness to redact subsidies, affordability of energy among poor
                    customers, and lack of information on the cost of subsidies to the economy.
                    Reducing subsidies can reallocate resources to other productive needs that help
                    the economy grow. Social safety nets can ensure that the poor do not face market-
                    based energy prices. The reform of energy subsidies is thus likely to have a net
52                  positive impact on the economies of MENA countries. IMF (2014) recommends that
                    countries consult stakeholders widely and draft a detailed roadmap, which includes

                    a comprehensive energy reform plan, a phased increase in prices, improved EE to
                    reduce the burden of subsidies, social safety nets for the energy and income poor,
                    independent price setting without political interference, and a clear communication
                    strategy.
                    China is well known for its success over the past three decades in improving EE
                    across sectors, allowing its economy to grow much more quickly than its overall
                    demand for energy. At the same time, the country has also gradually reformed its
                    planned energy pricing system, starting with a two-tiered approach in the 1980s
                    whereby a portion of coal was sold at market prices, while the remainder was sold
                    at regulated prices according to state-supervised contracts. The liberalization that
                    began with coal now covers oil products, such that prices for oil products now follow
                    international prices with mechanisms to limit the amplitude and rapidity of price
                    swings. A few exceptions remain, such as subsidies for fuel used in agricultural
                    activities, but motor fuel prices are relatively cost-reflective. Natural gas prices have
                    begun to change as well, in response to the need to pay for large new supplies of
                    more expensive domestic and imported gas. But electricity prices have proven much
                    more difficult to change, and they are one of the strongest remaining points of
                    direct government intervention in the economy.
                    Thanks to these changes, the IEA (2014e) estimates that overall energy subsidies fell
                    by nearly 40 percent just from 2011 to 2013.
                    There are limits, however, to the benefits of partial reforms of energy prices. In
                    China, government controls on coal prices began in the 1980s, and nearly all coal
                    now is sold at market-determined prices. At the same time, however, progress in
                    reforming tariffs of electricity, the great majority of which comes from coal-fired
                    power plants, has been very limited. Electricity prices remain highly controlled,
                    effectively forcing implicit subsidization of generators, many of which operate at
                    financial losses (Zhao and Ortolano, 2010). The resulting financial difficulties have
                    hindered investments by generators in EE projects that would otherwise have the
                    potential to lower their fuel costs and improve their financial position. While the
                    benefits of electricity price reform are many, there is strong reluctance to proceed
                    on a number of grounds, including perennial concerns about inflationary impacts
                    and compounding of the current financial difficulties of China’s struggling industrial
                    sector, the country’s biggest electricity user.
Business models
Business models (and implementing organizations) should reflect the country’s or
region’s macroeconomic conditions, energy market characteristics, and customer
income segments.
    Developing business models in developing countries can be especially challeng-
ing. As one study observed, “in developing countries, market information is scarce,
physical infrastructure such as roads are often poor, and legal frameworks and
enforcement mechanisms are unreliable. Furthermore, low-income customers in
these areas lack information, and service providers able to organize anything from
financial transactions to logistics may not exist. In short, the cost of doing business
in low-income markets is typically high. At the same time, low-income households
have a very limited budget for spending on energy, and find it difficult to make high
up-front investments due to the high cost of and limited access to credit” (Gradl
and Knobloch 2011).
    Of course, business models are inseparable from the organizations that employ
them to deliver efficiency to end-users. These organizations may be public-sector
agencies (as in most MENA countries) or private ESCOs. Building developers and
contractors are crucial to ensuring the success of energy standards, while oper-
ations and maintenance contractors are essential to ensuring that performance
meets design criteria. Manufacturers and suppliers of appliances, equipment, and
vehicles can also deliver more efficient devices to end users.
    Some of the other critical stakeholders include NGOs, the commercial finan-
cial institutions, and trade associations representing customers and equipment sup-




                                                                                          Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
pliers. These additional stakeholders can support customers and policy makers to
build capacity and awareness in the marketplace.




Implementation mechanisms for the three priority sectors:
industry, services, and residential
The EE implementation mechanisms must serve the three priority end-use sectors.

Industry
Energy prices here are generally not subsidized and customers are motivated
to reduce operational costs. Utilities and service providers such as ESCOs are
well-suited to undertake EE programs because industry needs specialized knowl-
edge, technical expertise, and trained personnel. Utilities, with their knowledge of
customer-demand patterns, can identify EE opportunities that benefit customers
and the utility. Public-sector EE agencies rarely have the expertise to undertake EE
in this sector, but can serve as facilitators and support implementing agencies in
accessing resources and incentives.
                                                                                          53
Services
Customers’ motivation for EE in this sector (comprising both commercial and
public services) depends on energy prices and their energy spending. Few prices
for commercial customers are subsidized, but energy bills may constitute only a
small portion of their operating costs. Public customers are also seldom motivat-
ed because their energy costs are part of fixed budgetary allocations. Long-term
improvements in the efficiency of buildings in the services sector—including pub-
                   lic and commercial buildings, schools and hospitals—often occur through building
                   codes and standards and through appliance performance standards, whether for
                   new or existing buildings.
                       Compliance with regulations accounts for an estimated two-fifths of EE mea-
                   sures in Europe, and three-fifths of countries surveyed globally (WEC 2008) have
                   established mandatory or voluntary new-building codes. In the short term, ESCOs
                   and utilities can undertake energy audits to identify retrofit options for reducing
                   energy use in buildings. Utilities and ESCOs are also well suited to undertake EE in
                   street lighting and public services such as water pumping, where end users general-
54
                   ly lack technical expertise and are not motivated to lower operational costs. Public
                   sector agencies can monitor compliance to ensure that EE program goals are met
                   and to undertake customer education programs.

                   Residential
                   This diverse sector, with multiple consumer preferences and motivations, is the
                   most challenging, especially in countries where energy prices are subsidized. Reg-
                   ulations could target the development of appliance labeling and performance stan-
                   dards. While labeling promotes voluntary actions, performance standards enforce
                   minimum efficiency standards. Regulations can also phase out inefficient equip-
                   ment such as incandescent lamps in the residential and other sectors. Utilities are
                   well suited to undertake lighting retrofits and weatherization programs (insulation
                   for facilities, for example) in the residential sector, given their relationship to the
                   customer and their ability to charge customers through utility bills. Public agencies
                   are well suited to monitor programs and to undertake customer awareness and
                   education programs, critical for implementing programs in the residential sector.

Global experience in financing and
delivering energy efficiency
As discussed in chapter 2, effective implementation of EE measures faces sever-
al hurdles, including lack of financing support (or its high cost), lack of scalable
implementation mechanisms, lack of enabling (policy, regulatory, and institutional)
environments, subsidized energy prices, market imperfections, and lack of consumer
awareness of benefits. Few of these constraints are unique to developing countries.
    This chapter focuses on a diverse range of countries for the first two encum-
brances, where domestic financial institutions (primarily commercial banks) and
utilities (energy providers) have played a large role in scaling up EE investments.




                                                                                         Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
MENA countries may be able to draw on this experience as they embark on their
own programs at scale.
    A broad range of mechanisms can finance EE—public financing through budget
allocations, dedicated EE funds or a customer charge to financial incentives such
as tax credits and rebates, investment subsidies, concessional loans, credit lines,
first-loss and risk mitigation and guarantee facilities, and commercial financing
from capital markets and consumer financing (see chapter 2).
    A wide mix of options can meet the specific requirements of different custom-
er segments that may have different motivations to implement EE. For instance,
large industrial consumers are knowledgeable about EE opportunities, pay higher
energy prices, and may be able to directly finance EE or finance projects through
commercial financial institutions. In contrast, small and medium industries may
not have enough income or free cash flow to commercially finance EE projects
and may require additional funding from elsewhere. Customers in the services
sector range from private consumers that own and operate commercial buildings
and hospitals to publicly owned facilities, schools, hospitals, and systems for street
lighting and water pumping. While private consumers may need financing similar
to that required by small and medium industries, public clients generally depend
entirely on budgetary allocations for EE investment. Residential customers seek          55
private and public financing depending on consumption level, energy prices, cost
of financing, and investments required.
    Utilities in the MENA region have considerable ability to support EE, as they
are largely state owned and are generally the only providers of energy to end users.
They are responsible for planning procurement of resources to meet customer en-
ergy demand for efficiently and cost-effectively meeting energy demand in markets
that subsidize energy prices. In MENA countries that import energy resources, util-
                   ities have the most interest in restraining energy demand to reduce the import of
                   expensive fuels, improve energy security and reduce subsidies. In MENA countries
                   that are resource-rich and subsidize energy prices, utility producers have an incen-
                   tive to reduce energy demand to free resources for more profitable exports. Utilities
                   are also aware of energy-demand patterns among the customers they serve. They
                   can also target EE improvements in energy production itself, a significant source
                   of energy savings.
                       Utilities can provide technical expertise and access to trained human resources
                   to plan and implement EE programs, to provide improved market surveillance and
56
                   capacity to enforce EE policies, and to use their revenues to make EE investments.
                   Globally, utilities have been important in improving the efficiency of energy use:
                   in 2011 utilities spent almost $12 billion on energy saving initiatives (IEA 2013a).

                   Commercial financial institutions
                   IEA (2014b) estimates that investment in EE markets worldwide in 2012 was $310
                   billion–$360 billion.13 New financing mechanisms and products are developing to
                   meet the demand of diverse energy markets, increasingly with the participation of
                   domestic finance institutions (mainly commercial banks) that have generally been
                   risk averse to financing EE. The IEA reports that this could in part be due to the
                   large amounts of public finance available for EE. Green investment banks capital-
                   ized with public funds are more able to leverage commercial funds from local and
                   global sources. IEA notes that “EE is a target sector for finance in [green invest-
                   ment banks] established in the United Kingdom, Malaysia, South Africa, Australia,
                   Japan, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.”14
                       But many perceive financing EE as risky due to uncertain policy and regulato-
                   ry frameworks, subsidized energy prices, high transaction costs, cost of monitor-
                   ing and verification, and the absence of project-specific cash flows, which hinders
                   project finance models for EE and moves the commercial banks toward greater
                   reliance on traditional collateral-based financing. The small size of EE projects
                   also hinders securitization of loans, a standard practice for commercial banks to
                   leverage additional funds and mitigate risks in capital markets.
                       EE projects most commonly have self-financing or commercial loans (IEA
                   2014a). Financing ranges from customer-financed projects to public loan programs,
                   which use tax revenues or other funds either to provide direct funds for projects
                   or to finance rebates and incentives. Loans encompass a variety of financing mod-
                   els, including direct customer loans, ESCO financing, utility on-bill financing, and
                   equipment leases or mortgages. A primary hurdle to commercial bank financing of
                   EE projects is their size, especially in the small and medium industrial and com-
                   mercial sector and in the residential sector, which entails high costs for project
                   due diligence and monitoring. Developmental banks in developing countries have
                   played an important role in financing EE: examples include Sri Lanka and Bangla-
                   desh, where public-sector development has taken the lead in developing financial
                   products for EE investment, usually aided by funds from MDBs that have provided
                   partial-risk loan guarantees, revolving funds, credit lines, and, somewhat different-
                   ly, ESCO financing.15

                   Partial-risk loan guarantee programs. Supported by MDBs, these can create a mar-
                   ket for financing EE by mitigating some of the risk perceived by local financial
institutions. However, the World Bank has found that loan guarantee programs work
only in countries with a functional banking system and liquidity in local financial
markets (Taylor and others 2008). Loan guarantee programs do not absolve cus-
tomers from meeting normal bank credit, due diligence and loan security require-
ments. Two successful EE loan guarantee programs are the Global Environment Fa-
cility (GEF)/IFC Hungary Energy Efficiency Co-Financing Program, and the China
ESCO Partial Loan Guarantee Program, both of which have been operational for
several years (box 3.1). The Hungarian program, launched in 1997, has catalyzed EE
lending through Hungarian commercial banks. The Chinese program, launched in
2003, has successfully backed ESCO EE investment projects. While the objectives of
the two programs are different, both have worked closely with local financial institu-
tions and supported them with capacity-building programs.

Revolving funds. The establishment of a dedicated revolving fund with conces-
sional terms such as low or blended interest rates and longer loan tenors to finance
EE has also been effective in countries with functional banking systems. Revolving
funds may be established with local financial institutions, such as the program
with IREDA (Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency—see box 3.1), or de-
veloped as a separate legal entity with accountable and transparent governance
structures. The Romanian Energy Efficiency Fund and the Bulgarian Energy Effi-
ciency Fund are two examples. Independent fund structures are a good option in
countries with weak local banking systems.
    Development banks are also commonly used to package and offer special loan
funds for EE projects. Often development banks have a mandate to promote proj-




                                                                                           Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
ects in the national interest and can pioneer financial products for EE, which com-
mercial banks can then replicate on a larger scale.

Lines of credit. These may target industrial projects, as with the World Bank–sup-
ported line of credit program for industrial EE and cogeneration in Tunisia, and
the SME EE loan programs developed by Indian Banks.16 Where institutions are
relatively well developed, it is also possible to target lines of credit at building EE,
as with the residential building program in Lithuania.
    While many of the aforementioned EE loan funds and loan guarantee funds
have been successful, they have not always led to the establishment of a sustainable
mechanism for expanded commercial bank lending. The unique feature of credit
lines is their use of an existing delivery mechanism: the lending framework of the
participating financial institution (Sarkar and others 2014).
    It is thus critical to develop delivery mechanisms aligned with local financial
markets and institutions and with the commercial objectives of local financial insti-
tutions. The World Bank has incorporated these lessons in its support for financing
EE and has collaborated with financial intermediaries—for example, in its Indian
SME bank lending programs and lending programs planned in China and Brazil.
The IFC is also designing programs with local financial institutions and lending           57
strategies to motivate banks to create new lending portfolios for EE. Local financial
institutions that benefit from concessional finance, lines of credit, or risk mitigation
packages get incentives for meeting EE lending targets—for example, in the line of
credit provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to
Bulgaria. Technical assistance in risk management techniques, project evaluation,
and financial due diligence is an integral part of support financial intermediaries.
    Other successful dedicated EE funds include the Korea Energy Conservation
                   Fund, established in the Republic of Korea in 1980 to promote EE through low-in-
                   terest loans, the ENCON Fund established in Thailand in 1992 with a levy on
                   petroleum products, and the Energy Conservation Fund, established in Sri Lanka
                   in 2007. Several State Energy Conservation Funds are in India, starting with a Fund
                   in the state of Kerala in 2010 (Wang and others 2013).
                       Commercial banks’ reasons for financing EE vary widely and depend on na-
                   tional and sectoral circumstances. UNEP surveyed 16 public and private financial
                   institutions in Europe, India, Japan, South Africa, the United States, and sever-
                   al MDBs to understand their approaches and motivation, as well as the policies
58
                   and regulations that influenced their decisions (Hamilton and others 2009). They
                   found that public banks typically provide low-interest loans for EE with their own
                   funds or by channeling funds from MDBs, provide technical assistance to clients

                   to undertake due diligence of EE projects, develop risk mitigation options such as
                   partial-risk guarantees, support government efforts, and contribute to innovative
                   mechanisms such as carbon financing.
                       Interested mainly in providing commercial financial services, commercial
                   banks also see EE financing as a growing market that serves clean energy and en-
                   vironmental policies, but they may have no internal mandates to build EE lending
                   portfolios. UNEP found, for example, that while Nedbank in South Africa and Yes
                   Bank in India both operate in countries that would benefit from more EE, they are
                   restricted to commercial banking products and make financing available only to
                   the most creditworthy clients. Yes Bank developed an EE lending facility for off-
                   balance-sheet activities such as ESCO financing, but there was little uptake, as the
                   ESCO market was immature in India. One of the more innovative private financial
                   institutions surveyed, EPS Capital, finances EE in Mexico and China, taking a dif-
                   ferent approach in each (box 3.1).



                   Box 3.1. Global examples of commercial financing for EE

                    Hungary Energy Efficiency Co-Financing Program (HEECP). Developed in 1997 by
                    the IFC, the GEF    , and local financial institutions (FIs) as a sustainable commercial
                    mechanism for financing EE investments, the program, which ran until 2005, included
                    a partial risk guarantee mechanism and technical assistance to Hungarian FIs and
                    project developers. Guarantee mechanisms for individual projects within the portfolio
                    are in effect. Local FIs originated and structured transactions and performed due
                    diligence and credit analysis, while the IFC provided the partial risk guarantee. The
                    preferred borrowers were ESCOs, leasing companies, and service providers who could
                    bundle individual EE projects. Performance guarantees from ESCO helped mitigate
                    performance risks.
                       HEECP consisted of three phases. In the first phase, two FIs participated and received
                    $5 million of GEF financing. In the second phase, six local FIs participated and received
                    $12 million from the IFC, while GEF contributed an additional $0.7 million for technical
                    assistance. The third phase provided loan guarantees.
                       By the end of 2006, 331 EE projects worth $93 million were supported from the
                    $55 million loan portfolio that HEECP supported with $17 million of guarantees. No
                    guarantees were called. The facility was later expanded with additional service offerings
                    and FIs. The program demonstrated reduced transaction costs and aided the expansion
                    of EE financing. Mature financial markets and banking systems, along with adequate
                    liquidity, attractive interest rates, and competition among local FIs, are essential for
                    such a program to succeed. The program took over six months to develop and another
                    two years for the products to be used (Wang and others 2013).
Box 3.1. Continued

  China ESCO Loan Guarantee Program. This program began in 2003 to help ESCOs obtain financing for
  implementing EE projects in China. The objective of this $26 million World Bank/GEF program was to
  enable ESCO financing; not to develop a wider market for EE financing. The partial loan guarantee program
  stimulates local FIs to promote financing for ESCOs providing performance guarantees. GEF funds were
  disbursed into a Guarantee Program Special Fund account held by China’s Ministry of Finance. I&G, the
  guarantee company, was able to use the facility to issue irrevocable loan guarantee agreements. The fund
  was also used to pay fund management fees and subrogation payments.
     I&G operated the ESCO Loan Guarantee Program consistent with standard guarantee practices in China.
  The program provided 90 percent loan guarantees given the risk perceived by local FI(s) for ESCO financing.
  I&G developed project assessment and appraisal procedures with the approval of the World Bank/GEF         ,
  and developed a team of full-time staff for conducting due diligence and program operations. I&G also
  developed credit assessment methodologies for financing ESCOs with technical assistance from the World
  Bank.
     Over three years through 2006, I&G issued 85 ESCO loan guarantees, totaling $32.1 million. The
  guarantees were provided to 29 ESCOs and mobilized commercial loans from 11 Chinese banks totaling
  $35.6 million and supported total investments of $57.2 million. The program helped less established ESCOs
  access commercial financing and develop (mature ESCOs did not require the guarantee program). The use
  of a local guarantee company was critical for the program’s credibility and success (Wang and others 2013).

  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) EE Loan Fund. IREDA is a non-bank institution
  that finances EE projects and new and renewable energy supplies. The World Bank extended a line of credit
  and GEF grant to IREDA in 2001. IBRD and IDA lent funds to private FIs at commercial rates. The GEF grant
  supported technical assistance and capacity building. IREDA approved 19 projects totaling $60 million.
  The typical project size was $4 million, but IREDA also financed projects as small as $200,000 for efficient

  equipment.
     IREDA offered a variety of financing terms (interest rates from 8 percent to 11.5 percent) and tenors
  (six to 10 years), covering up to 70 percent of ESCO project costs and 80 percent of EE equipment costs.
  The agency offered a rebate of 1–1.5 percent on the provision of bank guarantees, but standard security
  packages common in commercial banking in India were required of borrowers. Terms included support for
  energy audits and preparation of detailed project reports.
     IREDA offered strong expertise in project evaluation, a demonstrated record of financing projects with a
  large loan portfolio, credibility in the market, and a large client relationship network. On the other hand, the
  program entailed long procedures, little flexibility in changing to meet market needs, high cost of capital in
  local markets, and high competition with local FIs as financing terms improved in the capital markets. It was
  also difficult to turn the initial project pipeline into a loan portfolio. This program showed that high levels
  of investment can be achieved through large, specialized, parastatal FIs, but that loan processes can also be
  a drag as the market for EE financing matures (Wang and others 2013).

  EPS Capital Corp in Mexico and China. A program to support financing for ESCOs in the two countries.
  Both countries lacked adequate local commercial financing for EE projects. Local FIs did not understand EE
  project cash flow and perceived financing risks to be high. Loan tenors were also short, typically three years,
  which was inadequate for EE projects.
     EPS Capital trained local FIs in Mexico on evaluating projects and helped FIs understand the ESCO
  performance models. EPS Capital Corp worked with the Mexican Development Bank on developing guarantee              59
  products to mitigate the risks perceived by local FIs. EPS also demonstrated a model for aggregating several
  EE projects into a special purpose entity, to reduce transaction costs and scale up financing levels. EPS
  Capital accessed grant financing from the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Nacional
  Financiera, SNC (NAFIN) to provide support to local FIs.
     In China, EPS raised a $200 million equity fund to meet the equity requirements of Chinese banks for EE
  projects. The fund was for upfront equity (debt-equity of 50:50 basis), with special-purpose entities buying
  the EE projects from Chinese ESCOs. The use of the aggregator scales up the investment required, lowers
  transaction costs, and lowers the credit risk (Hamilton and others 2009).
                   ESCO financing
                   Financing by ESCOs differs from the above three mechanisms as it is provided through
                   entities that also carry out EE projects. ESCOs finance and implement projects for
                   clients and get their money back through a guaranteed-savings or shared-savings
                   contract (also known as an energy performance contract) that provides a reasonable
                   return on investment. Such a contract shifts the risk of achieving energy savings to
                   the ESCO, which is attractive to many customers. That, coupled with the third-party
                   financing that ESCOs bring, can stimulate demand for EE services, and has proven
                   especially attractive to large industrial and commercial customers.
60                     Pioneered three decades ago in the United States, ESCO financing is now used
                   in some 50 economies, including Brazil, China, India, Republic of Korea, and
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   South Africa (box 3.1). The ESCO market in China is reportedly the largest, worth
                   about $13 billion in 2013. ESCOs have played a key role in ratepayer-funded EE
                   programs outsourced by utilities.
                       ESCOs have been less successful in developing countries due to incomplete
                   enabling environments, inadequate access to low-cost financing, and poor con-
                   tract enforcement. Where conditions permit, however, ESCOs can undertake EE
                   projects on behalf of customers, utilities, or government EE agencies, providing
                   services that can transform EE markets—including project financing to supplement
                   limited public funds.


                   Utility delivery of energy efficiency
                   Electric utilities have spearheaded EE implementation in several countries.17 These
                   provide useful reference points to MENA countries as they try to implement EE.
                   While the technologies and programs most applicable to each of these sectors
                   may differ in the MENA countries, their programs’ financing mechanisms and ap-
                   proaches to implementation have certain themes in common, enabling them to
                   internalize the experiences of other countries’ utilities.
                       The customer bases targeted by utilities depend on factors including local regu-
                   lations, customer energy-demand patterns, objectives of the utility in curtailing or
                   shifting demand for electricity, incentive programs, financing and customers’ in-
                   centives to manage their electricity demand.
                       All sectors would of course benefit from greater EE, but discussions with stake-
                   holders identified the industrial, services, and residential sectors as key for the near
                   term. Industry and services—which includes commercial facilities, public buildings,
                   and services such as water supply and street lighting—are well suited for utility deliv-
                   ery of EE given that industrial and commercial customers generally pay higher tariffs
                   and are better organized with trained personnel to conduct EE programs. The phas-
                   ing in of “smart metering” technology, which improves data gathering and control of
                   customer demand, makes utilities a good partner to deliver EE in the marketplace.
                       Electric utilities are generally motivated to implement EE to comply with reg-
                   ulatory requirements. An IEA study quoting a regulatory assistance project notes
                   that many regulatory agencies in OECD countries require utilities to meet Ener-
                   gy Efficiency Obligations or Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS), a key
                   driver for utilities to undertake EE measures (Crossley and others 2012).
                       Ratepayer-funded EE programs have been successful in regulated electricity
                   markets, allowing regulators to mandate utilities to undertake EE programs on a
                   cost-recoverable basis. Deregulation and restructuring of the utility industry, as in
                   many OECD countries, had changed the market, and utilities no longer had the
same incentive to adopt EE. The distribution companies no longer owned genera-
tion plants and did not accrue the same benefits in reduced or delayed investment
in new generation capacity.
    To revive the market for utility-driven EE and incentivize utilities, regulators
therefore introduced a system-benefits charge, as in Brazil and the United States
(Box 3.1), collected from all ratepayers to fund EE programs. The system-bene-
fits charge in the United States varies from state to state and is generally a fixed
amount added to each kWh charged to customers.18 A regulator or state agency
serves as the administrator of the funds, which are allocated to utilities or other
public and private agencies, including ESCOs, to undertake EE programs.
    Regulations and their strict enforcement have been one of the main reasons
that utilities have implemented EE programs despite some of the disincentives
to do so. This regulated approach to financing and implementing EE programs
is appropriate to developing countries where the utilities are regulated, vertically
integrated, and largely in the public domain.
    Absent regulations, many utilities in developed countries with excess genera-
tion capacity follow EE measures as a service to their customers, to gain competi-
tive advantage in electricity markets with open access, or to reduce costs of supply.
    Electric utilities in countries with constrained energy resources and subsidized
electricity prices (some of the MENA countries) are motivated to help their con-
sumers reduce energy use as it helps them cut the subsidy and use available elec-
tricity to expand the customer base and/or reduce the import of energy resources.
Even utilities in resource-rich MENA countries have an incentive to reduce cus-
tomer demand given the price subsidies and the potential to export energy resources.

    The rest of this chapter summarizes the programmatic approach to EE taken by
utilities in six countries, summarized in table 3.1 (with cursory overviews for other
economies in Appendix 3), highlighting the experiences most relevant to MENA
countries.19


California, United States

Utility-delivered EE. In the United States, most regulated utilities are required to
implement EE, and in 25 states utilities are required to comply with the EERS that
establish specific, long-term targets for energy savings as part of a least-cost plan
to meet electricity demand. Utility investments in EE rose from $4 billion in 2008
to $7.2 billion by 2012. Compliance with EERS targets should result in electricity
savings of more than 232 TWh by 2020. However, mandated compliance is not the
only spur (box 3.3).
    California law, enforced by the Public Utility Commission (CPUC), requires
utilities in the state to meet new demand through EE, demand response programs,
and renewable energy prior to installing new power plants or procuring power. The
commission has developed strategic plans and roadmaps to meet EE targets and
                                                                                        61
to achieve market transformation. The commission promotes five key policy tools
to achieve EE goals: customer incentives such as rebates, codes and standards for
buildings and appliances, education and outreach programs, technical assistance
to customers, and support for R&D into new technologies. The commission peri-
odically sets goals for EE—in 2004 it sought to achieve cumulative electrical energy
savings by 2013 of 23,000 GWh and cumulative peak electricity demand reduc-
tions of 4,900 MW from EE programs.
                   Box 3.3. Harnessing the power of utilities to deliver energy efficiency in the US

                    Utilities in the United States, driven by regulation and by good system management
                    practices, have been among the leaders delivering EE. In 2009, U.S. utilities accounted
                    for 93 percent of the $4.4 billion spending on EE nationwide (Freeman and others
                    2010). Even states with capable public agencies rely on utilities’ capacity and knowledge
                    to help achieve EE targets.
                       U.S. states that impose a systems benefit charge—a charge on customers to fund
                    EE programs—have also relied on utilities to implement EE programs, though the
                    funds could also be used by public agencies to deliver EE.
62
                       An important point from U.S. states that have proclaimed EERS is that the EE
                    targets should initially be set low to allow utilities and other service providers to gain
                    experience in identifying and running programs. Utilities that do not meet mandated
WORLD BANK GROUP




                    targets may be required to pay into a state energy fund. The cost-effectiveness of
                    programs may vary depending on their objectives—for instance, programs designed
                    to reduce peak load may typically cost more than an energy savings program, but a
                    reduction in peak load may help the utility avoid or postpone adding new generation
                    capacity, which has even higher value than programs that only reduce operational
                    costs of supplying electricity.

                   Program funding. Utilities have funded the implementation of EE programs
                   through a charge of $0.003/kWh on customer bills, capped at 3 percent of a cus-
                   tomer’s bill. The customer charge meets about one-fourth of the utilities’ cost of
                   implementing approved EE programs, and the remaining is funded by the utility
                   and recovered through periodic revisions to customer tariffs as approved by the
                   regulator. The budget for implementing EE was $3.1 billion for investor-owned
                   utilities for 2010–12, with about 4 percent of the budget allocated to evaluation,
                   measurement, and verification of energy savings.

                   Program results. Investor-owned utility programs in 2010 and 2011 achieved esti-
                   mated energy savings of 7,063 GWh or 1.8 percent of retail sales, and reduced peak
                   demand by about 1,069 MW. The cost-benefit ratio for these programs was 2.02,
                   as determined by a total resource cost test. Savings were highest in the commercial
                   sector (55 percent), followed by the residential sector (34 percent). Programs to pro-
                   mote codes and standards delivered about 38 percent of the total savings. Among
                   end uses, high-efficiency lighting accounted for about 59 percent of savings followed
                   by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) improvements at 13 percent
                   and process improvements at 10 percent. Publicly owned utilities, which supply
                   about 25 percent of electricity in the state, achieved electricity savings of 402,416
                   MWh in 2012, which amounted to 0.74 percent of retail sales. The revised goal for
                   2015–24 is 21,800 GWh of cumulative electrical energy savings and 4,000 MW of
                   cumulative peak demand reduction. To meet these goals, utilities have developed EE
                   programs and customer awareness programs targeted at each customer sector.
                       California provides a “shared savings” incentive mechanism for investor-owned
                   utilities. The risk/return incentive mechanism rewards or penalizes the utility for
                   success or failure in meeting energy savings targets. Utilities that achieve at least
                   80–85 percent of the commission’s targets are granted incentives. Those hitting 65
                   percent or less are penalized. Energy savings incentives took effect in 2012, linking
                   incentives to quantity of energy saved rather than to percentage goals.
New South Wales, Australia

Utility-delivered EE. New South Wales (NSW) is one of three Australian states
that have implemented EE obligation programs. The state introduced NSW Green-
house Abatement Certificates (NGACs) to meet carbon emissions reduction tar-
gets through steps including demand-side management (DSM) and EE measures,
creating the world’s first EE certificate trading scheme. This program transitioned
in 2009 to the Energy Savings Scheme, a stand-alone EE certificate-trading plan. It
obligates generators, retailers, and wholesalers to meet specified targets by surren-
dering equivalent Energy Savings Certificates (ESCs). It aims to achieve savings of
4 percent of annual sales for 2014–20. The NSW Energy Efficiency Action Plan of
2013 targets annual savings of 16,000 GWh by 2020, and promotes open and com-
petitive market-based delivery of EE services to customers through their existing
utilities. Regulators approve EE programs eligible under the schemes, and utilities
actively market the program to increase awareness and educate customers.

Program funding. Liable entities may pass the verified costs of implementing EE
programs onto customers. Eligible facilitators may also use part of the proceeds
from the sale of ESCs to finance program costs, and the registration fee for the ESC
covers program administration costs. The ESCs are traded through spot contracts,
forward contracts, and options contracts. They have generally been trading at pric-
es around A$14.00–32.00 per MWh of electricity savings.

Program results. 8,826,129 ESCs were created between July 2009 and June 2013,




                                                                                        Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
resulting in estimated savings of 2,826 GWh, and the scheme is likely to result in
electricity savings of 5,501 GWh over 2014–23. Most ESCs are generated through
energy-efficient lighting projects. In 2012, the cost of generating an ESC ranged
from A$14.84 to A$21.70, and the ESC was trading at about A$25.36. Utilities that
acquired ESCs in compliance with program targets incurred an average cost of
A$29.39 in 2012. A total resource cost analysis, which measures the net benefit to
society, showed that the ESCs produced a net benefit of A$24.56. Liable entities
are penalized for any shortfall. In 2014, the penalty was A$25.97 per ESC.
    Overall, the Energy Savings Scheme has proven an effective mechanism. It has
also stimulated an energy services industry, creating many jobs. The ultimate cost
of the ESC scheme is met by customers through increases in energy prices.



South Africa

Utility-delivered EE. Eskom, the state-owned vertically integrated utility overseen
by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA), generates much of
the country’s power. Eskom has undertaken EE measures that reduced electricity
demand by about 3.6 GW (12 percent of system peak load) over 2005–12, and led
                                                                                        63
to energy savings of about 4 TWh. The shortfall in generation capacity in 2008 and
2009 was a primary motivator for implementing EE measures. The approved elec-
tricity tariff for 2015 is four times that in 2007. NERSA approves Eskom’s budget
for EE and DSM and allows the utility to recover program costs through the tariff.
    In 2004, NERSA promulgated the Regulatory Policy on Energy Efficiency and
Demand-Side Management, which made EE and DSM a licensing condition for all
major electricity distributors, defined the role of ESCOs, and created an indepen-
dent verification unit. In 2005, the country adopted a National EE Strategy, with
                   an EE target of 12 percent by 2015. Eskom has promoted an ESCO program since
                   2005, which targets customers with loads of over 500 MW, and has led to about
                   450 ESCO projects producing 869 MW of demand reduction and 2,727 GWh of
                   electricity savings. South Africa finalized an Integrated Resource Plan in 2013.
                       Eskom has implemented a standard offer program to replace inefficient equip-
                   ment targeting customers with loads of 10 kW–5 MW. The program provides set
                   payments against deemed savings associated with equipment replacement, and has
                   delivered an estimated 114 MW of demand reduction and 609 GWh of savings in
                   less than two years. The program also replaced inefficient lighting, shower heads,
64
                   and heat pumps, resulting in a demand reduction of 112 MW and energy savings of
                   493 GWh in two years. Eskom’s residential compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) mass
                   rollout program delivers CFLs through door-to-door delivery, direct installation,
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   and product discounts from retailers. The program rolled out 43.5 million CFLs in
                   South Africa over 2004–10, yielding demand reductions of over 1,800 MW.

                   Program funding. NERSA established an EE and DSM Fund administered by Es-
                   kom in 2004. For 2010–13, NERSA approved an EE budget amounting to 1.5
                   percent of Eskom’s gross revenues. However, for 2014–18, the budget approved is
                   less than 1 percent of revenues.

                   Program results. Eskom estimates that it realized net savings of 3,400 MW over
                   2005–13. Monitoring and verification costs of up to 8 percent of total project costs
                   are allowed by NERSA, and a budget of R128 million was approved for 2010–13.
                   Independent consultants undertake monitoring and verification using an approved
                   methodology based on the International Performance Measurement and Verifica-
                   tion Protocol (IPMVP).20 About half the EE initiatives were no-cost/low cost mea-
                   sures with payback periods of less than three years. The average cost per kWh saved
                   was about R0.4. NERSA establishes targets for Eskom and imposes penalties for
                   non-compliance. Overall, Eskom’s EE programs focusing on residential lighting and
                   programs for the industrial sector have sustained the greatest demand reduction.



                   China

                   Utility-delivered EE. China has developed a comprehensive energy strategy to im-
                   plement EE. The industrial sector, which accounts for 69 percent of final energy use,
                   is a key focus. China has been running government-funded EE programs since the
                   1980s, and adopted new policies in 2010 obligating government-owned utilities to
                   achieve energy savings of at least 0.3 percent in sales and demand savings of at least
                   0.3 percent compared with the previous year’s consumption. The State Electricity
                   Regulatory Commission (National Energy Administration) regulates grid companies
                   and ensures that they implement DSM and EE measures. Targets for EE may be met
                   by implementing measures in any customer sector and may include measures that
                   reduce transmission and distribution losses. Utilities can also establish ESCOs or
                   purchase up to 40 percent of the targeted savings from other eligible entities.

                   Program funding. DSM and EE programs get their funding through a surcharge
                   on electricity tariffs, revenues generated by differential pricing for energy-intensive
                   industries, a special fund created and managed by each provincial government, or
                   other fiscal means such as emissions reduction. The guidance on EE obligation
                   allows utility program expenses to be recovered through tariffs, though this mech-
anism has not yet been put in place (under present regulations, the grid companies
are not allowed to fully recover program costs, and they may not be compensated
for any reduction in revenue). Grid companies that establish ESCO subsidiaries
may be eligible for targeted funding from central and provincial governments. De-
spite these sources of funding, grid companies face heavy costs in acquiring energy
and demand savings that are not fully covered by financial incentives.

Program results. In 2013, the total energy savings were 16.2 TWh, and the total
load reduction was 3.44 GW. A draft compliance scheme awards utilities points
for energy savings achieved and implementation steps taken. The maximum is 100
points, of which measures related to the target for EE obligation receive a maxi-
mum of 60 and DSM implementation a maximum of 40. In early 2013, the NDRC
developed draft procedures for measuring and verifying energy savings by the grid
companies and provincial governments that are similar to evaluation practices in
the United States. China pays little attention to the cost-effectiveness of EE pro-
grams, which are principally implemented to meet EE targets. While there are pro-
posals to incentivize grid companies to implement cost-effective DSM measures,
grid companies are not sanctioned for not meeting EE goals.

the support of Susatinable Energy for All (SE4ALL), the BEE supports electricity
distribution companies in nationally coordinated EE and DSM programs. India’s
12th Five-Year Plan (2011–15) has established targets and strategies for implement-
ing and achieving electricity savings equal to around 45 TWh—roughly 1 percent of
total electricity consumption at the start of the Five-Year Plan. The targets include
savings from utility DSM programs. Regulators in at least 14 states have established
DSM implementation rules. Some 70 percent of government-owned electricity util-
ities have an energy department that operates DSM programs.
    The few private utilities have been more active in implementing DSM programs,
with ESCOs also involved. Utility-delivered DSM is, however, in the early stages
and utilities are undertaking pilot projects. India’s National Mission for Enhanced
Energy Efficiency of 2008 also promotes cost-effective strategies for end-use de-
mand-side measures, under which a market-based mechanism aims to improve in
EE in energy-intensive large industries and in power generation.

Program funding. While regulators allow utilities to recover eligible costs of utility
DSM programs through the tariffs, revising tariffs is not easy given political and
social sensitivity. Utilities are largely supported by funding from international orga-
nizations and do not have adequate funds to undertake large programs.
                                                                                          65

Program results. Several pilot projects have been successful:
        >	 The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company’s agricultural
          DSM project targeted replacement of 3,530 pumps for projected elec-
          tricity savings of up to 40 percent. If extended to the roughly 20 million
          pumps nationally, demand could fall by 62 TWh annually, or about
          6.5 percent of the national total. The utility also replaced 380,000 in-
                             candescent lamps with CFLs, for annual savings of 12-16 MWh and
                             reduced peak demand of 7-9 MW.

                            >	 Tata Power, a private utility, offers a pilot thermal energy storage pro-
                             gram to encourage customers to run their air conditioners on off-peak
                             rather than peak hours by offering a rebate on the tariff. In the first
                             phase of this initiative in 2014, Tata Power enrolled a thermal storage
                             capacity of over 15,000 TRH, which has achieved a load shift of more
                             than 3.6 million units of energy from peak to off-peak hours.

                             the power factor and efficiency of agricultural water pumping for 100
                             customers. It resulted in average peak load reduction of 60 percent and

                             energy savings of over 65 percent.

                            >	 Reliance Infrastructure Limited, a private utility, ran a DSM program
                             that replaced over 36,000 streetlight lamps, resulting in annual savings
                             of about 5.4 GWh and peak load reduction of 1.3 MW.
                   Scaling up these programs will take time and will depend on the ability of utilities
                   to recover the costs of carrying them out.



                   Brazil

                   Utility-delivered EE. Brazil has relatively low electricity intensity and high electric-
                   ity prices that are similar to prices in OECD countries, which motivates custom-
                   ers to take EE steps. The federal government and the national regulator, Agência
                   Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL), have promoted EE and DSM: ANEEL
                   requires utilities to spend 0.5 percent of their net operating revenues on improving
                   EE. Brazil established the National Electrical Energy Conservation Program (Pro-
                   grama Nacional de Conservacão de Energia Elétrica) in 1985 within the then na-
                   tional electricity utility, Eletrobras, and the Energy Efficiency Program (Programa
                   de Eficiência Energética, or PEE) seeks to promote the efficient use of electricity.
                       ANEEL also requires utilities to spend 60 percent of the funds set aside for EE
                   for implementing programs that benefit customers that pay a social tariff. ANEEL
                   allows up to 5 percent of funds to be used to meet administration and marketing
                   costs of program delivery. The Ministry of Mines and Energy approved a National
                   Plan for Energy Efficiency in October 2011, which targets 109 TWh of cumulative
                   electricity savings by 2030.
                       Distribution utilities may invest PEE funds to implement projects in customer
                   facilities. Brazilian utilities have invested heavily in efficient public lighting and in
                   programs targeting the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors. Some of the
                   largest utilities in the country have outsourced EE projects to ESCOs.

                   Program funding. Utility EE programs derive funding from a percentage of their
                   revenues, which they are required to set aside by ANEEL. Since the passage of this
                   law in 1998, originally set at 1 percent of utility revenue until an amendment in
                   2007 reduced it to 0.5 percent, the proportion allocated to energy efficiency pro-
                   grams has varied between 0.9 percent and 0.25 percent. Half of the allocation goes
                   to energy efficiency measures targeted at low-income households.
Program results. The PEE has generated energy savings of more than 8.5 TWh a
year and a reduction in peak demand of around 2.5 GW. The National Electri-
cal Energy Conservation Program, which funds a broad range of programs, saved
nearly 100 TWh in 2011. The requirement for distribution utilities to invest in
EE and DSM spurred significant investment: cumulative investments total more
than R4.6 billion (US$1.5 billion) since 1998 from the PEE. ANEEL requires a
cost-benefit ratio of 0.85 or less for projects to be eligible under the utility EE/
DSM program. Overall, utility delivery of EE has been successful and reasonably
transparent, though EE has not been adequately integrated into resource planning.

Summary of global experience

Financing
Financing EE through domestic finance institutions, such as commercial banks,
in developing countries is a challenge even when capital markets are strong. Most
MENA countries have little experience with EE financing and need to develop in-
novative financing mechanisms and products to mitigate the risks to local commer-
cial financial institutions and provide attractive financing options to customers.
    A multitude of structural factors can hinder deals, such as financing and con-
tract laws and terms, high transaction costs, low visibility of EE, small size of proj-
ects, opportunity costs for alternative investments and uncertain creditworthiness
of customers and service providers. It is a great challenge to package financing
mechanisms to meet local market conditions.21 But creating a sustainable source
of financing through local financial institutions is critical to creating a liquid mar-
ket for financing EE in the long run, and will require overcoming these obstacles
and building the capacity of local financial institutions to evaluate and finance EE
projects.
    Creating a market for financing is more challenging in countries with weak
local banking systems, as in some MENA countries, where it may be necessary
to support the creation of a strong banking sector as a precursor to sustainable
financing. In most countries, however, local banks have enough financial products
geared toward consumer retail finance that can be tailored to the needs of EE
projects, but that may need considerable public (state or MDB) support, especially




                                                                                          Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
where loan tenors range from one to three years and interest rates are prohibitive.
Local financial institutions also need to understand the dynamics of EE projects
where positive returns are hidden in the cash flow of the entity and to develop ap-
propriate financing products. The use of performance guarantees, project aggrega-
tors and innovative repayment systems, including through utility bills, can all help
mitigate the risks of financing EE.
    It is equally critical that financing delivery mechanisms be tailored to local
market conditions and not distort local financing markets—concessional financing
can stimulate the market but also distort long-term incentives. The World Bank
(2014a) study found that lending through local commercial banks offers the high-
est prospect of program sustainability and large-scale impact. This may entail de-
veloping partnerships with local financial institutions to support them in market
development.


Delivery in six countries
Most utilities in the six countries were motivated to adopt EE by policy and regula-
tory requirements, although some had business reasons particular to the local mar-
ket. Some (more in developed-country markets) aimed to sell additional products           69

or services, while others pursued EE regardless of regulations to reduce demand
for electricity and put off investing in generation, transmission, and distribution.
    In developed economies such as California and New South Wales, utilities com-
pete in open electricity markets and have an added incentive to provide expert
advisory services to retain customers.
    Providing EE services in developing economies brings multiple benefits to the
utility, and many utilities are now undertaking EE programs, generally in compli-
                   ance with policy and regulatory obligations, to meet electricity demand cost-effec-
                   tively. Utilities in South Africa, Thailand, and India have all supported EE—pro-
                   grams that replace inefficient lighting with CFLs are the most popular. Efficient
                   lighting can substantially lower peak demand in all countries, but is especially
                   important in countries with inadequate generation and weak transmission and
                   distribution. Finally, utilities in countries with subsidized tariffs that do not meet
                   the cost of electricity supply may seek to lighten the subsidy burden by curtailing
                   demand through EE.

                   Moving from MDB support to self-sustainability over the long run
70
                   One of the most widely deployed utility EE programs worldwide has been installa-
                   tion of CFLs, which are very effective at cutting peak demand load and saving ener-

                   gy. While some CFL programs got all their funding from the utilities, which provided
                   free or subsidized CFLs to customers, others billed customers in installments.
                       Despite these programs’ apparent success, many utilities have been unable to
                   sustain them without ongoing support from MDBs or other donors, primarily for
                   lack of regulatory mandates and inability to recover program costs through tariff
                   revisions. Subsidized tariffs in many developing countries have discouraged pro-
                   gram implementation, although reduced electricity sales resulting from electricity
                   savings effectively reduce the subsidy burden. This underlines the need for an in-
                   tegrated approach to EE, with well-defined regulatory incentives and sustainable
                   financing mechanisms.

Options for scaling up energy
efficiency in MENA
This chapter focuses on the options that MENA countries might consider as they
continue to strengthen their approaches to EE.
    Building on chapter 2 and chapter 3, chapter 4 reviews the elements necessary
to ensure a strong enabling environment and a good finance structure for scaling
up EE in MENA; i.e. the policies, institutions, finance, capacity, awareness build-
ing, and reporting. It makes suggestions for how to overcome the inherent barriers
to EE, and notes the existing good practices established by MENA countries. These




                                                                                         Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
provide a rich source of knowledge and clear lessons for developing EE policy
within neighboring MENA countries.
    The focus of the chapter then turns to the energy savings potential in the elec-
tricity sector and each of the three main end-use sectors: industry, services, and
residential. To the extent possible, sets of potential options that may be applicable
to the three subregions of MENA—Maghreb, Mashreq, and GCC—are presented for
the three chosen end-use sectors with the highest energy-saving potential.
    The chapter offers examples of how individual countries may benefit from par-
ticular options throughout, thereby contributing to the ongoing dialogue about
how countries and their development partners can build better enabling environ-
ments for targeted EE delivery mechanisms to function at scale. The examples are
not exclusive or definitive. Indeed, given the considerable variation in the market
characteristics of the individual MENA countries, the appropriate EE programs
will be quite different.
    For this reason, the report concludes with a menu of best practice options,
from which the individual countries can select appropriate measures, rather than
a single international best practice formula to implement EE improvements in a
particular MENA country.
    EE carries many different benefits (IEA 2014e) and the circumstances of              71
each country will determine which of those benefits it will prioritize. Some may
seek to deliver economic benefits through reduced expenditures on energy and
in supply-side investments. Others may emphasize increased security of supply,
employing EE to increase network operational efficiencies and improvements in
the reliability of supply. Still others may prioritize social welfare benefits, such
as increasing the levels of service (including lighting, refrigeration, and electronic
equipment) from new electricity supplies to previously unconnected households.
                       In addition, the emphasis for resource-rich energy exporters will be different
                   from that of energy importers, and the incentive to deliver EE may vary depending
                   on budgetary burdens resulting from energy-price policies. Collectively, these driv-
                   ers will help determine the level of ambition and direction of efforts to save energy,
                   shaping the enabling framework and the specific mechanisms for delivering EE.

Element 1.
Policy and regulations

The success of any EE policy depends on the
degree of government commitment, level of pro-
gram ambition, and stability of public support.
International experience has also shown that
well-designed policies include clearly defined
targets supported by an overarching EE legal and
regulatory framework.

EE policy and setting national targets
The drivers behind introducing an EE policy vary by country, depending on the
market characteristics and the government’s strategic vision for energy use. For ex-
ample, the Master Plan of Iraq, which aims to develop a 20-year cost-effective plan
for the electricity sector, reflects a need to increase security of supply and satisfy
environmental requirements. Significant projects identified in the plan include con-
verting existing power plants operating on crude oil to gas combined-cycle power
plants, lowering transmission losses by strengthening the grid, and reducing losses
in the distribution network by adopting better distribution planning, rebalancing
loads across phases, and improving maintenance standards (RCREEE 2015).
In Saudi Arabia the delivery of economic benefit is the primary motivation, and a
target objective to achieve a 30 percent reduction in electricity intensity between
2005 and 2030 has been set (RCREEE 2015). Energy-importing countries such




                                                                                         Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
as Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and West Bank and Gaza view EE as an economic
necessity and a key element in energy security. Almost all of them (Morocco aside)
have adopted national EE action plans with targets and measures. Morocco is fi-
nalizing its national strategy.
    A bottom-up approach works well for setting national targets because the po-
tential for EE improvement varies considerably by sector. Sectoral targets for EE
must be appropriate to sectoral energy intensity, specific energy consumption,
percentage reduction, and absolute targets. Targets are most effective—and much
easier to implement—when stakeholders take part from the earliest stages. This
requires placing EE units in key sectoral ministries that can recommend suitable
targets and mechanisms to a central unit.
    MENA countries in the early stages of EE policy development may also find it
effective to introduce realistic and quickly demonstrable (initially short- and medi-
um-term) goals and targets to help achieve public support and stakeholder buy-in.
Aligning the interests of stakeholders and demonstrating results in a short time
helps to sustain activity (Taylor and others 2008; Sarkar and Singh 2010). For
example, programs in India, South Africa, and Thailand, which replaced ineffi-
cient lighting with CFLs or LEDs (light-emitting diode), have delivered significant
                                                                                         73
savings in the short term. Morocco reduced peak load by 177 MW through the
replacement of 4.5 million inefficient light bulbs with CFLs over two years. On
average, customers observed about a 22 percent reduction in monthly electricity
consumption. By replacing 10 million light bulbs, both Egypt and Morocco aim to
reduce around 330 MW of peak load (RCREEE 2015).
                   Cost reflective energy pricing
                   Energy subsidies and other forms of price distortion encourage consumers to un-
                   dervalue energy and diminish the financial incentive to adopt EE measures. For
                   consumers to understand the benefits of EE, the price they pay for energy con-
                   sumption needs to be cost-reflective. Subsidies are distortive in all countries, par-
                   ticularly to net energy importers such as Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tu-
                   nisia. In recent years, several MENA countries have embarked on subsidy reforms,
                   and energy importers are making considerable progress.
                       In particular, according to RCREEE, Egypt has launched a five-year plan to
74                 phase out electricity subsidies and plans to increase tariffs annually until 2018, and
                   completely phase out subsidies by 2019. The petroleum sector has also started re-
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   forming subsidies. On July 5, 2014, the government increased prices of gasoline 92
                   octane by 40 percent, of gasoline 80 octane by 78 percent, of diesel by 65 percent,
                   and of natural gas for cars by 175 percent.
                       Jordan introduced a five-year plan to reform electricity prices in 2013 and plans
                   to increase rates annually until 2017. Since November 2012, Jordan has removed
                   subsidies for all domestic oil products, and prices track international market trends
                   through a monthly review.
                       Tunisia also introduced an electricity reform plan in 2014 and has periodically
                   revised rates upward. Morocco eliminated all subsidies for gasoline and industri-
                   al fuel in January 2014, and reviews prices for these fuels twice a month. Sudan
                   increased prices of gasoline by 68 percent, diesel by 75 percent, and cooking gas
                   (LPG) by 67 percent. Yemen removed subsidies for diesel and gasoline in July 2014.
                       Phasing out subsidies will cost consumers, so reforms have to secure public
                   support. It may be important to introduce programs supported by defined funding
                   sources that can help consumers reduce their energy usage and hence the financial
                   burden of the subsidy reform. Introducing social safety net programs and other
                   mitigation mechanisms to support the poor is also important.

                   Appropriate regulatory frameworks support
                   new (and developing) EE policies, including
                   regulations that provide codes and standards
                   for energy performance as well as suitable
                   enforcement mechanisms. Internationally,
                   appliance labeling (especially lighting, refrig-
                   erators, air conditioners, and water heaters),
                   buildings, and industrial equipment have
                   proven highly effective. A number of Arab
                   countries have already adopted standards
                   and labels for appliances, and a few have
                   adopted energy performance codes for build-
                   ings. The barrier is in enforcing them.
                       The EE labeling initiative in the Neth-
                   erlands has been successful. The program
                   provides information to consumers on EE
                   products through a range of channels includ-
                                                                      Source: Energy Efficiency Improvement and

Web-based tools calculate energy use and inform consumers about lifecycle costs.
Financial support incentives are also available for businesses, in the form of en-
ergy investment allowances and tax rebates for purchase of EE equipment. In the
MENA region, Jordan provides exemptions from sales tax and customs duties for
EE equipment. Tunisia reduces customs duty to 10 percent for EE equipment and
provides exemptions from value-added tax. Appliance standards and labels exist
in several countries. Figure 4.2 shows examples of labels currently in use for air
conditioners in Egypt.



ELEMENT 2.
Institutions and organizations

Successful delivery of EE requires strong leader-
ship from government and the empowered insti-
tutions.22 Their roles and responsibilities must be
clearly defined to avoid duplication of tasks.
    Based on experience across many regions, the
World Bank suggests that EE programs should be
commercially oriented, responsive to the needs
of target sectors, demand driven, and flexible to
help create a sustained shift in the market toward improved EE. These new pro-
grams will also need to be steered by a central body, which will provide a principal
hub for all stakeholders and ensure that the programs remain on track. Depending




                                                                                          Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
on the characteristics of a particular market, it may be appropriate to assign these
responsibilities to a dedicated state agency or agencies. Conversely, where utilities
will deliver the majority of programs, the utilities regulator may be more suitable.

EE agency
Having a dedicated energy agency, or agencies, with the authority to deliver EE pol-
icies and the responsibility for achieving goals has been highly effective internation-
ally. However, it is also important to ensure that the new EE policies and activities
match those of other public and private agencies.
    For example, China’s comprehensive EE programs work primarily through gov-
ernment agencies. The NDRC is the lead agency responsible for demand-side
management and EE, and coordinates all efforts of sectoral agencies and energy
conservation centers in the comprehensive EE programs. Collectively, the agen-
cies’ EE programs have contributed to a steady decrease in energy intensity of the
economy since 1980 (Allen and Crossley 2014). The Chinese model provides an
example of how appropriately resourced agencies can work with private agencies
and financial institutions.
    ANME in Tunisia is a good example of a dedicated agency that has the political
                                                                                          75
authority to act on government EE policies. An impartial state agency, it can work
with other government agencies, policy makers, and other stakeholders in EE pro-
grams. Its government affiliation also enables it to take a holistic view of the wider
economy and therefore determine the most appropriate sectoral interventions and
the most cost-effective use of resources.
    The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) is also a well-established,
government-affiliated agency. It is involved in policy formulation, implementation,
capacity building, and information dissemination. It plays an important role in fi-
                   nancing EE projects by reviewing and providing recommendations on loan applica-
                   tions for EE projects to Lebanese commercial banks through the National EE and
                   Renewable Energy Action (NEEREA) fund.23
                        Within the GCC, the mandate of the Bahrain Electricity and Water Conservation
                   Directorate at the Electricity and Water Authority Energy Planning includes policy
                   formulation and implementation in electricity generation, transmission, and distri-
                   bution (RCREEE 2015).
                        Egypt is in the process of establishing national authorities for EE. A central
                   unit has been set up under the cabinet, as have sectoral EE units in ministries con-
76
                   cerned with key energy supply and demand sectors (figure 4.3). This framework is
                   still evolving, and to be most effective will require an empowered central unit (or
                   agency) that can focus on planning, strategies, coordination and setting targets,
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   and sectoral units that have strong relationships with enterprises and consumers
                   (World Bank 2011).

                   Utilities regulator
                   The utilities regulator can also provide an effective channel for delivery of EE pro-
                   grams, by introducing a range of sectoral EE initiatives through utilities’ mandates
                   and incentives programs, as well as supplier obligation schemes. Internationally,
                   there are many examples of successful regulation programs to incentivize utilities
(Allen and Crossley 2014), such as the California program (chapter 3). This is based
on a long-term EE strategy for each economic sector and identifies near-, mid-, and
long-term measures:
        >	 Customer incentives, including rebates, innovative or discount financing,
          and nonfinancial support to consumers are the “carrots” that help pull
          consumers into choosing the efficient option.

        >	 Codes and standards that mandate minimum efficiency thresholds for
          buildings, appliances, or equipment (removing the less efficient choices
          from the market) are the “sticks” that push builders and manufacturers to
          efficient goods and services.

        >	 Education and information through marketing, education, and outreach
          inform market actors about EE opportunities. These programs often in-
          clude labeling, benchmarking, Internet-based comparisons, professional
          and trade materials, school curricula, and peer-to-peer exchanges.

        >	 Technical assistance helps ensure that customers’, installers’, or retailers’
          knowledge barriers are not hampering the progress of critical efficiency
          initiatives.


Obligated utilities
Governments have an option to introduce an EE certificates scheme, which can be
an effective mechanism to provide funding for EE activities and does not require




                                                                                           Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
the support of public funding. Ultimately, customers pay the cost of such schemes
through higher prices, although in competitive markets these increases are smaller.
   Allen and Crossley (2014) recommended that jurisdictions seeking to establish
a new energy services industry or expand an existing one can learn a great deal
from the Energy Savings Scheme (ESS) in New South Wales (NSW, Australia)
(chapter 3). The ESS creates a financial incentive to reduce electricity consump-
tion by encouraging energy savings.24 Some other objectives are:
        >	 Help households and businesses reduce electricity consumption and
          costs.

        >	 Complement any national scheme for pollution reduction by making the
          reduction of greenhouse gas emissions achievable at a lower cost.

        >	 Reduce the cost of, and need for, additional energy generation, transmis-
          sion, and distribution infrastructure.
The ESS also enabled organizations with expertise in helping other businesses to
reduce electricity to become Accredited Certificate Providers (ACPs). ACPs are
voluntary participants in the ESS and are eligible to create and sell ESCs from
energy savings projects. The ESS is therefore an important demonstration of two            77
unique policy and regulatory mechanisms that can assist in utility delivery of EE
certificate trading and third-party ACPs.
    Many of the utilities in MENA countries are state-owned, vertically integrated
monopolies. These utilities can benefit directly from EE programs, as the reduction
in peak demand will reduce or delay the requirement to invest in additional gener-
ation capacity. But an awareness- or capacity-building program may be required to
encourage participation from utilities.
                       In other MENA countries where there is active retail competition in the elec-
                   tricity market, utilities have less incentive to invest in EE. In such cases a utilities
                   obligation to undertake action to meet defined EE targets can be effective.

                   Regulation compliance
                   Clear responsibility for monitoring and verifying results is also necessary to con-
                   firm compliance with program requirements and to provide evidence of individual,
                   sectoral, and national benefits from the EE programs. Data gathered is useful in
                   evaluating the effectiveness of EE programs and inform future policy formulation
78                 to ensure that it stays relevant to changing market structure.

                   ELEMENT 3.
                   Finance

                   The goal is to mobilize private investment in EE
                   to make these markets self-financing. However,
                   barriers remain to the finance and uptake of EE
                   measures. These are discussed under the four
                   headings in the finance element in figure 4.1.
                   In many cases the main and often only source
                   of financing are the consumer’s own funds. The
                   sources described below above would typically
                   augment these.
                       Some of the barriers are common across all countries, such as the weak rec-
                   ognition of energy savings from efficiency investments, the small size of projects,
                   and the lack of information, data, and capacity to manage EE project finance.
                   Developing countries also have their own barriers, including low capital market
                   development, governance issues, small markets for EE, higher costs of capital and
                   higher perceived national risk for investors (Ryan and others 2012). These reduce
                   access to capital markets and private finance for projects.

    Countries at an early stage of development of capital and EE markets need a
comprehensive framework to incentivize and provide finance. The design and mix
of financial instruments need to match the country’s needs and its commercial and
financial market structure. The PROSOL solar water heater program in Tunisia,
for instance, demonstrates the usefulness of packaging projects as turnkey opera-
tionsFigure 4.5 shows schematically that in countries with low capital market de-
velopment, investment in EE comes primarily from public finance through grants
and concessional loan instruments. Incentives may also be in the form of parafiscal
measures, like reduced duties such as those used under Tunisia’s National Fund
for Energy Conservation (FNME) on energy-efficient devices that are not manu-
factured domestically. As development picks up, the proportion of EE investment
supported by commercial finance usually grows. Lebanon has experience in co-
operation between government agencies and the banking sector on EE (box 4.1).

Box 4.1 EE policy and finance in Lebanon

 The Lebanese Government has officially adopted the National Energy Efficiency
 Action Plan (NEEAP) for the years 2011-2015 as developed by the Lebanese Center
 for Energy Conservation (LCEC) in collaboration with the Project on Energy Efficiency
 in the Construction Sector in the Mediterranean (MED-ENEC), the EU funded Support
 for the Enhanced Integration and the Improved Security of the Euro-Mediterranean
 Energy Market (MED-EMIP) project, the League of Arab States, and the Regional
 Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE). The LCEC produced the
 NEEAP in October 2010 in coordination with national and international stakeholders
 in five cycles of reviews.




                                                                                                        Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
    The NEEAP 2011-2015 is the first comprehensive strategy in energy efficiency and
 renewable energy to be ever adopted by a Lebanese or Arab Government. It derives
 from the Arab Energy Efficiency Guideline developed by the league of Arab states
 and disseminated among its member states. The NEEAP is an official document that
 comprises 14 national initiatives paving the way for a structured approach towards
 achieving the national target of 12 percent renewable energy by 2020, it outlines
 energy conservation measures to be taken in the country in order to reach the national
 energy targets. It aims to strengthen the role of the public sector in the provision of
 information to consumers, the development of solar and hydro energy, the adoption
 of energy conservation laws, the banning of incandescent lamps, and the development
 of financing mechanisms.
    In Lebanon, finance for EE goes through banks. The Central Bank of Lebanon (CBL)
 was crucial in developing the National Fund together with the local authority for
 energy (LCEC). From the start, the objective was to use banks to stimulate investments
 through low cost funds. NEEREA has the following components:
       • Subsidized interest rates, whereby CBL exempts banks from reserve requirements.
       • Cash subsidies, which will be paid after the project is completed and the
         savings are confirmed by LCEC. The subsidies come from the EU and represent
         5 percent or 15 percent of the loan amount, depending if the sector already
                                                                                                        79
         receives another form of subsidy.
       • A loan guarantee for Small and Medium Enterprises up to 40 employees
         (“Kafalat Energy”)
       • A TA program to improve staff’s technical and managerial skills in advising
         clients at the level of the guarantee organization Kafalat, participating
         commercial banks and CBL.

                   International experience indicates that governments have the greatest success with
                   public finance when they are part of wider national action plans, developed with
                   the business and financial communities, and tailored to address local investment
                   risks and market constraints.25
                   The suitability of a finance option will depend on several key market characteristics
                   (figure 4.5). One important element is the cost-reflectiveness of energy prices, a ma-
                   jor factor that measures the level of energy subsidy. Electricity market liberalization
                   also matters—that is, whether there is active supply-side competition over electricity
                   companies or they are largely state-owned monopolies. Other factors include the lev-
80
                   el of capitalization within the market and the level of functionality within the bank-
                   ing system. An exit strategy should be available for occasions when the EE market is
                   developed enough for private financial markets to take over financing.

                   Public sector EE financing
                   The effectiveness of EE policies and programs increases when energy price reforms
                   are in place that improve the financial incentives for energy end users to adopt EE
                   measures.
                       In countries where the retail price of electricity is subsidized, consumers are
                   more likely to place a low value on energy use and have little awareness of the
                   value of EE, and consumer-financing mechanisms are unlikely to be suitable in
                   these markets. Governments in this situation could introduce a public financing
                   mechanism to mitigate the phasing out of energy subsidies. These countries may
                   also consider it necessary to raise awareness of why EE is becoming a matter of
                   national importance and gain public support for removing energy subsidies.
                       Even with the recent fall in oil prices, budget burdens can still be substantial
                   on net energy-importing MENA countries that run energy subsidies or alternative
                   mechanisms to control retail prices at below cost levels. As the benefits of energy
                   subsidies tend to accrue preferentially to the wealthy, the predictable result is so-
                   cial inequalities as well. In countries with low per capita GDP, any revisions to the
                   retail price structure should include targeted social safety net programs and other
                   mitigation mechanisms to support the poor and vulnerable. Consumers in these
                   countries are also likely to have a low level of finance available for investing in EE.
                       Utility-implemented programs that include bulk procurement of EE appliances
                   will work well in these countries, as they have the advantage of lowering their
prices. As mentioned in Chapter 3, numerous international examples have focused
on replacing inefficient lighting, such as the CFL replacements programs in Ban-
gladesh, Egypt, and South Africa and the LED lighting programs in Algeria, Egypt,
India, Morocco, and Tunisia. In Egypt, for instance, the CFL program provided a
50 percent cost reduction in price due to public bulk procurement, and customers
were able to make payments in installments through their monthly electricity bills.
    Governments are important for mobilizing investment in EE: first through pub-
lic budgets and investments through dedicated funds or financial intermediaries,
second through the tailored application of financial risk-mitigation instruments to
mobilize private green investment (figure 4.6).26

Public funds can be disbursed by public authorities directly through EE grants and




                                                                                           Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
investment subsidies, so they do not require a fully functional banking system. For
example, in Ireland the Better Energy Homes program, managed by the Sustain-
able Energy Authority of Ireland,27 encourages householders to invest in EE up-
grades. The Authority provides grants for roof insulation, external wall insulation,
dry‐lining, and other measures. The limitation of such grants and other subsidies
is that they are small, making it unlikely that investment for the deeper EE im-
provements with higher initial costs will be undertaken, even when the return on
investment is attractive.
    Introducing fiscal incentives such as tax rebates may be appropriate for coun-
tries with less established banking systems, although effective tax collection is
required. While tax incentives for EE investments exist in many countries, few
MENA countries offer such incentives. The exceptions are Jordan, which offers an
exemption from sales tax and customs duties for EE equipment, West Bank and
Gaza, where EE equipment is exempt from value-added tax/sales tax, and Tunisia,
where EE equipment is exempt from value-added tax (RCREEE 2015).
    Public finance can also come from credit lines and loans (which may be avail-
able at concessional rates) to local financial institutions for on-lending to proj-
ects.28 While several MENA countries do have operational banking systems, many
commercial financial markets are not well capitalized and financing is still scarce        81

or expensive, and public funds can provide capital. Concessional loans, credit
lines, and guarantee facilities can increase liquidity and lower the risk of default. In
Tunisia, two dedicated credit lines exist. The first comes from the World Bank with
total capital of $40 million for long-term loans with a guarantee from the Tunisian
government for co-generation and industrial EE projects. The second comes from
the French Development Agency with total capital of EUR 40 million to provide
loans for co-generation, EE, and renewable energy projects (RCREEE 2013).
                       Once liquidity has been secured for financing EE projects through local finan-
                   cial institutions, public funds can be used to encourage private (consumer) invest-
                   ment in EE through incentives to mitigate risk, such as reduced interest rates or
                   extended repayment periods. In Lebanon, NEEREA provides an entrepreneurial
                   financing mechanism for sustainable energy projects. NEEREA provides mainly
                   long-term soft loans with an interest rate of 0-1 percent. NEEREA loans are pro-
                   vided to end users through all commercial banks in Lebanon for all types of EE
                   projects, with a total repayment period of 14 years, including a grace period of four
                   years (RCREEE 2015).

                   ESCO financing
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   The ESCO financing model provides capital support for EE projects, and repay-
                   ment is made through shared savings or guaranteed savings contracts. In markets
                   with high capitalization and well-functioning ESCOs, the ESCO generally borrows
                   funding for the project directly from commercial financial institutions. The ESCO
                   effectively operates as an intermediary between the consumer and the institution,
                   and the ESCO guarantee lowers the perceived risk for the institution and can lead
                   to lower interest rates. Although the ESCO can provide equity to finance the proj-
                   ect, this does not provide an optimum solution as it limits the number of projects
                   it can undertake.

                   Markets with low levels of capitalization
                   In countries where the financial markets are not well capitalized and the cost of
                   borrowing is high, the ESCO model would benefit from additional sources of fi-
                   nance. In such cases, public funds (dedicated EE funds), IFIs, or donor agencies
                   could provide less expensive sources of capital, which would improve the cost-ef-
                   fectiveness of EE projects (figure 4.7). These additional sources of finance could go
                   through commercial banks and local finance institutions. Additionally, these three
                   originators could provide support to commercial banks, which would also lower
                   the cost of financing. In either case, the additional funds can stimulate demand for
                   ESCOs.

Although ESCOs have been very successful in the United States, and to a lesser
extent in Europe, they have tended to be less successful in developing countries
where the enabling environment is insufficiently developed. For example, Yes Bank
in India developed an EE lending facility for off-balance sheet activities such as
ESCO financing, but saw little uptake as the ESCO market is immature there (see
Box 3.1).
    The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), however, has been
very successful in implementing EE measures that helped it curtail electricity de-
mand and meet demand during generation shortfalls. With the assistance of the
World Bank and GEF, EGAT adopted a range of measures including voluntary
appliance labeling, promotion of ESCOs, lighting programs for the residential and
commercial sectors, and improved commercial building EE.
    A number of companies have emerged in several MENA countries, having tak-
en up various functions of ESCOs, though so far with relatively little uptake of the
financing models found elsewhere (Panev and others 2014):

Utility financing
National governments can introduce mandates or requirements on utilities to im-
plement EE programs, directly in the case of state-owned utilities or indirectly
though supply license obligations in the case of electricity markets with retail com-
petition. The finance needed for these programs can be provided from the utility
directly, through a public fund (often raised through public benefits charges—see
below), or through commercial financing by a third party such as a local or inter-
national finance institution (figure 4.8).

These forms of financial support can be channeled to the customer through util-
ities, including grants, concessional loans, revolving funds, and other risk-miti-
gation products. EE programs financed in this way provide a source of funding




                                                                                            Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
for customers to invest in EE through on-bill financing, and leverage the com-
mercial relationship between the utility and its customers to recover the financial
loans through installment charges on on-bill repayment, as in the example above
of Egypt’s CFL distribution program. Utility-implemented EE programs are appro-
priate in any of the end-use sectors, but the most appropriate form of support will
depend on the type of EE measures and the market characteristics.
    The results of the analysis in chapter 3 of utility EE finance programs provide
some insights into effective utility programs. Most utilities in the six programs ana-
lyzed were motivated to adopt EE by policy requirements, although some had busi-
ness reasons particular to the local market. Some (mainly in developed-country
markets) aimed to sell additional products or services, while others (in developed
and developing economies) were impelled to pursue EE regardless of regulations
to reduce the demand for electricity and put off investing in generation, transmis-
sion and distribution.
    Providing EE services in developing economies benefits the utility in many
ways, and many utilities are now undertaking EE programs, generally in compli-
ance with policy and regulatory obligations, to meet electricity demand cost-effec-
tively. Utilities in South Africa, Thailand and India have all supported EE. Efficient
lighting can substantially lower peak demand in all countries, but it is especially         85
important in countries with inadequate generation and weak distribution. Finally,
utilities in countries with subsidized tariffs that do not meet the cost of electricity
supply may seek to lighten the subsidy burden by curtailing demand through EE.
    As mentioned earlier, one of the most widely deployed utility EE programs
worldwide, the installation of CFLs (as in the example from Egypt above), is very
effective at cutting the peak demand load and saving energy. While some CFL
programs were financed entirely by the utilities concerned, which provided free
                   or subsidized CFLs to customers, others billed customers in installments through
                   the billing system. Despite these programs’ apparent success, many utilities have
                   been unable to sustain them without ongoing support from MDBs or other donors,
                   primarily for lack of regulatory mandates and inability to recover program costs
                   through tariff revisions.
                       Subsidized tariffs in many developing countries have discouraged program im-
                   plementation, although reduced electricity sales resulting from electricity savings
                   effectively reduce the subsidy burden. This underlines the need for an integrated
                   approach to EE, with well-defined regulatory incentives and sustainable financing

                   mechanisms.

                   Public benefits charge
                   National governments can raise finance to fund EE programs through a systems
                   benefit charge, which is placed on the customer’s utility bill and collected by the
                   utility. As a charge will raise the cost of energy for end users, it is best suited to
                   markets where the energy price is not subsidized. Otherwise, it would result in a
                   complicated finance mechanism in which government collects a charge to support
                   EE while reducing the cost of energy and thereby discouraging EE.
                       The resulting EE fund can then be used by governments to provide public fi-
                   nancing to support EE programs, which may be managed by the utility or state EE
                   agencies, or other public or private agencies permitted by the regulators to imple-
                   ment EE programs.
                       Where the electricity utilities are vertically integrated, state-owned monopolies,
                   this charge is collected and managed by the utility, as, for example, in California.
                   Where the electricity market is liberal, this charge is generally collected by the util-
                   ity companies and managed by a dedicated state agency or agencies, or by the util-
                   ities regulator (figure 4.9). Such funds allow EE development programs to address
                   technical, regulatory, and market barriers to EE and support program implemen-
                   tation through direct funding, incentives, and awareness and education initiatives.

ELEMENT 4.
CAPacity and awareness building 

The organizations and institutions directly in-
volved in implementation need the internal ca-
pacity to deliver on EE programs, including dedi-
cated, trained human resources with the expertise
to develop and deliver the sector-based programs
sustainably. In addition, effective implementa-
tion of EE policies requires that all stakeholders
are aware of the benefits of improved EE, which
calls for the preparation of strong and well-tar-
geted communication strategies. Element 4 in Figure 4.1 offers a few examples of
the measures that can be used to build capacity and awareness.
    Targeted efforts to build capacity are therefore an integral part of the enabling
environment, and should include education initiatives to meet the requirements of
all stakeholders. Germany (alongside the Netherlands and Denmark) is a global
leader on the policy mix for improving EE in the buildings sector.29 Germany’s
NEEAP indicates a strong governance framework, incorporating a good balance
of information and advisory programs with finance and incentive schemes for the
buildings sector, with minimum energy performance standards for new buildings
and those undergoing major renovations.
    Subsidies and policies can support highly efficient new buildings, designed to
ensure capacity development and provision of information activities. Financial

support, through grants and soft loans, is also available for single measures and for
comprehensive retrofits, as well as for new construction outperforming standards.
These actions go along with strong communication initiatives to inform and mo-
tivate end users as well as professionals to improve EE in buildings. Collectively,
the programs have achieved substantial market transformation in setting new stan-
dards.
    Although the overall objective of capacity-building initiatives and training pro-
grams is to promote EE and create awareness of the benefits and the importance
of reducing energy use, each sector has its own requirements. For example, within
the industrial sector companies, ESCOs, utilities, equipment manufacturers, energy
agencies, and commercial banks all need to understand why investment in EE is
important.
    Capacity building and training to consumers, project developers and lenders
are also necessary to promote EE in the services sector, as its consumers generally
have little information about the benefits of improved EE and the best options
open to them. An example of a comprehensive capacity-building policy for the
public sector can be found in the UK, where there is a strong public sector strategy,
clear rules and standards for public procurement, and good activities to establish
public buildings as a role model. The UK government buying standards program30          87

includes a set of technical performance specifications for energy consumption. It
has three key levels: the minimum mandatory standard, best-practice examples,
and the market leader. There is a web-based training program, supported by work-
shops that aim to reach as many procurers as possible.
    Capacity-building requirements change as a market matures, and so new infor-
mation and training programs will be needed (figure 4.10).

                   To operate successfully, ESCOs require the enabling regulatory framework and
                   environment to facilitate access to low-cost financing and sufficient awareness of
                   EE benefits. Specific actions are therefore often required to prepare the market
                   for ESCO financing by increasing the technical capacity of the relevant intuitions.
                   For example, in Mexico, EPS Capital conducted a staff training program for lo-
                   cal financial institutions, which included recommended approaches to evaluating
                   EE projects and the associated risks, and helped financial institutions understand
                   the ESCO performance models. EPS Capital Corp. also worked with NAFIN on
                   developing guarantee products to mitigate the risks perceived by local financial
                   institutions. More generally, support for EE could increase through clean energy
                   curricula deployed at schools, training institutes, and universities.
                       More generally, communications, capacity- and awareness-building initiatives
                   are needed to ensure that the market for EE products and services develops with
                   credibility and integrity. Certification programs would provide assurance to con-
                   sumers and build their confidence in EE investment. These programs should in-
                   clude manufacturers of EE equipment and appliances, as well as service providers
                   and equipment installers.
                       The potential for sharing public communications strategies exists. Building pub-
                   lic awareness of and support for the benefits of EE are essential to the success of
                   many EE measures. Such efforts would benefit from a shared language (Arabic)
                   and cultural similarities among countries. Today, most countries in the region share
                   the same or overlapping broadcast and other electronic media, so public informa-
                   tion campaigns can reach consumers in many countries cost-effectively.
ELEMENT 5.
Information and reporting

Developing and introducing a new EE policy is
the first step to delivering energy savings, real-
izing national economic benefits, and improving
social welfare. To sustain government commit-
ment and encourage continued investment in
EE, an evidence base will be needed, reporting
the national economic benefits from existing pol-
icies and raising the profile of EE in the country
as a whole. Element 5 in Figure 4.1 lists some of
the key information and reporting requirements.

EE improvments (MRV)
Reliable and robust MRV systems and program evaluation help ensure the achieve-
ment of EE policy goals. The data collected through the MRV systems can com-
municate the effectiveness of current initiatives. A standardized data gathering
methodology will enable the production of statistical reports that include cost-ef-
fectiveness and other performance metrics. Of critical importance is the setting of
baselines for energy consumption and efficiency against which to measure out-
comes of interventions, whether site-specific or sector-wide. The existing data
gathering and reporting systems in many MENA countries are likely to benefit
from internationally used systems such as the IPMVP (International Performance




                                                                                        Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
Measurement and Verification Protocol), which can be adapted.

Statistical Reporting
Another crucial piece of the enabling environment is timely provision of action-
able information to consumers. This can include, for instance, periodic real-time
information on energy consumption, the cost of that energy use, and possible steps
to reduce it. Metering systems have been effective internationally in reliably gath-
ering information on energy use and in monitoring energy savings. Outcomes from
individual measures can be aggregated by statistical systems into an account of the
national benefits of the overall EE program.
    Almost all consumers in Sudan have prepaid meters. The meter rollout pro-
gram arose in response to the high amount of nontechnical losses in the electrical
network and difficulties in collecting fees from customers. Through prepaid meter-
ing, customers can monitor their electricity consumption and can either purchase
electricity from the distribution company directly or pay through ATMs, mobile
banking, and the Internet. Before prepaid meters, overall system losses were in the
order of 40 percent annually. They are now about 25 percent. A substantial portion
of the 15 percent savings is due to a reduction in nontechnical losses. Sudan is also   89
considering introducing remote monitoring and accurate accounting of electrical
losses (RCREEE 2015).
    For their part, utilities and EE agencies can conduct customer load surveys to
understand energy consumption patterns over a day and seasonally, and design
suitable EE programs. Data analysis may be conducted at the customer sector and
end-use levels.
                   Best Practices
                   There is also a need to promote best practice and spread information on ways to
                   overcome barriers to EE programs. Stakeholders within MENA will also benefit
                   from sharing their own experiences of adapting EE finance and delivery mecha-
                   nisms and learning from the experiences of others within the region.
                      MENA countries are therefore likely to benefit from forming a regional work-
                   ing group of participants directly involved in EE programs. The Arab Ministerial
                   Council of Electricity has already formed such a group, which introduced NEEAP
                   to the region. Also, RCREEE acts as a regional platform that helps 16 MENA
90                 country progress with their EE plans. This parallels activity elsewhere: the Con-
                   certed Action group set up by the European Commission to support implementa-

                   Approaches to EE for net energy exporters and importers
                   Whether a country is a net energy exporter or importer has a direct bearing on the
                   priorities for national energy policy, and energy efficiency is no exception. It can
                   affect the industries and government agencies relevant to EE, public awareness and
                   support for EE, as well as the perceived national benefits from successful delivery
                   of EE.
                       This section looks first at the key differences between net energy (primarily oil,
                   but also natural gas) importing and oil-exporting countries, and then examines the
                   characteristic differences within these two main groupings. A series of high level
                   EE Action Plan templates that can be used to deliver on EE are then suggested as
                   a starting point for the groups of countries with similar characteristics.
                       Finally, the section presents options that may be appropriate for countries in the
                   three subregions of MENA.

                   Differences between net energy importing and exporting countries
                   Table 4.2, below, outlines how these countries are likely to differ in terms of how
                   the recent fall in oil prices is likely to affect them—the national policy drivers / mo-
                   tivation to improve EE, the general financial characteristics of oil exporters versus
                   oil importers (although it is recognized that there are some exceptions within this
                   general categorization).
                       Several other country-dependent market characteristics are likely to affect the
                   implementation of energy efficiency policies, the most significant of which are at
                   the bottom of the table.

Based on the characteristic differences within the two main groupings, decision trees
can be constructed to guide consideration of which of the suggested EE Action Plans,
or elements thereof, would be most appropriate. The key characteristics include:
        Energy market structure:
      1.	
           >	 In countries with state owned vertically integrated utilities EE
              programs driven by utilities are likely to be effective. Conversely,
           >	 In countries with liberalized energy markets the energy (utility) regulator
                                                                                                     91
              and/or dedicated state agency will have a more significant role.
        The level of capitalization / availability of finance is likely to affect the
      2.	
        ability to mobilize funds, and also the composition of those funds (private
        vs. public), and therefore the type and level of financial support required to
        support EE development.
        The stage of EE development is also a key consideration in deciding which
      3.	
        programs and measures are likely to be most effective. For an initiative to
                         be successful the market must be ready to receive and implement it. It is
                         therefore important to have:
                            >	 The necessary institutional structure is in place to support the
                              initiative.
                            >	 Finance available for investment.

                            >	 Public awareness/support for the initiative so consumers understand
                              benefits.

                   that liberalised energy markets include those with a single buyer and partial, some
                   or full unbundling. In deciding on which stage of EE development to assign to a
                   given country, the assessment of domestic experts should be considered alongside
                   information provided in this report and others, e.g. RCREEE (2015).
                       The countries can be grouped into one of 12 different categories (country
                   types), which share certain similarities in their approach to developing a successful
                   approach to delivering EE.
                       For these 12 country types (categories), eight high-level EE action plans aimed
                   at delievering EE were developed (Table 4.3). Only eight were developed, as some
                   of the action plans may be appropriate to more than one country type. For exam-
                   ple, countries with a vertically integrated energy market and a low availability of fi-
                   nance at the early stage of EE development are likely to adopt similar EE programs
                   and measures regardless of whether they are an oil importer or an oil exporter.
                   However, the net oil exporter will benefit economically from increased exports and
                   reduced energy intensity, whereas the net oil importer will benefit from increased
                   security of supply resulting from less outages and the ability to afford to invest in
                   grid/network infrastructure.

                   Potential for EE by sector and subregion
                   Chapter 1 presented estimates of the approximate energy-savings potential from
                   different sectors. Preparing such estimates is an art, and no two sets of estimates
                   will be the same. Still, such estimates provide useful guidance at various stages of
                   prioritizing activities. Table 4.4 highlights the shares of energy potential in the elec-
                   tricity sector, and the three selected end-use sectors in each of the countries within
                   the MENA subregions; i.e. industry, services, and residential (recall that this report
                   does not consider the transport and agriculture sectors). The red boxes highlight
                   Priority 1 areas, the yellow boxes Priority 2 areas for each country.
102                    The remainder of this chapter will first briefly consider options for EE in the
                   electricity sector, as the potential is very large in most MENA countries and does

                   not differ much from sub-region to sub-region. The large potential in the electricity
                   sector reflects in some countries the result of past or ongoing conflict, and for other
                   countries it is due to persistent underinvestment in infrastructure. It often reflects
                   greater efficiency in generation, such as converting single-cycle gas turbine power
                   plants to combined-cycle gas turbines.
                       After shortly considering the electricity sector, the chapter will describe options
                   for EE in each of the three selected end use sectors organized by Sub-Region:
                   Maghreb, Masgreq, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

Region-wide options for EE in the electricity sector
All stakeholders could benefit from efficiency improvements in the electricity
supply-side operation, as the gains would also result in an increased reliability of
electricity supply and therefore fewer blackouts. The electrical utilities will benefit
substantially from reduced system losses, which will ultimately lower the need to
invest in new generation, transmission, and distribution capacity. In the countries
with the greatest potential to improve EE in the electricity generation sector, the
utilities are all vertically integrated and state-owned monopolies. Thus, the utilities
are the best positioned to deliver the improvement programs.

Enabling environment

    >	 Policy and regulation: Governments need to agree on an overall plan,
      such as the NEEAPs that many countries in the MENA region have
      already adopted, that includes EE targets and associated timelines with
      the utilities.
    >	 Institutions and organizations: Clear roles and responsibilities for EE
      and regulatory mandates, or voluntary obligations for utilities, need to
      be set.
    >	 Finance:

          •	 More cost-reflective prices and efficient collection, alongside EE
           policies and measures to allow public funds to be made available




                                                                                          Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
           for investment in EE improvements, should be brought in gradually.
          •	 Public funds could be combined with funding from international
           donor agencies to maximize funding.
          •	 Governments could also consider introducing a public benefits
           charge when retail prices become more fully reflective of costs.
    >	 Communications and capacity building: Training programs at
      utilities are essential. A well-planned and -targeted national/regional
      communication and awareness campaign is essential.
    >	 Reporting and information: A benchmark is needed to compare and
      track EE improvements.

Recommended first measures
The first step in preparing to deliver an EE improvement program is to prepare the
market and to create awareness among stakeholders that may benefit from the pro-
gram. The stakeholders, and indeed the public, should understand that the delivery
of EE is a long journey and that it takes time for individuals to notice the benefits.
At the outset, the following initial measures are thus recommended:                       103
    >	 Gradual introduction of more cost-reflective prices alongside EE
      policies and measures.
    >	 EE training program for utilities.

    >	 National EE awareness campaigns.
   These are likely to improve awareness, particularly within the utilities, which
will provide a firm foundation to progress to the next stage.
                   Intermediate measures

                        >	 Convert existing power plants using crude oil to combined-cycle gas
                            power plants.
                        >	 Lower transmission losses by strengthening the grid and its
                            maintenance and management.
                        >	 Reduce losses in the distribution network by adopting better
                            distribution planning and improving maintenance and management.
                        >	 Rebalance loads across phases and improve maintenance standards.

                   The following tables indicate the considerable potential for improving EE across
                   each of the end use sectors, although the delivery mechanism is likely to vary by
                   subregion due to market characteristics. The greatest potential for end use EE im-
                   provement is in the industry and residential sectors (table 4.4). Options for appro-

                   EE initiatives are already taking place—programs in Tunisia are the most advanced,
                   notably EE industrial improvements. Industrial establishments with annual energy
                   consumption exceeding 800 toe have energy audits, dedicated energy managers,
                   and energy reports submitted annually—all mandatory.
                       For new industrial projects whose total projected energy consumption exceeds
                   800 toe a year, prior consultation with ANME is mandatory, as it is for new con-
                   struction projects for residential and services sectors whose total projected en-
                   ergy consumption exceeds 200 toe a year. New industrial projects or expansion
                   of existing industrial facilities whose total annual projected energy consumption
                   exceeds 7,000 toe require prior authorization from the ministry in charge of energy.
                   A dedicated EE unit in a Tunisian bank has expanded the flow of EE projects and
                   demand for financing, pointing to one possible means of scaling up investments
                   elsewhere.
   In view of progress toward EE improvement and the capabilities of utilities in
the subregion, utility-delivered programs are appropriate. Outsourcing EE program
implementation to ESCOs may also be highly relevant.
   Based on the comparisons of retail electricity prices and the estimates of energy
savings potential in chapter 1, Algeria and Tunisia will benefit greatly from invest-
ment in EE.

With a liberalized electricity supply market in Jordan and West Bank and Gaza,
obliging energy suppliers to deliver EE improvements to the end use sectors could
be effective. Outsourcing program implementation to ESCOs is also highly relevant.
    Utilities in Egypt and Lebanon have been modernizing and are expanding ca-
pacity to deliver EE programs to end use sectors. Many distribution utilities in
Egypt, for instance, are already leading EE programs, such as distribution of ef-
ficient lights and provision of EE audits, through dedicated EE divisions. Where
utilities have less capacity to address end use EE, such as Iraq, setting up one or
more dedicated EE agencies may be appropriate.

                   considerable benefits to all subregional countries, particularly Jordan and West
                   Bank and Gaza. Because the residential sector in Lebanon is growing rapidly, now
                   is a good time to inform consumers, especially new ones, of the importance of
                   EE. Egypt has already begun to take action to improve the efficiency of lighting in

Box 4.2. EE programs in Egypt

 Egypt began to address EE relatively early, although for some years the scope of activity
 was limited. In the 1980s, an ECEP project funded by USAID targeted large factories for
 EE improvements.
     In the 1990s the Energy Efficiency Improvement and Green House Gas Reduction




                                                                                                 Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
 (EEIGGR) project, financed by GEF and implemented by UNDP        , helped to establish energy
 performance standards and labels for six types of equipment as well as energy codes for
 new residential, commercial, and government buildings. That project also established a
 USD 1.5 million revolving guarantee fund to support loans for EE projects in industry. The
 project has, among other outcomes, contributed to ESCO promotion, EE in residential,
 commercial, and public (street lighting) sectors, and raised public awareness.
     In the 2010s, a cabinet-level Energy Efficiency Unit (EEU) was established to promote
 scale-up of EE and to set a clear EE strategy. In parallel, several EE programs exist in key
 energy supply and demand sectors. The most important of these currently are the NEEAP
 adopted in 2015 by the Ministry of Electricity, the EE in Industry project supported by
 UNIDO, and the Green Tourism initiative under the Ministry of Tourism.
     On July 24, 2007, the Supreme Council of Energy issued a decision on using energy-
 saving light bulbs and phasing out incandescent light bulbs in household. Measures taken
 since 2010 in accordance with the decision include issuing energy efficiency standards
 for high-efficiency lighting systems, and providing technical assistance and preparing
 the feasibility studies and technical for factories to encourage local manufacturing of
 energy-saving light bulbs. There are now 10 manufacturers of efficient lighting products
 in Egypt, including three component manufacturers. Approximately 10 million energy-
 saving bulbs have been sold through distribution companies under an initiative of the
 Ministry of Electricity and Energy, which requires that EE lamps be sold at half the price in
 cash or in installments, giving a guarantee period of 18 months. A second phase of the EE
                                                                                                 109
 lighting began in 2014 to distribute 10 million LED lamps to residential and commercial
 customers. The LED’s were acquired through bulk public procurement, which led to prices
 in the range of USD 3.00 to 3.50 per lamp. A third phase will distribute 50 million lamps
 using a similar approach.
     Although solar water heaters have been in use in Egypt since the 1980s, penetration
 has been limited. In 2014, an EE program under the Ministry of Industry aimed to scale up
 and locally manufacture solar water heaters for residential, commercial and industrial use.

                   It is hard to overstate the importance of promoting EE in industry in this subre-
                   gion. Egypt has substantial potential for improving EE in the sector (28 percent),
                   and has already undertaken significant efforts to exploit that potential (box 4.3)
                   Given current levels of cost recovery in retail pricing (32 percent), the country
                   would likely gain notable economic benefits from investment, particularly in ce-
                   ment and petrochemicals. Some possible further steps include:
                       >	 Establish reliable, widely accepted benchmarks for key industries, e.g., steel,
                         cement, fertilizers and petrochemicals.
                       >	 Establish energy databases and enforce EE standards for key equipment,
                         including electricity motors and boilers, across sectors.
                       >	 Mandate utilities to conduct energy audits in small and medium enterprises.

                       >	 Mandate energy-intensive industries to conform to the standards of ISO
                         50001 or an equivalent energy-management protocol.
                       >	 Launch industry-specific information and awareness programs.

Table 4.7 indicates the share of total EE potential attributable to the three end use
sectors in each country. Most of the countries are likely to benefit substantially
from improved EE, particularly in industry. Bahrain, UAE, and Yemen would also
benefit in services and Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia in the residential sector.

                   Looking ahead
                   There is no shortage of opportunities for EE across the MENA region. Even those,
                   such as the Maghreb countries, that have already made strides and accumulated a
                   wealth of experience in good practices have great potential. This chapter present-

                   residential sectors, the relatively few near- and medium-term measures described
                   above are likely to deliver significant results, as countries implement their respec-
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   tive NEEAPs and other EE commitments in the coming years. (Although not ad-
                   dressed in this report, the transport sector requires future attention, ideally in the
                   context of national and urban transportation planning.)
                       Relatively advanced countries can benefit from introducing more-targeted EE
                   programs aimed at well-defined sets of energy consumers to stimulate demand
                   for EE services. This would, among other things, help to build the environment
                   needed to sustain a functioning market for ESCOs and other dedicated providers
                   of efficiency services. The goal would be to create an EE market that would grad-
                   ually require less public support and eventually rely mainly on private activity at
                   commercial scale.
                       MENA countries at earlier stages of developing their approaches to EE may
                   find it effective to adopt relatively modest targets that will be reached quickly, with
                   the aim of fostering the public support and stakeholder buy-in needed to proceed
                   with more ambitious activities.
                       Countries with heavily subsidized energy prices might wish to focus on attain-
                   ing EE gains first in the public sector and through regulatory means, such as min-
                   imum energy performance standards (MEPS), while gradually introducing energy
                   subsidy reforms. These countries may also find it productive to launch national
                   campaigns to raise awareness for why EE is becoming a matter of national impor-
                   tance, and build public support for improving EE and lifting energy subsidies.
                       To ensure continuous attainment of the energy savings that greater efficiency
                   promises, regular fine-tuning of energy plans based on robust monitoring and eval-
                   uation is essential—all of which requires dedicated resources and growing institu-
                   tional capacity. Strengthening the enabling environment remains a challenge even
                   for countries in other regions that are leaders in EE.
                       Finally, while many of the steps described above can be taken by countries by
                   themselves, other steps, to be most effective, would benefit from concerted action
                   by countries acting together, such as harmonization of standards and labels for
                   energy-consuming appliances and equipment. This approach would enhance the
                   integration of markets and provide strong incentives to enhance the supply chains
                   for more efficient equipment.
Appendix 1.

Assessing energy use—data sources,
assumptions, caveats, and methods
Reliable data for energy consumption in specific subsectors of the economy are not
readily available in most MENA countries, hindering the robust analysis required
to develop effective policies and measures. The exceptions are Egypt, Jordan, Leb-
anon, Morocco, and Tunisia, which have conducted surveys to estimate demand
and potential for EE. In preparing projections of energy consumption and savings,
RCREEE (2014) drew on publicly available national, regional, and international
data sources (table A1.1).

                   ly projecting the savings in the base year to the estimated final and primary energy
                   consumption in the future years. The savings in primary energy consumption in
                   each country reflects standard fuel conversion efficiencies for electricity generation
                   to the estimated savings in final energy consumption.

                       This business-as-usual approach is consistent with the practice for first-level
                   analysis and provides a useful indicator, which can later be refined as better in-
                   formation becomes available. However, a business-as-usual analysis ignores the
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   impacts of improvements in energy use as countries adopt more efficient devices
                   and appliances and reduce their energy intensity as their economies shift toward
                   the services sector, which typically is less energy intensive than the industrial sec-
                   tor. The analysis also ignores the impact of the recent fuel subsidy (tariff) reforms
                   in some MENA countries.
                       The converse could also be true in energy-producing MENA countries, which
                   may experience an increase in overall energy intensity as production of primary
                   energy rises in response to global demand. The business-as-usual analysis may be
                   especially ill suited to countries such as Egypt, Morocco, and the United Arab
                   Emirates, which are rapidly modernizing their energy infrastructure.
                       The potential for EE in MENA countries is substantial, despite the challenge
                   posed by lack of reliable data at a disaggregated level of energy consumption. An
                   ESMAP study (2009) for the MENA region estimated that improved EE would
                   generate benefits of 0.5–1 percent of GDP, and a 20 percent improvement in EE
                   throughout the region was estimated to lead to GDP gains of $11 billion (2004
                   prices), with Egypt, Iran, Morocco, and Tunisia reaping about half the benefits.
                   The study identified potential for energy savings through reduced gas flaring and
                   lowered transmission and distribution losses.
                       These estimates show that, far from improving their efficiency of energy use,
                   MENA countries increased their energy intensity even as energy intensity declined
                   in many other countries (Figure 1).
                       Some countries have taken steps to improve EE, however. Tunisia reduced en-
                   ergy intensity by around 18 percent over 1980–2006. ESMAP (2009) estimated
                   that the gain in EE during 2005–07 resulted in annual fuel savings of 390 kilotons
                   of oil equivalent (ktoe), or 0.7 percent of the country’s annual energy consumption,
                   worth $40 million.
                       Even energy exporters in the region that have very high-energy intensities are
                   taking actions to improve efficiency. For instance, at the recent Conference of Par-
                   ties (COP) meeting on Climate Change held in December 2014 in Lima, a side
                   event on EE in the GCC countries highlighted the importance of EE to their econ-
                   omies (IISD 2014). Saudi Arabia is promoting EE by consumers and has estab-
                   lished the Saudi Energy Efficiency Center (SEEC), responsible for demand-side
                   management and EE projects.
    A key challenge for improved EE in MENA countries are energy price subsi-
dies, which substantially lower consumers’ financial incentive to adopt energy-effi-
cient technologies (see section below).
    Energy pricing, the impact of price signals, the cost and availability of energy-ef-
ficient appliances, and the policy and market environment all vary greatly among
MENA countries and affect uptake of EE measures. Estimating the market or eco-
nomic potential for EE in the region is thus a major undertaking requiring huge
data and resources—the focus of this assessment is therefore on the gross technical
potential for EE in the MENA countries as a tool for targeting policy efforts.
    While several standard approaches and methodologies are available to esti-
mate the technical potential for EE in various sectors of an economy, differences
among MENA countries in reliability of data, market, and economic conditions,
limit the options that can be applied uniformly. For instance, the use of energy
intensity indicators such as tons of oil equivalent (toe) per unit of gross domestic
product (GDP), while useful, may not capture or differentiate among the differ-
ent structures of countries’ economic sectors. However, the use of specific energy
consumption norms such as toe per square meter per year (toe/m2/y) for energy
use in commercial or residential buildings tons of fuel use per unit output in the
industrial sector, while more reliable and comparable across countries, is limited
by paucity of data.
    The technical potential in this assessment includes several indicators depending
on sector and data availability (table A1.2). The technical potential for EE in each
MENA country has been estimated for the base year of 2011 or 2012, depending
on the year for which the most reliable information was available, and based on




                                                                                           Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
norms for EE applicable to the MENA region (RCREEE 2010). The use of such
regional norms for EE is reasonably reliable for countries in the same subregion
(Mediterranean, Gulf, and North Africa). Specifically, for the residential sector,
the assumption is that energy consumption norms are applicable for countries in
the same climatic zone and comparable across countries with similar socioeco-
nomic and market conditions. Detailed end use energy consumption data (in the
residential, services, and industrial sectors) were available for Jordan, and were
used in more detailed assessments of the potential for EE in MENA countries. The
potential for EE in the residential sector includes the savings from use of efficient
lighting and solar water heating systems.
    The norms for energy consumption and the potential for EE are also informed
by cost abatement curves for energy-efficient technologies developed for a set of
MENA countries for the industry, transport, services, residential, and agriculture
and fishing sectors. The cost abatement curves were developed under the MED-
ENEC and MED-EMIP European Union Southern Mediterranean regional proj-
ects for Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia, and were developed based
on extensive data collection, compilation, and simulation. This earlier study esti-
mated the potential for electricity savings in 2020 through selected technologies
and solar water heating in the industry, services, and residential sectors.                117

Benefits of utility delivery of EE
Utilities have considerable technical expertise in managing electricity systems, but
may lack experience in providing specialized services to customers that are not
in their core area of technical or management expertise. Utilities have the oppor-
tunity to collaborate with other firms and leverage other resources to deliver EE
services to customers that not only enhance service delivery and effectiveness, but
can spawn business opportunities (figure A2.1).

Implementation of policies and regulations. Enforcing state-imposed mandates is
not easy, especially in developing countries, where capacity and resources are of-
ten allocated to other urgent needs. Utilities, with their expertise in energy service
delivery and their licensing requirements, can facilitate the delivery of EE services.
Utilities can also undertake supply-side efficiency improvements, which present a
vast potential for EE in many countries, especially where utilities are under state
ownership and have underinvested in electric power systems.

Delivery of financing. Given their commercial relationship with customers, utilities
can channel available incentives and rebates through customer bills. Customers
can also pay in installments. Utilities also have leverage over customers to ensure
that payments are prompt. This is a key advantage in many developing countries,
where ESCOs and other EE providers can struggle to receive payment for equip-
ment and services, especially from residential and small commercial customers.
                                                                                                              119
Utilities are in a better position to forge partnerships with equipment and appli-
ance manufacturers and suppliers to procure EE equipment. By undertaking large
EE programs or bundling projects, utilities can tap into climate change mitigation
funds. In countries with Energy Savings Certificate programs, utilities can help
customers undertake EE projects and generate or trade certificates. EE programs
in developing countries can also generate carbon credits that can provide an ad-
ditional source of revenue to the utilities and participating customers, which can
bring down the EE costs.
                   Responsiveness to customer needs. Utilities know energy demand patterns and so
                   are in a good position to design programs that benefit both customers and them-
                   selves. For instance, utilities can work with customers to identify opportunities
                   to curtail or shift loads through improved EE and DSM programs. This is espe-
                   cially true for industrial and large commercial customers. Advanced metering and
                   customer surveys can help target customer loads. Utilities also are aware of the
                   barriers to adoption of EE, both within the utility and for customers, and can de-
                   sign programs that help overcome them. For instance, residential consumers with
                   subsidized tariffs and/or low incomes may have little incentive to install efficient
120
                   equipment. Utilities can develop programs that help overcome the price barrier,
                   such as on-bill repayment, alongside longer-term strategies to increase tariffs. Fi-
                   nally, utility delivery of EE helps build better relations with customers, which has

                   Collaborating with local firms and other agencies. Without regulation that requires
                   otherwise, utilities do not generally consider provision of EE services a core com-
                   petency, and may prefer to outsource delivery of EE to professional energy firms
                   such as ESCOs. This approach harnesses specialized expertise for EE programs
                   and can create business opportunities for local firms. In many countries, the ESCO
                   industry has developed by working in collaboration with local utilities. Utilities
                   can also serve as a bridge between consumers and EE institutions and other gov-
                   ernment agencies and trade associations, which seek to promote EE in support of
                   national goals.

                   Technical and management expertise in program implementation. Utilities’ tech-
                   nical and management expertise in operating and managing power systems can be
                   deployed in EE. Utilities understand that effecting change and realizing the full
                   benefits of EE take time, and their long-standing relationships with customers are
                   an added advantage. Achieving success in EE program delivery typically requires
                   collaborating with local businesses and external consultants.

                   Sustainability of EE programs. As long-term suppliers of energy services, utilities
                   can deliver sustained EE services and programs to customers, which is essential
                   given that the savings from EE measures need to be sustained through periodic
                   replacements with equivalent or more efficient equipment depending on equip-
                   ment lifetimes. It is in the interest of utilities to ensure that customers sustain EE
                   programs, which will bring the utility the certainty it needs to consider EE as a
                   resource that can displace or delay additional generation to meet growing demand.
Appendix 3.

Other examples of utility delivery of EE
CLP Power, in Hong Kong SAR, China, facilitates free energy audits for its com-
mercial and industrial customers to identify EE opportunities and provides loans
to customers to adopt EE measures. It has conducted more than 1,300 audits. Its
primary motivation is to benefit from a higher return on equity offered to regulated
utilities in the territory, where the authorities encourage customers to pursue EE
that makes demonstrable energy savings. 34
    In Portugal, the Energy Services Regulatory Entity (ERSE) periodically tenders
for EE projects under its Promotion Plan of Efficiency in the Consumption of
Electrical Energy. Utilities and other eligible entities may bid for these projects and
receive funding from the plan.
    In countries with weak electricity capacity, it is usually in the utility’s interest
to run customer EE programs regardless of regulatory requirements, especially in
developing countries facing multiple challenges in meeting fast-growing demand.
    The Reliance Infrastructure Limited (Rinfra) serves some 3 million electrici-
ty consumers in Mumbai, India. It has undertaken several programs to reduce
peak demand with the support of the regulator, the Maharashtra Energy Regu-
latory Commission. Rinfra launched the Mumbai Efficient Lighting Program to
help small residential and commercial consumers replace inefficient incandescent
lamps with CFLs. Customers paid for the new lamps through their utility bills. The




                                                                                           Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
program sold 617,000 CFLs with estimated annual energy savings of 48 GWh.
    Also in India, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) in Bengaluru
launched the Bangalore Efficient Lighting Program with the Bureau of Energy Ef-
ficiency and funding from USAID. BESCOM offered vouchers to residential cus-
tomers for CFL lamps procured from major manufacturers. Customers then repaid
the cost of the lamp over nine months through their electricity bills. The program
sold 300,000 CFLs, leading to estimated energy savings of 24 GWh and demand
reduction of perhaps 13 MW.35
    In Bangladesh, under the Efficient Lighting Initiative of Bangladesh (ELIB)
program, the World Bank financed a loan to replace some 10 million incandescent
lamps with CFLs. The CFLs were provided free to residential customers in 10 cities
willing to replace incandescent lamps. The program, which required an investment
of about $15 million, aims for a 360 MW reduction in energy demand. The pro-
gram also benefits from carbon credits, which could contribute $5 million–10 mil-
lion in revenues, bringing down the cost of implementing the program.
    Eskom, the utility in South Africa, also initiated EE measures to counter a se-
vere shortfall in generation capacity in 2008. Eskom launched a National Efficient
Lighting Project to replace incandescent lamps with CFLs and followed it with a
CFL Sustainability Project. These initiatives have very significantly reduced de-          121
mand—by about 2,000 MW—and have resulted in annual energy savings of about
7 TWh.
    Many utilities in New England in the United States bid in a competitive auction
to implement EE projects in a forward capacity market operated by the ISO New
England, which seeks to competitively procure EE on an equivalent basis with
generation resources to meet future demand. EE projects, mainly from utilities,
account for a fourth of the bids received by the ISO, and the utilities benefit from
                   the revenues, which they use to supplement the costs of their other EE projects.
                       RWE, the largest power producer in Germany, has launched subsidiary busi-
                   nesses that profitably provide EE services to industrial customers, generating about
                   €500 million a year. A new subsidiary will provide EE services to residential cus-
                   tomers. RWE has implemented some 10,000 projects over five years, which range
                   from advisory services to installation and awareness programs.
                       Some utilities provide EE services to build stronger relationships with custom-
                   ers and to fulfill objectives of corporate social responsibility—also helping them
                   identify new opportunities. In Austria, for example, heating oil suppliers to indus-
122
                   try help customers identify and replace inefficient boilers with new ones that can
                   reduce energy use by up to 40 percent. The program has reduced oil use by about
                   11 percent. The program also helps entities meet EE obligations under European
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   Union directives.
                       Utilities in Finland have adopted voluntary agreements to support customers’
                   EE efforts. The utility prepares reports on trends in energy consumption by its
                   customers and provides benchmarks. A majority of customers participate in the
                   program. Utilities have increased revenues by providing additional services. The
                   program has helped reduce residential energy demand by 1–3 percent.
                       In Sweden, Kalmar Energi, a combined heat and power utility, provides ad-
                   visory and installation services for customers who wish to displace oil or electric
                   heating with district heating to meet both space and process heating needs. The
                   utility provides complete services, including financing to help customers evaluate
                   options for fuel switching to reduce heating costs.

Background to strategies for three
priority sectors
Detailed assessments of energy use in the three sectors are not readily available.
RCREEE (2014) estimates of the potential for EE reflect broad assumptions of
energy intensity and consumption norms (see appendix 1).

Industry
Improved EE in the industrial sector will result in energy savings of up to 20 per-
cent (or about 66 Mtoe) in 2025 (table A4.1). But this very heterogeneous sector
includes a wide range of industries that deploy diverse fuels, manufacturing pro-
cesses, and equipment and appliances.

Priority countries. Of the 17 MENA economies examined by RCREEE (2014), 12
have potential to reduce energy use by at least 10 percent by 2025 compared with
the business-as-usual scenario (see table A4.1, appendix 1).

                                                                                      123
   Some of the countries with the highest potential for EE in their industrial sec-
tors have large energy resource endowments. This may indicate inefficiency in
countries where energy prices are very low. But even in countries with few or no
commercial energy resources, the potential for EE is significant.
                   Conduct detailed assessments of the potential for EE. The first step should be for
                   countries to undertake detailed assessments of energy use in the industrial sector
                   categorized by type and size of industry, and assess the potential for EE through
                   efficient industrial processes and equipment use. The energy audits should help
                   countries identify the potential for savings both in industrial processes, through a
                   shift to more efficient process technologies, and in equipment, through more effi-
                   cient motor-drive, lighting, and heating systems.
                       Detailed assessments by Jordan, Lebanon, and Morocco have shown that the
                   potential for EE in the industrial sector involves the use of efficient motors and
124
                   improvements in compressed air systems (RCREEE 2013). Motors drive systems
                   and typically constitute a significant proportion of electricity use in industries. A
                   program to install energy-efficient motors is generally cost effective in process in-
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   dustries where motor drive systems operate almost continuously. The 12 coun-
                   tries should conduct customer and metering surveys to examine the potential for
                   cost-effective replacement of inefficient motors with energy-efficient motors.

                   Energy audits. A program to support energy audits in small and medium indus-
                   tries can identify the potential for EE in processes and equipment (large industries
                   generally have the technical expertise to identify EE opportunities on their own).
                   Energy audit programs could be supported through the state EE agency and imple-
                   mented by eligible auditors or by ESCOs.

                   Program implementation mechanisms. Regulations could mandate energy audits
                   in industrial facilities that consume energy above a predetermined level (to be iden-
                   tified through surveys of industrial facilities). EE opportunities in the industrial
                   sector can be implemented by utilities and ESCOs, or directly by customers. Utili-
                   ty-driven and ESCO programs have the advantage of reducing the risk of achieving
                   savings through use of performance contracts that guarantee savings to the facility
                   and ensure that only cost-effective programs are implemented.

                   Program financing mechanisms. Utility-implemented programs for the industrial
                   sector can derive support from customer energy bills or through dedicated EE funds
                   channeled through utilities. Fiscal incentives such as tax rebates and exemption on
                   EE equipment are also popular means of incentivizing industrial consumers.
                       Industrial EE programs may also be implemented by ESCOs with specialized
                   knowledge. ESCO-run programs may be financed through the ESCO or directly
                   by customers with financing from commercial banks. Given the region’s relative
                   lack of experience with the ESCO concept and the perceived risk, which inhibits
                   commercial financing of EE projects, it may be necessary to develop credit lines
                   and EE funds specifically to meet the financing needs for EE in the industrial sec-
                   tor. Financing could be channeled through ESCOs or customers could be directly
                   financed, but savings would be guaranteed through performance contracts.

                   Monitoring and verification. Metering systems are the preferred option for moni-
                   toring and verification of savings achieved through EE measures implemented in
                   the industrial sector. ESCO performance contracts may also be based on a deemed
                   savings approach for certain EE measures to reduce monitoring costs.

                   Capacity building and awareness programs. Capacity building and training are es-
                   sential for promoting EE in this sector, and such programs should be targeted at all
                   stakeholders, including industries, ESCOs, utilities, EE agencies, and commercial
banks. It is important that countries leverage the strength of the private sector, in-
cluding equipment manufacturers and suppliers, chambers of commerce, and trade
associations, to educate stakeholders and build capacity and create awareness.

Residential sector
Improved EE in the residential sector will likely result in energy savings of about
22 percent (or about 57,000 ktoe) in 2025. The residential sector comprises two
distinct types of customers—apartments and independent single-family dwellings.
Residential customers may be further categorized as renters and owners. The ap-
proach to implementing EE will need to be tailored for these customer segments
because their options and motivations may well vary. A key challenge for EE in
the residential sector is subsidized energy pricing, which undermines customers’
motivation to invest in EE.
    Apart from the differences in type of dwelling, residential customer segments
are homogeneous, as they use similar equipment and appliances. However, there
could be key differences in the way they procure and operate equipment since
apartment dwellers. Renters may have little or no control over equipment and
appliances that are installed by builders or property owners, while owners of sin-
gle-family dwellings may have more choices. Another difference is that the design
of apartment buildings can be more easily regulated than single-family dwellings to
include stringent building codes and standards.

Priority countries. Sixteen economies (table A4.2) have potential to reduce energy
use by at least 10 percent by 2025 compared with the business-as-usual scenario.

                   Conduct detailed assessments of the potential for EE. The first step should be for
                   countries to undertake detailed assessments of energy use in the residential sector
                   to estimate the potential among apartments and single-family dwellings and further
                   categorize the potential for savings among homeowners and renters who have dif-
                   ferent motivations to save energy and different potential for EE.
                       Detailed assessments by Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia have
                   shown that the potential for EE in the residential sector involves the use of efficient
                   lighting, solar hot water systems, efficient refrigerators and washing machines, and
                   better housekeeping measures (RCREEE 2013). The potential for EE in specific
126
                   customer segments of the residential sector has not been assessed. Typically, lights,
                   water heaters, and refrigerators are the main energy-consuming end uses in homes.
                   The potential for savings in these systems is significant and generally cost effective

                   (depending on energy prices). The potential for EE through revised building codes
                   and standards remains unexamined, but could be substantial in countries with
                   large apartment buildings. Renters typically are not motivated to undertake EE,
                   especially if the cost of energy is included in the rent.

                   Energy audits. A program to support energy audits in residential dwellings (apart-
                   ments and single-family dwellings) can identify the potential for EE in these sec-
                   tors. Energy audit programs could be supported through the state EE agency and
                   implemented by eligible auditors or ESCOs.

                   Program implementation mechanisms. The implementation mechanism best suited
                   for the residential sector depends on the customer segment and end use. Regula-
                   tions that mandate building codes and standards are effective means of ensuring
                   improved building designs that reduce energy use, especially in apartment build-
                   ings. Appliance performance standards and labeling programs can improve EE
                   among all customer segments.
                       EE programs for the residential sector may be implemented by utilities and
                   ESCOs or directly by customers. Utilities have the advantage of knowing customer
                   demand and have metering systems in place that help identify opportunities and
                   monitor program success. Utility-driven lighting replacement programs have been
                   widely implemented in many countries.
                       Enforcing building codes and standards can, however, be challenging and will
                   require efforts by all concerned, including architects, builders, and contractors.
                   Appliance labeling and performance standards are more readily applied since they
                   can potentially phase out inefficient equipment in the long term.

                   Program financing mechanisms. Utility-implemented programs for the residential
                   sector can be financed through customer energy bills or through dedicated EE funds
                   channeled through utilities or EE agencies. Given the subsidized energy prices, it
                   may be necessary to mobilize public funds and IFI/donor financing to undertake
                   EE. The objective of using public funds for EE would be to effectively shift the bur-
                   den of tariff subsidies to purchase of efficient appliances. Customer financing of EE
                   is feasible in countries that do not subsidize energy or are reforming energy prices.

                   Monitoring and verification. Metering systems and deemed energy savings based
                   on consumption norms for EE appliances are preferred options for monitoring
                   and verification of savings achieved through EE measures implemented in build-
                   ings and appliances used in this sector. Building codes and standards are enforced
through regulations, and a strict monitoring and compliance system must be put in
place in the permitting process.

Capacity building and awareness programs. Capacity building and training are
important for promoting EE in the sector because these customers frequently do
not have adequate information and knowledge of EE options. Capacity building
programs should be targeted at all stakeholders, including homeowners, ESCOs,
utilities, and EE agencies. It is important that countries leverage the strength of
the private sector, including equipment manufacturers and suppliers, to educate
stakeholders, build capacity, and create awareness.

Services sector
Improved EE in the services sector will result in energy savings of up to 13 percent
(or about 40 Mtoe) in 2025. The services sector comprises two distinct types of
customers: private commercial buildings (offices, hotels, hospitals, and so on) and
public facilities that include buildings (schools, hospitals, and municipal buildings),
street lighting, and water pumping systems. The approach to implementing EE will
need to be tailored to these two segments.
    The two customer segments are homogeneous to the extent that both segments
operate buildings, which use similar equipment and appliances. But there could
be key differences in the way they procure and operate equipment given that the
commercial sector generally pays unsubsidized prices for energy. The public sector
typically uses government budget allocations to pay energy bills, which may be
subsidized. The motivation to implement EE measures may thus be very different.

Conduct detailed assessments of the potential for EE. First, countries should un-
dertake detailed assessments of energy use in the services sector to estimate the
potential among private and public sector customers. This will further categorize
                   the potential for savings in principal customer segments such as buildings, street
                   lighting, water pumping, schools, hospitals, etc., which all have different energy use
                   characteristics and different potential for EE.
                       Detailed assessments by Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia have
                   shown that the potential for EE in the services sector (as in the residential sector)
                   appears to be principally through efficient street lighting and installation of solar
                   water heater systems. The potential for EE specifically in the commercial segment
                   of the services sector has not been estimated. Usually lighting, space conditioning,
                   and water pumping are the principal end uses in building energy systems. The
128
                   potential for savings in these systems is high, especially in old buildings. The cost
                   effectiveness of implementing EE measures in buildings would depend on the price
                   of energy. Buildings owned by the public sector generally depend on public funds
WORLD BANK GROUP




                   allocations to pay their bills and may generate little motivation to undertake EE.
                       EE for street lighting is typically cost effective from a societal perspective and
                   is relatively easy to adopt if funds are available. Countries should assess the mer-
                   its of installing efficient street lighting, which include efficient lamps and control
                   systems. Similarly, EE measures in public water pumping systems could generate
                   high savings, given that water supply and sewerage systems use large motor pump
                   systems that run continuously.

                   Energy audits. A program to support energy audits in private and public sector
                   buildings and in municipal street lighting and sewerage systems can identify the po-
                   tential for EE in these sectors. Energy audit programs could be supported through
                   the state EE agency and implemented by eligible auditors or ESCOs.

                   Program implementation mechanisms. The implementation mechanism best suited
                   for the services sector depends on the customer segment and end use to be target-
                   ed. Regulations that mandate building codes and standards and appliance perfor-
                   mance standards and labeling programs are applicable to both public and private
                   customer segments and are perhaps the most effective means of improving the
                   efficiency of energy use in buildings. EE programs can be implemented by utilities
                   and ESCOs or directly by customers. Utility-driven and ESCO programs have the
                   advantage of reducing the risk of achieving savings through use of performance
                   contracts that guarantee savings to the facility and ensure that only cost-effective
                   programs are implemented. Enforcing building codes and standards can, however,
                   be challenging and will require efforts by all concerned stakeholders, including
                   architects, builders, and contractors.
                       Improvements in street lighting and water pumping systems are perhaps best
                   undertaken by municipalities or EE agencies, who may wish to outsource the im-
                   plementation to ESCOs or to equipment manufacturers and suppliers with special-
                   ized knowledge.

                   Program financing mechanisms. Utility-implemented programs for the services
                   sector can be financed through customer energy bills or through dedicated EE
                   funds channeled through utilities. Fiscal incentives such as tax rebates and ex-
                   emption on EE equipment are also popular means of incentivizing private sector
                   services consumers.
     Building EE programs for private and public sector services customers and ef-
ficient street lighting and water pumping systems may also be implemented by
ESCOs. ESCO-implemented programs for commercial clients may be financed
through the ESCO or directly by customers with financing from commercial banks.
It may be necessary to develop credit lines and EE funds specifically to meet the
financing needs for EE in the services sector. Customers in the public sector have
little or no motivation to reduce energy bills, so projects will need to be financed
through public sources, which may be supplemented by IFI/donor funds and con-
cessional financing.

Monitoring and verification. Metering systems and deemed energy savings based
on consumption norms for EE appliances are preferred options for monitoring and
verification of savings achieved through EE measures implemented in buildings in
the services sector. A similar approach can be used for EE measures in street light-
ing and water pumping systems.

Capacity building and awareness programs. Capacity building and training are
important for promoting EE in the services sector since these customers frequently
do not have adequate information and knowledge of EE options. Capacity building
programs should be targeted at all stakeholders, including building owners, munic-
ipalities, ESCOs, utilities, EE agencies, and commercial banks. It is important that
countries leverage the strength of the private sector, including equipment manufac-
turers and suppliers, to educate stakeholders, build capacity, and create awareness.
   Programs for the services sector should target public and private facilities.




                                                                                        Delivering Energy Efficiency in the Middle East and North Africa
While many programs may be common, some programs could be based on cus-
tomer motivation.

Considerations for sector prioritization advanced by stakeholders
In the course of preparing its 2014 study, RCREEE consulted stakeholders to iden-
tify factors in addition to potential energy savings that could affect prioritization
of sectors for policy actions. The stakeholders provided input on nine countries,
revealing some differences in priorities among countries (table A4.4). This input
from a sampling of well-informed experts takes into account their views on tech-
nical, economic, and political feasibility and relative urgency to address EE in the
indicated sectors. The transport sector is absent, partly perhaps because of the per-
ceived urgency of responding to electricity outages that affect other sectors. While
the potential for efficiency improvements on the supply side is significant, as seen
in chapter 1, this was deemed a priority in Iraq, which has suffered infrastructure
degradation from years of conflict, and in Sudan, which requires a great deal of
investment to expand its utility infrastructure.

    on electricity end uses. The transport sector is unique, featuring some approaches that are
    relatively straightforward for many countries to adopt, such as fuel economy standards.
    But others are extremely difficult—notably reforming fuel pricing, making large investments
    in infrastructure to shift substantial passenger and freight travel from road to less energy-
    intensive modes, and overhauling deeply embedded urban and land-use planning practices. To

 5	 Appendix 1 discusses the assessment’s data sources, assumptions, caveats and methods.
    For instance, a common base year was required for comparative analysis, which meant that
    for some countries the most recent available data was not available. Since the purpose of
    the scenarios is to evaluate options for policy actions, not to provide market forecasts, the
    comparability of the data was more important than their place in time.

    Appendix 4 provides a summary of expert opinion from stakeholders consulted by RCREEE
    (2014), which generally supports the focus in this report on industry, residential, and services.

 6	 The tertiary sector includes commercial services and public services, which include, inter
    alia, public buildings, schools and hospitals, street lighting, water supply, and wastewater
    treatment. In this report, the unqualified term “services” or “services sector” is interchangeable
    with “tertiary sector.”

 7	 Total primary energy supply (TPES) is the standard category used to represent economy-wide           131
    consumption of primary energy. Primary energy supply is far easier to report for most countries
    than total primary energy consumption, which requires making estimates for many energy-
    consuming activities that are typically not reported, leading to inaccuracies and lacunae. The
    two categories of primary energy consumption and supply, however, are statistically identical.

 8	Projections of the primary energy mix by fuel source were not prepared. This will have an
    influence on overall efficiency of the energy system, but fuel switching is not the primary
    means for achieving energy savings in most applications.
                   9	The analysis for MENA countries was based on the latest year of data available. For most
                      countries, the base year was 2012, but for Algeria, West Bank and Gaza, and Sudan it was
                      2011. Only technical potential (measures that are technically feasible without regard to cost)
                      was assessed, since the detailed cost data to estimate techno-economic potential (those
                      investments with a reasonable payback time) are generally unavailable. Energy savings
                      potential based mainly on a top-down approach, comparing indicators of specific energy
                      consumption (energy consumed per unit of economic or physical output, person, floor area
                      etc.) in the country analyzed with references or benchmark values at country, regional or
                      sub-regional levels. Since many countries lack sufficient data to prepare a comprehensive
                      set of benchmarks, it was assumed that benchmark values from countries in the same sub-
                      regions would be generally applicable and not significantly influenced by structural economic
                      differences. Another assumption is that socioeconomic and technological conditions were
                      similar among countries within the same climatic zone, and with similar socioeconomic
132                   conditions in the residential sector.

WORLD BANK GROUP




                       reflects increasing electrification, which results in the loss of a growing share of primary fossil
                       energy in the conversion to electricity.

                   11	 The following points are from ESMAP 2008, except where noted.

                   12	ANME in Tunisia is very effective in rolling out EE across the country, as it has the political
                      authority to act on government policies—unlike the Bureau of Energy Efficiency of India, a
                      central agency charged with facilitating implementation of national EE policies but lacking
                      enforcement authority in the states.

                   13	 See IEA 2014b, p. 3. Estimates vary widely, however, and, using a more restrictive definition,
                      the IEA has estimated investment in EE to be $130 billion in 2012 (WEO 2014, p. 138).

                   14	 Development banks and donors are also making large commitments to financing EE. Here
                       the IEA (2014b) reports that bilateral and multilateral development banks (MDBs) provided
                       over $22 billion in financing for EE in 2012. MDB finance for EE under climate mitigation
                       programs alone is $4.3 billion in 2013. Some countries, such as China, are also increasingly
                       using public funds for EE: its EE investments exceeded $100 billion over 2006–10, and
                       the country plans to invest $200 billion-$270 billion in EE over 2011–15 to reduce energy
                       intensity (IEA 2014b).

                   15	 Bonds and equity market financing are generally available only to large industrial or commercial
                       customers who have access to capital markets through stocks and shares or bond markets.
                       New financing mechanisms for EE include green bonds, clean energy bonds, and climate
                       bonds. Initially floated by MDBs, they increasingly come from commercial banks. Bonds for
                       EE implementation are still developing and, apart from MDBs, are being used mainly by some
                       corporations in OECD countries to finance EE and clean energy projects. Equity funding
                       for EE is even less common and may not be an option in the MENA region, except for
                       large corporations listed on local stock exchanges. Climate finance may present an alternative
                       in eligible countries that can benefit from financing mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas
                       emissions.

   of January 1, 2011.
