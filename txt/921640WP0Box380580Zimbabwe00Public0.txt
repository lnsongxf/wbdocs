THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” m ark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       The law provides for model or boilerplate articles of incorporation. On
       the date of incorporation, the Registrar of Companies must be notified
       of the appointments of the company’s directors and secretaries. This is
       done by filing the particulars of the directors and secretaries and any
       changes therein or a list of directors and principal officers (Form CR 14).
       These documents must be accompanied by a duplicate original or a
       printed notarized copy.

       Registration Fee is US$ 5 for every US$ 100 or part thereof of the
       nominal/authorized capital of the company with a minimum fee of US$
       100.
       In practice, companies usually start up with a low amount of capital to
       avoid the exorbitant stamp duty. A company may also issue shares at a
       premium to circumvent the requirement.

        Request and obtain approval from the Inspector of Factories

        Before an application for approval of building plans can be submitted
        to the local authority, approval must first be obtained from the
        Inspector of Factories. This is a separate application and carries its own
   1    application fee, established by the Inspector. The approval period is not    30 days           USD 419
        less than 30 days. The cost is 1% of the project value.

        Agency: Inspector of Factories



        Request and obtain building plan approval by the Harare City
        Council

        BuildCo must submit the following documents at the same time: the
        building permit application, the application for the factories inspection,
        the TPD-1 form for the planning permit (only if needed which is not the
        case for the Doing Business case study), and the architects' and
        structural engineers' drawings and certificates to the relevant local
        authority for approvals, under the Regional, Town, and Country
        Planning Act and the model building bylaws. The application must be
        accompanied by a completed set of plans for the structure, prepared by
        a qualified draftsman or architect.
   2                                                                                 300 days          USD 419
        The application is circulated for approval to all departments, including
        the Department of Works, Highways and Works, Chemical Laboratory
        and Trade Waste, City Planning, Water and Sewerage, Land Survey,
        Traffic Engineering, Valuation and Estates, Department of Health,
        Department of Fire, Department of Housing and Community Services,
        and Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA).

        Each agency contacts the applicant directly for clarification or
        rectification, if required. Once all agencies have accepted the plans, the
        Chief Building Inspector makes a final assessment and issues an
        approval of building plans to the applicant. The form contains a
        commencement of work notice that must be submitted by the

                                                                                     Time to

                                                                                    complete
      applicant once the footings are ready for inspection. Subsequently, all
      phases of the construction must be approved by the Building
      Inspectorate.

      Procedural and approval costs are either 1% or 1.75% of the
      construction cost, but this varies from one authority to another. The
      time required for the entire procedure depends on the local authority;
      in Harare, it is usually not less than 6 months and can be up to a year.

      Because the approval cost is based on a percentage of the total
      construction cost, a certain amount is paid based on the estimated cost.
      However, the local authority may ask for the difference between the
      estimate and the actual cost at the end of the project (a common
      requirement). The cost of completion depends on whether the
      developer is prepared to fund the pre-purchase option. In addition,
      many developers close an insurance bond with the building contractor
      on the value of the construction materials.

      Should construction works commence prior to the approval of the
      building plans the local authority now imposes a "Regularisation Fee",
      or fine, of US$5,000.

      Agency: Harare City Council



      Request and receive inspection from Building Inspectorate upon
      completion of foundation

      Delays frequently occur because the City of Harare inspectors cannot
      get transportation to inspect a site. Even if offered a lift to the site by
      the contractor or consultant, the inspectors are not allowed to accept it
      because they are not insured for travel provided by a third party.

      Theoretically, inspections are conducted once a month. A final
      inspection will occur only if specifically requested (but is required for
3     obtaining the occupancy permit). Theoretically, the builder must stop         30 days       no charge
      construction until the inspection is conducted, but doing so is
      impractical. The City of Harare inspectors generally allow a structural
      engineer to cover the inspections of foundations. In practice, since 2007
      due to lack of fuel and means of transportation, inspections are no
      longer conducted. Companies use their own engineers for inspections
      during construction.

      * Request and obtain water and sewage connection from
      Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA)

      In 2007, municipal water supplies have been taken over by a new
      authority, the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA). Obtaining
      a new connection now requires proof of ownership of the stand and
      account clearance on any other water billing and is undertaken by the
      developer (in this case BuildCo) or its agents.

      Separate applications are made by the construction company for water
      and sewerage connections. There may be an additional charge for this
      determined by the local authority.

      BuildCo completes and lodges an application for a “new water
      connection and supply” form, available at the Water and Sewerage
      Branch of ZINWA. In addition to the form, BuildCo must provide the
      following:
7     • A letter of commitment addressed to the Director of Works stating          1 day       USD 2,390
      BuildCo’s intention to proceed with a connection
      • A statement of the quality of water required, to determine the
      appropriate pipe size and meter needed

      The branch will issue the applicant a T.W. number and notate the
      application form. A receipt for the application specifying the fees to be
      paid is issued. Fees come in two parts, a supply deposit and a
      connection fee, and would be USD 626.00.

      The applicant must take the notated application form and the receipt to
      the City Treasury Office, pay the required fees, and have the branch
      receipt machine-endorsed with the payment.

      The cost depends on the type of water supply required. The applicant
      must purchase the water meter; ZINWA are no longer able to supply
      water meters. Application, connection fee, and account deposit amount
      to USD 1,764.00 for a 25-milimeter connection. There is no charge for

        the application, but there is an upfront charge before the connection is
        made.

        The embossed receipt and the application form are returned to the
        branch, which requests that a job number be issued by the Costing
        Office. The branch then issues a Location Advice internally for the work
        to be undertaken. The applicant is required to complete an Installation
        of Water Service form indicating the site of the connection.

        Where fire hose reels on site are required (a requirement under the
        building bylaws for any industrial/warehouse building exceeding 400
        sq. m. in floor area), a 2-inch (50mm) water meter is required.

        Request and receive inspection from the local Fire Department on
        fire equipment installation for occupancy certificate

        Approval by the Fire Department is required to obtain an occupancy
        permit. Inspections are made by appointment only. At least one week’s
        notice is required most of the time. The same issues as with other
        inspections apply (no transportation, long delay). Therefore, in practice,    7 days       no charge

        the architect or draftsman picks up the inspector and brings the

        Obtain occupancy certificate

        An occupancy certificate is issued by the local authority once the
        project is complete and inspected by the Fire Department and the
  10    Building Inspector.                                                          35 days       no charge

      The seller applies for the rates clearance certificate to the local
      authority under whose jurisdiction the property falls

      This application is performed by a conveyancor (fees already covered by
      Procedure 1). The local authority will provide an assessment of how
      much is payable by way of advance rates and outstanding rates, if any.
      In Zimbabwe there is at the moment no land tax, instead rates are paid
      to the local authority. So every property in Zimbabwe is subject to these
      rates paid by the property owner to the municipality or any other local
      authority for the services provided, like refuse, sewage etc. Before one
      can transfer a property all the rates due should be paid to the local
      authority, so it depends on outstanding amount due to the municipality.
      The rates in Zimbabwe are based on the value of the property, size and
      whether there are improvements or not. It is also important to note that
      the value of the property is a function of the location of the property. For               USD 500 (Approx
      the property we are talking about the rates would therefore be around                      average for high
