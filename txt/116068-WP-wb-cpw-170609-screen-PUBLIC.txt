    k	   The High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing is co-chaired
         by Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Laureate in Economics, and Lord
         Nicholas Stern. Its objective is to identify indicative carbon price
         corridors—carbon price ranges which reflect the ambition of the
         Paris Agreement and support the achievement of the Sustainable
         Development Goals—to support the design of carbon pricing
         initiatives or other climate policies.
    l	   The FSB is an international organization composed of senior policy
         makers from ministries of finance, central banks, and supervisory
         and regulatory authorities in the G20 and four other key financial
         centres—Hong Kong, Singapore, Spain and Switzerland. It also
         includes international financial institutions and standard-setting
         bodies. The FSB promotes global financial stability by coordinating
         the development of regulatory, supervisory and other financial
         sector policies.

     disclosing implemented or planned internal carbon

     companies, about 80 percent are headquartered in
     countries that are putting a mandatory price on carbon

Definition of carbon pricing: For the purpose of the State and Trends of Carbon
Pricing report series, and also applicable to this brief, carbon pricing refers to
initiatives that put an explicit price on greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. a price
expressed as a value per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). These
initiatives include not only emissions trading systems (ETSs), carbon taxes, offset
mechanisms, and results-based climate finance, but also internal carbon prices set
by organizations. Policies that put an implicit price on carbon, for example removal of
fossil fuel subsidies, fuel taxation, support for renewable energy, and energy efficiency
certificate trading, are not included as they are outside the scope of this brief.
