Preface
This report is the outcome of a combined financing and supervisory effort by the Zimbabwe
Multi-Donor Trust Fund (Zim-Fund) and the Multi-Donor Analytical Trust Fund (MDTF) under the
World Bank as well the operational contributions of the beneficiary local authorities. The Zim-
Fund financed the study that generated the Harare and Chitungwiza input data, while the MDTF
financed the additional investigations in Ruwa, Epworth and Norton and the development of the
integrated water and sanitation investment plan for Greater Harare.
The Consultant signed two separate contracts with the two financiers with different contractual
obligations regarding submission of reports. Under the Zim-Fund project, the Consultant is
obliged to issue individual reports for Harare, Chitungwiza, Kwekwe, Chegutu, Masvingo and
Mutare. Under the World Bank project (which includes Harare and Chitungwiza), the consultant
is required to issue a single report covering all the project towns.
Considering the inter-linkages and dependencies of the technical and institutional aspects of
water and sanitation service provision in the Harare area, the financiers resolved that it would
be in the best interest of the Clients to receive a single combined report for the Zim-Fund and
the World Bank projects instead of issuing two separate reports for Harare and Chitungwiza as
per the Zim-Fund contract. This arrangement will allow the Consultant to provide the necessary
information on the integrated Greater Harare water and sanitation systems in one consolidated
document.

1      BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION

1.1    Project Background
       Zimbabwe Multi-donor Trust Fund (Zim-Fund)
       The economic and humanitarian crisis in 2008 that included widespread cholera outbreaks
       prompted the Zimbabwean Government and the donors to begin dialogue on the modalities
       of financing relief and remedial efforts. The African Development Bank was asked by a
       group of donors, with the consent of the Zimbabwean Government, to establish and
       administer a âbasketâ fund - the Zimbabwe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (the âZim-Fundâ). The
       main purpose for the Zim-Fund is to mobilise and administer donor resources needed for
       the economic recovery and development efforts in Zimbabwe. Part of the resources
       mobilised by the Zim-Fund have been applied towards the Urgent Water Supply and
       Sanitation Rehabilitation Project (UWSSRP) whose main scope is the urgent rehabilitation
       of water supply and sanitation systems in six urban centres, namely Harare, Chitungwiza,
       Mutare, Masvingo, Kwekwe and Chegutu.
       Under the UWSSRP, the Zim-Fund is also financing consultancy services for the
       development of Medium to Long Term Water Supply and Sewerage Investment Plans in
       the same towns and cities. The contract for these services was awarded to HP Gauff
       Ingenieure GmbH after an international competitive procurement process. The contract was
       signed on 22nd April 2013 and the project officially commenced on 20th May 2013.
       Multi-Donor Analytical Trust Fund
       The City of Harare requested the World Bank to support the development of a water supply
       and sanitation strategic plan for Greater Harare - the metropolitan area that includes Harare,
       Chitungwiza and the satellite towns of Epworth, Ruwa and Norton. The purpose of the
       strategic plan is to assess the infrastructure requirements for the Greater Harare area as a
       single water and wastewater infrastructure system that can be managed as one entity. The
       long term vision is to have a well-structured and sustainable single utility able to raise its
       own capital on the financial markets.
       The World Bank, therefore, engaged HP Gauff Ingenieure GmbH (i.e. further referred to as
       Gauff) to develop the Greater Harare Water and Sanitation Investment Plan â a key input to
       the strategic plan -, parallel to the on-going study financed by the Zim-Fund.
       The Investment Plan will outline the medium (until 2020) to long term (until 2030) water
       supply and sanitation infrastructure requirements. It is intended to be a âblue-printâ that will
       guide future infrastructure and institutional development necessary for sustainable water

1.2    Background to the Consulting Services
       Zim-Fund financed project
       The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Zimbabwe (hereafter called the Recipient)
       appointed âThe Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations Limitedâ
       (hereinafter called the Client) to act as its Procurement Agent under the Zim-Fund. The
       recipient also appointed Lahmeyer GKW Consult GmbH (formerly PÃ¶yry Environment
       GmbH) (hereafter called the Implementing Entity) to act as its Implementing Entity under
       the Project under the Zim-Fund.
       The Client invited pre-selected consulting firms to submit technical and financial proposals
       for the preparation of âWater Supply and Sewerage Medium to Long Term Investment
       Plansâ for six selected municipalities in Zimbabwe. After a thorough selection process, the
       Client selected HP Gauff Ingenieure GmbH (hereafter called Gauff) to carry out the
       services and concluded a contract with Gauff on 16th April 2013.
       On 22nd April, Crown Agents issued the âNotice to Commence the Servicesâ. In accordance
       with the consulting service contract (GC 11.1), the date of the notice was the âEffective
       Date for the Contractâ and subsequently the commencement of services was agreed not to
       be later than 20th May 2013.
       World Bank financed Project
       Recognising the linkages and similarities with the Zim-Fund financed study, the World Bank
       requested Gauff to submit a proposal for providing services necessary to develop the
       Greater Harare Water and Sanitation Investment Plan. The proposal was submitted in July
       2013. Contract negotiations started in August and the contract was signed on 4th October
       2013. The project officially commenced on 28th October 2013.
       The Consultant mobilised to Harare on 27th October 2013 and carried out kick-off meetings
       with the various local authorities and agencies involved in the project and made the initial
       inspection visits to Ruwa, Norton and Epworth. An Inception Report was submitted on â¦â¦,
       which covered the principle approach and planning criteria proposed for application under
       this project. The Consultant held various technical and non-technical meetings with the
       councils, provided details of the project progress in various meetings with the WB and
       submitted discussion papers for various relevant topics. Project Objectives
       The main objective of the project is to develop an integrated Water Supply and Sanitation
       Investment Plan for the Greater Harare metropolitan area. The Investment Plan will outline
       the medium (until 2020) to long term (until 2030) water supply and sanitation infrastructure
       requirements. It is intended to be a âblue-printâ that will guide future infrastructure and
       institutional development necessary for sustainable water and sanitation services.
       The specific objective for this project component is to develop detailed water supply and
       wastewater investment plans that meet medium term (until 2020) and long term (until 2030)
       infrastructure requirements for the Greater Harare area, combining Harare, Chitungwiza,
       Epworth, Ruwa and Norton.
       The investments cover the entire supply chain including water resources development,
       water and wastewater treatment, transmission and distribution, including institutional and
       sustainability issues. The consulting services do not cover other important urban
       infrastructure components, such as solid waste management and do not cover the
       important aspect of urban drainage.

1.4    Linkages with other Consulting Contracts
       This consultancy is closely linked to the Zim-Fund study contract previously awarded to
       Gauff in the sense that Harare and Chitungwiza intersect both projects. It is important to
       state that the work done under the Zim-Fund study was not be duplicated; but used as input
       to this study.
       Within this study, additional investigations were carried out in Ruwa, Epworth and Norton
       such that investment plans for these Councils were integrated with those developed for
       Harare and Chitungwiza into a single investment master plan for the Greater Harare area.
       Throughout this report, the study on the Water Supply and Sewerage Medium to Long
       Term Investment Plans for Harare, Chitungwiza, Mutare, Masvingo, Kwekwe and Chegutu
       is referred to as the âZim-Fund studyâ.

1.5    Planning Principles
       The planning principles of this study are aligned to the National Water Policy Document,
       which provides the necessary framework for the development of planning strategies. The
       policy document demands for adequate and affordable services to all residents and
       underlines the importance of efficient and conservative management principles when
       producing and supplying drinking water. Recurrent cost recovery is a key feature of the
       policy, which also underlines the importance of private and public users to pay for services.
       Metering of water production and consumption is an important instrument for effective
       operation and demand management, which is also promoted by the policy document. Also
       the reduction of unaccounted for water is promoted by the policy document and considered
       an important aspect of demand management. The policy also acknowledges the fact that
       operations can be provided by private service providers and that capacity building and
       investments in operation and maintenance equipment are necessary for sustainable service
       provision.
       The policy document considers the past service standards as being high and suggests that
       such high standards could be reduced until Zimbabwe has reached again a normalised
       situation. We believe that this aspect of the policy may be reconsidered as we suggest to
       promote sustainable service level standards, which are adequate to provide safe water
       supply and sewerage services and affordable to the residents in low, medium and high
       density areas. The principle planning strategies resulting from the National Water Policy are
       further elaborate in Chapter 6.

1.6    Investment Components
       The investment plan is subdivided into specific investment components, which are
       developed to support the objective of the project and are aligned to the service level
       objectives as outline above. The investments packages are as follows: (a) water demand
       management and NRW Reduction, (b) water supply service improvement, (c) extension of
       water supply services, (d) sanitation service improvements, (e) extension of sanitation
       services and, (f) accompanying measures. Table 1-2 gives a detailed explanation on each
       investment component.

2       CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROJECT AREA

2.1     Location and geography
        The project covers Harare and the surrounding satellite towns of Chitungwiza, Epworth,
        Norton and Ruwa, collectively known as Greater Harare. Greater Harare is situated on
        Zimbabwe's Highveld between latitudes 17Â° 40â S and 18Â° 06â S, and between longitudes
        30Â° 37â E and 31Â° 16â E. It is an urban sprawl with a total current population of around 2.35
        Million according to the 2012 National Census.

2.2     Project area

2.2.1   Harare
        Harare is the capital city of Zimbabwe. It is the seat of government, industrial hub and
        commercial centre of Zimbabwe.
        Harare was founded in 1890 under the name of Fort Salisbury. It was granted municipality
        status in 1897 and city status in 1935. Harare has heavy and light industries which are
        presently operating at low capacity due to the collapse of the countryâs economy. It is also
        surrounded by farms and mines.
        The city is well connected to other parts of Zimbabwe by railway lines and paved, all
        weather highways. The Mutare highway links Harare to Mutare, the provincial headquarters
        of Manicaland Province and far afield to the port City of Beira in Mozambique. The Harare â
        Beit Bridge highway links Harare to South Africa, while the Harare-Chirundu highway links
        Harare to the northern neighbouring countries of Zambia and Congo. The
        The National Railways of Zimbabwe operates a daily overnight passenger train service that
        runs from Harare to Mutare and another one from Harare to Bulawayo. Harare is linked by
        long distance bus services to most parts of Zimbabwe. The Harare International airport
        links the city to other parts of the world with both commercial passenger flights and freigt
        flights.
        The project area is the urban metropolitan under the jurisdiction of the City of Harare. There
        are currently 46 wards within the city boundaries covering an area of 85,000 hectare â
        including the recently incorporated Ward 1 (Harare South). The project also covers areas
        outside of the current city boundary where the council provides water and sewerage
        services and the peripheral areas earmarked for future inclusion into the city boundary. This
        includes the fast growing low density suburbs such as Rainham, Mt Hampden, Mt Pleasant
        Heights and Sally Mugabe and high density areas such as Whitecliffe and Caledonia.
        The wards are the planning units for population estimations and projections, however, the
        most commonly known areas in the city are suburbs. Harare has a number of low density,
        medium density and high density suburbs. It also has some informal settlements in Harare
        South, Caledonia and Whitecliffe. The low density suburbs are generally spread across the
        northern and north-eastern parts of the city, while the low density suburbs are in the west,
        save for a few exceptions such as Mabvuku and Tafara. The table below lists some of the
        suburbs in the city

2.2.2   Chitungwiza
        Chitungwiza started off as dormitory town in 1978 by creation of an urban council which
        initially incorporated St. Marys, Zengeza townships (formerly under the City of Harare), the
        Seke area (formerly under the African Development Fund of Internal Affairs) and the
        TILCOR industrial complex. Chitungwiza was granted town council status in 1981 and
        became a municipality in 1996.
        The project area is the urban metropolitan under the jurisdiction of Chitungwiza Municipality.
        It stretches from Manyame River in the north-west to Duri River in the south-east. It is
        bound by Seke Road on the north and the Nyatsime River on the south. This project also
        covers areas outside of the current municipality boundary earmarked for conversion into
        urban development. The area across the Nyatsime River has been identified as the
        expansion area where the future additional population will settle. The area has already
        been planned and demarcated into 5 wards. The council is planning to develop 50,000
        stands in this area over the next 30 years. The town will also grow northwards, taking up
        communal land in Seke District.
        The most commonly known areas in the municipality are suburbs, sections and âunitsâ. The
        main suburbs in Chitungwiza are St Maryâs, Seke and Zengeza. St Maryâs, located in the
        northern part, is the oldest suburb in Citungwiza and is divided into two areas generally
        known as St Maryâs South and St Maryâs North. Zengeza is located in the central section of
        the municipality and is divided into five sections numbered from 1 to 5.
        Seke is a conglomeration of more than 15 housing estates commonly known as âUnitsâ.
        The units are named alphabetically from unit A to P (skipping I). The northern part of Seke
        is called Seke North, while the southern part is called Seke South. The houses are mostly
        high density detached units of single storey with a small yard.

2.2.3   Epworth
        Epworth is located about twelve kilometres south-west of the Harare City Centre. It is a high
        density dormitory town administered by a Local Board â the local authority mandated with
        the provision of municipal services. It started off a Methodist Mission Post before it was
        inundated by the large influx of people in the late 70s and early 80s from the rural areas in
        search of economic opportunities in Harare. The Methodist Church could not control the
        influx of people, and therefore transferred ownership of the farm to the Ministry of Local
        Government in 1983. Given that the area was not planned as an urban settlement, it quickly
        became an informal settlement. It was formalised as a Local Board in 1986 under the
        Urban Councils Act. Since its inception, the area has grown rapidly, but the rate of growth
        has not been matched with the provision of basic services such as water, roads and decent
        sanitation. The local board however is in the process of formalising most of the area to
        facilitate land ownership rights and provision of services to the residents.
        There is very little for commercial activity in Epworth. The majority of the people get by as
        street vendors and informal manufacturers. Even though most of the stands are numbered,
        the streets are not named. The regularisation processes includes street naming as well.
        The project area is the current local board area, which comprises 7 wards. The project area
        also includes peripheral areas envisaged for inclusion into the local board boundaries within
        the planning horizon.
        Epworth is expected to grow southwards towards Twentydales farm. The population growth
        in the short term will be absorbed within the current council boundaries. The Twentydales
        Farm is likely to be incorporated only in the long term.

2.2.4   Norton
        Norton is a satellite town of Harare, located approximately 40km to the west of Harare
        along the A5 Harare to Bulwayo Road. It is in Chegutu district of Mashonaland West
        Province. It lies between latitudes 17Â° 50â S and 17Â° 54â S, and between longitudes 30Â° 38â
        E and 30Â° 45â E. Norton was originally a farming support and industrial town but has since
        developed significantly as a dormitory town serving Harare.
        The town was established in 1914 and was initially administered by a Town Management
        Board under the Rural Councils Act. It was upgraded to Town Council status in 1994. The
        current council area is made up of residential and industrial developments divided into 13
        wards with a total area of around 6,000 ha. The 2012 National Census estimated the
        population of Norton to be around 68,000. Most of this population resides in the high
        density areas of Katanga and Ngoni.
        The town is surrounded by large commercial farms. In fact, the town has expanded over the
        years by incorporating and subdividing surrounding farms. In recent years, areas such as
        Knowe, Galloway, Maridale and Johannes have been established by subdividing
        surrounding farms. The subdivision and development was typically done by private
        developers.
        The phenomenal expansion of Norton over the last 10 years has been driven by private
        developers seeking housing development investments targeting the working population in
        Harare. Given its proximity to Harare (only 40 km from the city centre), the town is very
        attractive for investments in residential housing and agro-processing industry (huge urban
        market in Harare).
        The town is host to the largest Grain Marketing Board Depot. Key local industry includes
        the Hunyani Pulp and Paper Company (currently dormant), the Dandy Sweets factory and
        the Allied Cotton Ginnery.

2.2.5   Ruwa
        Ruwa is a town in Mashonaland East Province, situated 22 km south-east of Harare city
        centre. It is bisected by the main Harare-Mutare highway and railway line. It serves as a
        small administrative and trading centre for the surrounding mixed farming area. The town
        has seen rapid growth in recent years mainly because of the housing development
        opportunities. It has become a popular area for private housing developers and people
        moving out of Harare.
        Ruwa is lies between latitudes 17Â° 52â S and 17Â° 55â S, and between longitudes 31Â° 18â E
        and 31Â° 15â E. Originally an industrial suburb it has continued to provide for both industry
        and increasingly as a dormitory town for Harare.
        Originally formed as a Local Board, Ruwa is in the process of attaining Town Council status.
        Development has generally been formal and well planned.
        The project area is the urban wards under the current jurisdiction of the local authority and
        the peripheral areas that the council intends to provide water and sanitation services to in
        future. The town is divided into 9 wards cover a land area of approximately 4,000 ha. Most
        of the wards are high density residential areas except for Wards 7, 8 and 9, which are
        either medium or low density residential areas. Most of the industrial and commercial land
        use is located in wards 7 and 9. The 2012 National Census estimated the population in
        Ruwa to be approximately 56,000
        The town is expected to expand into Anthelney Farm, Mara Farms and Tarisa Farms. This
        expansion is likely to happen in the long term. In the short-term, the population increase will
        be absorbed within the current council boundary, especially in Wards 7, 9 and 5. It is
        important to note that the extension area to the east includes the catchment for the Green
        Sykes Dam â a water source and storage reservoir for the raw water from Nora Dam. This
        area must be protected from excessive human development.

2.3    Climate
       Greater Harare has a subtropical highland climate. The average annual temperature is
       18Â°C, rather low for the tropics. This is perhaps due to its high altitude position and the
       prevalence of a cool south-easterly airflow.
       The Greater Harare area experiences three main seasons: a warm, wet season from
       November to March/April (rainy season); a cool, dry season from May to August (winter);
       and a hot, dry season in September/October. In the coldest month of July the average daily
       temperature ranges from about 7Â°C to 20Â°C, while in the hottest month (October), it ranges
       from about 13Â°C to 28Â°C. The figure below shows the average highs and lows over an
       average year.

       The rainy season starts around November and lasts for approximately five months until
       April. The average annual rainfall is about 825 mm. Very little rain typically falls during the
       period May to September, although sporadic showers occur most years. The wettest month
       is January with around 200 mm of rainfall. Rainfall varies a great deal from year to year and
       follows cycles of wet and dry periods from 7 to 10 years long. The figure below shows the
       variations of rainfall over an average year.

2.4    Topography
       The general topography of Zimbabwe is characterised by a central watershed which
       stretches across the country from the north-east to the south-west. The Greater Harare sits
       on one of the higher parts of the watershed. It was constructed on naturally flat and marshy
       plateau bounded by rocky hills in the central watershed. The terrain gently galls towards the
       south-west and the north-east. The ground elevation over the city averages around 1,500 m
       amsl. The southern, western, central and south-eastern parts of Harare drain southwards
       into the Manyame River, while the north-eastern part drains northwards into the Mazoe
       River system.
       The landscape is covered by a natural vegetation of open woodland. The most common
       tree of the local region is the Msasa (Brachystegia spiciformis) that colours the landscape
       wine red with its new leaves in late August. Two South American species of trees, the
       Jacaranda and the Flamboyant, which were introduced during the colonial era, contribute to
       the city's colour palette with streets lined with either the lilac blossoms of the Jacaranda or
       the flame red blooms from the Flamboyant.

2.5    Hydrological and Hydrogeological conditions
       Greater Harare lies in the upper Manyame sub-catchment â part of the Manyame
       catchment. Manyame catchment covers areas that are drained by three main rivers;
       Manyame, Musengezi and Angwa. The catchment is reasonably well endowed with water
       due to the relatively high mean annual rainfall of around 750mm. The upper Manyame Sub-
       catchment receives the highest rainfall.
       The general geology of Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment consists of greenstones of the
       Bulawayan Group, Older gneisses and granites of the Basement Complex, Great dyke
       mafics and ultra-mafics, doleritic and gabbroic dykes. The greenstone belt occupies the
       central part of the sub-catchment and consist of tightly folded, extremely sheared and
       metamorphosed volcanic and volcaniclastic or sedimentary rocks of the Bulawayan Group.
       Because of the fissures in these formations, groundwater potential is very high. Water

Greater Harare Water and Sanitation Investment Plan                                              Investment Plan Report
                                                                                                             Chapter 02

         yields do vary from 0.5-3.0 l/s. Borehole depths range from 30-60 m and water strikes vary
         from 10-40 m. Groundwater levels range from 1-20 m and are mostly less than 10 m.
         Granitic rocks are more abundant than any other rock type in the sub-catchment and
         stretch from NW to the SE part of the sub-catchment. They are varied in age and range
         from older gneissic rocks to younger granites. These rocks have poor groundwater potential
         as they have no primary permeability and porosity. These rocks cover the largest part of the
         Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment. Groundwater is from secondary structures such as faults,
         fractures and regoliths. Groundwater potential under such conditions is invariably related to
         the amount of rainfall, fracture pattern distribution and regolith development. Borehole
         depths in areas containing gneisses and granites range from 30-50 m. Groundwater levels
         range from 5- 30 m and are mostly less than 20 m deep. Yields are equally variable ranging
         from 0.1-0.2 litres per second. Values occurring outside these ranges should be expected
         depending on the prevailing hydrogeological conditions.
         Very few dolerite dykes occur in Upper Manyame Sub-C and they are more or less parallel
         to the Great dyke. The doleritic intrusions may be easily traced in the field as they form
         streaks of red soils and sometimes accompanying ridges of black weathering, rounded
         boulders, supporting a lot of vegetation.1

2.6      Water Resources
         The municipal water required in the greater Harare area is abstracted from the Manyame
         River system. The water is impounded at four main dam sites: Manyame (Darwendale),
         Chivero, Seke and Harava. In a recent study conducted by ZINWA, the 4% yield of the
         dams was estimated to be 480,000 m3/day. In addition to the yield of the dams, the
         catchment receives substantial amounts of water via the return of wastewater effluent
         (mostly untreated) into the river system.
         Studies have already been carried out on potential water sources for Greater Harare in
         other catchments. Sources such as Kunzvi and Shavanhove in the Mazoe Catchment, and
         Muda in the Sanyati Catchment have already been verified and will be developed when
         need arises. The need to develop new sources will be determined on consideration of yield
         and the quality of the water in the Upper Manyame catchment.
         The 4% risk yield of the dams in the Upper Manyame Catchment has already been
         exceeded by the installed capacity of the water production facilities. The water demand has
         also already surpassed the yield of the dams â strengthening the case for developing new
         water sources in other catchments.

2.7      Environmental Situation (Raw water Quality)
         The raw water quality in the catchment has been deteriorating at an alarming rate. This is
         mainly because domestic and industrial wastewater is being discharged into the natural
         water courses with hardly any treatment as most of the wastewater treatment facilities are
         dilapidated. A comparison of water quality data from 1996 and 2011 carried out by
         JICA 2shows a considerable increase in BOD in the catchment over the last 15 years. The
         comparison data used was from a 1996 JICA study and the Environmental Management
         Agency (EMA). The table below shows the water quality comparisons.

       Given these findings, there is clear need to rehabilitate the existing wastewater treatment
       facilities in the catchment and to consider appropriate wastewater technologies that will
       help clean up the catchment.

3      URBAN PLANNING AND DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE

3.1    Introduction
       The Greater Harare Metropolitan Area includes the five component settlements of Harare
       Chitungwiza, Epworth, Ruwa and Norton. Each of these centres is managed by an
       independent urban authority: the Harare City Council, Chitungwiza Municipality, the
       Epworth Local Board, the Norton Town Council and the Ruwa Local Board. Each town has
       its own unique history and pattern of development and, to date, there has been little in the
       way of coordinated planning between the individual towns. However, to a large extent,
       these centres do function as part of single urban and economic entity. In particular they are
       linked together on the basis of sharing a common water supply system and, also, all their
       wastewater treatment systems discharge upstream of the water supply dams on the
       Manyame River and consequently affect their common water supply.
       The four centres of Harare, Chitungwiza, Epworth and Ruwa form a single contiguous
       urban area whilst Norton is located some 45 km to the west of Harare. Norton and Ruwa
       are both situated alongside primary access roads and railway lines, to the west and east
       respectively. Both were initially developed to provide opportunity for industrial expansion
       outside of Harare, although more recently the focus has been on residential development.
       Chitungwiza has a limited industrial area and, together with Epworth, they primarily serve
       as satellite residential areas for Harare.
       Harare, with an area of 850 km2 is by far the largest of the entities, and accounts for 81.9%
       of the overall extent of 1,037 km2 currently included under the Greater Harare Metropolitan
       Area. Corresponding figures for the other centres are Chitungwiza 51 km2 (4.9%), Epworth
       34 km2 (3.3 %), Norton 60 km2 (5.8%), and Ruwa 42 km2 (4.0%).
       Harare is situated on the watershed between the Manyame catchment to the south and
       west and the Mazowe catchment to the northeast. Other than the small parts of Harare to
       the north and east (Hatcliffe, Borrowdale, Highlands, Greendale and Caledonia) which
       drain north into the Mazowe River, the bulk of the city together with all of Ruwa, Epworth,
       Chitungwiza and Norton drain to the west into the Manyame River. This leads to the
       unfortunate position whereby Harare, Chitungwiza, Epworth and Ruwa are all situated
       upstream of the main water supply dams of Lake Chivero and Lake Manyame, and even
       for Norton drainage is to the north directly into Lake Manyame.
       As the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare strongly dominates Greater Harare in terms of area,
       population and development of commerce and industry. Harare has a well defined Central
       Business District (CBD) which is lacking for the other centres of Chitungwiza, Epworth,
       Norton and Ruwa. In each case plans exist for development of a town centre but these
       have yet to be developed. As the capital city, Harare also supports the bulk of the
       institutional development, in particular hosting a large number of national organizations.
       For the other centres, institutional development is limited, the most numerous organizations
       being educational facilities, particularly schools, and churches.
       Harare also includes the largest industrial areas. Chitungwiza, Norton and Ruwa each have
       some industry; indeed the modern development of Norton and Ruwa was specifically in
       order to reduce pressure on industrial areas in Harare. Despite previous industrial
       development in these smaller centres, many of the large companies have now ceased
       operation or have relocated, This is largely due to the prevailing national economic malaise,
       but has been compounded by erratic water supplies to these towns.

       All towns include a mix of two or more types of housing: these being low density (LD),
       medium density (MD), high density (HD) and informal settlements, although the proportions
       of each differ widely between the different towns according to their individual histories of
       development.
       The overall purpose of this chapter is to provide detailed spatial population estimates that
       can serve to inform calculations of future water demand for Greater Harare. The remainder
       of this chapter presents historical population data (Section 3.2) and projected future
       populations (Section 3.3) and, in Section 3.4, these are broken down according to
       individual wards and by housing types. Calculation of institutional, commercial and
       industrial water demand is based on indirect methods, such that the focus of this analysis
       is primarily on residential populations. All population data is derived from official ZIMSTAT
       reports, and ward boundaries are those used by ZIMSTAT for the 2012 census. It should
       be noted that these ward boundaries have been subject to marked changes in recent years,
       often for political purposes, and that the ZIMSTAT boundaries do not necessarily coincide
       with those currently in use by the respective urban authorities. More detailed reports
       relating to each town are included in Appendices 3-1 to 3-5.

3.2    Historic and Present Population
       Population census data for Harare and Chitungwiza goes back to at least 1969, whilst
       disaggregated data was first reported for Norton in 1982, and for Epworth and Ruwa only in
       1992 (Table 3-1, Figure 3-1). Corresponding annual rates of population growth for the
       respective census intervals are shown in Table 3-2. It should be noted that the 2012
       population figure for Harare includes the population of six adjacent wards, currently outside
       of the official city boundary, but for which neighbouring parts are already in the process of
       being incorporated or, in the near future, are expected to be incorporated into the city.
       These are Wards 35 and 24 of Zvimba District, Ward 20 of Mazowe District, and Wards 6,
       7 and 25 of Goromonzi District (Figure 3.2). Collectively, these six wards add an additional
       109,708 people to the 2012 Harare population.
       Harare strongly dominates the overall population of Greater Harare, in 2012 accounting for
       72.5% of the overall population of 2,356,764 people. Corresponding figures for the other
       centres were 15.1% for Chitungwiza, 7.1% for Epworth, 2.9% for Norton and 2.4% for
       Ruwa.
       Summing the individual populations, Greater Harare has grown in population from 379,000
       in 1969 to nearly 2.4 million in 2012. This represents a six fold increase over a span of 43
       years. During this period the mean annual growth rates for Greater Harare have
       consistently been markedly higher than for the country as a whole, such that Greater
       Harare has grown to account for a steadily increasing proportion of the overall national
       population, from 7.4% in 1969 to 18.2% in 2012. This trend is shared with many of the big
       cities in Africa and can be expected to continue. The expected result will be the increasing
       concentration of population, economic activity and wealth within Greater Harare.
       A second key point to note is the marked decline in mean annual growth rates for both the
       country as a whole and for Greater Harare during the last twenty years (1992-2012) as
       compared to the previous period from 1969-1992. For Greater Harare the growth rates
       were over 6% in the earlier years, decreasing to 2.62% for the period 1992-2002 and to
       1.84% for the following period to 2012. The primary causes of this decline include the
       devastating HIV pandemic, leading to markedly increased mortality rates, and the

       pronounced economic decline from the late 1990s to the present, which has stifled
       economic growth and resulted in high levels of out-migration.
       Given the present unpromising macroeconomic outlook, future urban growth is likely to be
       due more to the push of continued high levels of poverty in rural areas rather than the pull
       of new urban opportunities resulting through investment and economic growth. Thus, whilst
       Greater Harare appears to have adequate land available to support continued growth,
       actual development is likely to be strongly constrained by the prevailing adverse
       investment climate.

       Historical mean annual rates of growth have varied greatly from one town to another. In
       general the rates of growth over the last 20 years for Epworth, Norton and Ruwa have
       been substantially higher than those for Harare or Greater Harare as a whole. Chitungwiza,
       in contrast, has experienced considerably lower growth rates over this period, probably due
       to limited space for further expansion. Ruwa and Norton have offered ample space for
       growth, and have attracted considerable levels of state and private investment, whilst in
       Epworth there has been a massive expansion of informal settlement. This has also been
       the case for Harare Ward 1 (Harare South or Harare rural) which has increased in
       population from 23,023 in 2002 to 113,599 in 2012, with virtually all the increase being of
       informal settlement, as well as the neighbouring areas of Caledonia (Goromonzi Ward 25)
       and Whitecliff (Zvimba Ward 35).

3.3    Population Projections
       A key limitation to projecting urban population is the unpredictability of some of the
       population change factors, especially net migration. While births and deaths could
       potentially be estimated from historical trends, since they take some time to change
       significantly, net migration can be influenced by and can quickly respond to short-term
       changes such as economic swings and patterns of investment. For this reason the
       approach adopted here was to estimate growth rates of the population from historical data
       and make reasonable scenarios about these growth rates into the future.
       Future population growth rates for Greater Harare were estimated through consideration of
       historical rates of growth (Table 3-2), comparison to regional data (Table 3-3), comparison
       to estimated growth rates for towns included under the associated Urgent Water Supply
       and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project (Table 3-4) and through discussions with the
       respective urban authorities. A number of workshops were held to debate and achieve
       consensus on the proposed future growth rates.
       Data on population growth was obtained from 87 urban centres (>25,000 people) in seven
       comparable Southern and East African countries for which data was available (Namibia,
       Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya), as recorded over their most
       recent census interval (variously 1997-2007 to 2002-2012). For all 87 towns the overall
       range of annual growth rates over the last decade was -0.03% to 6.97% with a mean value
       of 3.23% (Table 3-3). The data further suggests that growth is stronger in the largest cities

       smaller than 250,000 people).

       areas (>25,000 people) over their respective most recent census intervals (from 1997-2007

       Under the UWSSRP future population growth rates for the six project towns (Chegutu,
       Masvingo, Kwekwe, Mutare, Chitungwiza and Harare) were examined and debated at a
       combined workshop held in Harare on 09 July 2013. A key outcome of the workshop was
       to estimate future annual rates of population growth to 2020 and 2030 for each of the
       project centres, based on specific conditions pertaining to each of the centres.
       Table 3-4 shows the projected annual growth rates for the medium (2012-2020) and long
       term (2020-2030) for the six UWSSRP project towns. (Source: Workshop, Harare, 09 July
       2013).

       The resulting estimates varied between 1.1-4% for the period 2012-2020 and from 2-4% for
       the subsequent interval from 2020-2030.
       Now that the 2013 national election has been concluded, the extent of the macroeconomic
       challenges facing the country is clear, and there is little to suggest that the population
       growth trajectory for the coming years should be substantially different from the recent past.
       Certainly, there seems no feasible justification for predicting an immediate increase to the
       level of 4% per annum for Harare. The future mean rate of growth for Greater Harare for
       the period 2012-2020 was thus estimated at 2%, this being slightly higher than the figure of

       1.84% obtained during the previous census interval. Consistent with this overall figure the
       individual growth rates of Chitungwiza, Norton and Ruwa for the period 2012-2020 were
       maintained at their same levels as for 2002-2012 (Table 3-5). For Epworth, the rate of
       growth is expected to decline due to restricted opportunities for further expansion within its
       existing footprint, combined with the fact that the town is hemmed in between Harare and
       Ruwa such that the opportunities for additional external growth are also strongly
       constrained. The future rate of growth for Epworth from 2012-2020 is therefore expected to
       be 2.5% as compared to the former value of 3.91% for the period 2002-2012. For Harare, it
       was assumed that the relatively restricted opportunities for growth in Chitungwiza and
       Epworth would be compensated for by marginally higher rates of growth here, such that the
       future growth was forecast to increase from the previous figure of 1.59% for 2002-2012 to
       that of 1.75% for 2012-2020.

       Population growth for Greater Harare is projected to escalate markedly after 2020.
       Individual projections for Harare, Ruwa and Norton are estimated at 4% to 2025 and 5% to
       2030. Corresponding estimates for Epworth are lower (2% and 2%) again due to space
       constraints, and also for Chitungwiza (2% and 4%), on the basis that the targeted area of
       expansion on the Nyatsime Farms is further away from the city centre than much of Harare,
       such that development in this area is likely to be slower until such time as the closer areas
       are beginning to reach capacity. These figures imply overall growth for Greater Harare of
       3.59% for the period 2020-2025, and increasing to 4.68% for the subsequent interval to
       2030.

       Applying these estimated growth rates the resulting projected populations are shown in

       2012 to 2.8 million in 2020 and to 4.1 million in 2030.
       Over this same period Harare is estimated to increase from 1.7 million in 2012 to 2.0
       million in 2020 and 3.0 million in 2030. Chitungwiza is anticipated to increase to over half a
       million by 2030, Epworth to reach nearly 250,000 people and Norton and Ruwa to both
       expand to well over 100,000 people each, to roughly the current size of Epworth.

       Given the inherent high level of uncertainty as regards these future predictions, it is
       essential that these population estimates should be revisited, at a minimum prior to any
       detailed planning for the second investment horizon (2020-2030), and particularly in 2022
       after the next census has been completed.

3.4      Urban Planning
         There has never been any comprehensive planning carried out for the whole of the Greater
         Harare Metropolitan Area and none of the component towns have an updated master plan
         (although for Chitungwiza, JICA has recently completed a detailed study on future water
         supply and sanitation 1 ). The data presented below is largely derived through detailed
         discussions with the individual urban authorities.
         The general approach followed for each town was to examine the existing pattern of land
         use, including the allocation of 2012 ward populations by residential types. This was
         followed by consideration of existing plans for future growth and identification of
         possibilities for growth of different residential types both in existing wards and in
         neighbouring areas, together with analysis of predicted future demand for different types of
         housing to 2020 and to 2030. By comparison of expected growth by housing types against
         identified opportunities for growth, it was then possible to estimate future ward populations
         by housing types for the two periods to 2020 and 2030. The analysis was largely confined
         to residential use, since water demand for institutional, commercial and industrial purposes
         is being estimated through indirect means.

3.4.1    Harare
         Harare strongly dominates the Greater Harare Metropolitan Area. With a 2012 census
         count of 1,708,538 (including peripheral areas) Harare accounted for 72.5% of the overall
         population, and with an area of 84,994 ha accounts for 81.9% of the overall extent of
         Greater Harare (Table 3-7). As the capital city of Zimbabwe, Harare hosts many national
         and local institutions, is the centre of commercial and industrial activity and, unlike the
         other component towns of Greater Harare, has a well-developed central business district.

       Harare is divided into 46 wards. All wards include residential areas of various types: low
       density (LD), medium density (MD), high density (HD) or informal (INF) settlements. Low
       density housing dominates over most of the northern and eastern parts of the city, plus the
       city centre and a substantial band to the south. There are ten wards that comprise entirely
       of LD housing (City Centre, Belvedere, Marlborough, Avondale, Mt. Pleasant, Borrowdale,
       Eastlea, Highlands, Greendale and Waterfalls), plus Mabelreign and Hatfield which are
       predominantly LD but also include smaller portions of MD housing. MD housing does not
       dominate in any wards, but rather occurs as a component in association with either LD
       housing (as for Mabelreign and Hatfield), or else HD housing, as is the case for
       Sunningdale, Kambuzuma, Highfield, Glen View and Dzivarasekwa. See ward map in
       Figure 3-4 overleaf.

       HD housing dominates the southwestern and western portions of the city, with relatively
       small occurrences to the north (Hatcliffe) and to the east (Mabvuku and Tafara).
       Immediately to the south of the City Centre are Mbare and Sunningdale. Continuing to the
       southwest, the sector bounded by the Simon Mazorodze Road (leading south to Masvingo),
       the High Glen Road (to the west) and the Bulawayo Road, includes the HD areas of
       Highfield, Rugare, Kambuzuma and Warren Park. Further out, to the west of High Glen
       Road, are the suburbs of Glen Norah, Glen View, Budiriro, Mufakose, Kuwadzana and
       Dzivarasekwa. Ward 1 (Harare Rural or Harare South) covers a vast swathe across the
       southern portion of the city from the headwaters of Lake Chivero in the west to Epworth in
       the east, and from Chitungwiza in the south to the remainder Harare in the north.
       Previously commercial farm land, this portion is now dominated by informal settlement.
       For the purpose of this project it was decided to include portions of six adjacent wards
       parts of which have been, or are anticipated as being, incorporated into the city in the near
       future. These wards comprise Wards 35 (Whitecliff, Rainham, Spitzkop, Heaney and
       Rydale Ridge) and 24 (Mt. Hampden) of Zvimba District to the west; Ward 20 (Mt. Pleasant
       Heights) of Mazowe District and Wards 6 (Sally Mugabe Heights) and 7 (Echo and Rumani
       farms) of Goromonzi District to the north and, to the east, Ward 25 (Caledonia) also of
       Goromonzi District. Zvimba Ward 24 and the three northern wards currently include and
       are expected to be developed as LD settlements. Caledonia comprises entirely of informal
       settlement, while Whitecliff is dominated by informal settlement (75%), but also includes
       portions of MD (20%) and LD (5%) housing.
       For Harare, for all 52 wards, the estimated break down of population in 2012 by housing
       types was as follows: 28.3% LD (482,961 people), 3.0% MD (50,409 people), 59.4% HD
       (1,014,130 people) and 9.4% informal settlement (161,038) (Table 3-8). Based on
       discussions with City of Harare planning officials, it is expected that the combined
       proportion of LD and MD residents will gradually decline over the planning period from a
       combined figure of 31.3% for 2012, to 29% for 2020 to 25% by 2030. During the same
       period the proportion of informal settlement is expected to grow from 9.4% for 2012 to
       13.6% for 2020 and 19.6% for 2030. This implies a corresponding decrease in the
       proportion of HD population from 59.4% in 2012 to 57.4% in 2020 to 55.4% in 2030.
       Using these figures, the future estimated populations by housing types for the years 2020
       and 2030 are shown in Table 3-8. This suggests that the LD population will grow from
       483,000 in 2012, by 29,000 people to 512,000 in 2020, and then by 173,000 people to
       reach 686,000 in 2030. The MD population is forecast to increase from 50,000 in 2012 to
       57,000 in 2020 and to 76,000 in 2030.
       The HD population was just over 1 million in 2012. This is forecast to grow by 113,000 to
       1.13 million in 2020 and then by 562,000 to reach 1.69 million in 2030. Coupled with this,
       the informal population is expected to grow from 161,000 in 2012, by 106,000 to reach
       267,000 in 2020, and by a further 330,000 to reach a total of 597,000 in 2030.
       The expected general pattern of development is for continued expansion of LD housing to
       the north and northeast (between the Lomagundi and Murewa roads), and for continued
       HD expansion to the west and south of the city. This will serve to confine future extension
       of the sewer network to the southern and western portions of the city, whilst the LD
       residents to the north can continue to rely on septic tanks.
       Twelve areas were identified for future LD expansion, eight within the boundaries of the
       current 46 wards and four in the peripheral areas to the north (Table 3-8). The existing
       wards appear to offer a total LD growth opportunity of 14,500 stands or 101,500 people.

                                                                                           Chapter 03

       This is more than adequate to cater for the anticipated demand of 29,358 extra LD
       residents to 2020, but substantially short of the projected demand of 173,478 new
       residents to 2030. Thus, by 2030 all LD growth within the existing wards is expected to be
       fully taken up, and a similar amount of growth will have taken place in the neighbouring
       areas to the north. However, growth in all prospective areas, other than Goromonzi Ward 7,
       is expected to start prior to 2020 and to continue into the subsequent interval to 2030.
       The picture for MD expansion is similar to that of LD, in that the identified four opportunities
       for expansion within the existing wards, which give a total of 12,600 people, are sufficient
       to cater for demand to 2020 (6,515 people) but not to 2030 (25,791 people). The major MD
       development is expected to occur to the west within Zvimba Ward 35, where a further
       2,000 stands (14,000 residents) are expected. Again, development in all five potential
       areas appears likely to span both time horizons to 2020 and to 2030. It is also feasible that
       there might be additional MD developments in the peripheral areas to the north, although
       this has not been provided for in this working model.
       Fifteen of the existing wards appear to offer possibility for HD expansion, collectively
       amounting to a total of 14,510 stands or 145,100 residents. This compares to an estimated
       demand of 112,579 people to 2020 and of 674,455 to 2030. Thus, all HD expansion to
       2020 is projected to be accommodated within the existing wards, with the balance of
       opportunities being taken up during the subsequent period to 2030. From 2020-2030 the
       bulk of HD growth is expected to occur in Ward 1 and the peripheral areas of Caledonia
       and Whitecliff, and will come about through upgrading of existing informal settlements
       (550,000) to formal HD housing.
       The bulk of the low income development is expected to comprise informal housing, and is
       anticipated to occur primarily within Ward 1 and the peripheral wards of Zvimba 35 to the
       west and Goromonzi 25 to the east. Collectively, these areas have an estimated capacity
       for an additional of 99,500 stands or 995,000 people. All growth in these areas in the
       medium term to 2020 is expected to comprise informal housing. However, during the
       subsequent interval to 2030, while it is assumed that informal growth will continue, it is
       further assumed that a substantial portion of the informal settlement in each of these areas
       will be provided with services and thus upgraded to formal HD housing (total of 550,000
       people). The estimated capacity appears more than adequate to cope with the expected
       demand through to 2030 of 436,367 people, even allowing for the anticipated ongoing
       conversion of informal to formal HD settlements.
       Resulting estimated ward populations for 2020 and 2030 broken down by housing types
       are shown in Appendix 3-1.

3.4.2   Chitungwiza
        Chitungwiza primarily serves as a dormitory residential town to Harare. With a 2012
        population of 356,840 it was the second largest component of Greater Harare, accounting
        for 15.1% of the overall population (Table 3-7). Yet with an area of 5,106 ha, or 51 km2 it
        accounts for just 4.9% of the overall extent of Greater Harare, and is in fact less extensive
        than Norton.
        Chitungwiza includes 25 wards. The three constituent portions of St. Marys, Zengeza and
        Seke form a single contiguous block of high density residential settlement, broken up in
        places by minor drainages which take the form of vlei areas generally draining in a
        southwest direction into the Nyatsime River. Interspersed amongst this are minor portions
        of LD and MD housing. Adjacent to the Duri drainage, in the eastern parts of Wards 18, 22,
        23 and 24, there are small portions of informal settlement. There are a number of shopping
        centres with associated commercial activities and home industries and, in Ward 14, space
        has been reserved for development of a town centre but this has yet to come to fruition.
        There is also a heavy industrial portion, principally within Ward 12 but with provision to
        extend into the adjacent Ward 18 to the east.

                                                                                         Chapter 03

       For Chitungwiza the 2012 HD population was estimated to be 330,017 which equates to
       92.5% of the overall population (Table 3-9). The remaining population comprised of 4,489
       LD residents, 5,600 MD residents and 16,734 informal settlers, comprising respectively,
       1.3%, 1.6% and 4.7% of the overall population. It was assumed that future proportions of
       housing types will generally be maintained at the 2012 values, except that future informal
       settlement will be restricted to the Duri River area, and will be completed by 2020. This
       gives rise to minor fluctuations in the proportions of HD and informal categories of housing.
       Applying these figures, the future estimated populations for the years 2020 and 2030
       broken down by housing categories are shown in Table 3-9. This suggests that the LD
       population will grow from 4,489 in 2012 by 369 people, to give a 2020 population of 4,858,
       and then by 2,034 people to give a 2030 population of 6,523. MD growth will similarly be
       limited, growing from 5,600 in 2012 by 461, to 6,061 in 2020, and by 2,542 to 8,142 in 2030.
       The bulk of the growth is expected to be in HD housing, which will expand from 330,017 in
       2012 by 26,279 people to 356,296 in 2020, and by 155,108 people to 485,125 in 2030.
       Growth in informal population is expected to be limited to 2,250 people during the interval
       from 2012 to 2020, resulting in a small rise in population from 16,734 in 2012 to 18,984 in
       2020, and which will be maintained to 2030.
       For Chitungwiza, a key expectation is to incorporate the six adjacent farms of Longlands,
       Braemar A, Dunnotar, Cawdor, Tantallon and Edinburgh into the municipal area of
       Chitungwiza. Collectively known as the Nyatsime Farms, these form a single contiguous
       block of land situated to the south of the Nyatsime River and extending for some 10 km to
       the south of Ward 6. The intention is that this area should be developed in phases, through
       to perhaps 2040, with the anticipation of providing 35,889 HD stands on 890 ha; 11,514
       MD stands on 576 ha; 2,257 LD stands on 339 ha, and with 157 ha being reserved for
       industrial stands. It is also planned to incorporate a neighbouring portion of Seke
       Communal Land, adjacent to Ward 22.

       Eight areas were identified for future LD expansion, seven within the existing 25 wards plus
       on the Nyatsime Farms (Table 3-9). For MD housing, a single opportunity for expansion
       was identified in Ward 6, plus additional potential for the Nyatsime Farms. For both LD and
       MD the overall identified opportunities for growth (26,495 for LD and 15,610 for MD) far
       outstrip the projected demand to 2030 (respectively 2,034 and 2,542 people). Although
       much of the supply relates to development of the Nyatsime Farms, the existing wards have
       more than enough capacity to satisfy the projected demand, such that future LD and MD
       growth to 2030 is anticipated to be confined to the existing wards and allocated
       proportionally in relation to the identified opportunities.
       Informal growth is expected to be confined to the interval 2012-2020 and to be restricted to
       the three wards along the Duri River where this is already taking place, collectively
       resulting in an additional informal population of 2,250 people.
       Opportunities for future HD growth were identified in three wards, amounting to a total of
       22,550 additional residents. Additional opportunities were identified for Seke Communal
       Land (20,000 people) and the Nyatsime Farms (105,420 people). The estimated expansion
       to 2020 (26,729 people) is expected to be split between the existing wards and Seke
       Communal Land. During the subsequent interval to 2030, the remaining opportunities in
       the existing wards and Seke Communal Land will be fully developed, with the balance
       being accommodated on the Nyatsime Farms. Overall the expected demand for HD
       housing (155,108 people) is projected to marginally outstrip the estimated potential supply
       to 2030 (147,970 people). If necessary, the balance could be accommodated either by

3.4.3   Epworth
        Epworth, like Chitungwiza, serves as a residential dormitory town for Harare. It contains a
        number of shopping centres with associated commercial and light industry activities, but
        there is no CBD and no formal industrial areas. With a 2012 population of 167,462 Epworth
        had grown to become the fifth largest town in Zimbabwe, and accounted for 7.1% of the
        overall population of Greater Harare (Table 3.7). In terms of area, Epworth covers just
        3,438 ha or 3.3% of the overall area of Greater Harare.
        Epworth is divided into seven wards. Unlike, the other component towns of Greater Harare,
        Epworth is dominated by informal settlement (100,870 people), which in 2012 accounted
        for 60.2% of the overall population (Table 3-10). Informal settlement occurs in all wards
        and dominates in Wards 1, 4, 6 and 7. The HD population is confined to a single ward
        (Ward 3) and is limited to just 9,612 people, or 5.7% of the 2012 population. Due to its
        particular history of development as a mission station, Epworth contains sizeable MD
        (42,100 people) and LD (14,880 people in Wards 1 and 4) populations, respectively
        accounting for 25.1% and 8.9% of the overall 2012 population. Wards 2 and 5 are
        dominated by MD housing.

       Epworth has relatively limited opportunity for future expansion within the existing wards,
       and, other than to the south, most of the surrounding areas are already incorporated into
       either Harare or Ruwa, again limiting opportunities for future expansion. Thus, although
       some expansion is envisaged into the adjacent southern areas (Gormonzi Wards 23 and
       24), the limited availability of land is expected to lead to slower rates of growth than has
       been the case in the past.
       Analysis of future opportunities for growth (Table 3-10) indicates that there is limited
       opportunity for LD growth, and no MD growth is anticipated. In fact the bulk of the future
       growth is expected to be informal settlement, but in the long term (2020-30) this will be
       tempered by conversion of some of the informal settlement to formal high density housing.
       This is one of the key planning concerns in Epworth, how to regularise and provide
       services to the existing informal settlements, many of which have been settled in a
       haphazard manner. This presents numerous challenges to the provision of services, and
       will necessarily be a demanding and slow process. Based on discussions with town
       authorities it is assumed that no progress will be made in this respect during the medium
       term to 2020. However, during the subsequent interval to 2030 it is anticipated that roughly
       half of the existing informal settlement in Epworth will be upgraded to formal high density
       housing (with individual household water and sewer connections).
       The resulting changes in proportions of housing to 2020 and 2030 are shown in Table 3-10.
       The general trend is of a decrease in the combined proportion of LD and MD housing from
       34.0% in 2012 to 30.6% in 2020 to 25.1% in 2030. The proportions of HD and informal
       housing (currently at 5.7% and 60.2%) are expected to expand marginally to 2020 (to 6.7%
       and 62.7%, respectively), but thereafter the anticipated conversion of informal settlements
       to HD housing is expected to lead to a marked drop in the proportion of informal
       settlements by 2030 (42.7%) and a corresponding increase in the proportion of HD housing
       (32.1%).
       Using these figures, the future estimated populations for the years 2020 and 2030 broken
       down by housing categories are shown in Table 3-10. Essentially, all remaining
       opportunities within the existing wards will be taken up by 2020 for all housing categories.
       For the subsequent interval to 2030 all growth (44,683 people) will occur in the adjacent
       areas to the south, and it will all be informal in nature. However this will be accompanied by
       substantial conversion of existing informal settlements to HD settlements within Wards 1 to
       7.
       This suggests that the LD population will grow from 14,880 in 2012 by 5,600 people, to
       give a 2020 population of 20,480, and that there will be no further LD growth to 2030.
       Similarly, there will be no MD growth such that the 2012 MD population of 42,100 will be
       maintained to 2030.
       The largest change is projected for HD housing, which will experience modest growth of
       4,000 people from 9,612 in 2012 to 13,612 in 2020, and thereafter will increase by 66,284
       people to 2030 to give a total 2030 population of 79,896.
       The informal population is expected to grow from 100,870 in 2012 by 26,974 to give a 2020
       population of 127,844, and then to reduce by 21,601 people to 2030 (through conversion to
       formal HD housing) to give a 2030 informal population of 106,243.
       Resulting estimated ward populations for 2020 and 2030 broken down by housing types
       are shown in Appendix 3-3.

3.4.4   Norton
        Norton is situated some 45 km to the west of Harare such that it is not contiguous with the
        remainder of Greater Harare. With a 2012 population of 67,591 Norton accounted for just
        2.9% of the overall population of Greater Harare, yet with an area of 6,006 ha, Norton is
        larger than either Chitungwiza or Epworth, and accounts for 5.8% of the overall extent of
        Greater Harare (Table 3-7).
        Starting during the 1950âs, Norton was specifically planned and developed in order to
        provide opportunity for industrial expansion outside of Harare. The town comprises of a
        CBD, industrial area and a mix of low and high density residential housing. There is little in
        the way of medium density housing and informal settlements are absent.
        Norton is divided into thirteen wards. Wards 1, 2, 3 and 4 comprise LD housing and include
        the CBD and the industrial area, and collectively account for two thirds of the overall area.
        The remaining nine wards are dominated by HD housing. With respective 2012 populations
        of 16,112 LD and 51,479 HD residents, LD accounted for 23.8% of the overall population
        and HD the remaining 76.2% (Table 3-11). In the absence of any plans to introduce any
        MD housing or informal growth, it was assumed that future proportions of housing types will
        be maintained to 2030 at these same values of 23.8% LD and 76.2% HD.

       Using these figures, the future estimated populations for LD and HD residents for the years
       2020 and 2030 are shown in Table 3-11. This suggests that the LD population will grow
       from 16,112 in 2012 by 6,440 people, to give a 2020 population of 22,552, and by a further
       12,467 people to give a 2030 population of 35,019. Similarly, HD residents are expected to
       grow from 51,479 in 2012, by 20,575 people to give a 2020 population of 72,054, and by
       an additional 39,830 people to give a 2030 population of 111,884.
       The expected general pattern of development for Norton is for continued expansion of LD
       housing within Wards 1-4, plus additional expansion within Wards 6 and 13, specifically
       targeting those portions closest to Lake Manyame (which were previously zoned for HD
       development). For HD housing, in addition to Wards 11, 12 and 13, the most logical
       direction of expansion for HD housing would be to continue to the west of Wards 12 and 13
       (i.e. to the north of the railway line). However, this is apparently not possible and, instead,
       the town envisages expanding into the portion to the south of the railway line and to the
       west of Ward 4, within what is now Ward 14 of Chegutu District.
       Eight areas of possible expansion were identified within the extent of the current 13 wards
       of Norton, five for LD housing (Wards 1, 2, 4, 6 and 13) and three for HD housing (Wards
       11, 12 and 13). Collectively, these provide opportunity to accommodate an additional
       18,837 LD residents and 21,980 HD residents.
       For LD housing, this should be just sufficient to cater for the total expected growth to 2030,
       which is projected to amount to 18,907 people. For HD housing, the expected growth of
       20,575 people to 2020 will virtually exhaust the estimated growth opportunities within
       Wards 11, 12 and 13 (21,980 people). For the subsequent period from 2020 to 2030 it is
       therefore assumed that the anticipated HD growth of 39,830 people will need to be
       accommodated outside of the existing town boundary within what is now Ward 14 of
       Chegutu District.
       Resulting estimated ward populations for 2020 and 2030 broken down by housing types
       are shown in Appendix 3-4.

3.4.5   Ruwa
        Ruwa with a 2012 population of 56,333 was the smallest of the component towns of
        Greater Harare, accounting for just 2.9% of the overall population (Table 3-7). In terms of
        size, Ruwa is 4,187 ha in extent, making it slightly larger than Epworth, and equating to 4%
        of the overall area of Greater Harare.
        Ruwa is the youngest of the component towns of Greater Harare having only developed
        during the post independence era. Like Norton it was developed in order to provide
        additional industrial capacity and thus relieve pressure on the existing industrial areas
        elsewhere in Greater Harare. In addition to industrial areas, Ruwa includes a mix of LD,
        MD and HD housing. Currently, there is no informal settlement. Land has been reserved for
        construction of a town centre, but this has yet to be realized.
        Ruwa is divided into nine wards. Low and medium density housing is confined to Wards 7,
        8 and 9, which collectively cover 84% of the overall extent of Ruwa. Ward 7 is dominated
        by LD housing, whilst Wards 8 and 9 comprise a mix of LD and MD housing, and Ward 9
        also includes a substantial HD portion. The remaining Wards 1 to 6 comprise a contiguous
        portion of HD development extending as an irregular strip to the south of the Harare-
        Marondera road. The industrial area is located in the northeastern corner of Ward 7,
        immediately to the south of the Marondera road and railway. Part of the northeastern
        portion of ward 9 has also been reserved for heavy industry but has not yet been

       The distribution of population in 2012 by housing types was 26.5% LD, 13.7% MD and
       59.8% HD â there were no informal settlements. The combined proportion of LD and MD
       housing (40.2%) was considerably higher than that of the other urban entities of Greater
       Harare (range is 2.9% for Chitungwiza to 34% for Epworth). Moreover, LD and MD
       accounted for about only one third of the total identified opportunities for future expansion
       in Ruwa. As such the combined proportion of LD and MD housing is expected to gradually
       decrease from 40.2% in 2012, to 35% in 2020 and 30% in 2030. The balance is expected
       to be taken up by HD housing, which is projected to rise in proportion from 59.8% in 2012,
       to 65% in 2020, and to 70% in 2030. No development of informal settlement is envisaged.
       Using these figures, the future estimated populations broken down by housing types for the
       years 2020 and 2030 are shown in Table 3-12. This suggests that the LD population will
       grow from 14,950 in 2012 by 10,967 people, to give a 2020 population of 25,917, and by a
       further 9,077 people to give a 2030 population of 34,994. Similarly, MD residents are
       expected to grow from 7,718 in 2012, by 5,804 people to give a 2020 population of 13,522,
       and by an additional 3,976 people to give a 2030 population of 17,498.
       The major growth will be in terms of HD, the population of which is expected to increase
       from 33,665 in 2012 to 73,243 in 2020 to 122,479 in 2030, the corresponding levels of
       growth being 39,578 from 2012-2020 and by 49,235 from 2020-2030.

       To cater for the future development of Ruwa it is envisaged that additional land will be
       incorporated to the northeast (Ward 9 Extension - Tarisa, Sebastopol, Romany, Clovadael
       B and Liddesdale Farms of Goromonzi Ward 25); to the southeast (Ward 5 Extension â

                                                                                        Chapter 03

       Galway Estate) and to the south (Ward 7 Extension - Dagbreek, Mariandi and Mandalay
       Farms of Goromonzi Ward 24). It is expected that Ward 9 Extension will comprise a
       mixture of LD and HD housing, whilst Ward 5 Extension and Ward 7 Extension will be
       restricted to HD housing.
       Nine areas of possible expansion were identified within the extent of the current 9 wards of
       Ruwa, three for LD housing (Wards 7, 8 and 9), one for MD (Ward 9) and five for HD
       (Wards 1, 2, 5, 7 and 9) (Table 3-12). Collectively, there is opportunity to accommodate a
       further 9,240 LD, 14,000 MD and 54,000 HD residents.
       For LD housing, it is assumed that all existing opportunities within Wards 7, 8 and 9 (9,240
       people) are developed by 2020, with the balance of the expected population (1,727 people)
       being absorbed in Ward 9 Extension. For the subsequent interval to 2030 it is assumed
       that all LD growth will occur in Ward 9 Extension (9,077 people).
       For MD the projected development in Ward 9 of 2,000 MD stands (14,000 people) should
       be more than sufficient to cater for the expected MD growth through to 2030 (9,780 people).
       For HD housing, the expected growth of 39,578 people to 2020 could feasibly be
       accommodated within the existing wards, although some growth is forecast to also occur
       within Ward 9 Extension during this period. For the subsequent interval from 2020 to 2030
       it is expected that HD growth will occur in Wards 5, 7 and 9, and in the adjacent areas of
       Ward 5 Extension, Ward 7 Extension and Ward 9 Extension.
       Resulting estimated ward populations for 2020 and 2030 broken down by housing types
       are shown in Appendix 3-5.

4.1.1   Water Supply
        The Harare water supply scheme consists of two water treatment works - Morton Jaffray
        WTW with a nominal design capacity of 614,000 m3/day and Prince Edward WTW with a
        nominal design capacity of 90,000 m3/day. The scheme also has 16 treated water pumping
        stations, 27 reservoir sites 5,400 km of transmission and distribution pipelines and over
        200,000 service connections. The schematic in Figure 4-1 Shows the general configuration
        of the water supply scheme, while the map in Figure 4-2 shows the spatial location of the
        main facilities in the scheme

4.1.1.1 Water Resources
       Harare is supplied with raw water from Harava Dam, Seke Dam, Lake Chivero and Lake
       Manyame. Morton Jaffray WTW is supplied by Lake Chivero and Lake Manyame whilst
       Prince Edward WTW is supplied by Harava and Seke Dams. All the raw water dams are
       located in the Upper Manyame Catchment area, along the Manyame River.
       The total estimated 4% yield of the Chivero-Manyamewith allowance for upstream and
       downstream commitments is 159,376 Ml/year - approximately 436 Ml/day (Latest ZINWA
       assessment). Allowing for upstream commitments only, the 4% risk yield is 174,448 Ml/year
       (478 Ml/d). The 10% risk yield with upstream commitments only is estimated to be 231,117
       Ml/year (478 Ml/d). The safe yield of the dams is clearly much lower than current average
       demand, let alone projected demand. This is risky for a large city such as Harare. There is
       need to develop water production facilities in other catchments.
       The two upstream dams, Harava and Seke with a combined capacity of 12.5 million m3,
       which is a relatively small storage capacity provide water for treatment at Prince Edward
       WTW. They are normally only used for water supply purposes after the rain season when
       the dams contain sufficient water of a reasonable quality. It is important to note that the
       Prince Edward WTW was intended as a peak load facility to be operated during the hot
       season.
       Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Works has three number intake works namely; the old
       intake tower (intake No.1) constructed in 1952 and draws water at five water levels; three
       being the City of Harare intakes and the other two an irrigation intake and the river outlet
       pipe respectively. Each of the COH intakes is connected to a common ND 1100 water main
       which transports raw water to the distribution chamber at the head of the water treatment
       works. Another intake tower was constructed in 1976 in order to resolve the issue of
       abstraction levels in the old intake tower as well as to have a better location for abstracting
       better quality raw water. The new intake tower was built to avoid the weed in the bay
       around the old intake and to change the design of the intake and install telescopic intakes.
       Raw water from the intake works enters the treatment works from the northeast via a 3 m x
       3 m tunnel. It is directed initially to a mixing chamber before being fed into the treatment
       works.
       The third supply is from Lake Manyame and is via a 3 m x 3 m rectangular 15.4 km long
       tunnel. The tunnel is approximately 45 m into the ground at the works and raw water is
       pumped from a riser shaft.
       The mechanical and electrical components of the intake structures are in bad condition and
       will need to be rehabilitated or replaced.

4.1.1.2 Water Treatment Works
       The City of Harare operates two water treatment facilities namely: Morton Affray WTW
       located adjacent located adjacent to the Harare - Bulawayo Highway about 40 km west of
       Harare and Prince Edward Water Treatment Works located approximately 22 km South of
       Harare. They are both conventional surface water treatment facilities.
       Morton Jaffray WTW
       Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Works (WTW) consists of three units constructed in
       phases - Unit 1 constructed in 1954 with a design capacity of 160,000 m3/day and fed from

         in 1994 with a design capacity of 227,000 m3/day and fed from both Lake Chivero and Lake
         Manyame by gravity. The total design capacity is, therefore 614,000 m3/day, however the
         estimated current total water production is reported to be around 500,000 m3/day to
         550,000 m3/day 1.

           Component                Description

           Unit 1

           Chemical storage,        Raw water is dosed with aluminium sulphate which is prepared in four
           preparation and          concrete tanks equipped with a stirrer. These concrete tanks are badly
           dosing                   corroded and refurbishment is greatly recommended preferably using an
                                    HDPE membrane liner. For pH adjustment, the water is dosed with lime slurry
                                    prepared from two circular steel tanks. The corresponding stirrers and dosing
                                    pumps need to be replaced. In order to reduce the organic matter content of
                                    the raw water, Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) is also dosed and is
                                    prepared in two concrete tanks with stirrers which were recently been
                                    rehabilitated and new stirrers installed. However, dosing pumps and
                                    corresponding pipework does not exist. Sodium silicate is dosed as a
                                    flocculation aid after being prepared from two recently rehabilitated concrete
                                    tanks with new stirrers. Stirrers have not yet been commissioned. As part of

                                    for treated water disinfection was rehabilitated under the âUNICEF âproject in
                                    2009/2010. Two new chlorinators were installed.

           Clarifiers               Clarifiers No. 1 and No. 2 are circular with separate upstream flocculation
                                    chambers equipped with flocculators for moderate mixing purposes and
                                    bottom scrapers for sludge removal. For both clarifiers, flocculators are not
                                    operational. The motors and stirrers would have to be replaced. The scraper
                                    bridge drives are not working, making sludge removal very difficult. This can
                                    only be achieved by emptying the tanks and removing sludge manually.
                                    Clarifier No. 3 is a circular clarifier of the Accelerator type with an integrated
                                    flocculator. This clarifier is completely out of operation as the
                                    electromechanical equipment (motor, stirrer, valves, and pipe-work) is worn
                                    out and would have to be replaced.Clarifiers No. 4, No. 5 and No. 6 are
                                    vertical flow clarifiers (overall depth: 12m) of the PATTERSON CANDY type
                                    with 8 sludge pockets each. Clarifier No. 7 is a DegremontPulsator type
                                    clarifier, which receives its raw water by means of a separate gravity main
                                    from Lake Chivero. The vacuum system that creates the pulsations for sludge

                             clarified water outlet valves will need to be checked on their operational
                             status including desludge valves.

        Rapid      Gravity   Unit 1 comprises a total of 26 No. rapid gravity sand filters: 12 PATTERSON
        Sand Filters         filters (installed between 1952 and 1954) and 14 DEGREMONT filters
                             (installed in 1966). Inlet and outlet baffle gates of the 12 âPatterson âtype
                             filters are completely corroded and need complete replacement. The float
                             type filter outflow regulation system is completely worn out, and no longer
                             operational. All valves (filtered water outlet, backwash water inlet, and air
                             inlet) need to be replaced as many of these are heavily leaking. The new
                             valves will need to be equipped with pneumatic actuators complete with
                             corresponding air compressors. The two existing backwash air blowers are
                             very old, but still operational.

                             Inlet plates of the 14 âDegremontâ filters are heavily corroded. A number of
                             the A.C. filter floor slabs are cracked and need repairing. The âDegremontâ
                             siphon type outflow control system is not working. All valves (filtered water
                             outlet, backwash water inlet, and air inlet) will need to be replaced. The new
                             valves will need to be equipped with pneumatic actuators complete with
                             corresponding air compressors. Only one air blower is operational for filter
                             backwashing. A second air blower will need to be installed including all
                             corresponding pipework and fittings.The existing air pipework is leaking and
                             requires repair or replacement. Two very old backwash water pumps
                             (installed in 1954) are serving both, the âPatersonâ and âDegremontâ filters. A
                             number of valves and pump starters will need to be replaced as the electrical
                             control board is now in a bad state.

        Raw       Water      The underground raw water pumping station receives water by gravity flow
        Pumping Station/     from Lake Manyame via a rectangular tunnel, approximately 3m x 3m and
        Raw Water Tower      15.4 km long. The underground raw water pumping station is approximately
                             45 m below the ground, and comprises a total of 5 WEIR pumps; 3 pumps
                             installed in 1985 and 2 pumps installed in 1993. Raw water is pumped up a
                             raw water tower approximately 40m above ground and then falls down by
                             gravity into the 1800 mm Ã main leading to the raw water mixing chamber
                             where it is mixed with Lake Chivero raw water. Due to the 40 m falling height
                             it is expected that the water from Lake Manyame is supersaturated with
                             dissolved oxygen, which later on is released in the Pulsator type clarifiers,
                             thus reducing the floc formation process due to flotation effects.

        Chemical             In order to reduce the organic matter content of the raw water, Powdered
        Storage,             Activated Carbon (PAC) is dosed into the raw water mixing chamber by one
        Preparation   and    PAC dosing pump capable of dosing 25 % of the total PAC demand leaving
        Dosing               75 % being dosed manually by pouring the content of 25 kg bags of PAC
                             directly into the mixing chamber. For pH correction Sulphuric Acid (H2SO4,
                             98%) is dosed into the same mixing chamber above in order to reduce the
                             raw water pH from a maximum range of 8.5 to 8.7 down to 6.8 to 7.0 which is
                             the optimum pH range for subsequent coagulation with aluminium sulphate.

        Component            Description
                             Sulphuric acid is stored in a 60 ton storage capacity tank, which lasts on
                             average 4 days only and is dosed by a single pump.

                             Aluminium Sulphate is dosed at the inlet point of the six distribution channels
                             to the six Pulsator type clarifiers of Unit 2 and 3. Due to the required high
                             aluminium dosing rates of 60 to 80 mg/l, a daily amount of approximately 40
                             tons of aluminium sulphate is required. There are three aluminium sulphate
                             solution tanks approximately 600 m3 in capacity each. Granular aluminium
                             sulphate is being dosed. Two concrete tanks, originally foreseen for sodium
                             silicate preparation are now used for alum solution preparation and from
                             these preparation tanks alum is pumped to two alum dosing tanks, out of
                             which alum is dosed by means of two centrifugal pumps (GRUNDFOS). In
                             order to allow for some alum solution reserve volume, it is now common
                             practice to store surplus prepared alum solution in the above 600 m3 alum
                             solution tanks.

                             Sodium Silicate is dosed as a flocculation aid by means of two separate
                             dosing plants, one for Unit 2 and one for Unit 3.Each plant comprises two
                             concrete preparation and dosing tanks, each tank is equipped with a stirrer.

                             Lime dosing for final pH-adjustment is through a lime dosing station,
                             comprising 4 No. lime slurry hoppers and 4 No. lime dosing pumps.

                             As part of the disinfection process, gaseous chlorine is dosed

        Pulsator     Type    Unit 2 comprises 3 Pulsator type Clarifiers commissioned in 1976 and Unit 3
        Sludge     Blanket   again comprises 3 Pulsator type Clarifiers commissioned in 1994. All clarifiers
        Clarifiers           are of the same type and size.

                             Pre-treated water is distributed by a distribution chamber with weirs
                             discharging partially treated water to individual channels, where coagulation
                             and some kind of pre-flocculation take place. Each clarifier inlet channel has
                             a âVenturiâ flume for flow measurement purposes. However, in one of the six
                             channels this flume has been taken out, which leads to overloading of this
                             individual channel and thus of the corresponding downstream clarifier. The
                             âPulsatorâ type clarification process is considered as not being the optimum
                             clarification process for algae containing raw water as the formation of a
                             sludge blanket over a large rectangular surface area is rather difficult under
                             operational circumstances, where chemical dosing rates cannot be accurately
                             monitored and where frequent power failures occur, leading to a complete
                             breakdown of these sludge blankets. Compared to the vertical clarifiers
                             (No.4, No.5 and No.6 of Unit 1), the solids and algae removal rate of Unit 2
                             and Unit 3 clarifiers is less than the removal rates observed for Unit 1
                             clarifiers.

                             Therefore, due to the difficult sludge blanket formation only a limited sludge
                             abstraction via sludge concentrators located at one side of the clarifiers, a lot
                             of sludge is accumulated at the bottom of the clarifiers. This leads to frequent
                             emptying and cleaning of the clarifiers (roughly, every 3 to 4 months) and
                             thus a significant loss of water.

        Sand Filters           comprises 18 rapid gravity sand filters of the same type. Filter regulation is of
                               the syphon type outflow regulation. This system is longer operational. New
                               pneumatically actuated solenoid valves were installed in 2009/2010 in all four
                               mains per filter (i.e. in Î¦400 mm filtered water outlet, Î¦ 600 mm backwash
                               water outlet, Î¦ 500 mm backwash water inlet and Î¦ 300 mm air inlet) for

       High Lift Pump Station
       The treated water pump station comprises of 14 pump-sets. Pump-sets 1-3 are fed from an
       ND 800 mm suction pipe with a positive suction. Pump-sets 4-14 are fed from a concrete
       clear water duct with a capacity of 455 Ml/d with a positive suction.
       Pump-sets 1 - 3 were commissioned in 1954 as treated water pumps for the old treatment
       works. Due to continual operating problems during the last 5 to 10 years the pumps (W. H.
       Allen, Sons & Co, Size 20"/18") are scheduled to be replaced by Worthington Pumps with
       the same characteristics. When operating with two pumps in parallel only a minor rise in
       flow is achieved and the usual duty is with one pump operating and two as standby.
       Maximum discharge is 25 m3/min for one pump. The pumps discharge into a ND 750 mm
       transmission main to Lochinvar Reservoir. A performance curve for the new 12 UZDL 25
       Worthington pumps is available. The duty point for each pump-sets is 19.0 m3/min against
       a 172 m head with an efficiency of 85%. The speed is 1450 rpm.
       Pump-sets 4 - 6 were installed in 1960 for the transfer of treated water from the water

       The pumping station is connected to the old ND 1300 pumping main due to the
       replacement of the old and damaged pipes along the pipeline route to Warren Control. A
       performance curve for the new 12 LNC 29"A Pleuger Worthington pump is available. The

       of 85%. The speed is 1480 rpm.
       Pump-sets 7 - 10 were commissioned in 1976 and the pump Model is 20" SDS METS.
       They consists of an A pump rated 600 kWin series with a B pump rated 1,300 kW. They
       discharge into a 1300 mm Ã transmission main to Warren Control Pump Station.
       Pump-sets 11 - 14 were installed in 1994 and the pump Model is 16-LN-35E. Each pump
       set consists of two identical pumps connected in series with a duty point of 53 m3/min
       against a of 90 m head. The speed is 1482 rpm and the efficiency 88%. They discharge
       into another ND 1300 transmission main to Warren Control Pump station.
       The three old pipes (ND 750, ND 975 and ND 1300) and the new ND 1300 pipeline from
       the treated water pump station have flow recorders installed in separate chambers out of
       the main pump station.
       Backwash Water Treatment and Recycling Plant
       A backwash water treatment plant was installed approximately 10 years ago to treat dirty
       backwash water and recycle treated dirty backwash water to the head of the works. At
       nominal plant design capacity and depending on filter backwashing frequencies, the plant
       could easily result in a water savings of around 12,000 to 15,000 m3/d. However, due to
       lack of funding for the final completion of the works by ODIS Filtering Ltd., of Israel, the
       plant was never commissioned.
       The plant comprises the following treatment processes:
          â¢   Polymer supported solid-liquid separation, (SOLIQUATOR),
          â¢   Pressure filtration of the liquid phase of the SOLIQUATOR with the filtered water to

        Component           Description

                            The coagulant is mixed in three alum make-up tanks and the solution
                            gravitates to three number mixing tanks before being pumped to the dosing
                            point. According to the plant operators, the average Aluminium Sulphate
                            dosage rate is almost the same throughout the year, approximately 27.5 to 35
                            mg/l.

                            In order to reduce the organic matter content of the raw water during dry
                            periods and following the first rains, Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) is
                            dosed into the raw water by means of manually dosing one 25 kg bag for 2
                            hrs. For pH correction, lime is dosed after being prepared in two octagonal
                            tanks with mixers. Dosing is done down-stream of the rapid sand filters.

                            Sodium Silicate is dosed as a flocculation aid between September and
                            December at a rate of 0.5 mg/l.

                            As part of the disinfection process, gaseous chlorine is dosed. In addition it is
                            dosed to kill algae, due to algal bloom in the supplying dams.

        Clarifiers          There are 28 No. vertical flow clarifiers all approximately 18m x 9m x 9m with
                            a surface loading rate of 1.5m/hr. The clarifiers receive coagulated water from
                            a central circular distribution chamber that is connected to the flocculation
                            channel. Clear water collection troughs are made of asbestos cement and
                            consequently are very difficult to clean and as such these must be replaced
                            with steel troughs with V-notch weirs for optimum and even distribution of
                            clarified water. Treated water is collected by several troughs installed at the
                            top of the tanks and flows to rapid sand filters. The clarification treatment
                            performance appears to be good. The manually operated desludging valves
                            are all in good operational status. The abstracted clarifier sludge is
                            transferred to sludge lagoons by means of two sludge pumps, installed in the
                            old 1929 low lift pump station. Out of these two pumps only one is operational
                            and is very old. Therefore, two properly designed sludge pumps will need to
                            be installed including corresponding pipework and valves.

        Rapid        Sand   There are sixteen DegremontAquazur type rapid gravity sand filters
        Filters             constructed in banks of eight either side of the filter gallery and observation
                            deck with the following dimensions: 11.8m x 4.25m. The operators advised
                            that under normal circumstances the filtration rate is around 5m/hr. The water
                            depth on the sand filter surface is controlled by siphons, of which vacuum
                            strength is regulated by floats so that the water level is constant. However,
                            this control mechanism is no longer operational and when the filter resistance
                            reaches 1.5 m, washing of the filter layer using pumped water and
                            pressurized air takes place. The backwash sequence is; air only followed by
                            air and water and then water only until the water is clear. The filter floors
                            comprise partly cracked precast concrete slabs with Degremont D20 type
                            filter nozzles. Each filter is operated via three valves i.e. filtered water outlet,
                            backwash water inlet and air inlet valves. The valves are fitted with pneumatic
                            actuators which needs a complete overhaul.

       High Lift Pump Station
       Three pumps are installed in the high lift pump station. Some pumps were replaced recently
       under the EU project. All the other installations are approximately 40 years old. Presently
       only one pump is operational and it is reported that even the characteristics of the newly
       installed pump motors might not be adequate for the corresponding pump. However, new
       pumps will be installed under the UWSSRP Phase 1. The pump station has a drainage
       pump that is very old.

4.1.1.3 Transmission and Storage
       Booster Stations
       The water distribution network of the City of Harare consists of 16 booster stations for the
       conveyance of treated water. Based on the designated duty pumps in these stations, the
       pumping capacity ranges from 720 m3/day to 362,880 m3/day as minimum.
       Out of the 16 booster stations, 6 are lift stations with 4 water towers at Donnybrook,
       Highlands, Greendale and Waterfalls with 2 being reservoirs near Kuwadzana and
       Dzivaresekwa.
       There are also 2 private pump stations at Donnybrook for Lafarge Cement Factory and at
       Philadelphia for a military camp.
       With the proposed Kunzwi WTP and Kunzwi Booster Station, a number of these booster
       stations will not be required in the long term planning to 2030.
       A summary of these booster stations is provided in the table overleaf. Modetailed
       assessment of the booster stations is presented in Appendix 4.1.

       Transmission Mains
       The City of Harare and surrounding areas are supplied by transmission pipelines from
       Morton Jaffray and Prince Edward Water Treatment Works. Two ND 1300 pipelines, a ND
       750 and a ND 975 pipeline convey water from Morton Jaffray WTW pumping station to

       Warren Control ground reservoir. DN 750 main conveys water from Morton Jaffray to
       Lochinvar reservoir.
       Prince Edward Treatment Works supplies treated water through a ND 975 pipeline to the
       City of Harare and Chitungwiza.
       The main supply point of the cityâs water distribution system is the Warren Control pumping
       station from where most of the city is supplied with treated water. From Warren Control,
       water is conveyed to 24 reservoirs by four transmission mains. These transmission mains
       also feed directly into the distribution system of the City. The four transmission mains are:
          â¢   The ND 800 main, supplying the north-west of the City (North-West Main);
          â¢   The ND 750 main supplying the Alexandra Park reservoir site (Alexandra Main);
          â¢   The ND 975 main supplying the Letombo system reservoirs (Letombo Main);
          â¢   The 1000 mm main supplying the south of the City and feeding the Letombo
              reservoir (Highfield Main).
       These four transmission mains constitute the backbone of the supply system of the city.
       They are supported by additional primary mains which form a looped system incorporating
       the main pumping stations and reservoirs of the water distribution system. The main
       components of this system are:
          â¢   Warren Control pumping station;
          â¢   Letombo reservoirs and pumping station;
          â¢   Alexandra Park reservoirs and pumping station;
          â¢   Orange Grove pumping station;
          â¢   Greendale reservoirs;
          â¢   Highlands reservoirs and pumping station.
       From Warren Control pumping station treated water gets pumped through the Letombo
       Mains and Highfield Mains to the Letombo reservoirs. The Letombo reservoir site/ pumping
       station operates as the main supply point of the eastern part of Harare. From there, treated
       water gets transferred by pumping to the reservoirs at Greendale, Ventersburg and
       Donnybrook. These reservoirs command the eastern areas of Harare. Greendale reservoir
       gets fed by a second supply source, the Orange Grove pumping station. This pumping
       station is supplied by two gravity mains - a ND 450 and a ND 375 from Alexandra Park
       reservoirs.
       From Warren Control pumping station the Alexandra Park reservoirs are fed by two
       transmission mains, the ND 750 Alexandra Main and a ND 600 pipe branching off the ND
       975 Letombo Main. From Alexandra Park the Highlands reservoirs are fed by pumping
       through a ND 525 main which gets supported by a ND 300 pumping main from Orange
       Grove pumping station. The north-east of the city gets supplied from Highlands reservoirs.
       The north-west of the city is supplied by the ND 800 North-West Main from Warren Control.
       The reservoirs of Dzivaresekwa, Bluff Hill, Epsilon and Adylinn get supplied by this main.
       The south-western areas of the city are supplied off the transmission mains from Morton-
       Jaffray to Warren Control by pumping. In addition, the reservoirs at Lochinvar and Marimba
       are directly fed from this transmission main.

       Storage Reservoirs
       The water supply system in Harare has 27 treated water reservoir sites. The reservoirs are
       dotted all around the city between 1,460 m and 1,600 m amsl. The main reservoirs in terms
       of capacity are Letombo, Alexandra Park, Lochinvar, Greendale and Highlands which
       together have a storage capacity of approximately 553,740 m3. This is about 70% of the
       total storage capacity of the water supply system. The table below shows the main
       characteristics of the reservoirs.

4.1.1.4 Distribution Network
       The primary and secondary distribution network is made up of AC, steel and PVC pipes.
       The total network length (excluding transmission pipes above ND 600) is 5,200 km. Steel
       pipes are the oldest. Installation of PVC pipes only started in the 80s. PVC pipes now
       account for 22% of the network.Deterioration of the steel pipes is a major source of leakage.
       Much of the old steel reticulation in the centre of the city was replaced with PVC pipes in

       The distribution system is supplied by both pumping and gravity. There are areas that are
       supplied exclusively by pumping or gravity and others that are supplied by a combination of
       both.Most of the areas are supplied by pumping. Off-takes on transmission mains feed
       directly into the distribution system. These off-takes are equipped with 33 pressure
       reducing valves (PRVs) in order to reduce excessive pressure levels in the distribution
       network.
       District Metering System
       The City of Harare used to have a comprehensive metering system in operation. Bulk water
       meters and flow meters were installed to measure weekly flows at outlets/inlets of
       reservoirs and pumping stations as well as flows in main supply pipes transferring water
       into individual supply areas of the city. There were 145 district meters installed in the water
       supply system. Out of 145 meters, 11 bulk meters used to be read by the Chitungwiza
       Council. The remaining 134 meters were under the control of the water workshop of the
       COH. The district metering system is no longer functional because (a) the meters are not
       working, and (b) there have been interconnections among district metering areas that are
       not metered. We recommend that the old district metering system be restored after a
       comprehensive NRW study.
       Areas outside the City Boundaries
       Harare provides treated water to consumers outside the city boundaries. These areas
       include neighbouring municipalities and government facilities such as, Chitungwiza,
       Epworth, Ruwa, Norton, Domboshava, Inkomo Barracks, Chikurubi Complex (within the
       City boundaries), Cranbourne Barracks (within the City boundaries)
       Pilot Area Investigations
       The purpose of the pilot area investigations was to assess the condition of the water
       distribution and sewerage networks and recommend rehabilitation investment measures for
       the entire system using statistical methods.
       The pilot areas were selected in liaison with the Harare Water following the selection
       criteria specified in the ToR of the Zim-Fund financed study. It was chosen to be
       conveniently small, but characteristically representative of the entire network so that
       extrapolations to the entire network could be done with reasonable levels of confidence.
       Two pilot areas - one representing the high density housing category the other representing
       the medium density housing category - were chosen for the investigations.Highfield was
       chosen because it is one of the oldest high density suburbs and is densely populated, while
       Cranborne was chosen because it is one of the oldest medium density suburbs and isfairly
       representative of most medium density suburbs.
       The AC pipes in the study areas appear to be in good condition despite the age â not very
       surprising considering that AC pipes have a lifespan of 50-70 years. Even though AC pipes
       undergo gradual degradation in the form of corrosion (i.e., internal calcium leaching due to
       conveyed water (lower Langelier index = more leaching) and/or external leaching due to
       groundwater), the council has not reported enough pipe failures to suggest that the pipes
       need replacement. The exposed pipes from the replaced pipes did indicate that the pipes
       were in fair condition except for those cracked pipes from presumably too high pressures
       as shown in the photo below.

       Generally, all the valves are in a bad shape; they are rusty and leaking.Valve chambers are
       generally in a very poor condition, damaged and filled with stones as shown in the photos
       below.

       Furthermore, there are no covers and those that do have, have been vandalised. Therefore,
       the conclusion based on the above is that, all network appurtenant fittings and structures
       must be replaced.
       Significant amount of water is lost after the meter resulting in unnecessary water use/
       wastage. If metered, these wastages lead to increased water bills, which may not be paid
       by the consumers. If unmetered, these wastages result in high NRW levels, as flat rate
       billing considers only a limited average amount of water usage. Wastage can be reduced
       and water conservation measures be implemented through rehabilitation of household
       installations and household education and awareness programs. Even though Household
       investments are normally not part of project funding, a provision in the investment plan for
       public awareness campaigns aimed at sensitizing consumers on the motivation and
       financial benefits associated with investing in internal plumbing repairs is made. It is further
       recommended that council should make it a policy to fix leaking taps and pass on the costs
       to the consumers as a way to minimise water losses.
       As can be seen from the photos below, the service connections are heavily corroded and
       incrusted. This was expected, given that these connections have been in service for over
       30 years. Most of the leakages in the network occur on these lines.

        It is therefore recommend that, all house connections be replaced including the saddles. It
        is further recommend that, the replacement of service lines should be of HDPE. HDPE
        house connections have proved to be durable and reliable. HDPE pipes have a smooth
        internal surface that does not corrode or tuberculate and maintains its flow capability over
        time. HDPE service connection pipes have a cost benefit associated with their longevity.
        The polyethylene pipe industry conservatively estimates the service life for HDPE pipes to
        be 50-100 years. This translates to savings in replacement costs for a long period.

4.1.2.2 Condition Assessment of Trunk Sewers
       The condition of the critical sewer mains conveying waste water from different suburbs in
       Harare were assessed with the help of Harare Water Staff. The following are the critical
       sections inspected during the site visit:
          â¢   the 1400 mm Ã RC twin mains collecting most of the influent in the Firle or Mukuvisi
              Catchment;
          â¢   the 600 mm Ã AC main collecting most of the influent on the eastern part of the
              Crowborough Catchment;
          â¢   the 900 mm Ã RC twin mains collecting most of the influent on the western part of
              the Crowborough Catchment.
       The 1400 mm Ã RC twin mains colleting waste water in the Mukuvisi Catchment.
       Assessment of these mains was carried by visual inspection via manholes. The main seem
       to be in good condition. However, the benching indicated some corrosion. The mains will
       require rehabilitation in a long term (2030). The photos below show the condition of the
       manholes on the 1400 mm Ã RC twin mains.




       Manholes
       The ND 600 main collects waste water from the eastern section of the Crowborough
       Catchment Area such as Kwadzana, Glaudina, Dzivaresekwa, Tynwald North Sanganayi
       Park and Bluff Hill. Assessment of this main was carried out by visual inspection of the
       manholes and on specific sections of the pipe. The pipe is currently surging and has
       collapsed at the downstream end. The entire section of main mustbe replaced and
       upgraded. The photos below show the condition of the manholes and collapsed sections on
       the 600 mmÃ AC main.

       Collapsed section of the 600 mm Ã AC and state of Manholes on the main
       The 900 mm Ã RC twin mains collects the influent from the western part of Crowborough
       Catchment. Assessment of these mains was carried out by visual inspection of the
       manholes and the pipe bridge upstream of the Crowborough WWTW. The steel pipes on
       the pipe bridge are severely corroded and damaged, and all the influent from one of the 900
       mm Ã is surcharging into the stream. Consequently, about 5,000 m of the 900 mm Ã does
       not convey any waste water and is in effect, abandoned. Part of the influent on the 900 mm
       Ã RC main discharges into the main. The steel pipes pipe bridge and the 5,000 m length of
       the 900 mm Ã RC downstream of the pipe bridge that is currently abandoned due to the
       influent surcharging into the stream needs to be replace and upgraded. The figure below
       shows the condition of the manholes and damaged pipes on Pipe Bridge.

4.2     Chitungwiza
        This section presents a summary of the existing water supply and sewerage infrastructure
        in Chitungwiza. More tailed information is presented in Appendix 4.2.

4.2.1   Water Supply

        The Municipality of Chitungwiza receives bulk water from the City of Harareâs water
        treatment facilities which are mainly; Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Works and Prince
        Edward Water Treatment Works. The transmission system is designed in such a way that
        water can be drawn from both Prince Edward WTW and Morton Jaffray WTW.

        Overall, the city provides services to a population of 356,840 (2012 National Statistics). At
        present, the system has 55,669 connections, which are equipped with water meters most of
        which are not functional. The schematic layout of the system is presented in the following
        figure.

4.2.1.1 Water Sources

       Prince Edward Water Treatment Works (WTW) is located approximately 22 km South of
       Harare adjacent to Prince Edward Dam also known as Seke Dam. The Water Treatment
       Works has a reported maximum peak production of 90,000 m3/day. The current average
       daily water production is reported to vary between 50,000 to 55,000 m3/day.

       During the rainy season when Prince Edward WTW is operating at full capacity, most of the
       supply to Chitungwiza is from Prince Edward WTW. Prince Edward WTW is supplied with
       raw water from the upstream Harava1, Harava2 and Seke Dams all along the Manyame
       River. During the dry season when Prince Edward WTW is not operating at full capacity due
       to insufficient water in the upstream dams, Chitungwiza is supplied from the Morton Jaffray
       WTW system.

4.2.1.2 Transmission System

       The transmission main from Prince Edward WTW starts off as a ND 600 steel main
       followed by a ND 225 branch after the bridge feeding an area called Mayambara which is
       under Harava Rural District Council. The ND 600main continues before splitting into a
       450mm diameter main and a ND 525 main before the Police Station. The ND 450 main
       feeds the reservoirs located on the northern part of Makoni Shopping Centre. The ND
       525main also feeds the reservoirs and the reticulation network. The reservoirs can
       hydraulically be described as floating reservoirs.

       The ND 600mm diameter main has off-takes feeding the following areas;

          â¢   ND225 off-take for Area 1 - Mayambara;

          â¢   ND300 off-take for Area 2 - St Mary`s &Manyame Park;

          â¢   ND300 off-take for Area 3 - Zengeza 1, 2, 3 & 5;

          â¢   Area 4- ND375 - off take for area 4-Tilcor, Zengeza 2, 3 & 4.

       The ND525 main has off-takes feeding the following areas;

          â¢   ND 300 off-take for Area 5- Unit H,D,J, with interconnection to Unit K;

          â¢   ND375 off-take for Area 6- Unit A, C, F, M, L & K.

4.2.1.3 Storage Reservoirs

       The reservoirs for Chitungwiza are located on the north eastern outskirts of the town north
       of Makoni Shopping Centre at the end of the network. The reservoir site has four ground
       reservoirs of equal capacity and an elevated tank. They have a total storage capacity of
       approximately 46, 000 m3. A small booster pump station houses the pump sets used to
       transfer water to the elevated tank.

       From a visual inspection, the tanks are in a good state with no cracks, scaling concrete or
       rusting rebar. They are in good working order but, largely redundant since they never fill up
       because of their location in the network and the limited water supply from Harare.

4.2.1.4 Distribution Network

       The distribution network comprises of a combination of AC pipes in old sections of the town,
       Polyethylene and PVC pipes in newer sections of the city (15 years old).

       The Municipality of Chitungwiza advised that, some sections in the distribution network
       continuously suffer from pipe bursts. This is attributed to the fact that pressure reducing
       valves are not working. The areas most vulnerable are; Unit N and Unit K.

       No issues have been raised in the recently installed networks. The recently installed
       networks include the following areas:

          â¢   ND90 Polyethylene pipes in Zengeza;

          â¢   ND110 PVC pipes in St Maryâs (Manyame Park);

          â¢   ND 90 PVC pipes in New Developments and infill areas;

          â¢   ND 75 PVC pipes in New Developments and infill areas.

       It is worth noting that, there are control valves and bulk flow meters on all the branches, but
       most of them are not working. The branches come off the 525mmÃ rising main to the
       storage reservoir resulting in low lying areas getting water ahead of the high level areas,
       hence the need to address the issue of control valves.

       The oldest section of the distribution network was constructed between 1973 and 1978 and
       the network has been expanding based on the growth of the city.The layout of the network
       is structured in eight independent supply zones, with the last supply zone to Unit O formed
       as a loop so that water can be supplied from both the service reservoirs and also from Unit
       N.

       The water supply to Chitungwiza is erratic and varies in terms of continuity of supply but
       has an approximate supply rate of 500m3/hour. To manage supplies to the various suburbs,
       the municipality has a rationing criterion in which certain areas/zones get water on a
       particular day in a week. The table overleaf shows a summary of the water supply
       schedules for Chitungwiza.

4.2.1.5 Pilot Area Investigations Findings and Recommendations â Water Distribution Network

       All the network elements are over 30 years old. There have not been any major
       rehabilitation or replacement undertakings since the town was developed. In the oldest
       parts of town, water pipes and appurtenant structures date as far back as 1978.

       Water pipes

       St Marys is supplied by a ND225 main. The water distribution mains within the pilot zone
       are ND75 mm mains.

       The AC pipes appear to be in good condition despite the age â not very surprising
       considering that AC pipes have a lifespan of 50-70 years. Even though AC pipes undergo
       gradual degradation in the form of corrosion (i.e., internal calcium leaching due to conveyed
       water (lower Langelier index = more leaching) and/or external leaching due to
       groundwater), the council has not reported enough pipe failures to suggest that the pipes
       need replacement. The exposed pipes from the replaced pipes did indicate that the pipes
       were in fair condition except for those blocked as a result of siltation.

       Valves and fire hydrants

       There were no hydrants in the pilot area. Isolation valves were found randomly installed on
       the distribution mains. Generally, all the valves are in a bad shape; they are rusty and
       leaky.

       Valve chambers are generally in a very poor condition, damaged and filled with stones as
       shown in the photos below. Furthermore, there are no covers and those that do have, they
       have been vandalised.

       Therefore, the conclusion based on the above is that, all network appurtenant fittings and
       structures must be replaced as most network leakages occur there.

       Vandalised valve chamber

       Significant amount of water is lost after the meter resulting in unnecessary water use/
       wastage. If metered, these wastages lead to increased water bills, which may not be paid
       by the consumers. If unmetered, these wastages result in high NRW levels, as flat rate
       billing considers only a limited average amount of water usage. Wastage can be reduced
       and water conservation measures be implemented through rehabilitation of household
       installations and household education and awareness programs. Even though Household
       investments are normally not part of project funding, a provision in the investment plan for
       public awareness campaigns aimed at sensitizing consumers on the motivation and
       financial benefits associated with investing in internal plumbing repairs is made. It is further
       recommended that council should make it a policy to fix leaking taps and pass on the costs
       to the consumers as a way to minimise water losses.




        Vandalised water meter House connection            Flow meter testing

       Service connections are taken off the 75 mm tertiary mains using cast iron saddles. Each
       saddle serves 4 ND 20 service connections.

       As can be seen from the photos below, the service connections are heavily corroded and
       incrusted. This was expected, given that these connections have been in service for over
       30 years. Most of the leakages in the network occur on these lines.

       It is therefore recommend that, all house connections be replaced including the saddles. It
       is further recommend that, the replacement of service lines should be of HDPE. HDPE
       house connections have proved to be durable and reliable. HDPE pipes have a smooth
       internal surface that does not corrode or tuberculate and maintains its flow capability over
       time. HDPE service connection pipes have a cost benefit associated with their longevity.
       The polyethylene pipe industry conservatively estimates the service life for HDPE pipes to
       be 50-100 years. This relates to savings in replacement costs for a long period.

4.2.2   Sewerage

        The wastewater infrastructure in Chitungwiza consists of both on-site and off-site sanitation
        systems. Building and housing guidelines, by-laws and standards stipulate that Low density
        properties depending on soil conditions, are not connected to the sewerage system. They
        are provided with on-site septic tanks and soak-away pits. High and medium density
        properties, on the other hand, are all connected to the sewerage system. The sewerage
        system in Chitungwiza consists of laterals, collector mains, pump stations and trunk mains
        that collectively convey wastewater to Zengeza Sewage Treatment Works. Figure 4-7
        shows the schematic layout of the sewerage system in Chitungwiza.

       length of the existing network and number of man-holes.

4.2.2.2 Pilot Area Investigations Findings and Recommendations â Sewerage Network

       The sewer collection system in the pilot area comprises of ND 150 Vitrified Clay (VC) and
       AC material.

       The sewer pipes are generally in good condition though; there is silt/solids accumulation
       due to insufficient sewage flow.The structural integrity of all inspected manholes is
       considered to be good. However, there seems to be insufficient flow in thesewers to flush
       away the solids (silt and human waste) as observed in the photos below.

       Given the findings elaborated above, it is recommend that measures should be put in place
       for routine cleaning of sewer pipes and ensuring that there is sufficient flow in the sewers by
       improving water supply services. Phase 1 of the UWSSRP has provided sufficient sewer
       cleaning equipment that the councils will be using to address the problem of sewer
       blockages.

       Investment should also be directed towards replacing those sewers that were reported by
       the council to have collapsed, including reconstructing the manholes that are damaged.

           â¢   Sludge Digesters.
       Modified Conventional Treatment Works Old Works
       The modified conventional treatment works consist of the following process units;

       Intake Works
       The inlet works consist of two parallel screen channels, which were supposed to be isolated
       by penstocks which are completely corroded. According to the original design, the two
       screen channels would comprise a coarse screen (with approximately 60mm spacing
       between bars) and a medium screen (with approximately 30mm spacing between bars),
       manually raked. However, only the medium screens are in place at present, but are highly
       corroded and damaged.
       Grit removal is supposed to take place in two parallel baffled grit chambers. The baffles
       (A.C. plates) are no longer in place and the weir penstocks are completely corroded and
       missing in some areas. The two grit removal chambers are nearly full with sand.
       Rusting Air-lift pipework 150 mm in diameter discharges grit into a shallow grit separation
       box, with missing aluminium sluice gates.

       Anaerobic Ponds
       The pond system consists of 4 parallel sets of ponds, i.e. 3 ponds in series each. All ponds
       are concrete lined with a sloped floor and a sloped collection trough to allow for gravity flow
       of the settled sludge towards the scour valves (one per pond) for desludging.
       Two ponds are interconnected by sluice gates in order to be able to take-out of operation
       one of the two ponds for maintenance (cleaning) purposes. A third pond can be by-passed
       by making use of a separation chamber, which was supposed to be equipped with sluice
       gates.
       All the ponds are filled up with sand, sludge and weeds.
       All gates, submerged steel plates (at the outlet of the ponds) and valves are corroded and
       some are missing.
       The ponds are surrounded by 150 mm diameter A.C. pipes, which supply recycled effluent
       from the outlet of the biological trickling filters by means of the effluent pumping station
       back to the ponds for scum breaking purposes. The recycled effluent is distributed on top of
       the ponds by making use of numerous jet pipes (50 mm diameter). However, these jet
       pipes are heavily corroded and not operational.

       Biological Trickling Filters
       The works comprises a total number of 5 trickling filters, approximately 38 m, in diameter
       and 4.0 m deep. The filters are filled with granite rocks of average grain size of around 50

       to 80mm from local quarries. The trickling filters were constructed between 1975 and 1980.
       They have, however, undergone major repair works to inlet columns and distributor arms,
       between 1997 and 1999.
       The 450 mm diameter incoming pipes to the five trickling filters are partly broken and valves
       would be required to isolate individual trickling filters for maintenance purposes.
       The concrete structures of the trickling filters do show cracks and leakages and thus have
       to be sealed.

       Effluent Pumping
       There are 2 no. Effluent Pump Stations. The old Pump Station was constructed in 1975 and
       comprises a total of 4 pumps. The new Pump Station was constructed in 1995 and
       comprises a total of 5 pumps, out of which 3 are treated effluent pumps to Imbwa farm and
       2 are recirculation pumps to anaerobic ponds for scum breaking purposes.
       Biological Nutrient RemovalTreatment Works;
       The BNR Works constructed with financial support from Japan in 2000 ha a nominal
       capacity of 20,000 m3/d. The plant was operated from the day of commissioning upto 2004
       and consists of the following process units;
          â¢   New Inlet Works complete with a grit system discharging grit to the existing Old
              Works grit removal system.

4.3.1.4 NRW assessment
          â¢   Bulk and Block Metering - Bulk and block metering is absent and new metering will
              be needed throughout as soon as water is restored.
          â¢   Distribution Networks - The distribution networks were reportedly in relatively good
              condition when water was last regularly supplied. The condition cannot be assessed
              now as water has been entirely absent for many years. Incidents of vandalism have
              been noted, especially at locations where public water points used to be provided.
          â¢   Consumer Metering - The Council reports that almost all consumers either have
              never had a meter or have a faulty meter.

        follows:
            -   6 No Boreholes with hand-pumps were installed in a joint programme with a church




        Water Point with Hand Borehole Pump


        A once off testing of all boreholes was carried out and all were found to have high iron
        content but met requirements for potable water.

4.3.2   Sewerage

4.3.2.1 Sewage Sub Catchments
        A small area of Epworth, within Wards 1, 2, 5 and 7 currently has a sewerage network.
        Ponds were constructed to collect and treat the sewage from the area but were quickly
        overbuilt and were never commissioned. Therefore the sewerage network was never
        commissioned either.

4.3.2.2 Sewer Reticulation System
        The sewerage system covering most areas that have water supply has never been
        commissioned. As soon as water supply is restored there are many properties that do have
        water connections and demand for a sewage system will grow.
        Discussions with the local board indicate that sewer pipes are likely to be in good condition
        whilst manholes will require sand removal and in about 50% of cases, reconstruction of the
        cover slab.

4.3.2.3 Sewage Treatment
        Epworth has an existing pond set which was never commissioned and is now overbuilt and
        used as a sports field and so cannot now be commissioned.

4.4     Norton
        A summary of the existing situation in Norton is presented here. More detail along with a
        narrative of the proposed investment measures is presented in Appendix 4.4.

4.4.1   Water Supply

4.4.1.1 Water Sources
        Norton currently obtains all of its water from Morton Jaffray WTW. A DN300 steel treated
        water supply line 4.3km long feeds the townâs reservoirs on a hill to the east of the town
        from the WTW.
        The existing supply has a capacity of between 8 and 10MLD, depending on the pumping
        pressure at the Morton Jaffray WTW. Modelling for Harare indicates that pressures at
        Morton Jaffray will be about 12.5bar at the discharge manifold once the refurbishment is
        complete. On this basis the existing line can supply around 8MLD to Norton. Current
        supplies are also around this figure.

4.4.1.2 Raw Water Pump Stations and Intakes and Transmission Mains
        The town currently has no raw water supply of its own although a project has been
        underway for some time to develop one. This is discussed further below.

4.4.1.3 Norton WTW
        The town currently has no water treatment works of its own although a project has been
        underway for some time to develop one. This is discussed further below.

4.4.1.4 Booster Pump Stations
        The current system in Norton is entirely gravity fed. This makes for easy operation but
        supply pressures have been declining with increased demands and as more demand areas
        have been added to the system.
        Transmission System
        Figure 4-11below shows the transmission system for Norton, in schematic form:

       The sole treated water supply to the whole of Norton is a single DN600 AC pipeline from
       the Norton Tanks to a distribution centre at the Council Engineering Offices in Ward 3. A
       major concern with this line once it enters the town boundary it has no servitude and has
       been overbuilt in areas.
       A tee off approximately half way along the line feeds Ward 2 which is a newly developed
       low density suburb.
       At ward 3 the DN600 splits into the various parts of the distribution system for Wards 1 and
       3 and with onward transmission to Wards5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10 and 11. These wards together
       make up the whole of the original town of Norton for which the water supply system was
       designed.
       New expansion areas in Wards 12,13 and 6 have been attached to the distribution system
       for the old town and receive almost no water. Modelling confirms that the network simply
       does not have capacity to supply these areas.
       Similarly Ward 4 is supplied through the distribution system of ward 3 and then via a 2.5km
       DN160 main which is entirely too small to supply the area.
       Thus under the existing condition areas of the old town which used to have adequate
       supply now suffer from low pressures and short supply hours but do receive water, New
       development areas receive little or no water at very low pressures. As a result many people,
       especially in the new development areas now rely on shallow wells for their water supplies.

4.4.1.5 Storage Reservoirs
       Norton has a single tank site with 2 x 5000m3 circular concrete tanks located on the site.

       Bulk and block metering is absent for most of the town although a GIZ project is currently
       underway to address this.
       The distribution network has certain parts which are known to be problematic and which will
       require significant rehabilitation. These tend to be the older areas of the town. The Council
       staff identified:
           â¢   DN300AC line in Wards 8 and 9 suffers regular burst despite low pressures.
           â¢   Western part of Ward 5 has GI pipes and very low supply pressures despite bing
               low lying.
       The Council Reports that over 50% of consumer meters are faulty or inoperable.

4.4.1.8 Emergency Water Supplies
       With the considerable water shortages that Norton has been experiencing the Council has
       an ongoing programme to supply water through strategically located water points and
       boreholes provided mostly by NGOs. There currently 21 boreholes with hand pumps.

4.4.2   Sewerage

4.4.2.1 Sewage Sub Catchments
        Originally there was just one main sewerage catchment in Norton with two small sub-
        catchments supplied by small sewage pump stations. All wastewater was conveyed to the
        Townâs wastewater treatment works on a single location near LakeManyame. Recent
        expansion in the town to the west has led to development outside of this sewage catchment
        and consideration must now be given to strategically planning the future sewerage
        catchments of the town.

        Ward 6 and 13 have a sewerage system which is blanked off and has neither ponds nor
        pump station to discharge to.
        A system is required which collects from all areas that are currently sewered and that the
        Council intends to provide with sewerage services in future. The proposed system of
        sewerage catchments for Norton is shown in the figure below.

4.4.2.2 Sewer Reticulation System
        Nortonâs sewer system varies in age but is generally considered to be in reasonable
        condition with no areas reported as causing significant maintenance problems. However
        general rehabilitation works will be expected on the system including targeted line
        replacements and manhole rehabilitation and cover programmes. Older parts of town
        experience significant amount of infiltration flow during and just after the rainy season.

4.4.2.3 Transmission Sewers
       The current sewage transmission system meets current hydraulic requirements and
       according tothe Council is reliable and does not present an undue maintenance burden.
       The system has been modelled assuming normalized water supplies to meet demands and
       in areas of existing development is adequate.
       In Figure 4-13 above the proposed sewerage catchment development is presented. If this is
       followed then all existing sewers have the capacity needed for the long term duty.
       For Norton, it is not planned that any expansion to the existing sewerage reticulation
       system will be carried out in the short term. Therefore there are no proposed short term
       measures to expand the main sewage transmission.

4.4.2.4 Sewage Pump Stations
       There are three sewage pump stations in Norton as follows:
       Tangatara SPS
       Tangatara SPS handles flows from a few houses in the Twin Lakes Area of Norton. Peak
       flows are <10l/s. The station pumps into a 785m long AC force main 150mm diameter.
       The SPS is not enclosed in a fenced area and its pump is considered by the Council to be
       unreliable as it is a temporary unit which is also used for many other duties. The 1AC force
       main suffers regular bursts and should be replaced.
       There are no standby power facilities and the station overflows at times of power failure.
       Details of the pumping equipment in the station were not available.

       Narira SPS
       Narira SPS handles flows from a few houses in the Narira Area of Norton. Peak flows are
       <10l/s. The station pumps into a 500m long AC force main 150mm diameter.
       The SPS is enclosed in a fenced area and its pump and force main are reliable.
       There are no standby power facilities and the station overflows at times of power failure.
       Large informal ponds have been dug to capture these overflows.
       Details of the pumping equipment in the station were not available.

       Narira SPS


       The Maridale SPS was built by a private developer to handles flows from the development
       in Ward 12. Modelled flows are 35l/second. It is however intended that this station will be
       abandoned in the long term and will therefore only continue to operate in the short term.
       Currently that station does not function because it has no pumps installed. No problems are
       reported with the Force Main which discharges to a manhole in Ward 9 from where sewage
       gravitates to the Norton WWTW.
       The SPS is not enclosed in a fenced area and there are no standby power facilities.
       As there is almost no water supplied to this area overflows of sewage are minimal but as
       soon as water returns these will be serious.

4.4.2.5 Sewage Treatment
       Norton has two sewage treatment plants at the same location known as the âOld Worksâ
       and the âNew Worksâ.
       Norton Old Works
       The Norton Old Works consists of a traditional treatment process with the following
       components:
           â¢   Intake works with coarse and fine bar screens, grit screening and flow measuring
               and flow diversion facilities.
           â¢   2 No. Primary sewage clarifiers with bridge mounted scrapers
           â¢   2No. Biological trickling filters

          â¢   2No. Humus tanks with bridge mounted scrapers
          â¢   Holding ponds for treated wastewater awaiting pumping to disposal
          â¢   Disposal to a forest plantation owned by Hunyani Pulp and Paper but currently
              leased out.
          â¢   Drying beds for clarifier sludge.
       In addition to the above, non treatment components include:
          â¢   A pump station with the following functions;
                   o   Pumping of primary effluent to trickling filters;
                   o   Pumping sludge to sludge drying beds;
                   o   Pumping of final wastewater to the holding ponds;
          â¢   High lift pump station at the ponds serving the new and old works
          â¢   7.8km AC main to the forest plantation serving the new and old works.
       Norton New Works
       The Norton New Works consists of a traditional treatment process with the following
       components:
          â¢   Intake works with coarse and fine bar screens, grit screening and flow measuring
              and flow diversion facilities;
          â¢   4 No. Primary sewage clarifiers of the âDortmundâ upflow type, without scrapers. 2 of
              the four are generally finished but not yet commissioned;
          â¢   3No. Biological trickling filters. Only one is commissioned and two are partly
              constructed;
          â¢   6No. Humus tanks of the Dortmund type. Three are commissioned and the other
              three are generally finished but not commissioned;
          â¢   Sludge drying beds;
          â¢   A partly completed digester. Construction quality on this is poor and the potential to
              complete it dubious.
          â¢   Disposal system is the same as for the old works.
       In addition to the above, non treatment components include:
          â¢   A pump station with the following functions;
                   o   Pumping of clarified wastewater to the filters;
                   o   Pumping primary effluent to trickling filter distribution box;
                   o   Pumping of final wastewater to the holding ponds;
                   o   Pumping sludge to sludge drying beds.
       Existing Works Capacity
       Calculations of the capacity of the new and old works have been carried out as part of the
       GIZ exercise which looked at, but eventually did not proceed with, rehabilitation of the

       works. The following capacities were provided based on actual sewage characteristics at
       the plant inflow:
       Old Works
       Limiting component is the Biological Trickling Filters with 3.2MLD capacity. Clarifier
       capacity is 6.6MLD. Works nominal capacity is 3.2MLD.
       New Works
       Limiting component is the Primary Clarifiers with 2.2MLD capacity in the two existing
       clarifies which can be economically raised to 4.4MD by commissioning the other two units.
       Filter capacity of the one complete unit is 4.7MLD. Therefore completion of the other two
       units is not required. The large filter capacity of this plant arises from design at a time when
       Norton had significant industry producing high COD wastewater.
       Combined Works Capacity
       The combined nominal capacity of the works is around 7.2MLD.
       Holding Ponds
       The existing holding ponds have an allowable loading rate of around 300kg BOD per day,
       equivalent to a flow of 2.4MLD from treated sewage from the works. Thus with any flow
       above this the pond will be overloaded and will remain anaerobic throughout.
       On-Going Works
       Norton Water supply Project
       When supply difficulties first arouse with the Morton Jaffray Supply Norton commenced a
       project to bring Raw Water from Lake Chivero to their own water treatment works, from
       where it was to be pumped to the hillside tanks. The project included the following
       components:
       1. An intake on Lake Chivero based on the re-use of an existing intake tower. This tower
          has been identified as problematic because it has a fixed depth intake which cannot be
          moved to access the layers of best water and it is located within a bay that wind tends
          to fill will weed from other areas of the lake. City of Harare had previously abandoned
          the use of this intake due to wind blown weed choking the area of the dam in which it is
          located.
       2. A raw water pump station and pipeline 3km long
       3. A 20MLD FC Reactor type water treatment plant.
       4. A treated water pump station and pipeline 1500m to the Norton tanks
       Money for the project was provided intermittently and at the time it was suspended the main
       works were the partial completion of the FC reactor WTW. None of the pump stations or
       pipework had been completed.
       A review of the project was carried out by GIZ with a view to a decision on whether it would
       be prudent to fund the completion of the works. GIZ concluded that the costs would be very
       high and that the raw water source quality was very low and therefore a risk to success and
       decided not to finance completion. The current review concurs with the GIZ findings and
       therefore we have recommended an increase in supplies to Norton from Morton Jaffray

        A summary of the existing situation in Ruwa is presented here. More detail along with a
        narrative of the proposed investment measures is presented in Appendix 4.5.

4.5.1   Water Supply

4.5.1.1 Water Sources
        Ruwa currently obtains water from the following sources:
           â¢    Nora Dam via DN450 uPVC/ DN515AC supply line which feeds into Green Sykes
                dam on the outskirts of the town. This has been constructed as part of a 25 year
                Build Operate Transfer (BOT) scheme.
           â¢    City of Harare (treated water supply) via:
                   o   DN525 supply line from Donny Brook tanks to the ZIMRE estate and
                       onwards into the supply network for Ruwa
                   o   DN350 supply line from the Ventersberg tanks which feeds the Mutare Road
                       Ground Tanks via a booster station on the western outskirts of Ruwa.
           â¢    Green Sykes dam on the outskirts of the town which is connected to the WTW via
                DN515 AC supply line.

        Figure 4-15:   Ruwa Water Supplies

        The supplies from City of Harare have become increasingly unreliable and are now virtually
        non- existent. Thus over the past ten years Ruwa has focused on its project to bring the
        townâs water needs from Nora dam, some 15.5km southeast of the town. This project has
        been largely completed in 2014.

       The ZINWA yield assessment for the âNora Pick up Weirâ gives a 4% yield of around 10,000
       ML per annum or 27MLD. Ruwa have installed a raw water system capable of transferring
       21ML per day (24 hour pumping).

4.5.1.2 Ruwa WTW
       The Ruwa WTW is of the âFC Reactorâ type. This is a proprietary design of âHydro Project
       Zimbabweâ of Bulawayo.
       The FC reactor contains two functional units within a single vessel constructed of either
       steel of concrete.The base of the unit functions as an upward flow clari-flocculator and
       above this there is a filter which achieves filtration through a floating bed of hardened
       kaylite. Filtration is upwards and backwash is downwards and is achieved by opening a
       valve at the base of the unit. The system operates entirely under gravity and requires no
       circulation or backwash pumps.
       The FC reactor plant is used in many locations throughout Zimbabwe and the Ruwa
       Engineering staff are very happy with the performance of the units installed.
       There are two FC reactor units on the site:
       1. The original 2.5MLD unit fabricated steel unit
       2. A more recent 5MLD reinforced concrete unit
       Works was commenced on a 4000m3 clear water reservoir at the site of the WTW but this
       has not been completed. The FC reactor units therefore drain directly into supply.
       The works is generally in good condition although the following issues were identified:
       1. Corrosion of the 2.5ML steel FC reactor vessel.
       2. Chemical dosing arrangement is not functional and requires overhaul. Filter beds are
          losing hardened kaylite media which finds its way into supply and clogs supply meters.
       3. Sludge drying bed construction is incomplete
       4. Treated water reservoir is incomplete.

4.5.1.3 Booster Pump Stations
       The system currently contains one booster pump station, split into two parts, located at the
       Mutare Road reservoir site.

       The original part of the station pumps to the 180m3 elevated tank at that location whilst a
       new section of the pump station is under construction and will deliver to the new Damofalls
       Tanks and generally into supply.

       Three sources of treated water are available to Ruwa when all things are functioning
       normally. These are the two City of Harare reservoirs at Ventersberg and Donny Brook and
       the Ruwa WTW.
       The City of Harare Supplies are as follows:
           â¢   The original supply to Ruwa was a DN315 line from Ventersberg through a booster
               at Sunway City and then Via a DN200 Line to RuwaâsMutare Road Tanks.
           â¢   Later a DN525 was added to supply the ZIMRE area without any intervening
               storage.
           â¢   Currently no supply is received from Ventersberg and little from Donny Brook.
           â¢   There are no reported problems with the pipelines themselves.
       The supply from Ruwa WTW Operates as Follows:
           â¢   At the water treatment works there are a number of connections directly into the
               supply network of the northern part of Ward 9.
           â¢   A DN315 AC line runs south with offtakes to Ward 9 and Damofalls before reducing
               to DN250 and terminating at the Mutare Road Ground Tanks

             â¢   From Mutare Road Ground Tanks a single DN250 goes into supply in the southern
                 area of the town with multiple off-takes.

4.5.1.5 Storage Reservoirs
       Existing storage reservoirs are located and supplied as shown in Figure 4-16 above. The
       following reservoirs exist in the town:

       The above table covers the storage within the town only. Of great importance to Ruwa but
       belonging to Harare are the Donny Brook tanks which have a large diameter supply line to
       Ruwa and to a lesser extent the Ventersberg tanks which have a long DN300 supply line to
       Ruwa but which should also feed the growing Sunway City development. Little or no water
       is currently received through these lines.

4.5.1.6 Distribution Network
       The following Zones are logically identified from the network layout. Currently poor valves
       etc. mean that many of the zones are heavily interconnected and do not constitute demand
       management areas.

       Bulk and block metering is absent for most of the town.
       The Ruwa distribution networks are relatively new as Ruwa is a new settlement. As such
       major issues with dilapidated pipes and house connections are not generally reported.

       With the considerable water shortages that Ruwa has been experiencing the Council has
       an ongoing programme to supply water through strategically located water points and

4.5.2   Sewerage

4.5.2.1 Sewage Sub Catchments
        Ruwa has a single sewage catchment served by the Adelaide Ponds. This is divided into
        four sub-catchments, each served by a single sewage pump station.
           â¢   Runyararo SPS Sub-catchment - This is a small area of Wards 1 and 2 which drains
               to the Runyararo SPS. This SPS has a short lift into a sewer line in the Ruwa Main
               SPS sub-catchment at Jun-93.
           â¢   Chiremba SPS Sub-catchment - This covers wards 4 and 6 and areas of Ward 5
               which drain to the Chiremba SPS. This SPS has a short lift into a sewer line in the
               Ruwa Main SPS sub catchment at Jun-102.
           â¢   Ruwa Main SPS Sub-catchment - This covers the whole of Ruwa, including flows
               from the two above sub catchments with the balance of flow arriving all the way by
               gravity to the Ruwa Main SPS.
           â¢   Wards 5&7 Sub Catchment - The new developments in Wards 5 and 7, south of the
               Chiremba SPS cannot feed any of the existing sub catchments by gravity. It would
               appear that the developer intends to install a sewage pump station at the
               southernmost extent of this area (Jun-31 in mapping) and pump up to a manhole
               within the Ruwa Main SPS sub-catchment. This pump station has not yet been
               installed.

4.5.2.2 Sewer Reticulation System
        Ruwa is a relatively new town and as such there are no significant problems reported with
        the sewer network. However, in the last decade water supplies have been short and flows
        therefore low and it is expected that a return to normal supply levels may show up areas
        where the existing system has deteriorated.

4.5.2.3 Transmission Sewers
        The main sewer network for Ruwa has been modelled using the expected flows at the 2030
        time horizon to identify sewer lines which may need to be augmented or upgraded to
        accommodate the expansion of the town. It should be noted that all of the current network
        appears adequate for normal flows with the current population.

4.5.2.4 Sewage Pump Stations
        There are three sewage pump stations in Ruwa as follows:
        Runyaro SPS
        Runyaro SPS (Jun-87 in modelling). Peak modelled inflows were 18l/s and pumping head
        is not clear but <15m for the short lift to Jun-93 in the Ruwa Main SPS sub catchment.
        The SPS has is enclosed within a fenced area and has an inlet works with coarse and fine
        bar screen and grit screening upstream of the pumps.
        Pumping equipment consists of one submersible pump in a wet well.
        The station is prone to overflows as a result of power failures but is mechanically reliable.
        Spills are into the Ruwa stream and thence into the Manyame No standby power is
        available at the station.

       Chiremba SPS
       Chiremba SPS (Jun-106 in modelling). Peak modelled inflows were 6l/s and pumping head
       is not clear but are estimated around 40m for the lift to Jun-103 in the Ruwa Main SPS sub
       catchment.
       The SPS is enclosed within a fenced area and has an inlet works with coarse and fine bar
       screen and grit screening upstream of the pumps.
       Pumping equipment normally consists of two submersible pumps but has been replaced by
       a single end suction pump after failure of the submersibles.
       The station is prone to overflows as a result of power failures but is mechanically reliable.
       Spills are into the Ruwa stream and thence into the Manyame. The station has a relatively
       new standby generator.
       Ruwa Main SPS
       All sewage from Ruwa ends up at the main sewage pumps station. From here it should be
       pumped around 1250m to the Adleigh ponds located between Ruwa and Epworth.
       The SPS is enclosed within a walled area and has an inlet works with coarse and fine bar
       screen and grit screening upstream of the pumps. There are three inlet works consisting of
       coarse and fine screens and grit screening. Two feed into old wet wells and are not used
       whilst the one feeding the current pump station is in good condition and is in use.
       The station is currently inoperable with one pump failed, two motors failed and one panel
       failed. With no pumps running, all of Ruwaâs sewage discharges untreated into the
       Manyame catchment.

4.5.2.5 Sewage Treatment
       Ruwa currently uses the Adelaide stabilization ponds which are in an area which forms part
       of Epworth and which has been zoned by Epworth for development. Ruwa has no direct
       access to the ponds and discharge no effluent to them.

5       POPULATION, WATER DEMAND AND WASTEWATER FLOW PROJECTIONS
        This chapter presents the methodology for projecting the water demand and wastewater
        flows. The projected flows are applied for each project town, and Greater Harare as a
        whole, to determine the medium and long-term water supply and sewerage infrastructure
        input/output requirements. The chapter also summarises the basic assumptions made
        concerning water usage, wastewater generation and water losses, which were already
        presented and approved in the Final Inception Report.

5.1     Key Planning Criteria

5.1.1   Service Levels
        Domestic water consumption depends to a large extent on the service levels utilised by the
        users. These service levels depend on the affluence and income levels of the water users.
        The housing development standards in Zimbabwe categorise properties according to
        density and size of properties. There are generally three categories: High density with
        properties (stands) equal or smaller than 400 m2, medium density with properties between
        400 m2 and 1,000 m2, and low density areas with properties larger than 1,000 m2.
        The standard in Zimbabwe was to provide house connections for all urban properties with
        sewer connections for all medium and high density stands. Low density areas were to be
        on-site septic tanks with soakaways. There were some exceptions such as Epworth, which
        developed as an informal settlement although informal settlements were not allowed. In the
        last 15 years there have been a number of housing developments that have either not been
        provided with technical infrastructure services or have been provided with infrastructure but
        without water services. Residents have been forced to obtain their water from boreholes,
        wells and surface water whilst sanitation has been on-site septic tanks with soakaways
        (even on small stands), pit latrines or open defecation.
        However, it should be noted that even though the National Water Policy emphasises that
        there is a duty to provide safe water and sanitation services to all, it recognises the
        challenges associated with such a commitment and hence acknowledges that the
        requirements for house connections and water borne sanitation may be relaxed during the
        recovery phase. Hence, the provision of waterborne sanitation systems will be strategically
        phased over the planning horizon. The use of low cost technologies for services provision
        during the recovery phase will be promoted as stipulated by the National Water Policy. In
        this regard, the population in peri-urban areas such as parts of Epworth and Harare South
        that are currently developing informally will initially be provided with low cost water supply
        systems based on water kiosks or house connections with flow restrictors.
        Field visits and discussions with the councils were conducted to determine the proportions
        of population in each service level category. The results of these surveys are presented in
        the Appendix.

5.1.2   Per Capita Consumption
        The current standards for specific water consumption in Zimbabwe are generally higher
        than the regional averages. However, the actual consumption is lower than the standard
        provisions due to water rationing induced by high network leakages and reduced water
        production. Infrastructure rehabilitation interventions are expected to restore production

        facilities to design capacity and also arrest the leakage situation in the network. However,
        the specific water consumption is not expected to rise back to the old standards due to a
        number of factors such as: progressive block tariff system which penalises high water
        usage, improved public awareness on the need to conserve water, and state driven policies
        that promote principles of financial sustainability in the provision of water and sanitation
        services. In light of the foregoing, the specific consumption figures presented in the table
        below have been applied in the calculation of the domestic water demand.

5.1.3   Institutional Consumption
        Water consumption for institutions such as schools, hotels, hospitals, prisons, service
        camps and administrative offices is closely intertwined with domestic consumption. In
        essence, the water requirements for daily patrons and workers of these institutions are
        generally included in the total water requirements, if they come from within the enumeration
        area. An allowance (15% of domestic consumption) has been made for people that
        patronise and visit the institutions from areas outside the area of consideration (ward).

5.1.4    Industrial and Commercial Consumption
         Industrial and commercial demand on the other hand depends on activities of the
         commercial or industrial establishment. Most of the commercial and industrial activities use
         water in their production processes in addition to the water used for cleaning and
         consumption by the workforce.
         Studies have shown that the size of the property on which the industry is located, gives a
         good indication of the amount of water required by that industry. At this master-planning
         stage, detailed characteristics of the existing and future industries are not known and in the
         absence of such information, the industrial water requirements have been calculated on the
         basis of area. A unit consumption figure of 15 â 22.5 m3/ha/day has been assumed.
         The current industrial land area was calculated using a combination of information gathered
         during field investigations and recent satellite images.

5.1.5    Physical Water Losses
         Physical water losses are inevitable no matter how well controlled and maintained a public
         water supply system is, but it can be minimised. Such losses occur at various stages of the
         water supply chain. In the distribution network, losses occur at the numerous pipe
         connections and fittings. This type of losses depends on the type of fittings and the nature
         of connections as well as workmanship. As the network gets older, the various elements
         begin to fail due to rusting or bursting, increasing the network losses considerably. This is
         normally exacerbated by high pressures in a network based on system operation and
         control. This type of losses can be mitigated by regular maintenance and routine
         rehabilitation. There has not been a specific attempt to quantify the physical losses in all the
         towns. Data on total NRW (physical and commercial losses) is generally reported by the
         councils without breaking it down into the two components. Without carrying out appropriate
         measurements in the field, it is virtually impossible to determine the current physical water
         losses. Furthermore, the erratic water supply situation especially in the satellite towns and
         the non-functional bulk and domestic water meters makes it very difficult to determine
         current physical losses.
         Moving forward, it is reasonable to assume that system losses and especially technical
         losses will decrease significantly as the quality of the infrastructure improves and the level
         of operation is enhanced. For the purposes of the current estimates, it is assumed that
         physical losses will reduce to 25% by 2020 1 and eventually to 20% by 2030. The reduction
         to 20% of the average day gross water demand is in-line with what can be considered
         desirable within a system 2 . All utilities would like to eliminate physical water losses
         completely, however a more economically realistic and acceptable level is around 15% to
         20%. The reduction in leakage rates will be achieved by implementing the activities outline
         in Table 2-2 overleaf. While we recognise the efforts being made by Harare Water to
         reduce the water losses in the network, we believe that significant water loss reduction will
         only occur after implementation of a targeted water loss reduction project.

5.1.6   Peak Factors
        Water production and transmission facilities are usually designed to meet service
        requirements during the peak demand month. The peak month in Zimbabwe is October
        when demand is generally around 25% above average. Hence a peak season factor (Psf)
        of 1.25 was used.
        Water distribution pipes are designed with peak hour hydraulic loading. The peak hour
        factor depends on the nature of commercial activities and the demographic characteristics
        of a town. Generally, the higher the population, the smoother the diurnal curve (the less the
        fluctuations in water consumption). Table 2.3 below shows peak hour factors for different
        population ranges. Given the population and demographic characteristics of the urban
        centres that make up Greater Harare, a peak hour factor of 1.5 is considered applicable for
        distribution network designs. However, as part of an investment master plan, network
        hydraulics of the supply networks in the various networks of Harare are not undertaken.
        This activity will be undertaken for supply areas selected for rehabilitation and/or expansion
        during the study and final design stage.

5.1.7   Wastewater Return Rates
        The wastewater flows have been estimated as a function of the water demand. Studies
        have shown that the proportion of water that is returned as wastewater is highly dependent
        on the water consumption patterns. Properties such as those in low density areas with well-
        manicured and watered gardens will generate less wastewater (as a percentage of water
        consumed) than high density properties with no lawns. The table below shows the assumed
        water return for each service user category. Generally low density areas are on septic tanks
        except that where soil conditions are not suitable for soakaways, sewers are provided.

5.1.8   Service Coverage
        Service coverage is a very important input parameter in the water demand and wastewater
        flow calculations. Field surveys and extensive discussions with the councils were used to
        determine the current water and sewerage service coverage for all the urban centres that
        make up greater Harare. Thematic maps showing the areas serviced were created and
        used to estimate the service coverage percentages used in the calculation of water demand
        and wastewater flows.
        Water Service Coverage
        The water service coverage considered factors such as the actual reticulation network
        coverage and the prevalence of boreholes.
        The population living in areas where there is a water reticulation network were considered
        âcoveredâ even though the supply in those areas is erratic so that they could be included in
        the water demand calculations. This approach essentially determines the amount of water
        needed to service the population living in areas that already have a reticulation network.
        The mainly informal settlements that are not reticulated, such as large parts of Harare
        South and some parts of Epworth, are considered ânot coveredâ and are excluded from the
        current water demand. Given that the guiding principles outlined in the National Water
        Policy stipulate access to water services for all, the coverage proportion for these areas

       have been increased over the planning period while keeping in mind that the service levels
       in the ârecovery periodâ will be basic (water kiosks and service connections with flow
       limiters).
       In recent years, there has been a proliferation of private boreholes in the low density areas,
       mainly as a reaction to the unreliable municipal water supply. The properties with private
       boreholes are essentially not using municipal water even though they have a service
       connection. There are significant numbers of private boreholes in the northern low density
       suburbs of Greendale, Waterfalls, Mt Pleasant, Highlands, Hatfield Belvedere, Marlborough,
       Borrowdale, Alexander Park, Eastlea, Avondale, Vainona and Northwood. The table below
       shows the approximate numbers of registered private boreholes as reported in the Upper

       of the northern low density suburbs. It also excludes the informal high density areas on pit
       latrines. Using sewer network data collected from the councils, we have defined the so
       called âurban boundaryâ - the current extent of the municipal sewer network and areas
       where it would be economically and technically feasible to extend municipal sewerage
       services. The map in Figure 5-1 shows the current âurban boundaryâ and the proposed
       extension of this boundary over the planning horizon.
       The northern low density suburbs such as Vinona, Pomona, Borrowdale, Quinnington,
       Greystone Park, Helensvale and Glenwood are mainly on septic tanks and are not covered

       by the municipal sewer reticulation system. The area around the CBD and the western high
       density suburbs are all covered by the municipal sewer reticulation system. There are two
       isolated sewer reticulation catchments in the high density areas of Tafara/Mabvuku and
       Hatcliffe.
       Harare is developing rapidly southwards into Harare South ahead of water and waterborne
       sanitation services. Most parts of Harare south are not sewered and people are relying on
       pit latrines. The âurban boundaryâ will gradually be extended into these areas over time as
       long as the property development is controlled and urban planning protocols are followed.
       A sewer reticulation network was laid in parts of Epworth, but it was never commissioned.
       This network cannot be resuscitated because the pipes and manholes have been
       vandalised over time. Hence the whole of Epworth is considered to be un-sewered. Most
       people are relying on pit latrines. With the construction of the proposed wastewater
       treatment works in Harare South, the southern parts of Epworth can be provided with a
       sewer reticulation network.
       Chitungwiza is mostly sewered except for informal settlements sprouting on the southern
       and eastern outskirts. The new high density housing developments in the Nyatsime area
       will be sewered in phases as shown on the map.
       Most of Ruwa is on sewers despite the fact that the sewage is currently not being treated.
       The whole Ruwa catchment area will be connected to an outfall sewer that will lead to the
       new wastewater treatment works in Harare South. This will allow most of development
       areas in Ruwa to be sewered in phases as indicated on the urban boundary map. In the
       medium term, the urban sewer boundary will be extended westwards in to cover the new
       development areas in Ward 9 and southwards within Wards 7 and 5.
       In Norton, the high density suburbs of Ngoni, Katanga and Damo Falls are all sewered. The
       majority of the low density suburbs such as Twinlakes, Galloway, Nharira and Knowe are
       on septic tanks. Sewers were also laid in Maridale and Johannesburg but they were never
       commissioned. These sewers have since been vandalised and cannot be reused. The
       people in these suburbs are relying on pit latrines. They make up part of the population
       without water borne sanitation services. The sewer network in these areas will be rebuilt in
       the medium term, extending the current sewer boundary westwards. In the long term, the
       urban sewer boundary will be extended to the new high density development area west of
       Knowe (Chegutu 14).

5.2    Population in Service Level Categories
       Water supply and sewerage schemes are sized and designed to meet the service
       requirements of a population. Hence the target population is a very important parameter in
       the calculation of water demand and wastewater flows. The base population and population
       projection methodology have been elaborated in Chapter 3. Domestic water consumption is
       largely driven by the level of affluence of the population and the service level type used to
       receive the services. Affluent people with house connections tend to use more water than
       poor people accessing services through yard taps or communal water points. It is important
       therefore to determine the population in each service level category before the domestic
       water consumption can be calculated.
       As elaborate in Chapter 3, the population in each service level category was determined
       through a combination of consultations with the councils and spatial analysis of population
       and water distribution infrastructure. The tables below population distribution across service
       level categories in each project town. The capita water consumption for each of these
       service categories is

5.3    Water Demand
       The level of investment required to provide water supply and sewerage services to a
       population is driven by the water demand and the resultant wastewater flows. Water
       demand comprises domestic, institutional, commercial and industrial water use
       (consumption), and the inevitable water losses resulting from the physical leakages and
       inefficiencies in the commercial operations of the service provider (NRW). The water

        consumption varies over time, so the water supply and sanitation infrastructure is sized and
        designed with capacity to provide services during the highest possible demand (peak

5.3.2   Greater Harare
        The water demand summary tables for Greater Harare are presented in the tables below.
        Table 5-13 shows the demand summary for all the towns put together, while Table 5-14
        shows the peak season demand for each town. The total peak season demand for Greater
        Harare is currently around 712,000 m3/d. It reduces to 662,000 m3/d in the medium term
        and then grows to just over 820,000 m3/d in the long term. The reduction in the medium
        term is due to the assumed reduction in the physical losses over the next 7 years and the
        gradual reduction in per capita water consumption over time. As elaborated in the Inception
        Report, for these assumptions to take root, there must be significant investment in network
        rehabilitation, including awareness campaigns aimed at changing water usage habits.

        The Greater Harare area is currently utilizing water from the Upper Manyamen Catchment,
        except for Ruwa which uses sources in the Mazoe Catchment. The 4% risk yield of the four
        dams (Seke, Harava, Chivero, Manyame) that provide storage for the water supply in
        Greater Harare is around 478,000 m3/d (allowing for upstream commitments only) . clearly,
        the demand already exceeds the available water at 4% risk. The available water could
        increase if the risk factor was to be relaxed to 10% as is being advocated in some quarters.

       However, the evident climate change effects on the environment, particularly rainfall
       patterns, may weaken the argument for relaxing the risk factor.
       In terms of water production facilities (raw water abstraction and treatment), the installed
       capacity currently stands at a total of just over 710,000 m3/d, even though the actual
       production is around 540,000 m3/d. The plant rehabilitation efforts currently going on under
       various financing sources are expected to restore the water works to design capacity.
       Given the demand figures presented in the tables above, it is clear that investment in new
       production facilities will not be needed in the medium term. Investments must rather be
       directed towards arresting the physical losses in the distribution network. It will only become
       necessary to invest in new sources in the long term. Given the low yield and general
       environmental degradation of the Upper Manyame Catchment, the additional sources and
       production facilities must be located in other catchments. The Kunzvi dam and water
       treatment plant in the Mazoe catchment will have to be built within the period 2020 to 2030.
       The figure below shows the balance between water production and demand over the
       planning horizon. In the medium term, the production deficit will be addressed by
       investments in the distribution network to reduce losses and the rehabilitation of water
       works to restore production capacity. Kunzvi Dam will only become necessary after 2020.
       Given the low yield and general environmental degradation of the Upper Manyame
       Catchment, additional production facilities located in other catchments are needed soon.
       The Kunzvi dam and water treatment plant in the Mazoe catchment will have to be built as
       soon as possible.
       We propose that Kunzvi should be constructed first instead of Muda Dam because it can
       provide all the required capacity at one site. If Muda were to be developed first, Kunzvi
       would still have to be developed with a short period because Muda Dam WTW (with a
       capacity of 50,000 m3/day would not provide enough water to satisfy the projected demand
       within the planning horizon. However, the Muda Dam and the Shabanove schemes should
       also be considered in the long term beyond the planning horizon of this study
       Kunzvi will be developed in two phases â phase I with a capacity of 100,000 m3/day should

5.3.3   Harare
        The water demand for Harare is summarised in the table below. The important thing to note
        is that Harare would be able to meet its water requirements even in the long term if the
        satellite towns had their own sources. However, it is not economically and, in some cases,
        technically feasible to develop own sources in each the satellite towns. As explained above,
        the collective water deficit in the long term will have to be addressed collectively as greater
        Harare in the long term.

        In terms of storage requirements in the distribution network, the design criteria are that
        there should be at least 1 day storage (of the peak season daily demand). The total
        reservoir storage in Harare is currently around 830,000 m3. It may appear as if there is
        enough storage capacity for the long term horizon. But, given the restructuring of the
        network necessitated by the addition of the Kunzvi scheme, some of the main reservoir
        sites such as Letombo and Alexandra Park will have redundant capacity that cannot be
        utilized in the new structure. Hence there will be need to upgrade some of the reservoir
        sites in order to provide the required 1 day storage for the zones commanded. The table
        below shows the zones where there is need to upgrade storage capacity. Reservoirs that
        will supply the new development areas in Harare South and the northern low density
        outskirts will have to be upgraded. The deficits at Hatcliff and Kambanji reservoirs will be
        compensated by the huge surpluses at Alexandra Park and Greendale respectively.

5.3.4   Chitungwiza
        The table below shows the water demand summary for Chitungwiza. Chingwiza relies on
        bulk water from Harare Water. It is estimated that Chitungwiza currently receives around
        16,000 m3/d from Harare Water. This is clearly nowhere near meeting the current water
        requirements for Chitungwiza, let alone long term water requirements. The JICA study

        concluded that there is no ground water potential in the area around Chitungwiza and that
        developing Muda Dam as an own source for Chitungwiza is more expensive than buying
        bulk water from Harare water. The deficit therefore will have to be addressed by
        rehabilitating the bulk transmission pipeline from Harare and strengthening the water
        purchase agreement with Harare Water or indeed merging with Harare into one water utility
        company â an economic and political decision that will have to be taken by the government.
        Our recommendation, however, is that it would be in the best interest of Chitungwiza to be
        part of single Greater Harare utility.

        The Chitungwiza water scheme currently has one reservoir site in the Seke area with a total
        storage volume of 46,000 m3. This represents less than one day storage volume, which is
        below the stipulated criteria. Additional reservoirs are recommended, both at the location of
        the existing reservoirs and in the Nyatsime area where most of the new housing
        developments are planned.

5.3.5   Epworth
        The water demand summary for Epworth is shown in the table below. Epworth relies on
        bulk water from Harare even though supply is dismal. It is technically and economically not
        feasible to construct an own water source for Epworth. The yield for ground water sources
        is very poor and there is no surface water source within the vicinity of Epworth. Hence it
        should continue relying on supply from Harare.

        There is currently no storage reservoir in Epworth and this has emerged as one of the
        major issues around demand management raised by the local board. Given that there is no
        high ground within Epworth where a storage reservoir can command the with reasonable
        pressure, Epworth will continue using Ventersburg Resrvoirs and measures have been
        proposed to improve supply from the reservoirs to Epworth.

5.3.6   Norton
        The water demand summary for Norton is shown in the table below. Norton relies on bulk
        water from Harare Water. It currently estimated that Norton receives around 5,000 m3/d
        from Harare Water. This is clearly not enough to meet the townâs current water service
        requirements. There is a general suspicion that the main bottleneck that limits the amount
        of water to Norton is the hydraulic capacity of the ND 300 transmission main. Given the
        proximity of the Norton to Morton Jaffray (MJ) WTW, it is more economical for the town to
        continue getting bulk water than building an own source. The hydraulic capacity of the
        transmission main from MJ WTW will be increased in phases to meet the water
        requirements for the town.

        In terms of storage, Norton relies on 2 x 5,000 m3 capacity reservoirs situated on the south-
        eastern outskirts of the town. The available storage volume is way below the one day
        storage requirement. Hence additional storage is required. The additional storage will be
        strategically located within the service area.

5.3.7   Ruwa
        The water demand summary for Ruwa is presented in the table below. Ruwa is the only
        satellite town with its own source, in addition to bulk water from Harare Water (though
        unreliable according to the council). There is a water treatment plan in the Tara township
        area with a nominal capacity of 7,500 m3/day abstracting water from the Green Sykes Dam.
        The plant is currently not operating at full capacity because there is not enough raw water
        in the Green Sykes Dam.
        A new raw water pipeline from Nora Dam to Green Sykes Dam has just been
        commissioned. This will increase available raw water to Ruwa. With this pipeline fully
        operational the water treatment plant should be able to operate at full capacity throughout
        the year. Even at full capacity, the amount of water produced will not be enough to satisfy
        current and future demand. Since the new raw water pipeline has a hydraulic capacity of
        21,000 m3/d, there is room to expand the treatment facilities. The council has proposed to
        increase the capacity of the existing plant by 10,000 m3/d to bring the total nominal capacity
        to 17,500 m3/d. This proposal has been adopted in this investment plan. Even with this
        increase in water production capacity, it will still be short of the estimated medium and long
        term water demand. Hence Ruwa will still continue relying on Harare Water to close the
        deficit. The construction of the Kunzvi water supply scheme will make more water available
        for bulk supply to Ruwa

         the planning horizon until the total volume is around 44,000 m3.

5.4      Wastewater flow Estimations
         Wastewater flow is closely correlated with water use. The water supplied to a property is
         used for consumption, watering the garden and cleaning. The water used for cleaning and
         other hygienic uses ends up as wastewater. Zimbabweâs low density properties are
         generally huge with lush gardens that require a lot of water to maintain. Studies in
         Zimbabwe have shown that 50-85 % of the water supplied ends up as wastewater
         depending on the housing category. 3
         The wastewater calculation procedure and the results are elaborated in the following sub-
         sections.

5.4.1    Calculation Methodology
         The current and projected wastewater flow is calculated using the process illustrated in the
         figure below and the formulae stated hereunder.

         The present wet weather wastewater flow for Harare is estimated to be around 182,000
         m3/d, increasing to 191,000 m3/d in 2020 and 243,000 m3/d in 2030. The nominal hydraulic
         capacity of the treatment facilities in Harare is 219,000 m3/d. However, the treatment
         facilities are in a dilapidated state. Harare Water estimates the current treatment capacity to
         be a paltry 26,000 m3/d. The Zim-fund Project and the loan from Exim Bank of China are
         expected to extensively rehabilitate the wastewater treatment facilities and restore the
         nominal treatment capacities in the short and medium term. In the long term, there will be a
         capacity deficit. Most of the additional sewage is expected in the Harare South
         development area.
         Wastewater flow in Chitungwiza is estimated to be round 38,000 m3/d, increasing to 55,000
         m3/d in the long term. Chitungwiza has a 20,000 m3/d BNR plant which has not been
         operational since 2005 and a 35,000 m3/d modified conventional plan which is partially
         operational. Hence, most of the wastewater from Chitungwiza is discharged to the water
         courses untreated. Rehabilitation works under the Zim-Fund project are expected to restore
         the modified conventional treatment plant to nominal capacity. The BNR plant is not being
         rehabilitated under the Zim-fund project, but has been included in this investment plan.
         Hence, the existing plants would suffice for the long term when rehabilitated. However, the
         need to avoid pumping and the topographical configuration of the new development areas
         means that the sewage from St Maryâs and the Nyatsime area will be transmitted to the
         new Harare South wastewater treatment facility.
         Wastewater from Ruwa is not being treated at present because the pond system the town
         was using has been abandoned due to land wrangles with Epworth Local Board. The
         Epworth Local Board has taken back the land on which the ponds are located because it
         falls within their boundaries. Hence there is urgent need to find a solution for treating the
         estimated wastewater out of Ruwa.
         Epworth has a sewer reticulation network, which was never commissioned because the
         treatment plant to which it was designed to discharge was never built 4. Hence, residents



4 The Safege sewerage master plan of 2003 had proposed a wastewater treatment plant just south of Epworth that would cater for the
         Donny Brook area and Epworth. This facility was never built due to lack of finances

       are currently using pit latrines and septic tanks. The sewer network can still be utilised once
       there is a treatment plant that can receive the sewage from Epworth.
       A combined solution for the treatment sewage from Ruwa, Donny Brook, Epworth, Harare
       South and parts of Chitungwiza has been proposed. The sewage treatment facility will be
       strategically located at the lowest point so that the sewage from all these areas will be
       collected and conveyed by gravity. The treatment facility will have enough capacity to
       handle the estimated sewage flows for the target areas. A detailed description of this
       proposal is presented in the Appendix.
       The wastewater flow for Norton is expected to increase from the current 3,800 m3/d to
       13,200 m3/d in the long term horizon. Norton currently operates one old wastewater
       treatment plant a nominal capacity of 3,200 m3/d. There is a new plant under construction,
       which, when complete, will be able to treat 4,400 m3/d, bringing the total treatment capacity
       to 8,200 m3/d. This will barely meet the requirement for the medium term. Additional
       treatment facilities will be required in the long-term, especially in the new development west
       of Knowe.

6      STRATEGIC PLANNING PRINCIPLES FOR WATER AND SANITATION

6.1    Introduction
       The objective of the medium- and long term investment plan for Greater Harare is to
       provide cost estimates, along with implementation schedules for specific water supply and
       sewerage infrastructure components. Such investments must be tailored towards agreed
       national water sector objectives and policy directions. Such are enshrined in the National
       Water Policy published by the Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management
       in March 2013. The policy defines the vision for urban water supply and sanitation services
       as follows:
       âAll urban water users should enjoy adequate, continuous, readily accessible, safe, hygienic,
       sustainable and affordable domestic water and sanitation services provided by accountable,
       efficient, coordinated, funded and capacitated institutionsâ
       The policy document is clear in its strategic objectives. The key urban water and sanitation
       policy guidelines are summarised as follows. These guidelines provide the foundation for
       the planning strategies applied in this investment master plan.

       The National Water Policy provides the principle development objective and necessary
       foundation to develop planning strategies for this investment master plan. The policy
       document demands for adequate and affordable services to all residents and underlines the
       importance of efficient and conservative management principles when producing and
       supplying drinking water.
       Recurrent cost recovery is a key feature of the policy, which also underlines the importance
       of private and public users, to pay for services. Metering of water production and
       consumption is an important instrument for effective operation and demand management,
       which is also promoted by the policy document. Also, the reduction of Non-Revenue Water
       (NRW), is promoted by the policy document and considered to be an important aspect of
       demand management.
       The policy also acknowledges the fact that operations can be provided by private service
       providers and that capacity building and investments in operation and maintenance
       equipment are necessary for sustainable service provision.
       The policy document considers the past service standards as being high, and suggests that
       such high standards could be reduced until Zimbabwe has reached again a normalised
       situation. It is believed that this aspect of the policy may be reconsidered. Promotion of
       conservative standards for water production, storage, use and treatment, which consider
       recent environmental sound technologies and sustainable approaches can be suggested,
       which do not contradict high service level and improved living standards.

6.2.1   Water demand management
        Investment measures considered under water demand management are designed to
        promote the effective and efficient operation of the water supply infrastructure.
        These project components will entail the procurement and installation of new water meters
        for all consumer connections (100% metering), procurement and installation of pre-paid
        water meters for large bulk water consumers, consumers database review and identification
        of illegal and unregistered connections, network re-structuring to allow for bulk metering
        and water balancing, rehabilitation/ replacement of existing water distribution network,
        rehabilitation and installation of section valves to facilitate zoning of the network into
        metering districts, installation of bulk meters/ data loggers and pressure reducing valves,
        the implementation of leakage control, monitoring and repair programme and set-up of
        permanent computerised monitoring programmes and a replacement programme of leaking

6.2.2   Water supply service improvement
        The investment measures covered under the water supply service improvement component
        will lead to adequate services in terms of quantity and quality. We have developed specific
        criteria to define the water production requirements for various planning horizons and
        determined the adequacy of present service levels and defined progressive service level
        improvements for the planning horizon (see Section 6.3 for more details).
        The investment measures in this component cover the rehabilitation and extension of water
        production facilities, reservoirs, pumping stations, the installation of telemetry system for
        monitoring of reservoir levels and provision of water quality monitoring equipment.

        The sanitation service improvements are required to rehabilitate or expand existing
        wastewater treatment facilities, sewer networks and pumping stations. The detailed scope
        will be defined as per present situation analysis and effluent flow projections. The
        investments into these sanitation improvements will lead to improved collection and
        treatment of sewage and promote public health and the environment. Sanitation service
        improvements will have an important environmental benefit in that reduction in pollution of
        the main water sources will result in reduction of risks to health and reduction in water
        treatment costs.

6.2.6   Accompanying Measures
        The accompanying measures include investment measures aimed at improving capacity to
        carry out technical and commercial operations such as, revenue improvement program,
        technical and commercial operations management, management and technical information
        systems and professional services.
        Revenue improvement program
        The revenue improvement program covers the scope of a complete customer survey and
        data base clean-up of the existing billing database. The component also considers the
        upgrading or procurement of a modern computerised billing system, which allows for
        consumer meter management, NRW applications, asset management and other utility
        related operational activities. The benefits of a modern and improved billing and
        infrastructure management systems are significant and lead to reduced revenue loss and
        enhanced asset management.

        Operations management
        The procurement of tools and equipment for the water and sanitation service teams are
        necessary to allow for active operation control and maintenance. This will reduce down-
        times and promote infrastructure lifespan. The required tools and equipment are aligned
        with the existing and proposed infrastructure development. Workshops for general and
        specific maintenance are equally required, as well as suitable transport for technical
        supervision and maintenance teams. A large proportion of low density housing areas are
        operated with individual septic tank systems, which require emptying. Provisions for the
        purchase of vacuum tankers, including tools for the operations, may be necessary.

       Management and technical information systems
       Management and technical information systems are important tools for utility management,
       especially for larger urban service providers. We consider under this investment component
       the procurement of a modern accounting and payroll system, the procurement and
       installation of network information/asset management system, based on GIS technology,
       and other types of information systems or modules (e.g. asset management, demand
       management and customer support service in combination with the billing system).
       Especially the asset management system will provide a number of advantages as far as
       monitoring, operations and maintenance of the network infrastructure is concerned.

6.3     Service levels and performance indicators

6.3.1   Introduction
        Services must be provided according to a defined level to the consumers. This guarantee of
        service is necessary to provide value for money to customers and is an instrument for
        regulating the consumerâs and service providerâs interests.
        In an environment of limited market competition, the water and sanitation services should
        be regulated and be organised in accordance with specific guidelines to ensure that
        consumers are provided with adequate and reliable services. It is also in the interest of a
        service provider to offer and provide such agreed services in order to promote and increase
        customer satisfaction and willingness to pay for services.
        Service levels are considered a minimum standard the service provider should aim at
        exceeding such levels. Considering the present dilapidated state of infrastructure in Harare
        and the satellite towns, the following proposed service levels can only be achieved after the
        implementation of the medium term investment program.

6.3.2   Proposed Investment Performance indicators
        Considering the service level guidelines in the National Water Policy and the current
        situation in Greater Harare, the investment plan intends to achieve the performance targets
        indicated in the table below.

7      DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED WATER AND SANITATION INVESTMENT MEASURES
       The assessment of the existing water supply and sewerage systems described in chapter 4
       has concluded that there is need for major rehabilitation investment to bring the facilities
       back to good working order. Further analysis of the water and sewerage service
       requirements detailed in Chapter 5 indicates that the water and sewerage reticulation
       networks will need to be extended in the medium and long term horizons.
       The water demand production capacity in the medium term will be addressed by the
       rehabilitation of the existing water treatment facilities and implementation of a structured
       NRW reduction strategy. Additional water production capacity will only be added in the long
       term, with the construction of the Kunzvi scheme. Priority will also be given to the
       rehabilitation of the existing sewerage reticulation network and wastewater treatment
       facilities in order to improve the quality of raw water in the Manyame catchment.
       This chapter summarises the identified investment measures. The conceptual design of the
       technical investment measures is presented in the Appendix 4. The proposed investment
       measures have been designed to meet the service requirements for the medium term year
       of 2020 and long term year of 2030.
       The proposed investment measures are grouped in the broad categories illustrated in the
       figure below.

7.1.1   A â Water Demand Management/NRW Reduction Measures
        Any efforts aimed at reducing NRW water including network rehabilitation should be
        preceded by a comprehensive NRW assessment and other preliminary activities such as
        network mapping. The NRW assessment will shade more light on the components of NRW
        and the results of this exercise will inform a comprehensive NRW reduction action plan.
        The following activities will have to be undertaken
           â¢   Assessment of commercial losses: This activity will include review of billing and
               revenue collection processes that impact commercial losses. This activity will first
               quantify and categorise commercial losses as guided IWAâs âbest practiceâ water
               balance. It will also identify commercial processes that contribute to commercial
               losses. Then a comprehensive strategy to reduce commercial losses will be
               developed. The strategy may involve policy and major work processes changes.
           â¢   Assessment of physical losses in some pilot District Metering Areas (DMAs): The
               aim of this activity is to determine the quantity of physical losses in typical areas and
               also determine the amount of resources needed reduce the physical losses. The
               results obtained from the pilot areas will then be used to estimate the physical
               losses in the entire network and the level of effort required to reduce the losses
               within economic reason. The outcome of this activity will be a network rehabilitation
               investment programme and a sustainable strategy to reduce physical losses over a
               reasonable period of time.
           â¢   Development and calibration of a hydraulic model for the water supply system: The
               objective of this activity is to have a model for predicting the behaviour of the water
               supply system under certain operating conditions. The model will be used to
               optimise the distribution network for better management of physical losses.
           â¢   Pressure measurements: Among the many factors that affect water network leakage
               is pressure. Pressure affects leakage in a number of ways, including: the rate of
               leakage, frequency of bursts, location of leaks, pressure surges and pressure
               cycling. The objective of the pressure measurements is to establish the diurnal
               pressure profiles in the different parts of the distribution network. The pressure
               measuring exercise will yield the requisite information for the development of the
               performance indicators and the planning of the NRW management strategy.
           â¢   Review of network operating procedures: this activity is necessary to ensure a
               sustainable leakage control programme. It is important to understand why the water
               is being lost in the first place. This activity will involve carrying out a thorough review
               of the physical characteristics of the network and the current operational practices.
               The outcome will be a catalogue of problems caused by poor infrastructure and
               poor network management practices. This information will form the basis for
               structural reforms in the management of the water supply system.
           â¢   Establishment of a Computerised Network Information System: record keeping is an
               integral part of a good water network management system. A GIS database
               management system is preferred because of the location dimension of the network
               elements. The City of Harare has no functional GIS-based network information
               system at the moment. Network data is still on hard copy maps that are hardly
               updated. So there is an urgent need for a comprehensive network mapping exercise.
               This should actually precede all the other leakage related network investigations.

       In order to bring the physical water losses down to around 20% by 2030, the network will be
       systematically rehabilitated (replacing pipes and valves in bad condition). The ToR
       stipulates that the network rehabilitation measures for the entire network shall be
       determined using statistical methods. Pipe and valve condition assessments were
       conducted in a pilot area that could be deemed as representative of the entire network. The
       details of the pilot area investigations have been presented in Chapter 4. The findings of
       the investigation are summarised below:
          â¢    The AC distribution pipes are reported to be in good condition despite their age;
          â¢    All of the gate valves are in poor condition. Network leakages occur at these fittings;
          â¢    The majority of service connections are corroded and incrusted. This is where most
               of the network leakages occur;
          â¢    Areas of the city with GI Pipe networks are badly corroded. Some replacement has
               been carried out in the CBD but significant work remains to replace all GI pipes.
          â¢    The majority of water meters are non-functional and few functional ones are not
               measuring water usage accurately;
          â¢    Significant amount of water is wasted after the meter resulting in unnecessary water
               use/ wastage.
       In light of the above findings, the following measures are recommended:

          â¢   Since the AC pipes are still in good condition, they should be left in service except
              for the broken pipes identified by council;
          â¢   Network replacement programmes shall target areas where the ditribution network
              is in poor condition, especialy areas with GI pipes.
          â¢   All pressure reducing valves shall be replaced
          â¢   All network appurtenant structures such as valves and fire hydrants should be
              replaced;
          â¢   All service connections and water meters should be replaced;
          â¢   All bulk water meters should be replaced;
          â¢   A database cleanup programme shall be carried out which shall include measures
              to locate unmetered connections and illegal connections.
          â¢   Under normal circumstances, line after the service meter and the plumbing system
              in a property is the responsibility of the property owner or water user. But, if the
              property is not metered, there is no incentive for the water user to keep their
              plumbing system in good condition and reduce water wastage. In a water supply
              scheme where most water users are not metered (or meters are not working) as is
              the case in Harare, there are huge water losses at the properties and this is usually
              part of the NRW since the customers are billed on normal usage estimates. Hence,
              we recommend that council should, firstly, meter all customers and then implement
              a water conservation programme that has elements of rehabilitating household
              plumbing installations and household education and awareness programmes. The
              finances for such a programme are part of the investment plan.
       Given the recommendations outlined above, the investment measures needed to
       rehabilitate the network and reduce physical losses are presented in the table below. The
       network rehabilitation measures proposed will be implemented under the medium term
       project.

7.1.2.1 Rehabilitation of Morton Jaffray WTW including Source Works
        Raw water for Morton Jaffray WTW is abstracted from three intake works namely;
           â¢   The old intake tower (intake No. 1) constructed in 1952 and draws water at five
               water levels; three being the City of Harare intakes and the other two an irrigation
               intake and the river outlet pipe respectively. The COH intakes are connected to a
               common 1100 mm diameter water main which transports raw water to the
               distribution chamber at the head of the water treatment works. This tower was
               abandoned because of water quality issues and recently has only been used as an
               irrigation abstraction point by local farmers.
           â¢   The new intake tower constructed in 1976 in order to resolve the issue of
               abstraction levels in the old intake tower and to move the intake to an area that was
               not affected by windblown weed. This discharges raw water into a mixing chamber
               via a 3 m x 3 m tunnel before it is fed into the treatment works.
           â¢   The Lake Manyame 3m x 3m rectangular 15.4 km long tunnel. The tunnel is
               approximately 45m into the ground at the works and raw water is pumped from a
               riser shaft.
        Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Works was constructed in three stages. All three units are
        conventional surface water treatment plants consisting of the process units illustrated in the
        schematic below:

                Chemical
                                     Rapid mixing           Flocculation       Sedimentation
                 dosing




                                                                                   Rapid Sand

                                                                                    Filtration

        The first module was constructed in a number of phases starting in 1953, with an initial
        rated capacity of 162,000 í µí±3 /d, followed by the second module in 1976 with a rated
        capacity of 227,000 í µí±3 /d. The third module was constructed in 1994 with a rated capacity
        of 227,000 í µí±3 /d. Therefore, the total capacity of the Treatment Works is thus 616,000
        í µí±3 /d. However, due to operational challenges, it has been reported that, the present
        combined output under the current mode of operation is limited to only 429,408 í µí±3 /day.

       All the intakes and the components of the treatment units were subjected to comprehensive
       condition and capacity assessment. The details of the assessments are presented in
       Chapter 4 and Appendix 4.1. The general finding is that facilities are in urgent need of
       rehabilitation so that they are restored to the nominal design capacity. The identified
       rehabilitation measures are summarised in the table below.

7.1.2.2 Rehabilitation of Prince Edwards WTW
       Prince Edward Water Treatment Works was constructedin 1972.The design capacity of PE
       WTP is 90,000 m3/d. The amount of water currently being treated at PE-WTW is 55,000
       m3/d during the wet season and 40,000 m3/d in the dry season respectively. The raw water
       intake amounts during the above periods are around 60,000 m3/d and 45,000 m3/d
       respectively.
       The plant was subjected to comprehensive condition and capacity assessment. The details
       of the assessments are presented in Chapter 4 and Appendix 4.1. The general finding is
       that facilities are in urgent need of rehabilitation so that they are restored to the nominal
       design capacity. The identified rehabilitation measures are summarised in the table below.

7.1.2.4 Rehabilitation of storage Reservoirs
       The water supply system of the City of Harare (COH) has 27 treated water reservoir sites.
       The reservoirs are dotted all around the city between 1,460 m and 1,600 m amsl. The main
       reservoirs in terms of capacity are Letombo, Alexandra Park, Lochinvar, Greendale and
       Highlands which together have a storage capacity of approximately 553,740 m3. This is
       about 70% of the total storage capacity of the water supply system.
       All the reservoirs were assessed. The table below shows the rehabilitation measures at
       each reservoir site.

7.1.3.1 Kunzvi Water Supply Scheme
        The Kunzvi water production facilities will be needed to augment current production in the
        medium and long term. The facilities have been sized to produce and deliver 150,000 m3 /d
        of water during the peak month. Hence the average production will be 120,000 m3 /d and
        total production per year will be 43,800 Ml p.a. according to ZINWA, the 4% risk yield after
        deducting upstream commitments is 43,200 Ml p.a â which is the same order of magnitude

       to take into account the need to accommodate the raw water from the proposed Musami
       scheme on the Shavanoe River.
       Kunvi will be built in two phases. Phase I with a capacity of 100,000 m3 /d will be built over a
       period of three years starting in 2019. Phase II with a capacity of 50,000 m3 /d will be added
       in 2029.
       The scheme was extensively studied in 1999 by GKW Consult and BCHOD. Under this
       study, we have endeavoured to update the parameters used and revisited the sizing of the
       different components. A new hydraulic model has been built to resize the facilities. The
       scheme will comprise a dam, an intake tower, raw water transmission mains, a water
       treatment plant (150,000 m3/day), two treated water pump stations, and a transmission
       main to deliver treated water to Donny Brook Reservoirs. There will also be need to
       restructure the water distribution system so that the water from Kunzvi is only restricted to
       the eastern parts of the city, while the water from Morton Jaffray WTW is restricted to the
       western and north-western parts. Hence, high level primary transmission and secondary
       distribution mains needed to effect the resource zoning, have been identified and sized.
       The full discussion on the hydraulic analysis is presented in Appendix 4.1. The proposed
       investment measures for the Kunzvi Scheme, including the primary transmission mains is
       shown in the table below.

7.1.3.2 Construction of new storage reservoirs
       In terms of storage requirements in the distribution network, the design criterion is that
       there should be at least 1 day storage (of the peak season daily demand). The total
       reservoir storage in Harare is currently around 820,000 m3. There is enough storage even
       for the long term horizon. However, there will be need for localised reservoirs for the new
       development areas such as the northern low density extension areas around Sally Mugabe.
       We have proposed a new 8,000 m3 reservoir along Shamva Road.

7.1.3.3 Extension of Distribution Network to new areas
       The water reticulation network will be extended to cover the new development areas. As
       outlined in Chapter 3, most of the additional population in the medium and long term will
       settle in Harare South, Whitecliff, Rainham, Mount Hampden, Mount Pleasant Heights,
       Sally Mugabe and Caledonia.There will also be some infill growth in a few wards that are
       not saturated yet. The water network requirements in the new development areas have
       been calculated on the basis of population and the per capita infrastructure requirements.
       The per capita infrastructure requirements were calculated using the existing network
       quantities and the population from the 2012 census. The parameters below were used to
       calculate the infrastructure requirements in extension areas
          â¢     House hold size (assuming one connection per household):                        6 people
          â¢     Tertiary pipe network lengths per capita â ND 75:                               1.2 m/ca.
          â¢     Tertiary pipe network lengths per capita â ND 100:                              0.8 m/ca.
       The table below shows the investment measures needed to extend the water network to
       the new development areas.
       In addition to the above measures which will cover the areas formally supplied with water
       there will remain in the short term some areas where no formal water supply exists. These
       areas will need to be provided with kiosks with water supply from the nearest point of
       supply in the city or by borehole.

7.1.4   D â Sewerage Service Improvements
        The sewerage improvement measures will focus on rehabilitating existing sewage
        collection transmission, treatment and disposal facilities. An extensive condition
        assessment was carried out on all the major facilities such as Firle WWTW, Crowborow
        WTW, Hatcliff WTW, and a number of sewage pump stations. Capacity assessments of the
        sewerage network were also carried out. The proposed investment measures aimed at
        improving sewerage services and protecting the Manyame catchment are briefly described
        below.

7.1.4.1 Rehabilitation of Firle WWTW
        Firle sewage treatment works comprises a total of 5 individual wastewater treatment
        streams with a nominal overall design treatment capacity of 144,000m3/d. Units 1 and 2
        were commissioned around 1970, and have a nominal design treatment capacity of 18,000
        m3/d each. Unit 3 is a modified activated sludge process biological reactor commonly
        known as a BNR with a 5 stage configuration for biological nutrient removal of nitrogen and
        phosphorous, and was commissioned in 1982 and has a nominal design treatment capacity
        of 18,000 m3/d.Unit 4 is also a modified activated sludge process biological reactor with a
        3-stage configuration for the biological nutrient removal of nitrogen and phosphorous,
        instead of the 5-stage concept as unit 3. Unit 5 is a modified activated sludge process
        biological reactor commissioned in 1996 and has a nominal design treatment capacity of
        72,000 m3 /d.
        Firle WWTW in addition to the above units has 3 No. ponds in series serving all units for
        additional effluent treatment in order to meet the corresponding standards for land and/or
        crop irrigation. However, under normal circumstances treated effluent from units 3, 4 and 5
        is directly discharged into Mukuvisi River.
        Firle Sewage Treatment Works has two separate effluent pump stations â the existing
        Effluent Pump Station (EEPS) with a total of six pumps, all of which are not working and the
        new Effluent Pump Station with a total of four pumps, two of which are operational. Treated
        effluent from Unit 1 & 2 is discharge on adjacent farms owned by the City of Harare for
        further purification.
        The identified rehabilitation measures at Firle WWTW are summarised in the table below.

7.1.4.2 Rehabilitation of Crowborough WWTW
       Crowbrough WWTP comprises of 3 units with a combined treatment capacity of 54,000
       m3/d. The estimated dry weather flow is reported to be between 100,000 to 110,000 m3/d,
       being twice the design capacity. Unit 1 was commissioned in 1959 and Unit 2 some years
       later. These have a nominal design capacity of 18,000 í µí±3 /d each. Unit 3, commissioned in
       1984 has Nominal design capacity 18,000 í µí±3 /d. Units 1 and 2 have primary settlement with
       trickling filters. Unit 3 is BNR. The table below summarise the rehabilitation measures
       identified.

7.1.4.5 Replacement/Upgrading of existing sewer network
       The sewers are generally in good condition, except for the exposed ferrous sections on
       stream crossing, which are badly leaking. The pipes in these sections will be replaced.
       Sewers in older parts of the city such as Mbare, CBD, Kuwadzana, Rugare and Westlea
       are reported to be in bad condition. These sewers will also be replaced. According to the
       hydraulic model, some trunk sewers will be upgraded to increase carrying capacity. The
       details of the modelling are presented in Appendix 4.1. The table below summarises the
       sewers that will be replaced/upgraded.

7.1.5   E â Extension of Sewerage Services

7.1.5.1 Harare South sewerage Investment measures
        The Harare South sewerage investment measures relate to the sewage collection and
        treatment for the eastern, south eastern and southern suburbs of Harare. These areas all
        fall within the Manyame river catchment.
        Currently these areas have varied sewage provision and include large un-sewered areas
        into which the city is expanding. Collected sewage is, with the exception of Chitungwiza,
        treated in many, dispersed small stabilization ponds which are generally functioning poorly.
        The current situation in this catchment is that the majority of sewage is therefore
        discharged into the Manyame and its tributaries untreated.The prince Edward Water
        Treatment works extracts water from the centre of this increasingly polluted catchment.
        Existing Plan
        Current plans date back to the 2003 Harare Sewage Master Plan prepared by Safege. This
        master plan recognized that the major expansions of Harare would be in the southern
        suburbs, termed in that report the Southern Industrial Area or SIA. That Master Plan
        expected population growth within the SIA to increase sewage production from zero in 2003
        to 85MLD in 2015. The management of this sewage and sewage from eastern suburbs was
        proposed as follows:
        1. Ventersberg, Tafara, Donny Brook, Ruwa and Epworth would all be drained to a new
           sewage treatment works at Lyndhurst Farm. The plan called for the construction of
           collector and trunk sewers leading a Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) plant on
           Lyndhurst Farm. Considerable progress was made on the sewer construction but none
           on the treatment works before the project was suspended due to lack of funds.
        2. The Southern Harare Suburbs, collectively termed the SIA were divided into six sub
           catchments. The 2003 plan calls for part of the effluent from the SIA area to be pumped
           to Lyndhurst Farm WWTW whilst 3 new BNR works and two additional sewage
           pumping stations would serve the balance of the SIA.
        3. Not included in the 2003 Harare Master Plan is Chitungwiza. Current plans are for the
           construction of a new Sewage Treatment Plant at the confluence of the Nyatsime and
           Manyame rivers an the North West corner of Chitungwiza.

       Proposed Combined Plan
       This project is recommending a proposal to combine all of these areas into a single sewage
       catchment with all of the effluent to be collected into a major new Harare South Trunk
       Sewer (HSTS) and treated at a new Harare South Wastewater Treatment Works
       (HSWWTW). The proposal would include the following sub projects:
       1. Completion of the Donny Brook to Lyndhurst Farm trunk sewer and connection of
          Ventersberg, Donny Brook and Mabvuku /Tafara to this line. This was partly
          constructed in 2003 but not completed. This sub project is required regardless of
          whether a combined sewage plan is implemented and will allow for the
          decommissioning of three sets of waste stabilization ponds in Donny Brook.
       2. Connection of the Epworth area to the Donny Brook to Lyndhurst Farm trunk sewer
          which passes through Epworth. This sub project is required regardless of whether a
          combined sewage plan is implemented and will allow the Epworth sewer system
          constructed 20 years ago finally to be commissioned.
       3. Construction of two trunk sewers to link the collection system in Ruwa to the Donny
          Brook to Lyndhurst sewer. This construction will allow the decommissioning of three
          sewage pumping stations in Ruwu which currently regularly discharge raw sewage into
          the Ruwa river.This sub project is required regardless of whether a combined sewage
          plan is implemented.
       4. An extension from the end of the existing Donny Brook to Lyndhurst Farm Sewer
          approximately 28km to a proposed new Sewage Treatment Plant close to the
          confluence between the Manyame and Mukuvisi Rivers.
       5. An extension in the trunk sewer proposed to link Chitungwiza to its new WWTW by
          approximately 1km such that it ties into the trunk sewer from Lyndhurst Farm to the new
          WWTW.
       6. Construction of a single WWTW at the end of the new Trunk Sewer. The construction of
          this works would obviate the need for construction of the five new WWTWs currently
          proposed at Lyndhurst Farm, SIA Zones 2,3 and 4 and Chitungwiza.
       Ideally these works would be put in place immediately but the HSTS and its associated
       treatment works represent a very major capital investment at a time when the city has many
       competing demands for resources. Therefore it is planned that interim measures will be put
       in place in the short to medium term to keep the existing system functioning and return it to
       its designed functionality whilst the HSTS scheme will be implemented as a long term
       investment measure.
       Interim measures proposed are as follows:
       1. Short term minor works to rehabilitate the existing Donny Brook 1 to 4 waste

       2. Construction of temporary pond system in Ruwa to treat Ruwa Wastewater in the

       5. Only the lowest portion of the Harare South Trunk Sewer will be developed in the
          Medium Term, from Chitungwiza to the outfall.
       6. Initially the new Single Treatment works will be sized for just flows from Chitungwiza
          and areas downstream and so wil require a small pump station and DN500 force main
          to the location of the new ponds and irrigation system.

7.1.5.2 Extension of sewer reticulation system in new development areas
       Waterborne Sanitation

       The sewer network will be extended to cover the new development areas. As outlined in
       Chapter 3, most of the additional population in the medium and long term will settle in
       Harare South, Whitecliff, Rainham, Mount Hampden, Mount Pleasant Heights, Sally
       Mugabe and Caledonia. There will also be some infill growth in the existing areas. The
       sewer network requirements in the new development areas have been calculated on the
       basis of population and the per capita infrastructure requirements. The per capita
       infrastructure requirements were calculated using the existing network quantities and the
       population from the recent census. The parameters below were used to calculate the
       infrastructure requirements in extension areas
          â¢     House hold size (assuming one connection per household):                         6 people
          â¢     Tertiary sewer collector lengths per capita:                                     1.2 m/ca.

       Unserviced Areas

       A significant proportion of the population of Harare will remain outside of the areas provided
       with formal waterborne sanitation, even in the long term. Sewage system investments will
       take many years to implement and some area will remain outside of the sanitation boundary
       for the town even in the long term. In these areas support must be given for the proper use
       of on-site sewage disposal and treatment systems. Support will include:
          â¢   In areas of high water table where pit latrines and pour flush latrines are not
              practical, communities will need support to deploy and manage urine separation
              composting toilets. This type of toilet offers a good solution in these areas but as
              they require a more significant structure than pits or pour flush toilets they are often
              unaffordable. In addition users must be trained in their proper use and communities
              must find a source of ash which has to be added to the composting solids and is not
              readily available in Harare where people do not cook on wood stoves.
          â¢   In other areas pour flush toilets are clearly the preference of the householders and
              are seen to be installed where ever sufficient water is available. These offer a cheap
              alternative to a full waterborne solution with significant benefits over pit latrines.
              Pour flush systems should only be encouraged in areas where water supply is piped
              in. Support to communities wishing to use this type of toilet may include:
                   o   Improvements to water supply such that the householders have sufficient
                       water to operate pour flush systems
                   o   Training of builders in good practices for construction of pour flush toilets
                       and soakaways.
                   o   Provision of subsidised components such as cover slabs and squat pans to
                       improve the affordability of pour flush systems
          â¢   Only where water supplies are very scarce will pit latrines be favoured by house
              holders. In future, reliance on pit latrines should therefore be limited to areas where
              no formal water supply system is in place. Support to communities on pit latrines
              may include:
                   o   Training of builders in good practices for construction of pit latrines.
                   o   Provision of subsidised components such as cover slabs, squat pans and
                       ventilation pipes to improve the affordability of quality pit latrine systems
                   o   Training of householders in methods of maintaining the toilets and
                       preventing the breeding of insects in the toilets.

7.2.1   A â Water Demand Management/NRW Reduction Measures

        Pilot area investigations yielded the following findings:

           â¢   The AC distribution pipes are reported to be in good condition despite their age;

           â¢   All of the gate valves are in poor condition. Network leakages occur at these fittings;

           â¢   The majority of service connections are corroded and incrusted. This is where most
               of the network leakages occur;

           â¢   The majority of water meters are non-functional and few functional ones are not
               measuring water usage accurately;

           â¢   Significant amount of water is wasted after the meter resulting in unnecessary water
               use/ wastage.

           â¢   The billing database is poorly maintained and revenue collection efforts are
               hampered by this.

        In light of the above findings, the following measures are recommended:

           â¢   Since the AC pipes are still in good condition, they should be left in service except
               for the broken pipes identified by council;

           â¢   All network appurtenant structures such as valves and fire hydrants should be
               replaced;

           â¢   All service connections and water meters should be replaced;

           â¢   All bulk water meters should be replaced;

           â¢   Under normal circumstances, line after the service meter and the plumbing system
               in a property is the responsibility of the property owner or water user. But, if the
               property is not metered, there is no incentive for the water user to keep their
               plumbing system in good condition and reduce water wastage. In a water supply
               scheme where most water users are not metered (or meters are not working) as is
               the case in Chitungwiza, there are huge water losses at the properties and this is
               usually part of the NRW since the customers are billed on normal usage estimates.
               Hence, we recommend that council should, firstly, meter all customers and then
               implement a water conservation programme that has elements of rehabilitating
               household plumbing installations and household education and awareness
               programmes. The finances for such a programme are part of the investment plan.

           â¢   Support will be required to clean up the billing database and to ensure that all mains
               water connections are properly recorded.
        Given the recommendations outlined above, the investment measures needed to
        rehabilitate the network and reduce physical losses are presented in the table below. The
        network rehabilitation measures proposed will be implemented under the medium term
        project.

        the new Nyatsime development areas. The detailed discussion on the capacity analysis
        and sizing (hydraulic modelling) in presented in Annex 4.2. The table below shows the new
        transmission and primary mains.
        In addition to the above measures which will cover the areas formally supplied with water
        there will remain in the short term some areas such as the Seke Communal Area where no
        formal water supply exists. These areas will need to be provided with kiosks with water
        supply from the nearest point of supply in the city or by borehole.

7.2.3.2 Construction of new storage reservoirs

        The reservoirs for Chitungwiza are located on the north eastern outskirts of the town north
        of Makoni Shopping Centre at the end of the network. The reservoir site has four ground
        reservoirs of equal capacity and an elevated tank. They have a total storage capacity of
        approximately 46, 000 m3. A small booster pump station houses the pump sets used to
        transfer water to the elevated tank.

        Considering the long term demand of around 85,000m3 , it is clear that the existing storage
        capacity will not be sufficient. Hence we recommend the following investment measures:

           â¢     Construction of a new 22,000m3 /d concrete reservoir at Makoni Reservoir Site;

           â¢     Construction of a new 15,000 m3 /d concrete reservoir at highest point on Nyatsime
                 Farm Development.

7.2.3.3 Extension of distribution system in expansion areas

        The water reticulation network will be extended to cover the new development areas. As
        outlined in Chapter 3, most of the additional population in the medium and long term will

7.2.4   D â Sewerage Service Improvements
        Sewerage improvement measures in Chitungwiza consist of rehabilitation of Zengeza
        WWTW, rehabilitation of Tilco Sewage Pump Station and replacement/upgrading of sewers.

7.2.4.1 Rehabilitation Zengeza WWTW

        Zengeza WWTW consist of two treatment facilities constructed in phases â the Modified
        Conventional Treatment Works and the Biological Nutrient Removal Works. The modified
        conventional works consist of inlet works, anaerobic ponds, biological trickling filters and an
        effluent pumping station. The BNR Plant was constructed with some financial support from
        Japan in 2000.It has a nominal plant capacity of 20,000 m3/d. It consists of the following
        process units;
            â¢    New Inlet Works complete with a grit system discharging grit to the existing Old
                 Works grit removal system.

7.2.5   E â Extension of Sewerage Services

        Formally Sewered Areas

        The sewer network will be extended to cover the new development areas. As outlined in
        Chapter 3, most of the additional population in the medium and long term will settle in
        Longlands, Braemar A, Dunnotar, Cawdor, Tantallon and Edinburgh which are loosely
        referred to as Nyatsime Farms. There will also be some infill growth in the existing areas.
        The sewer network requirements in the new development areas have been calculated on
        the basis of population and the per capita infrastructure requirements. The per capita
        infrastructure requirements were calculated using the existing network quantities and the
        population from the recent census. The parameters below were used to calculate the
        infrastructure requirements in extension areas
            â¢    House hold size (assuming one connection per household):                     6 people
            â¢    Tertiary sewer collector lengths per capita:                                 1.2 m/ca.

        Unserviced Areas

        Certain areas of Chitungwiza will remain outside of the areas provided with formal
        waterborne sanitation, even in the long term. Sewage system investments will take many
        years to implement and some area will remain outside of the sanitation boundary for the
        town even in the long term. In these areas support must be given for the proper use of on-
        site sewage disposal and treatment systems. Support will include:
            â¢    In areas of high water table where pit latrines and pour flush latrines are not
                 practical, communities will need support to deploy and manage urine separation
                 composting toilets. This type of toilet offers a good solution in these areas but as
                 they require a more significant structure than pits or pour flush toilets they are often
                 unaffordable. In addition users must be trained in their proper use and communities
                 must find a source of ash which has to be added to the composting solids and is not
                 readily available in Harare where people do not cook on wood stoves.
            â¢    In other areas pour flush toilets are clearly the preference of the householders and
                 are seen to be installed where ever sufficient water is available. These offer a cheap
                 alternative to a full waterborne solution with significant benefits over pit latrines.
                 Pour flush systems should only be encouraged in areas where water supply is piped
                 in. Support to communities wishing to use this type of toilet may include:
                      o   Improvements to water supply such that the householders have sufficient
                          water to operate pour flush systems

                       improve the affordability of pour flush systems
          â¢   Only where water supplies are very scarce will pit latrines be favoured by house
              holders. In future, reliance on pit latrines should therefore be limited to areas where
              no formal water supply system is in place. Support to communities on pit latrines
              may include:
                   o   Training of builders in good practices for construction of pit latrines.
                   o   Provision of subsidised components such as cover slabs, squat pans and
                       ventilation pipes to improve the affordability of quality pit latrine systems
                   o   Training of householders in methods of maintaining the toilets and
                       preventing the breeding of insects in the toilets.

7.3.1   A - Water Demand Management/NRW Reduction Programme

7.3.1.1 Rehabilitation of the Distribution Network
        No detailed investigations were done as condition assessments of the water network in
        Epworth. Rather data gathered for other towns under previous studies was combined with
        information from local officials to build up a picture of the state of the networks and the cost
        estimates from replacement of network piping are therefore based on a simple percentage
        of the total length of the network in place.
        Pipes
        Whilst the Epworth water network is considerably newer than in many areas of Harare it
        has had perhaps the worst supply of water. Estimates therefore allow for replacement of up
        to 10% of the existing network pipes.
        Network Valves
        Discussions with the operators of the network in Epworth indicate that valves in many areas
        have not had water and have not been operated for many years. Water supply quantities
        are too small to allow the operators to practice any form of demand management.
        Therefore the investment plan allows for full replacement of network valves. The
        comprehensive valve replacement programme in the short term will not need to be
        repeated as a long term measure.
        Bulk Metering
        There are no operational bulk or block meters in Epworth. Therefore estimates for the
        metering programme are based on the number of meters required to meter all main pipes
        that feed the demand areas as well as metering both ends of all primary distribution pipes.
        Experience shows that meter replacement programmes must be regularly repeated as
        meters have a limited lifespan. Therefore the cost of meter replacements are repeated at
        the long term also. The cost of metering new and expanded areas is covered in the
        estimates made for those expansions.
        Pressure Reducing Valves
        Currently the network into Epworth has no pressure reducing valves. An allowance has
        been made for one valve which may be required initially of Ventersberg is rehabilitated and
        it remains necessary to moderate network pressures in Epworth to ensure even distribution
        of supply to all areas supplied by the tanks.
        Replacement of Service Connections
        Experience has shown that service connections of galvanised iron as are provided in
        Epworth are subject to corrosion and heavy loss rates. It is therefore intended to replace all
        GI connections with HDPE connections prior to or parallel to network rehabilitation.
        In Epworth it is not intended to greatly expand the quantity of supply available until the long
        term investment round. Therefore some form of demand management is required for the
        interim period. Allowance has therefore been made to fit flow limiting devices to the house
        connections as they are renewed.
        Service connection replacements should have a 60 year life and will not be repeated in the

       In Epworth, the limited number of metered properties has had almost no water for nearly a
       decade. Water meters cannot continue to operate reliably under such conditions. Therefore
       the investment plan includes a short term intervention to replace all service water meters at
       the same time as the connections are replaced. The fitting of flow limiting devices should
       allow for network pressures to be maintained even if supply volumes remain low for some
       time and this will prevent the need to drain and refill the network with the consequent
       damage to meters caused by venting air.
       Commercial Operation Improvement Measures
       For each town a package of commercial and operational improvement measures shall be
       implemented. This shall revolve around giving the network managers the tools they need to
       effectively identify and manage non-revenue water.

7.3.3   C â Extension of Water Supply Services

7.3.3.1 New Transmission and Storage Facilities
        In the short term there will be no investment in expanding the transmission and storage
        facilities in Epworth. Current supply levels are near zero so the short term will focus on the
        rehabilitation measures described above.
        Long term significant investments will be required in the Epworth water transmission
        facilities. This will involve construction of a water booster pump station at the Ventersberg
        Reservoirs, dedicated to the supply of Epworth and the extensions and augmentations to
        the distribution network as follows:

       A review of the modelling of the Harare water network has shown that increasing the
       quantity of storage at Epworth would be inefficient with such large available storage volume
       at nearby Ventersberg. Therefore there are no plans to install any bulk storage within
       Epworth but rather to rely on a boosted pumped supply from Ventersberg as described
       above.

7.3.3.2 Extension of Distribution Network to new areas
       The predicted population growth in Epworth will require extensions to the distribution
       system. Some of this work will likely be funded through private developers but in Epworth
       there are also considerable areas which are already settled and where the council will be
       responsible for the provision of services.
       As it is only intended to significantly increase supply volumes with the installation of new
       distribution capacity in the long term there will be a period during which demand would
       greatly outstrip supply and therefore new connections made in this period should be
       provided with flow limiting devices as recommended for existing connections. The
       estimated no of new connections and associated water network lengths required are as
       shown below.

        remote monitoring and control of the reservoirs.

7.3.4   D â Sewerage Service Improvements

7.3.4.1 Rehabilitation of Sewerage Reticulation System
        The sewerage system covering most areas that have water supply has never been
        commissioned. As soon as water supply is restored there are many properties that do have
        water connections and demand for a sewage system will grow.
        Discussions with the local board indicate that sewer pipes are likely to be in good condition
        whilst manholes will require sand removal and in about 50% of cases, reconstruction of the
        cover slab.
        Short Term Investment Measures
        In the short term, the inability to treat any sewage generated in Epworth means that the
        area must remian on on site sanitation systems.
        Long Term Investment Measures
        In the long term improvement to the sewer network in Epworth will commence with the
        activation of the sewer network that was previously installed but never commissioned. This
        will involve limited replacements, extensive grit removal and refurbishment of nearly all
        manholes on this system.

        Long term expansion of waterborne sanitation in Epworth will depend on the water supply
        network first being reinforced such that there is sufficient supply for all households with
        waterborne sanitation. Only once this occurs can the sewer network be expanded.

7.3.5   E â Extension of Sewerage Services

7.3.5.1 Extension of Sewer Reticulation System to new areas
        Currently Epworth is not connected to any treatment works. Connection to the Harare
        South Trunk Sewer will only occur in the long term. Once the HSTS is available the
        following sewers will be installed to meet the long term requirements for Epworth.

        With the commissioning of the Epworth outfall sewer there will be a considerable increase
        in the number of properties connected to sewer. As most areas are already developed the
        responsibility for extending the tertiary sewer network to connect more customers will likely

       connect customers to the sewer network. All of these works are long trem as they cannot
       commence until HSTS is in place. Initially this consists mainly of connecting customers to
       the existing network but eventually a significant length of new network will be required.

7.4.1   A - Water Demand Management/NRW Reduction Programme

7.4.1.1 Rehabilitation of the Distribution Network
        No detailed investigations were done as condition assessments of the water network in
        Norton. Rather data gathered for other towns under previous studies was combined with
        information from local officials to build up a picture of the state of the networks and the cost
        estimates from replacement of network piping are therefore based on a simple percentage
        of the total length of the network in place.
        Pipes
        Nortonâs water network is reportedly in generally good condition although specific areas of
        concern were located with the DN300 AC lines in Ward 1 and Ward 9 and the galvanised
        iron pipe network in parts of Ward 5 which is known to be severely scaled. Estimates have
        allowed for the replacement of up to 5% of the existing network pipes.
        Network Valves
        Discussions with the operators of the network in Norton have indicated that valving in the
        town should be improved to facilitate proper demand management. A programme of valve
        replacement is already underway utilising GIZ financing so this investment measure may
        already be in hand. The comprehensive valve replacement programme in the short term will
        not need to be repeated as a long term measure.
        Bulk Metering
        There are no operational bulk or block meters in Norton. Therefore estimates for the
        metering programme are based on the number of meters required to meter all main pipes
        that feed the demand areas as well as metering both ends of all primary distribution pipes.
        Experience shows that meter replacement programmes must be regularly repeated as
        meters have a limited lifespan. Therefore the cost of meter replacements is repeated at the
        long term also. A programme of metering is already underway utilising GIZ financing so this
        investment measure may already be in hand. The cost of metering new and expanded
        areas is covered in the estimates made for those expansions.
        Pressure Reducing Valves
        With improvement of network pressures in Norton an allowance has been made in the
        investment plans for the installation of pressure reducing valves. These will most likely be
        used, at least initially, in the pressure sustaining role in order to maintain pressures in the
        mains whilst demands exceed supply in the distribution system.
        Replacement of Service Connections
        Experience has shown that service connections of galvanised iron as are provided in Ruwa
        are subject to corrosion and heavy loss rates. It is therefore intended to replace all GI
        connections with HDPE connections prior to or parallel to network rehabilitation.
        Given the age of most of the networks in Norton all historical connections are likely in GI
        and should be replaced. Visual inspection of newly constructed areas show that in most
        area the service connections have been vandalised by owners in an attempt to get more
        flow from the system.

       In Norton, despite increases in supply of water to the town, major expansions to the
       distribution network are not expected until the long term project and therefore flow limiting
       devices should be fitted to the service connections.
       Replacement of Service Water Meters
       As a foundation to an effective non-revenue water programme in Ruwa it is intended to
       replace all service water meters. Those in service now are generally 10 to 20 years old and
       at least 50% are known to be faulty.

7.4.1.2 Commercial Operation Improvement Measures
       For each town a package of commercial and operational improvement measures shall be
       implemented. This shall revolve around giving the network managers the tools they need to
       effectively identify and manage non-revenue water.

7.4.2   B â Water Supply Service Improvements
        In Norton, work is required to improve the valving at the tanks if additional supplied of water
        are to be coming from Morton Jaffray. The selected valve replacement will allow the tanks
        to operate without manual intervention. GIZ have already installed bulk meters on the
        existing line from Morton Jaffray.

7.4.3   C â Extension of Water Supply Services

7.4.3.1 New Water Production Facilities
        Norton will rely on increased production at the Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Plant to
        meet its short and long term water production requirements.

7.4.3.2 New Transmission and Storage Facilities
        Short Term Investment Measures
        In the short term the minimal intervention necessary is to supply sufficient water to the town
        for its population minimal requirements and to reverse the trend of chronic low pressure in
        the network. The 8MLD that can be supplied by the existing line cannot sustain Norton so
        this supply must be expanded. At the same time regardless of available supplies pressures
        will be very low unless certain minimum interventions are carried out. The following short
        term measures are therefore proposed.

       Water Storage

       management methods are still in place. The storage time will drop well below the
       recommended 24 hours during this period.
       Long Term Investment Measures
       The focus of the long term investment measures will be to supply adequate water to meet
       normal demands at reasonable network pressures in all areas of Norton and to supply the
       increasing demand of the areas of new development in Wards 2, 4 12, 13 and the Chegutu
       expansion area (planned expansion of the town into Chegutu District). The following
       investments will be necessary:

        As it is only intended to significantly increase supply volumes in the long term there will be
        a period during which demand would greatly outstrip supply and therefore new connections

7.4.4.3 Rehabilitation of Wastewater Treatment Plants
       The rehabilitation of the Norton SPS will require not only repairs to the existing works but
       the establishment of a new treated effluent pump station, rising main and a new wastewater
       disposal system through irrigation onto forest trees. The investments required are as
       follows:
       In the short term it is proposed that the Norton Old and New Sewage Treatment works be
       fully rehabilitated as these will remain integral to sewage treatment in Norton in the future.
       The rehabilitation measures shall include:
       Old Works
          â¢   Intake
                   o   Replace flow measurement devices
                   o   Provide grit drying slabs and skip from screenings

                   o   Mechanical rehabilitation and
                   o   replacement of corroded steelwork
          â¢   Holding ponds for treated wastewater awaiting pumping to disposal
                   o   Clear vegetation from embankments
                   o   Clear vegetation from pond and dredge sediment
                   o   Fill low areas of embankment where overflow occurs
          â¢   Drying beds for clarifier sludge.
                   o   Clean the drying beds
                   o   Replace sections of collapsed wall
                   o   Replace sludge carts
       In addition to the above, non-treatment components include:
          â¢   Pumps to the filters:
                   o   Replace 1 duty and 1 standby pump
                   o   Replace 2No. Sludge Pumps to the drying beds
                   o   Service all electrical equipment

       Wastewater Disposal Area
       Norton has an existing irrigation scheme on Greenacres farm. This is capable of manging
       the effluent produced by the two existing works. However the farm is not controlled by the

       municipality and the force main, owned by the farm, is in poor condition. The most
       economical solution would be to rehabilitate this existing system to support the existing
       WWTWS but because of the lack of control and reliability of this system it is proposed to
       provide Norton with a new wastewater disposal area. Whilst the investment plan has been
       prepared on the basis that a new disposal area will be required this decision should be
       revisited at feasibility study stage. The proposed new disposal area should be outside of
       the Manyame catchment where there is land available and a promising area has been
       located at the location of MH 66 on the mapping. This area is within the Chegutu expansion
       area but outside of the Townâs proposed Sewerage Boundary.
       At this location it is proposed that Norton shall establish 170Ha of forest plantation onto
       which its wastewater can be irrigated. The entire 170Ha shall be established as a short
       term measure as the effluent from the existing WWTW can be disposed of on 170Ha
       without the need for any storage pond to allow for lower application rates during the rainy
       season.
       In the long term the proposed new pond system in Norton will also discharge to this
       irrigation area but no additional land will be required as the ponds will provide significant
       rainy season storage.
       The works are summarised as follows. Note that in the long term certain minor rehabilitation
       measures will also be required to renew mechanical equipment at the works and its
       associated pump stations.

7.4.5   E â Extension of Sewerage Services

7.4.5.1 Extension of Sewer Reticulation System to new areas
        For Norton, it is not planned that any expansion to the existing sewerage reticulation
        system will be carried out in the short term. Therefore there are no proposed short term
        measures to expand the main sewage transmission.
        Long Term Investment Measures
        In the long term Nortonâs water shortages should be resolved and it is intended to remove
        flow limiting devices as significantly increased supply volumes become available with the
        construction of the two new DN600 supply lines into Norton as described above. At this
        stage it will be necessary to greatly expand the sewerage systems in Wards 6, 12 and in
        the new Chegutu Expansion area. The following lines are proposed.

       Considerable growth is expected in the short and long term in the number of properties
       connected to the sewer system and in the areas covered by Sewerage. In the short term
       the expansion of sewerage will be limited to areas where there is already connection to the
       existing Sewage Treatment Plant. Long term as the new sewage treatment capabilities are
       added the town will expand its sewerage boundary and numbers of new connections will
       increase significantly.

       Ward 6 WWTW
       As a long term measure it is proposed to construct an anaerobic pond at Ward 6 for the
       purpose of primary treatment of wastewater arising from Wards 12, 13 and 6. Peak and
       average inflow to this works are predicted at 9.5 and 3.8MLD respectively. The works to be
       constructed will consist:
           â¢    Inlet works with coarse and fine screens and grit screening as well as screening
                disposal
           â¢    Anaerobic pond with 2 streams in parallel of 3 days retention time. Each pond
                should therefore have volume around 6,000m3 .

       Facultative Ponds near Chegutu Expansion Area
       At the same time as the anaerobic ponds it is proposed to construct a facultative pond
       system at a location where the Chegutu Expansion area can gravitate to the ponds. This
       location is between the Chegutu Expansion and Ward 12. The ponds shall provide
       treatment for wastewater from the Chegutu Expansion area and secondary treatment for
       the wastewater from the Ward 6 Anaerobic Ponds. The works to be constructed will consist:
           â¢   Inlet works with coarse and fine screens and grit screening as well as screening
               disposal
           â¢   Anaerobic pond with 2 streams in parallel of 3 days retention time. Each pond
               should therefore have volume around 5,000m3 as anaerobic treatment is only
               required for wastewater from the Chegutu Expansion Area.
           â¢   Facultative pond for all wastewater (approximately 9MLD). The pond will require
               retention time of 20 days and approximate volume 180,000m3 . Typical dimensions
               would be 600 x 300m which could be subdivided into two parallel streams.

7.5.1   A - Water Demand Management/NRW Reduction Programme

7.5.1.1 Rehabilitation of the Distribution Network
        Network Pipes
        No detailed investigations were done as condition assessments of the water network in
        Ruwa. Rather data gathered for other towns under previous studies was combined with
        information from local officials to build up a picture of the state of the networks and the cost
        estimates from replacement of network piping are therefore based on a simple percentage
        of the total length of the network in place.
        Ruwa has a relatively new water network, mainly dating from the 1980s and 1990s.
        Discussions with the network managers indicate that generally the network is not
        problematic. Pressures have been low for many years and as supply is restored it is likely
        that rates of pipe failure will increase. Estimates therefore allow for replacement of up to 5%
        of the existing network pipes.
        Network Valves
        Discussions with the operators of the network in Ruwa have indicated that valving in the
        town should be improved to facilitate proper demand management. The comprehensive
        valve replacement programme in the short term will not need to be repeated as a long term
        measure.
        Bulk Metering
        There are no operational bulk or block meters in Ruwa. Therefore estimates for the
        metering programme are based on the number of meters required to meter all main pipes
        that feed the demand areas as well as metering both ends of all primary distribution pipes.
        Experience shows that meter replacement programmes must be regularly repeated as
        meters have a limited lifespan. Therefore the cost of meter replacements are repeated at
        the long term also. The cost of metering new and expanded areas is covered in the
        estimates made for those expansions.
        Pressure Reducing Valves
        Only one pressure reducing valve is expected to be required in Ruwa in the incoming
        supply to ZIRE from Donny Brook. In addition there are level control valves required at the
        two elevated tanks and the ground tanks
        Replacement of Service Connections
        Experience has shown that service connections of galvanised iron as are provided in Ruwa
        are subject to corrosion and heavy loss rates. It is therefore intended to replace all GI
        connections with HDPE connections prior to or parallel to network rehabilitation. These
        connections are estimated at around 20% of the total falling mainly in the older wards of
        Ruwa.
        In Ruwa there will be an augmentation of supply in the short term from the new Nora Dam
        water source and so it is not intended to install flow limiting devices on the service
        connections.

       As a foundation to an effective non-revenue water programme in Ruwa it is intended to
       replace all service water meters. Those in service now are generally 10 to 20 years old and
       at least 50% are known to be faulty.
       Rationalisation of Zoning
       With improved metering and valving there is a need in Ruwa to rationalise the Zoning of the
       town. In principal the Ruwa WTW will supply the northern areas of Ruwa, Glamis reservoir
       will serve areas to the between it and Ruwa river and Mutare Road Tanks and Booster
       Station will supply the southern parts of the town. ZIMRE will continue to be supplied from
       Harare and valves interconnecting ZIMRE's network with that of the rest of Ruwa should be
       closed when water supplies normalise.
       Modifications to this Zoning may be required as water respources become available from
       different sources.

7.5.1.2 Commercial Operation Improvement Measures
       For each town a package of commercial and operational improvement measures shall be
       implemented. This shall revolve around giving the network managers the tools they need to
       effectively identify and manage non-revenue water.

7.5.2   B â Water Supply Service Improvements
        The Ruwa intakes are new and will not need rehabilitation. Limited rehabilitation works
        have been identified for the existing water treatment facilities in the short and long term
        projects as follows:
        Short Term Investment Measures
        1. Strip down and apply internal and external corrosion protection to the steel 2.5MLD FC
           reactor unit.
        2. General servicing/ rehabilitation of both FC reactor units is required, including:
               a. Attend to seals which are allowing filter media to escape into supply
               b. Install strainers on discharge pipework to catch any filter media that does
                  escape the reactor.
               c. Service all valves
               d. Improve safety and handrailing on walkways and ladders
        3. Replace the existing chemical mixing and dosing facilities. As this is the only, very small
           power requirement of the plant, it is recommended that the current system be replaced
           with a solar powered dosing system. With a solar power source it will be possible to
           increase the automation of the chemical dosing system.
        4. Complete the 4000m3 circular clear water reservoir and all connecting pipework. The
           works currently operate at low flow rate, discharging directly into supply. The 4000m3
           clear water reservoir should be constructed to balance outflows and allow the plant to
           optimize production.

        5. Complete the construction of the sludge drying beds. The works are currently operating
           at low rate but when 17.5MLD of treatment capacity is on site the drying beds will be
           essential.
        Long Term Investment Measures
        Short term measures will take the capacity of the Norton WTW to 20MLD, matching the
        21MLD supply available through the raw water pipeline. Once the capacity of this supply is
        exhausted additional flows will come from the Kunzvi scheme. Kunzvi will deliver its treated
        water to Donny Brook reservoirs which already have a high capacity link to Ruwa. However
        the works will be maintained at 20MLD capacity even after commissioning of Kunzvi.
        Long term investment measures will be limited to repair and rehabilitation of mechanical
        plant, corrosion protection and servicing of the FC reactor units and the dosing equipment.

7.5.3   C â Extension of Water Supply Services

7.5.3.1 New Water Production Facilities
        Ruwa has recently completed a major Bulk Water Supply project from the Nora Dam.
        Investigations with ZINWA show that the dam has a high yield potential and should provide
        a reliable source of water to the town. The town currently only has 7.5MLD in available
        treatment capacity but the raw water supply is rated at up to 21MLD. To capitalise on the
        investment made in raw water it is proposed to expand the water treatment capacity by
        adding a 12.5 ML/d FC reactor to the existing water treatment facilities. The total water
        production capacity will be 20 ML/d

       Following from the investment made into supply of water it is necessary to strategically
       reinforce the distribution facilities in the town. This will include works on booster pump
       stations and pipework as follows:
       The additional water supply availability in Ruwa in the short term will require the
       construction or reconfiguration of the water booster stations. The purpose of the two
       proposed booster stations is to maintain reasonable network pressures at high flow rates in
       high areas which cannot be gravity fed from the tanks. One transfer pumping station is
       proposed to transfer water from Ruwa WTW to the Mutare Road tanks as a gravity feed of
       sufficient capacity would require an uneconomically large diameter pipe. Pumping proposed
       is as follows:

       The Ruwa Transmission system is to be reinforced in the short term to the extent
       necessary to properly distribute the water that will become available from the expanded
       WTW. This requires additional capacity on a north south axis through the town allowing
       higher feed rate from the Ruwa WTW to Mutare Tanks and from Mutare Tanks to the
       expansion areas in the south of Ruwa in Wards 5 and 7.

       Long Term Investment Measures
       As Ruwaâs water supply situation normalizes it will be necessary to reinforce the primary
       and secondary distribution system as tabulated below:

7.5.3.3 Storage Facilities
       In the short term the minimum work will be done on water storage which shall involve the
       replacement of the elevated tank at Mutare road with a similar sized storage on the same
       tower. The Council wish to decommission the existing tank because of extensive corrosion.
       As Ruwaâs water supply situation normalizes the available storage as proportion of daily
       supply will likely drop significantly below the recommended 24hour minimum. Therefore as
       a long term measure it will be necessary to augment storage within Ruwa.
       The layout of the town is such that the existing WTW is at approximately the highest point
       but also it is the closest high point in the town which can be easily connected to the Donny
       Brook Tanks which will supply treated water above and beyond the 17.5MLD that the Ruwa
       WTW will ultimately be capable of. It is therefore makes sense to construct the townâs main
       storage at this location. This new storage will be sized to provide a total of 24hours of
       storage in the system. Hence investment in storage will be as follows:
            â¢    Replacement of Mutate Road Elevated reservoir in the medium term (200 m3 )
            â¢    Ruwa WTW Clear Water Tanks Expansion in the long term (40,000 m3 )

7.5.3.4 Extension of Distribution Network to new areas
       The predicted population growth in Ruwa will require extensions to the distribution system.
       Most of this work will likely be funded through private developers.

7.5.3.5 New Bulk Water Management Facilities
        Ruwa has a complex arrangement of multiple supply sources and multiple reservoirs, some
        of which boost into supply. To work efficiently this system will require good control and
        automation of reservoir levels and booster pumping pressures.
        Variable speed pumping is recommended on all booster pump stations and should be
        controlled by network pressures with lower pressures set for off peak hours when system
        frictional losses are lower.
        A system will be required to monitor the status of all reservoirs and to control the feed
        pumps from the Ruwa WTW to the tanks

7.5.4   D - Sewerage Service Improvements

7.5.4.1 Rehabilitation of Sewerage Reticulation System
        Ruwa is a relatively new town and as such there are no significant problems reported with
        the sewer network. However, in the last decade water supplies have been short and flows
        therefore low and it is expected that a return to normal supply levels may show up areas

7.5.4.2 Rehabilitation of Sewage Pump Stations
       In Ruwa, the modifcations proposed to the sewerage system mean that the existing
       sewage pumps stations are to be decommissioned rather than rehabilitated. Certain
       decommissioning works are required in the short term and there will be no long term works
       on sewage pump stations.

7.5.4.3 Rehabilitation of Wastewater Treatment Plants
        Ruwa historically discharged sewage to the Adelaide ponds. These are located on land

7.5.5   E â Extension of Sewerage Services

7.5.5.1 Protection of Green Sykes Dam
        The catchment area of the Green Sykes dam contains areas currently proposed for housing
        development. Ruwa should revisit this planning and ensure that the whole catchment area
        of Green Sykes is protected against any development that may damage water quality in the
        dam. Zoning within the Green Sykes dam catchment should be limited to agricultural and
        agricultural small holding and housing developments should be prevented.

7.5.5.2 Extension of Sewer Reticulation System to new areas
        Considerable growth is expected in Ruwa in three separate areas to the North East and
        South of the Town. In addition it is a key part of the proposal for Ruwa that it will
        decommission all of its sewage pump stations and its ponds.

       In the long term it is proposed that Ruwa will construct an outfall sewer to the existing line
       between Donny Brook and Lyndhurst Farm joining to the Harare South Trunk Sewer. In the
       short term this final connectionw will not be available so an interim pond treatment system
       is required. These ponds will be located at the lowest area in the proposed expanded town
       of Ruwa and therefore, considerable investment is required in main sewers.
       The main sewer network for Ruwa has been modelled using the expected flows at the 2030
       time horizon to identify sewer lines which may need to be augmented or upgraded to
       accommodate the expansion of the town. It should be noted that the entire current network
       appears adequate for normal flows with the current population. The modelling has identified
       the following investments required within Ruwa.

7.5.6   New Ruwa Wastewater Treatment Plant
        The decommissioning of the Adelaide ponds will leave Ruwa with no Sewage Treatment
        system until the commissioning of the HSTS which is not expected in the short term.
        Therefore as a short term investment measure it will be necessary to construct a new
        WWTW for Ruwa. It is proposed that a pond/ irrigation system will be used and will be
        constructed at the Northern Part of Dagbreek farm. Ruwa have already commenced
        planning for a new WWTW although their proposed location is north of the river. In this
        proposal a location south of the river was selected so as not to interfere with land that could
        be used for housing development. Final decision on location can be made at feasibility
        study stage.

8.1    Legal and Policy Framework
       On a national level, the main legislation that regulates the access to water and the
       development and management thereof is provided for in the Water Act. This was
       overhauled to its current version referred to as the Water Act 1998, which replaces the
       Water Act 1976. It has been strengthened by the National Water Policy, 2013 of the
       Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management.
       In general terms, the 1976 Water Act prioritised water allocations to commercial farms and
       other enterprises with commercial interests through the issuing of indefinite water rights.
       This effectively favoured a representative population of about 1% and neglected the
       remaining population. The Water Act 1998 sought to rectify the allocation of the national
       water resource more equitably and recognises the notion that the access to water for
       primary use is a basic right. The Water Act 1998 (CAP 20:24) provides the following main
       features:
          â¢     Water rights have been replaced with water use permits. The permits are issued for
                a limited period and can only be renewed subject to water availability and evidence
                of efficient use. The previous Act provided water rights without limitation of time and
                issued on a first come, first serve basis and were part of the title deed;
          â¢     The priority principle (favouring commercial use) has been done away with.
          â¢     Water can no longer be privately owned.
          â¢     Water is to be viewed from the complete hydrological perspective, i.e. groundwater
                and surface water are treated as part of one hydrological system, i.e. recognising
                the presence of ground water as an equal resource, which was previously ignored.
          â¢     Stakeholder-driven institutions have been formed that will have more say on water
                allocation and general water management on a day-to-day basis.
          â¢     Greater consideration of the environment, with environmental water use now
                recognized as a legitimate user.
          â¢     More control over pollution, with the âpolluter paysâ principle being introduced.
       Relevant extracts from the Water Act 1998 (CAP 20:24) are provided in the following table.

                                              f) assist in data collection and participate in catchment planning;

       With the changes provided through the promulgation of aforementioned legislation and
       establishment of new authorities outlined above, the Water Act 1998 also constituted part of
       the water sector reform, which took place in parallel with land settlement reforms. The
       water sector reform process was also driven by international calls for more efficient and
       sustainable management embracing environmental, technical and financial aspects of
       sustainability. The support for Zimbabweâs water sector reform emanated from concerns of
       inadequate water availability coupled with unsatisfactory efficiency levels and
       inconsistencies between legislation and the requirements for water.
       Some explanations to the disappointing performance of the water sector, despite the
       revised legislation and newly formed organisational framework are provided in a joint report
       from the University of Zimbabwe and ZINWA1:
           â¢    Conflicting policies â the water reform was being launched at the same time as the
                land reform process. Although the objectives were similar in redistributing the
                resources to the same people in each reform, the land reform took place at a speed

                 that the water sector could not keep pace, loosing track of who is located where and
                 holds what permit.
           â¢     Weak institutional linkages; The Water Act assumes that water institutions created
                 under the Water Act are consulted before use of the natural resource, however
                 there is little evidence that this is done.
           â¢     Insufficient funding resulting from donor withdrawals at a time when the water sector
                 reform was being implemented. The CCâs were supposed to be implemented with
                 the assistance of donor funding, however, without the planned and necessary
                 financial backing the CCâs could not take off as intended. With the implementation of
                 the land reform and uncertainties regarding continuing occupancy, existing
                 occupiers ceased or reduced their payments for water permits and contributions to
                 the Water Fund set up as part of the Water Act 1998 and intended, with additional
                 contributions from the governmentâs budget, to develop the water sector as directed
                 by the minister. Unfortunately, new settlers did not necessarily abide by the
                 principles of âuser paysâ and âpolluter paysâ. Thus, the inflows into the Water Fund
                 were meagre and required investments into the water sector were not possible as
                 intended.
           â¢     Lack of capacity within key institutions including ZINWA, Ministry of Water and Rural
                 Development could not offer the necessary professional expertise since several key
                 positions were vacant. The much needed Water Fund would have gone a long way
                 to fill these posts. Apart from this, staff remunerations were low and unattractive for
                 staff working in these institutions.
           â¢     The lack of enforcing critical elements of the Water Act 1998 contributes to
                 inadequate inflow of funds to sustain ZINWA.
       The recently endorsed National Water Policy (2013) provides an opportunity for a renewed
       start of implementing the water sector reform. The document echoes the Water Act 1998 in
       many respects. This medium and long term investment plan recognises this policy and at
       the same time is considered to be an integral part of implementing the National Water
       Policy. Whilst all aspects, including technical considerations of the National Development
       Plan are detailed in Chapter 7, relevant legislative, institutional and organisational issues
       are extracted as shown in the following table.

           â¢    Council by-laws gazetted in the 1972 2 still form the basis of operations with respect
                to water supply and sewerage service provisions. Over time sections thereof have
                been amended, in particular the tariff for water supply and sewerage
                collection/treatment services through various statutory instruments readily available
                at the council 3. Less readily available are the original by-laws and it is obvious that
                little reference and in most cases little knowledge on their content is reflected by
                council personnel in their day-to-day operations. This is confirmed with the lack of
                litigations against defaulters and offenders of the by-laws and Epworth is no
                exception. General sensitisation and possible review of this fundamental legal
                framework needs to be looked into to encourage greater obedience to comply with
                the same.
           â¢    Public Finance Management Act (CAP 22:19) of 2009; as part thereof, the councils
                have been instructed by the Ministry of Finance to ring-fence the revenues and
                expenditures for water and sewerage service operations. In line with the National
                Water Policy it encourages the councils to isolate the daily operations in the form of
                a more autonomous organisation. However, realistically this step toward
                decentralisation of water and sewerage service operations has not and cannot take
                place presently as there is need to cross-fund and subsidise other council activities
                such as health, education, road maintenance and cleaning, etc. As long as the other
                mandatory services of the council are unable to operate sustainably, ring fencing is
                not possible. This opens the need to involve line ministries of the financially ailing
                services to provide subsidies or other funding as is understood to have been the
                case before the economic downturn.
           â¢    Labour Act (CAP 28:01); provides the basis of employment, remuneration, and
                termination as well as trade union matters, codes of conduct and disciplinary , As

          â¢   Directives; It is understood from the councils that the Minister for Local Government
              issued a directive not to disconnect any household connection supplying water to
              the premises on the basis that water is a human right. This in itself, but exacerbated
              by the currently depressed economic situation, has encouraged non-payment for
              outstanding debts. While the basis of the directive is understood and generally
              followed, it substantially infringes on the councilâs ability to operate sustainably,
              plunging it into a downward spiral of decreasing ability to effectively finance the
              water and sewerage service operations causing declining service delivery capacities,
              which in turn strengthen the consumerâs argument not to make payments.
              Following the general elections of August 2013 a directive was issued to write-off all
              accumulated debt accrued from water and sewerage charges relating to domestic
              use with effect from 01.09.2013.
       In summary, the council is bound to a variety of national and local legislations that are
       partially implemented due to either conflicts between some legal requirements, inability to
       comply and ignorance to their existence. The proper implementation of the existing legal
       framework, notwithstanding the need for some critical amendments to be carried out to
       support the basis for effective delivery of services, this should affect the institutional and
       organisational re-organisation of the councils with respect to water and sewerage services.

8.2    Institutional Framework
       The current organisational structure for water and sewerage services in Epworth, Norton
       Ruwa, Chitungwiza and Harare is integrated in the overall Municipal Councilâs structures,
       resulting in the operational involvement of several departments and sections, viz:
          â¢   Department of Engineering Services: technical matters relating to daily development,
              daily operation and maintenance/repair activities, drawing on specific sections:
                   o   Water section;
                   o   Sewerage section; and
                   o   Planning.
          â¢   Department of Financial Services: meter reading, billing, collection, customer care,
              budgeting, external payments (suppliers on cash terms and credit), internal
              payments (payroll), management and control of debt and credit, performed by:
                   o   Revenue section;
                   o   Expenditure section; and
                   o   Information Communication Technology (ICT) section;

Greater Harare Water and Sanitation Investment Plan                            Investment Plan Report
                                                                                           Chapter 08

          â¢   Department of Central Administration contributing with aspects of human resource,
              legal matters and general administration and security supported by various sections:
                   o   Administration;
                   o   Welfare;
                   o   Legal section; and
                   o   Human resources.
       This presents a complex and scattered organisational setup for the planning, operation and
       maintenance of water and sewerage facilities. Apart from the structure, the main
       shortcomings in relation to the specific operation of water and sewerage services were
       noted to be:
          â¢   Unclear job-titles and job descriptions;
          â¢   Work overlaps and in the existence of several vacancies, work gaps;
          â¢   Unclear and/or disregard for responsibilities, particularly at lower levels, leading to
              the necessity to micro-manage and directorâs and immediate subordinates over-
              burdened with responsibilities;
          â¢   Cumbersome reporting lines between sections and more so, between departments,
              officially requiring the involvement of heads of section and possibly heads of
              department on operational issues between officers on lower levels (e.g. revenue
              officers compiling monthly reports including production figures from the technical
              section [Engineerâs Department]);
          â¢   Prioritisation and decision making typically involves several departments, causing
              delay, particularly if these are not unanimous amongst the parties involved;
          â¢   Low literacy levels, notably prevalent at the supervisory level and below.
          â¢   Poor revenue collection which leads to poor performance of the utility. The little
              revenue that is collected is consumed by staffing costs leaving nothing for
              maintenance.
       Some of the resulting challenges reported were, lack of preventive maintenance, poor/no
       recapitalisation of assets including consumer water meters, delays in procurement leading
       to delays in repairs, uncertain availability of chemicals and other inputs, Poor standard of
       comprehensive reports from which well-founded management decisions can be made,
       delays in payment of payroll leading to poor work morale and declining work ethics.
       The Council operates a joint fiscal system for all its activities, which proved to be
       satisfactorily as long as deficit-making activities (e.g. health) were subsidised with regular
       and adequate subsidies. However, these grants are reported to have shrunk significantly
       and are not received regular any longer. This has resulted in a situation whereby any
       surpluses generated automatically cross-subsidise deficit operations and denying, amongst
       others the surplus-making activities to carry out preventive maintenance and recapitalise
       themselves. This has undermined the ability of otherwise surplus-making activities to
       operate sustainably. It is believed that this situation has led to a directive from the Ministry
       of Finance to ring fence all council activities. As much as the Council attempts to comply
       thereto, it is realistically unable, since the volume of subsidy has reduced while the
       activities still need to be performed as part of the Councilâs mandate. The implications were

        and still are that any surpluses generated are taken to deficit operations and the overall
        financial performance of the Council is reduced, which in turn exacerbates the challenges
        outlined in the foregoing. This fundamental issue needs to be addressed to comply with the
        directive as well as allowing the break even and surplus activities to remain financially
        buoyant. Harare City on the hand has a separate department, Harare Water that reports
        directly to the Town Clerk. Harare Waterâs revenue is not exactly ring fenced. Revenue
        collection is through the City Treasurer who issues combined bills for water, rates and
        refuse collection. There is an agreed percentage of the collected revenue that is passed to
        Harare Waterâs account.
        Having recognised the aforementioned general shortcomings there is need to address
        several main topics:
           1. Organisational structure â to streamline activities and create a leaner more
              efficient set up with regard to daily operations including decision making, reporting
              and responsibilities. In previous years, local authorities in Zimbabwe functioned
              well and provided good service in both water supply and sewerage using the same
              organisational structure that still exists today. Whereas there is need to streamline
              the scattered organisational structure to achieve higher levels of organisational
              efficiency, the existing structure can be made to function by empowering staff to do
              their work and motivating them.
           2. Separation of accounts to ring fence the funds received for water and sewerage
              operations;
           3. Job descriptions â to clearly specify reporting lines, responsibilities, functions and
              result based tasks. Once drawn up and approved by management, these need to be
              read and accepted to ensure they are followed;
           4. Training in specific fields directly relating to the tasks assigned, but excluding
              general educational and basic qualifications.

8.3     Organisational Capacity Assessment
        This section provides a brief overview of the existing capacity for provision of water supply
        and sanitation in Harare, Chitungwiza, Ruwa, Epworth and Norton. It describes staff
        numbers and skill levels and other relevant measures of capacity and competence to
        undertake the necessary tasks effectively.

8.3.1   Harare Water
        The City of Harare is mandated to supply water to approximately 2.5 million people,
        including residents of satellite towns of Chitungwiza, Norton, Ruwa, Epworth and other
        settlements on the periphery of the City. This mandate has been delegated to the technical
        department within the council known has Harare Water
        Harare Water is faced with various challenges that include water quantity, water quality and
        financial issues. Owing to lack of adequate investment in the water and sewerage
        infrastructure for the past 15 years, the infrastructure has been deteriorating and most of
        the equipment is now obsolete. The City is therefore experiencing perpetual water supply
        shortages due to the demand that has outstripped supply and frequent breakdowns in the
        aged infrastructure and power supply challenges.

       Harare Water is also experiencing challenges in the provision of wastewater disposal
       services to its residents due to the dilapidated sewerage and wastewater treatment
       infrastructure.
       The City of Harare is run by an elected council. The town clerk is the chief executive of the
       Council. Figure 8.1 shows the top structure of Harare City.

        Total Estimated Current Staffing (2014-2018)
        The staffing for the existing WSS department is summarised in the following Table 8.4. This
        shows that the total current establishment is 2,338 and that the majority of the staff (more
        than 60%) is in the technical sections (Production, Distribution, Workshops, Wastewater
        and Quality control) while the Commercial and Financial Section and the overall
        management and ICT make up the balance.

        Whereas, the current establishment look good in terms of numbers, the actual numbers of
        staff on the ground is 1497 (64% of the establishment). This explains why the services are
        poor, that there is not enough staff to cover as per the establishment.
        Considering that there were 190,761 connections in 2011, the current staffing level per
        1000 connections is around 7.8 while the staffing levels would have been 12.3 per 1000
        connections using established numbers. The work load on the current staff is heavier than
        the commonly used benchmark of 10/1000 connections. However, it should be borne in
        mind that certain functions would still be provided by the Council (e.g. HR, Audit and legal),
        which will raise the number of staff per 1000 connections further up.

8.3.2   Chitungwiza Municipality
        Overview
        Chitungwiza was formed in 1978 from three townships: Seke, Zengeza, and St Marys
        located about 30 km south of Harare. Due to its proximity to the capital, it is sometimes
        referred to as a dormitory town with residents commuting to and seeking employment in
        Harare,
        The Town is run by a council consisting of 25 Councillors including the executive Mayor.
        The Councillors are elected into office by a public ballot in the 25 wards of the city for a
        term of 4 years, who are the policy makers for that period. The executive board comprises
        of council managerial staff headed by the Town Clerk responsible for implementing council
        policies. The executive board is answerable to the Minister of Local Government.
        The main mandate of the council is to provide public services relating to basic and social
        services to the residents of the city within the boundaries of the municipality:

       It is worth noting that almost all positions are filled (99 %) with permanent employees and
       the council does not engage any casual workers.
       Apart from technical facilities (e.g. water treatment works, sewerage works, workshops)
       Chitungwiza Council offers its services to the public through five offices: Head office, Seke
       North, Seke South, St. Maryâs and Zengeza.
       The activities related to the management and operation of water and sewerage services is
       spread across several departments as shown in the table below.

Greater Harare Water and Sanitation Investment Plan                          Investment Plan Report

       From the organisation charts above it is evident that the functions related to water and
       sewerage services are spread across different departments and sections of the councilâs
       existing organisation structure.
       Institutional Assessment
       The Works Department headed by the Director of Works is responsible for a number of
       services. Part of these services is positioned under the Water distribution and sewerage
       collection and treatment works. The responsibilities for water distribution and sewerage
       treatment are with two Principal Engineers while the sewerage network is headed by a
       Superintendent.
       The water distribution section comprises of a supervisor for the reservoirs, a foreman and
       operators under this position. In addition a clerk is available to provide administrative
       support. This team is responsible for the general maintenance of the network and ensuring
       that the water is distributed to the customers.
       The official establishment of the sewerage network headed by the Superintendent
       comprises a foreman, a supervisor for specialised equipment and operators to carry out
       cleaning and repair of the sewerage network. However, the actual current position varies in
       that there is no Principal Engineer.
       The Principal Engineer for the sewage treatment works is supported by a supervisor for
       Zengeza treatment works, another supervisor for the BNR plant, an electrician, laboratory
       technician, a machinist (fitter) and operators, responsible for the operation and
       maintenance of the two sewage treatment works. In addition a clerk is available for general
       administration.
       This organisational setup, as also depicted in the official organisation charts provides for
       service delivery of water and sewerage services as evidenced with reports of past
       performance (prior to 2000). However in recent years limitations and challenges are
       experienced, some of which are partly attributable to the current organisational architecture
       subjected to a different economic environment for which it was originally not designed for.
       In view of the current dilapidated state of the infrastructure, in particular the clear water
       storage reservoirs the sewage pumping stations, and waste water treatment works the
       staffing levels still appear to be high despite recent efforts to reduce these.
       Although the support for and provision of services in relation to water and sewerage has
       been confronted with serious challenges, the importance of these sections should not be
       underestimated considering the public health implications if not provided in adequate
       quantity and quality and the potential revenues earned from the service. It should therefore
       be given a greater priority by the council.
       The operational units identified as relevant for the provision of water and sewerage services
       are:
          â¢   Storage and distribution / Reticulation,
          â¢   Waste water collection;

          â¢   Revenue Collection,
          â¢   Management.
       Water Storage and Distribution
       The potable water received by customers in Chitungwiza is produced by Harare Water,
       specifically by the Prince Edward water treatment works with augmentation from Morton
       Jaffray water works. Therefore, the main function of Chitungwiza Council is the storage and
       distribution of the water received. Since Harare Water is not supplying adequate volumes of
       water to Chitungwiza, it is a challenge for the council to fulfil its mandate of providing
       potable water to all its residents.
       Water storage and distribution is performed under an experienced Principal Engineer and
       assisted by a Supervisor for the reservoirs and two Foremen, one for Seke area and the
       other for Zengeza and St. Maryâs. Reporting to them are 60 operators; 55 for the network
       maintenance and the remaining 5 to operate the storage reservoirs.
       Furthermore, the team lacks much needed ultrasound equipment to detect and monitor
       leakages in the pumping main from the bulk meter at Prince Edward treatment works to the
       storage reservoirs north of Makoni Shopping Centre.
       The personnel engaged in the water distribution section directly impact on the delivery of
       water produced to the consumers and is primarily involved in the water management
       through pressure control, repair of breakdowns and reduction of water losses. Unfortunately
       it is largely underequipped with regard to equipment and tools to detect leaks and effect
       repairs. This detrimentally affects billing, unaccounted for water, the willingness to pay for
       this service by consumers and hence revenue collection.
       Sewage Collection and Treatment
       Sewage collection is divided into two drainage areas, namely, drainage area 1 from
       St. Maryâs, Manyame Park, Zengeza 1 and parts of Zengeza 5, which drains into 3 pumping
       stations for subsequent transmission to Zengeza sewage treatment works and drainage
       area 2 for: Seke, parts of Zengeza 2, Zengeza 5, Zengeza 3 and Zengeza 4, which drains
       by gravity, which gravitates directly to the same sewage treatment works.
       Although the official organisation charts provide for a Principal Engineer in charge of
       sewage treatment and a Superintendent responsible for the sewerage network, the former
       is currently held by a Superintendent and the position intended for a Superintendent is
       currently vacant. Thus, the sewage treatment is headed by a Superintendent, who also
       takes charge of the sewerage network.
       The currently consolidated functions of sewerage network and sewer treatment are
       supported by two sections.
       The first section, responsible for sewerage reticulation comprises 4 assistant foremen, and
       8 line supervisors and 64 operators. In addition this section has one supervisor for
       specialised equipment with an additional 8 operators.
       The second section, in charge of sewer treatment consists of one Superintendent with 10
       works attendants. In addition, this section has one electrician and one assistant for
       Electrical works. Furthermore the section has a Laboratory Technician and an Assistant. It
       also has a Fitter (Machinist) and an Assistant.
       This section is supported by 112 works operators.

       Maintenance
       This essentially refers to workshop personnel, equipment and materials. As stated above,
       both water and waste water workshops have no qualified Journeyman. Currently the
       workshop is largely underequipped and experiences challenges in the repair of flow meters
       and effect preventative maintenance to pumping plant and equipment as well as basic
       repairs to infrastructure such as valves and flow meters.
       Data Collection, Billing and Revenue Collection
       This core activity is performed by the Financial Department in collaboration with the
       Information Communication Technology (ICT) section that is headed by an ICT Manager
       supported by a system support administrator, 2 Technicians and one Data Clerk. The field
       work (mainly meter reading) and customer interface (receipting and receiving customer
       queries) is handled by 6 supervisors who coordinate a team of 50 to 60 meter readers
       provided by the Housing Department. In addition to the ICT staff, there are 8 Data Clerks
       who digitise the data into the billing system. Apart from this, there are 50 cashiers and their
       assistants located at the four satellite offices and the head office; Seke North, Seke South,
       St. Maryâs and Zengeza. The coordination of the cashiers is carried out by a revenue
       accountant who reports to an assistant revenue director, both at the head office. The
       revenue collection is further supported and assisted by a team of Principal Credit Controller
       and 8 Credit Controllers from the Chamber Secretaryâs Department.
       In view of the large number of non-functional consumer meters and the anticipated
       adoption of technologies to streamline meter reading and data entry, the current
       establishment responsible for billing is regarded as high.
       The billing for water and sewerage services is combined with others; fees, rents and levies
       through an all-encompassing billing and accounting software; Pastel-Sage Evolution run on
       an HP ProLiant G7 server, procured in 2011, connected to a combined wired and Wi-Fi
       LAN.

       are included; disconnection / reconnections, meter servicing and repairs of the tertiary
       distribution network (house connections) checking for unauthorised water consumptions.
       This will require closer cooperation with the Engineering Department that performs
       technical operation and maintenance activities as well as formalised multi-skilling.
       Further to the current monthly activity schedule, the potential benefits of the following
       amendments and additions should be investigated:
          â¢   Staggering of the monthly cycle in a way that each operational area starts its
              monthly activity schedule at a different time and that a particular activity (e.g. meter
              reading) can be performed throughout the month. This should not negate efforts to
              introduce the aforementioned multi-skilling of personnel;
          â¢   Introduce more efficient methods of data collection and transfer to a software best
              capable of storing and processing data related to water and sewerage services;
          â¢   Introduce system-generated reminders and demand notes (warnings) in response to
              non-payment, which could be issued through letter, e-mail, short message service
              (SMS) and/or other appropriate modes of communication to the consumer;
          â¢   Introduce alternative modes of payment, in particular the possibility of payment via
              the mobile phone as offered by at least one mobile phone provider in Zimbabwe;
          â¢   Introducing a comprehensive MIS that can provide relevant information not only to
              management but operators and consumers.
       With regard to the consolidation and streamlining of information, the current LAN, WAN and
       server provides a first step. However investments would be required to expand the WAN
       network to the anticipated new area, Nyatsime as well as providing a LAN in the offices of
       the new area. In addition some 31 personal computers (PC) and a backup server were
       reported as a necessary investment.
       Apart from the above listed opportunities, there are other possibilities of improving the
       effectiveness and efficiency of the billing and revenue collection systems, which are
       covered in more detail in Chapter 9.
       Management
       Heads of departments are responsible for defining and implementing policies and
       coordinating the available resources in the most effective and efficient way to achieve pre-
       set performance targets. Management is also responsible for the review and adjustment of
       performance targets in line with strategic development goals (e.g. metering) and realistic
       capacities.
       Under the current organisational arrangements the management for water and sewer4age
       services is split and performed by different Departments; Engineering Services, Finance
       Department, Housing and Chamber Secretary. The apparent challenges experienced with
       regard to performance (technical and financial), setting policies relevant and specific to
       water and sewerage operations, coordination of technical, financial and human resources
       and prioritisation of strategic goals may, at least in part, be attributed to the currently
       fragmented management responsible for water and sewerage services. Whilst the overall
       responsibility is vested under the Department of Engineering Services, this excludes
       important functions provided by the Finance Department and Housing.

        From discussions with various council management personnel, the Chitungwiza Council
        appears to be suffering from similar symptoms as experienced in other councils in
        Zimbabwe 5 . While the central government has continuously promoted a process of
        decentralisation of responsibility to the local authorities in the fields of health, education,
        water, sanitation, roads and other public and community services, it has not decentralised
        the financial resources including slowing down or cessation of financial grants that
        accompany these responsibilities. Furthermore, it was reported that the central government
        has in the past not settled large outstanding amounts for services rendered by the local
        authorities contributing to the poor financial performance of the councils. This in turn has
        led to declining service delivery over the years.
        Local authorities are not able to set charges without the approval of their line ministry and
        âzero-rate increasesâ (since 2009) have become a common feature. It is clear that the
        priority of the line ministry differs to the councilâs desire to set cost-covering tariffs. In view
        of the zero-rate increases, despite increases of input costs, the Council is confronted with
        increasing difficulties of operating a budget with minimal or no increases. Even with modest
        or negligible budget increases the council is increasingly unable to cover operational costs.
        This general situation has led to an increasing dependency on overdrafts and/or non-
        payment of creditors as well as non-payment of salaries. With this background it is not
        surprising that service delivery has fallen to its lowest levels in history for most services.
        With respect to water and sewerage service delivery, the impetus of change is anticipated
        to be provided by a change of the organisational structure.

8.3.3   Epworth Local Board
        Epworth is run by a council consisting of 8 Councillors including the executive Mayor. The
        Councillors are elected into office by a public ballot in the 7 wards of the Local Board for a
        term of 4 years, who are the policy makers and members of the Local Board council for that
        period. The executive board comprises of council managerial staff headed by the Town
        Clerk responsible for implementing council policies. The executive board is answerable to
        the Minister of Local Government. Epworth Local Board constitutes one parliamentary
        constituency seat.
        The councilâs main mandate is to provide public services relating to basic and social
        services to the residents of the city within the boundaries of the municipality:
             â¢    Water supply and sewerage services;
             â¢    Works and roads;

       Notwithstanding that not all personnel in the above table are fully deployed in water and
       sewerage activities 7, a total of 27 permanently employed staff or 6% out of the total 450
       permanent staff employed by the council are engaged in activities related to the provision of
       water and sewerage services. Only 1 employee was on temporary terms. Positions of three
       (3) chief officers are vacant. These are Director for Engineering Services, Town Planner
       and Environmental Health Officer. A breakdown of the personnel establishment by
       department is shown in the following table.
       By far the most important contributor to the overall personnel establishment for the water
       and sewerage service activities is the Engineering Department. As such, the water and
       sewerage services are mainly provided and driven by this department. Nonetheless, the
       other two involved departments also play important roles and thus there is need to
       streamline the scattered organisational structure to achieve higher levels of institutional
       efficiency and ring fencing, which is addressed in later
       Table 8-7 shows the number of staff employed by the council excluding the medical
       services section.




7      For example; the drivers are part of a pool that is used by all departments and other activities not related to water and/or
       sewerage, thus the total figures in the table are somewhat overstated.

8.3.4   Norton Town Council
        Norton is run by a town council consisting of Councillors, the Town Secretary, the internal
        auditor, the general administration and the private secretary. The main mandate of the
        council is to provide public services relating to basic and social services to the residents of
        the city within the boundaries of the municipality. The council has the following
        departments:
            â¢      Engineering department including: Water supply and sewerage services; Works and
                   roads
            â¢      Health:

            â¢      Housing;
        Norton does not have water treatment works but it has sewerage works and workshops. It
        receives its water mainly from Harare Water; however, the supply is not reliable. The
        organisation of the council is as shown in the Figures below.

       Notwithstanding that not all personnel in the above table are fully deployed in water and
       sewerage activities a total of 79 permanently employed staff out of the total 149 permanent
       staff employed by the council are engaged in activities related to the provision of water and
       sewerage services. There were no temporary staff members. Positions of eighteen (18)
       chief officers are vacant. These are the Deputy Director of Engineering, One (1) Credit

       plumbing assistants, two (2) sewer linesmen, three (3) sewer operators, one (1) guard and
       five (5) meter readers.
       By far the most important contributor to the overall personnel establishment for the water
       and sewerage service activities is the Engineering Department. As such, the water and
       sewerage services are mainly provided and driven by this department. Nonetheless, the
       other two involved departments also play important roles and thus there is need to

       sewerage services. There were no temporary staff members. Positions of twenty three (23)
       chief officers are vacant. These are the Deputy Director of Works, Six (6) Senior Plumbers,
       two (2) Sewer Cleaning Foremen, nine (9) assistant Plumbers, one (1) pond, three (3)
       general hands, and one (1) meter reader.
       The water and sewerage services are mainly provided and driven by the Engineering
       Department with support from the other departments. Thus there is need to streamline the
       scattered organisational structure to achieve higher levels of institutional efficiency and ring
       fencing, which is addressed in later.

8.4    Proposed Organisational Structure for Greater Harare Metropolitan Utility
       In this section the envisaged organisational structure for the greater Harare Water Utility is
       presented. The headquarters for the utility will be in Harare where also the largest
       consumers are. The satellite towns of Chitungwiza, Epworth, Norton and Ruwa will have
       semi-autonomous branches sharing the legal, audit and human capital services from the
       headquarters.
       The entity would be fully responsible for all aspects of an operation responsible for
       providing water and sewerage services, owned and guided by the various Councils. In
       comparison to the department in one council, this organisational arrangement takes over
       the responsibility of all investment budget aspects, human resource management, audit,
       legal matters and any other function that was provided under the Councilâs WSS
       department.
       The concept of a utility is to enhance the commercial principles of providing the services of
       water supply and sewerage collection and treatment, as would be appropriately contained
       in the new entityâs memorandum and articles of association, in a technically and financially
       sustainable manner. Essentially the existing sections would remain in place, though partly
       expanded as outlined in the following:
          â¢   Technical section comprising two main units:
                   o   Water supply unit responsible for the production, storage and distribution of
                       potable water; and
                   o   Sewerage unit in charge of collection and treatment of sewage; plus
                   o   Investment planning unit responsible for the early planning of both re-
                       investments (of e.g. consumer meters) and new expansion works to cope
                       with increasing demand for services and confirm and implement the
                       investment plans;
                   o   Electrical and mechanical unit providing expertise and support functions to
                       the water and sewerage units;
          â¢   Commercial, Financial and Administration section with two sub-sections for
              commercial and financial/administrative aspects respectively:
              Commercial sub-section in charge of revenue generating and collection activities
              through:
                   o   The data entry and billing unit responsible for the timely generation of water
                       and sewerage invoices; and

Greater Harare Water and Sanitation Investment Plan                            Investment Plan Report
                                                                                           Chapter 08

                   o   Collection unit that takes care of receipting, posting and banking of the
                       monies collected for water and sewerage only (i.e. not for other council
                       services);
                   o   Customer relations/service unit that is dedicated to address (record and
                       follow up) issues raised by consumers. This unit would be closely knit with
                       the new connections unit that also provides a customer interface;
              Financial and Administration sub-section in charge of planning and managing
              expenditures required for daily operations. This section harbours the following units:
                   o   The planning unit that coordinates the drawing up of strategic and business
                       plans as well as compiling of annual operational budgets. The unit would
                       furthermore take up the responsibility of financial reporting and liaison during
                       annual audits;
                   o   The more operational expenditure unit responsible for (approved) budget
                       procurements and expenditures including reimbursements to the council for
                       expenses incurred on behalf of the new department (including payroll). This
                       unit would also be in charge of bank reconciliations, credit control and cash
                       flow management.
                   o   Human resources unit to take over the function previously provided by the
                       Council. Itâs activities would include the recruitment and termination
                       processes, contractual and welfare issues as well as the preparation of the
                       payroll;
                   o   Administration unit to manage office supplies, utilities, insurance, security,
                       transport, communication and any corporate social responsibility matters
                       that may be deemed appropriate;
          â¢   Information and technology section providing cross cutting support for the planning,
              management and maintenance of hardware and software used by all main sections.
          â¢   In addition, legal and audit support functions would be provided by appropriately
              employed officers and if deemed necessary separate units may be defined as to be
              confirmed through a separate and detailed organisational development consultant.
       Thus, compared to the department, the WSS utility has no direct links to the Council and all
       functions necessary to provide the water supply and sewerage services are carried out by
       the new entity. Essentially the independent utility would take over the long-term financial
       issues (investment budget), administrative issues including human resource. Other
       functions the new entity will take over are in relation to audit and legal matters. The
       expanded staff for the utility is as follows:
           â¢ Harare Head Office and Harare Branch                        1,933
           â¢ Epworth Branch                                                 33
           â¢ Norton Branch                                                 157
           â¢ Ruwa Branch                                                    82
           â¢ Chitungwiza Branch                                            208
              TOTAL                                                      2,413
       The structure to support this establishment is presented in Appendix 8, Tables A8.2 to A8.6

9      INVESTMENT COST ESTIMATES

9.1    Introduction
       This chapter presents the methodology and approach used for estimating the investment
       costs. It also discusses the principles that guided the creation of the priority list for the
       investment measures.It ends with summaries of the estimated investments necessary to
       improve and extend water and sewerage services in the towns that constitute Greater
       Harare up to 2030.
       The investment measures have been grouped into six broad categories that reflect the
       problem areas andâvalue chainâ for providing water and sewerage services. The
       categorisation also considered the ease of creating project packages for implementation
       from the investment plan.

9.2    Unit Rates
       Unit rates for individual investment items are a very important building block towards
       estimating investment costs. Given the recent economic downturn in Zimbabwe coupled
       with uncertainty over the future economic outlook for the country, it is difficult to estimate
       accurate unit rates. The possibility of cost escalation due to perceived political risk has
       been taken into account.
       For major procured components such as pipes, pumps valves etc. quotations have been
       obtained from reputable manufacturerâs agents in the region and these have been
       developed into rates with the addition of transport, handling charges, profit and overhead
       charges and installation costs.
       For the major overall works component of pipe installations and civil works involving
       earthworks,the rates have generally been worked up from first principals using basic
       earthworks rates from the higher end of the market spread (Market is US$2.5 to US$6.5/m3
       and US$6.5 is used as the basis). To these basic earthworks, rates additions are made for
       shoring of excavations, haulage of materials etc.
       For investment items where works are similar to recent tenders under the UWSSRP Phase
       1 works currently under execution, the rates tendered by the contractors have been used.
       In all cases the median rate of contractorsâ bid prices has been used in estimate
       preparation and not the lowest.
       The rates from the contractors were also compared with similar works in the region. As
       expected, the rates used by the phase 1 contractors are higher than the regional averages,
       possibly because of perceived political risks, and logistical difficulties in clearing imports.
       In general, the unit rates cover the following:
           â¢   Supply of the items,
           â¢   Installation of the items,
           â¢   Ancillaries and related works to ensure the proper function of the items,
           â¢   15% to cover perceived political risk and other risks.
       The rates do not include VAT and other taxes. We assume that the council is a registered
       VAT agent of ZIMRA, as such it does not pay VAT (claims VAT on all goods purchased).

        We further assume that import duty will be waived on all materials and equipment that will
        be imported for the purpose of these investments.
        The rates calculated above are for the present year. We have assumed an inflation rate of
        2% for calculating future rates for the medium and long term.

9.3     Prioritization Principles

9.3.1   Introduction
        The water and sanitation facilities in Harare and its satellite towns have been neglected in
        the last couple of decades. Very little investment has gone into rehabilitation or extension of
        the systems, hence huge investments are required to restore the facilities to nominal
        capacity and extend services to meet demand necessitated by population and economic
        growth. Given the current political and economic situation in Zimbabwe, there may not be
        enough funds to finance all the identified investment measures in one project. Hence
        prioritization and evaluation to identify measures with the highest economic and social
        returns is an important element of this investment plan. The following subsections outline
        the principles guiding the prioritization. We have grouped the investment measures into
        three broad priority categories.
        The highest priority will be given to investment measures aimed at ensuring that the utility
        meets its basic public health and service obligations by getting the most out of the existing
        facilities. The second priority will be given to measures that will help the councils meet all
        environmental obligations, while the last priority will include measures that will respond to
        the increasing demand for services due to population and economic growth.

9.3.2   Priority 1 â Investments for Restoration of Existing Facilities
        The highest priority will be given to the measures outlined in the table below. From the list it
        should be noted that the âminimum Service measures âand âcoverage restoration measuresâ
        for water and the âcritical environmental interventionsâ for sewerage must be the immediate
        priority as providing safe drinking water to all and preventing sewage spills in residential
        areas are fundamental to public health.

        Table 9-1:     1 Priority Investment Measures

         Investment Measures          Remarks

         Water - Minimum Service      Provide water kiosks in all areas with no supply and where the cost
         Measures                     of restoring or establishing a reliable 24 hour supply in the short to
                                      medium term will be prohibitive.

         Water      -    Coverage     NRW identification through a programme of bulk meter, block
         Restoration Measures         valves and pressure reducing valve installation combined with
                                      proper zoning of the secondary and tertiary network so that an
                                      accurate water balance can be obtained.

                                      Night flow monitoring programmes should be initiated to identify
                                      areas where leaks are likely heaviest.

                                      pipelines. Metering will indicate where large leaks are occurring and
                                      a targeted replacement programme can then be initiated.

        Investment Measures        Remarks

                                   Repair and replacement programme on secondary distribution
                                   pipelines. Metering will indicate where large leaks are occurring and
                                   a targeted replacement programme can then be initiated.

                                   Burst management response programme. Create teams with
                                   necessary equipment to quickly respond to bursts and use public
                                   relations campaign to enrol the help of the public in reporting bursts.

        Water          Demand      General demand management through: (i) restoration of 100%
        Management Measures        domestic and commercial metering for water. In areas where 24
                                   hour supply cannot be achieved metering cannot go ahead; (ii)
                                   Renewal of house connections; (iii) installation of pressure reducing
                                   valves to lower tertiary distribution network pressures (iii) Public
                                   Education measures.

                                   It is normal for a small number of large customers to represent a
                                   large proportion of utility revenue. Meter replacement programmes
                                   should target this group as a priority.

                                   Demand management in areas not currently getting 24 hour supply.
                                   This would involve three stages: (i) Increasing network pressures
                                   but managing these to reasonable levels with pressure reducing
                                   valves; (ii) Installing flow limiters and meters (iii) Restoring 24 hour
                                   supply. The flow limiters will keep demand down allowing 24 hours
                                   of supply.

                                   Metering can only take place in areas where the network pressures
                                   never fall to zero. The use of flow limiting devices flattens the peaks
                                   in the daily demand curve, making it easier to keep network
                                   pressures positive at all times. Roll out of metering should be
                                   planned to occur on an area by area basis. An area may only be
                                   selected for metering once major leaks have been repaired, it has
                                   24 hour supply and the network has stabilised.



        Water â Database Clean-    Prior to embarking on a programme of individual customer metering
        up                         (and possibly parallel to it) a complete overhaul of customer
                                   database and billing database is required. This should be
                                   considered as a revenue raising measure by ensuring all customers
                                   are known, are being billed and will get a meter or have their
                                   existing meter replaced when the metering programme
                                   commences.

                                   The database cleanup exercise requires considerable field work in
                                   identifying the location of all consumer meters and known
                                   unmetered connections, geo-referencing these and linking the
                                   connection to the appropriate account number. A concurrent desk
                                   exercise should review the locations of meters on satellite
                                   photography with the actual layout of stands to identify any stand
                                   which does not have an associated meter/ connection in the

        Water â Tertiary Network      Once supplies have been restored and primary and secondary
        Rehabilitation                distribution system leaks have been reduced there will be more
                                      water arriving in the tertiary networks, sufficient to achieve 24 hour
                                      supply and 100% customer metering. Data from block and
                                      customer meters will then make it possible to determine which
                                      areas of the distribution system are leaking most. From this will
                                      follow (a) targeted replacement of tertiary distribution pipework (b)
                                      targeted replacement of house connections

        Water - Initial Coverage      These measures allows the utility to bring on extra customers and
        Expansion Measures            raise revenue. The additional water needed must be obtained from
                                      NRW savings.

                                      (a) Priority expansions into areas with least overhead in terms of
                                      additional distribution system. These are areas where the
                                      distribution system is already constructed but supplied with little or
                                      no water. These are new customers which can be added at minimal
                                      additional cost.

                                      (b) Secondary expansion into new service areas where tertiary
                                      infrastructure has been provided by developers and the Utility
                                      needs to add only secondary distribution. City planning authorities
                                      should only allow new developments n areas where these criteria
                                      are met. High cost/ low density areas should be targeted to
                                      maximize revenue increases and minimize additional load on the
                                      sewerage system.

        Sewage        -    Critical   Coverage Restoration. Rehabilitation of sewers in areas where
        Interventions             -   water supplies are revived. This is to prevent sewage spills in areas
        Environmental                 of population. To include: (i) de- choking of blocked sewers in areas
                                      where newly restored water supply causes blockages. Equipments
                                      should be provided for this; (ii) replacement of sections of sewer in
                                      areas of most infiltration and or collapses. This is a maintenance
                                      reduction and cost saving measure.

                                      Restoration of trunk sewers. This is to prevent sewage spills
                                      upstream of sewage works. (i) replacement of key sections of
                                      blocked sewer; (ii) capacity enhancements (new parallel lines) on
                                      low gradient sections of main and trunk sewer lines running at or
                                      above capacity

                                      Restoration of sewage pumping. (i) minimal emergency
                                      interventions in sewage pump stations to restore screening and
                                      pumping equipment;(ii) replacement of sections of sewage force
                                      main susceptible to bursts.

                                      Restoration of treatment capacity at existing sewage treatment

        Sewage â Initial coverage     This will expand sewage coverage into areas where developers or
        expansion measures            council have already installed sewer lines but these are not hooked
                                      up or commissioned. This should be done in areas where water
                                      supply has been reconnected or expanded and will allow council to
                                      start to bill for sewage also. This will therefore be a revenue raising
                                      method. Works will include; (a) short lengths of main sewer to
                                      connect the area to the trunk system (b) installation of missing
                                      sewage pump stations

        Water â Next Stage of         When networks are stabilized, customers metered and the billing
        Demand    Management          system is functional the utility can gain more information about
        Measures                      customers use of water. This will lead to new demand management
                                      initiatives including: (a) identification of wards with high
                                      consumption and running education programmes to encourage
                                      customers in those areas to reduce consumption; (b) improve the
                                      tariff band structure to discourage very high consumption; (c)
                                      identify industries with heavy consumption patterns and work with
                                      them to reduce their water demand through recycling, demand
                                      management etc.

       At the end of this set of interventions the city will be getting the most from its existing assets
       and customers and will have a strong revenue base through which it can start to address
       capital intensive expansion measures.
       As well as the capital investment measures described above there should be a similar
       priority given to public health in those areas that are outside of the Sewerage Boundary,
       where householders do not have a sewage connection. Provision of safe drinking water in
       these areas will alleviate the disease burden but other measures will also be required:




        Education measures â safe     Once the city has restored its supplies by way of public standpipes
        drinking water                or water kiosks the population should be educated to use these
                                      safe sources in preference to their (often closer) shallow wells.

        Education measures â safe     Further education programmes should teach people better practices
        sanitation                    in building and managing their pit latrines and pour flush systems to
                                      lower the likelihood of these spilling raw sewage onto properties.

        Disease monitoring            Initiate programmes working with local clinics tocontinuously map
                                      diseases linked to poor sanitation. This will allow for rapid and
                                      targeted intervention when a disease outbreak linked to poor
                                      sanitation occurs.

        Targeted construction    of   In some areas, generally those prone to flooding, the pit latrines
        toilet facilities             commonly constructed will not suffice and may lead to sewage
                                      spills. Generally these are also the communities least able to invest

                                       composing toilets parallel to education programmes in their use will
                                       be required and will need to be publicly funded.

        Itis assumed that the measures described above will not be a one off but all of these efforts
        will continue on an ongoing basis through good maintenance, meter replacement, ongoing
        database audits etc.

9.3.3   Priority 2 â Investments to meet all environmental obligations
        The second priority will be given to the measures aimed at enabling the councils to meet all
        their environmental obligations as outlined in the table below. It is assumed that the
        revenue improvements realised from the implementation of the first priority measures will
        enable the councils manage operate the sewage treatment and disposal facilities more
        sustainably.

         Sewage â Expand Sewage        It is likely that with the completion of all or most of the measures
         Treatment Capacity            above the Cityâs sewage treatment plants will be functional but
                                       heavily overloaded, with significant flows bypassing the secondary
                                       and tertiary treatment. At this stage the treatment capacity deficit
                                       can be addressed by expanding full treatment capacity to meet
                                       demand at all works in the Manyame Catchment and construction
                                       of the HSTS project

         Sewage â Eradicate sewer      These measures and the measures above, do not include any
         bottlenecks.                  significant increase in water supply into the city and therefore in
                                       general the capacity of the main and trunk sewers should not be
                                       challenged. However there may be certain small sections of main
                                       and trunk sewers which are acting as bottlenecks. This may
                                       include: (a) replacement of collapsed or partly collapsed lines, (b)
                                       replacement of mains with larger diameter or improving gradients to
                                       improve velocities in areas where silting occurs, (c) increasing line
                                       capacity in short sections of line with low fall by doubling up the line
                                       or by short length line replacements with larger diameters.

                                       coverage. This should be limited to areas within the sewerage
                                       boundary.

9.3.4   Priority 3 â Investments to Meet Increasing Needs of the City
        The third priority measures are those aimed at expanding capacity and extending service
        infrastructure to cater for increased demand fuelled by population and economic growth.
        These measures are outlined in the table below.

         Investment Measures          Remarks

         Water â Supply Increases     Bring on new sources of supply to meet the expansion of the city
                                      after all available water savings from demand management and
                                      NRW reduction have been used up:i.e (a) implementation of the
                                      Kunzvi project (b) primary distribution system restructuring and
                                      enlargements to cater for increased water from Kunzvi

         Sewage     â      Maintain   As new water supply sources come on line the capacity of WWTWs
         Environmental Standards      will be challenged. New treatment streams and BNR modules will
                                      need to be added on an ongoing basis.

         Water â Supply        Area   The secondary water supply network will be expanded into new
         Coverage Increases           areas, not currently provided with water supply. This will allow new
                                      areas to be released for development.

         Sewage â Serviced Area       New trunk sewers to areas of new water supply coverage. These
         Coverage Increases           areas will only be within the City sewage boundary

         Water â Improved Storage     The city has well over 24 hours of storage capacity at present.
                                      Many cities operate effectively with significantly less than this but it
                                      is a desirable figure. With the increases in supply availability the
                                      storage tie will decrease and in many satellite areas increased
                                      coverage may reduce local storage time to just a few hours. Thus a
                                      major storage increase will be required to create a minimum of 24
                                      hours storage throughout the system.

9.4     Investment Cost Estimates
        The detailed cost estimates for all the investment components are presented in the
        Appendix. The investment plan has been structured according to the prioritization principles
        outlined above. 1st and 2nd priority measures have been put under the medium term project
        (2017/18), while 3rd priority measures could be implemented under the long term project
        (2026/27). We assume that more refined project packaging will be done at the feasibility
        study level once a decision has been taken to implement.

9.4.1   Harare
        For Harare the total required investment between now and 2030 is US$1,759 million split
        US$664 million in short term investment measures focused mainly on rehabilitation of
        existing infrastructure and US$1,095 million in longer term investments in expansion.
        In the short term the majority of the expenditure is on repair and rehabilitation to existing
        water networks.
        In the long term the Kunzvi scheme and the Harare South Trunk Sewer and its associated
        new treatment facilities dominate the cost estimates.
        Of the âexpansionâ measures there is an approximately 60:40 split between expansion in
        tertiary water and sewer networks, traditionally carried out by private developers and
        primary and secondary infrastructure provided by the utility.

9.4.2   Chitungwiza
        For Chitungwiza the total required investment between now and 2030 is US$162 million
        split US$72 million in short term investment measures focused mainly on rehabilitation of
        existing infrastructure and US$90 million in longer term investments in expansion.
        The majority of the expenditure is on repair and rehabilitation to existing water networks.
        Significant ânewâ works are limited to the distribution system as much of the investment
        required in expanded water and sewage treatment is undertaken by Harare as the first
        phase of the Harare South Trunk Sewer will cater for Chitungwiza's needs.
        The total programme represents an investment of $1,850 per connection with the repair,
        rehabilitation and environmental intervention (Priorities 1 and 2) measures costing $1,200
        per existing connection whilst expansions will cost approximately US$2,800 per connection
        added.
        The investments are summarised in the tables on the following pages.

9.4.3   Epworth
        For Epworth the total required investment between now and 2030 is US$64 million split
        US$16 million in short term investment measures focused mainly on rehabilitation of
        existing infrastructure and US$47 million in longer term investments in expansion.
        The majority of the expenditure is on projects to meet environmental commitments which
        includes for commissioning the Epworth sewer network and connecting it to the Harare
        South Trunk Sewer. Significant ânewâ works are limited to the distribution system as much
        of the investment required in expanded water and sewerage treatment is undertaken by
        Harare.
        The total programme represents an investment of $2,000 per connection with the repair,
        rehabilitation and environmental intervention (Priorities 1 and 2) measures costing $1,000
        per existing connection whilst expansions will cost approximately US$3,100 per connection
        added.
        The investments are summarised in the tables on the following pages.

9.4.4   Norton
        For Norton the total required investment between now and 2030 is US$100 million split
        US$42 million in short term investment measures focused mainly on rehabilitation of
        existing infrastructure and US$57 million in longer term investments in expansion.
        The majority of the expenditure is required in priority 3 projects to expand water and
        sewerage coverage to new areas. There is also significant investment required in sanitation
        as the town requires a rehabilitation of its existing sewage works, a new disposal system
        and a new future sewage treatment works. Costs in Norton are also generally higher than in
        other towns because the new developments are spread out and require significant
        investment in primary and secondary water and sewerage systems.
        The total programme represents an investment of $3,600 per connection with the repair,
        rehabilitation and environmental intervention (Priorities 1 and 2) measures costing $3,700
        per existing connection whilst expansions will cost approximately US$3,600 per connection
        added.
        The investments are summarised in the tables on the following pages.

9.4.5   Ruwa
        For Ruwa the total required investment between now and 2030 is US$100 million split
        US$42 million in short term investment measures focused mainly on rehabilitation of
        existing infrastructure and US$57 million in longer term investments in expansion.
        The majority of the expenditure is required in priority 3 projects to expand water and
        sewerage coverage to new areas. However, unlike many of the other towns considerable
        areas of these expansions are already in place and therefore the investment is required
        sooner than in other cases. There is also significant investment required in sanitation to
        provide a new sewage treatment works in the short term and in order to link the town to the
        Harare South Trunk Sewer in the long term.
        The total programme represents an investment of $3,600 per connection with the repair,
        rehabilitation and environmental intervention (Priorities 1 and 2) measures costing $3,700
        per existing connection whilst expansions will cost approximately US$3,600 per connection
        added. The high cost of the new WWTW drives up the cost per existing customer of the
        priority 1 and 2 measures.
        The investments are summarised in the tables on the following pages.

9.4.6   Greater Harare
        For Greater Harare the total required investment between now and 2030 is US$2,225
        million split US$863 million in short term investment measures focused mainly on
        rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and meeting environmental standards and US$1,363
        million in longer term investments in expansion.
        In the short term the majority of the expenditure is on repair and rehabilitation to existing
        water networks. The only significant ânewâ works in the short term is the first phase of the
        Kunzvi Scheme and.
        In the long term the Kunzvi scheme and the Harare South Trunk Sewer and associated
        treatment works dominate the cost estimates.
        Of the âexpansionâ measures there is an approximately 60:40 split between expansion in
        tertiary water and sewer networks, traditionally carried out by private developers and
        primary and secondary infrastructure provided by the utility.
        The cost per connection implications for each town and greater Harare as a whole are
        presented below. Total investment between now and 2030 is $2,900 for Greater Harare
        and ranges between a high of $3,600 and a low of $1,850 in the individual towns. Towns
        which have their bulk water and sewage treatment needs met by Harare (Epworth, and
        Chitungwiza) require significantly lower investment than those that meet more of their own
        needs. Ruwa and Norton's higher initial costs reflect the need for the towns to make
        significant investment in sewage treatment and disposal, this cost being distributed in the
        table amongst the existing connections and not the expansions.

10     IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPT

10.1   Introduction
       This chapter outlines the implementation road map for the investment plan. The road map
       makes several assumptions regarding modes of implementation, sources of funds and the
       imminent institutional reforms espoused in the National Water Policy.

10.2   Key Assumptions
       In developing this implementation road map, we have made the following key assumptions:
          â¢   Some form of concessionary finance will be available for the implementation of the
              initial projects in the medium term;
          â¢   The institutional arrangements for water and sanitation services in the Greater
              Harare area will evolve towards an autonomous utility service provider as
              recommended in the National Water Policy;
          â¢   The water utility will be viable enough to attract financing for the investment
              requirements in the long term (2020 to 2030);
          â¢   Electromechanical equipment and devices such as water meters shall be replaced
              periodically given their relatively short economic life. We assumed that bulk and
              domestic water meters shall be replaced every Seven (7) years. Pump sets and
              other electromechanical equipment shall be replaced after Fifteen (15) years;

10.3   Proposed Sequencing of Investment Measures
       The sequencing of investment measures should be as illustrated in the figure below.

                  Stabilise the                Incease water
                                                                            Expand facilities to
              situation and get the         production to cover
                                                                            cater for inreased
              most of the existing          deficit after reducing
                                                                           demand for services
                     facilities,                     NRW
       â¢reduce NRW                    â¢increase water                â¢extend reticulation
       â¢rehabilitate water             production                     network to new
        production and                â¢expand wastewater              development areas
        treatment facilities           treatment facilities          â¢expand water
       â¢rehabilitate sewage                                           production facilities
        collection and treatment
        facilities

       The first wave of investments should focus on institutional reforms, reduction of NRW and
       rehabilitation of existing water and sewerage infrastructure. The second wave of
       investments will focus on increasing water production to bridge the demand gap after
       reducing NRW to economically feasible levels. The third wave of investments should
       expand facilities to cater for increased demand due to population and economic growth.
       Given the proposed sequencing framework above, the investment measures can be
       grouped into three main project clusters as follows:
          â¢   The medium term investment projects (mainly rehabilitation measures);
          â¢   The Kunzvi project Phase I (to increase water production);

                                                                                            Chapter 10

          â¢   The long term projects (expansion of water production and wastewater treatment
              facilities).
       The following section outlines the timing of the envisaged implementation activities up to
       20130.

10.4   Implementation Road Map
       The investment plan is expected to be finalised in the second quarter of 2014 after a
       comprehensive consultative process with all relevant stakeholders. It is assumed that the
       acceptance of the investment plan report will signify ratification and intent to implement the
       investment plan. We assume that the internal consultations and initial discussions around
       financing arrangements will take place in the second quarter of 2014. The second half of
       2014 has been set aside for the project appraisal process and finalisation of financing
       agreements.
       Besides the above mentioned activities, it is imperative that the proposed institutional
       reforms are set in motion to ensure that, by the time investments in infrastructure are
       completed in 2018, an appropriate institutional arrangement that ring-fences revenue from
       water supply and sewerage assets, is in place. Going by the pronouncements in the
       National Water Policy, we believe that there is sufficient political will to transform the water
       sector and that the necessary reforms will start in time to safeguard the proposed
       investments.
       Actual planning (feasibility study) and design work for the medium term projects is expected
       to start in the first quarter of 2015 so that the designs and tender documents can be
       completed by the fourth quarter of 2015. The entire 2016 has been set aside for the
       process of procuring construction services. The actual implementation of the projects is
       envisaged to start in the first quarter of 2017. Construction will continue for two years until
       the end of 2018. Thereafter, the traditional liability period will kick in for another year until
       the end of 2019. The facilities will be completely handed over to presumably well
       streamlined âwater utilityâ for operation by end of 2019.
       The Kunzvi phase I project is expected to start with a review of the studies and final
       designs done in 1998. This scheme will involve construction of a new dam, which may be
       under the jurisdiction of ZINWA. Hence the necessary inter-institutional talks and
       preparations must start well in advance. Actual construction is expected start in 2019 for
       three years until 2022.
       It is assumed that the new water utility will have adequate human resource and financial
       capacity to continue with the implementation of the periodic investment measures such as
       replacement of aging water meters. This assumption hinges on a further assumption that
       the water tariffs will have been revised to reflect the true cost of service provision and that
       the institutional reforms will have been completed. Extension of the water and sewerage
       reticulation system to new development areas will be financed and implemented by private
       developers.
       The long term projects are slated for implementation in the years 2026 and 20207. The
       studies, planning and design should start two years earlier to provide adequate time for the
       sometimes lengthy process of procuring contractors. It should also be noted that the
       construction of the Kunzvi phase II is envisaged to be part of the long term projects.

11     FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

11.1   Objective and Output of the Financial Analysis
       The main objective of the financial analysis contained in this chapter is to provide a
       measure of the entityâs financial sustainability. The output of the financial analysis is a utility
       based financial model, providing forecasts of income statements, annual and cumulative
       cash flows and (simplified) balance sheet over the project evaluation period that include the
       effects of an investment plan scenario. The financial analysis provides a means of judging
       the entityâs financial viability under the various investment plan scenarios considered.

11.2   Approach and Methodology
       In line with the objectives and outputs outlined in the previous section, the general
       approach of the financial analysis is to firstly identify and quantify all relevant
       cost/expenditures and revenues over the project horizon, i.e. to 2030, and capture these
       vide a commonly used spreadsheet application (Excel). The second step of the analysis
       allocates the relevant annual data to a simplified income statement, which is subsequently
       used as the first line item for a consolidated annual cash flow statement followed by a
       simplified balance sheet linked to the investment asset source sheet and aforementioned
       financial analyses. A schematic overview of the general approach is shown in figure 11.1.

       received for water and sewerage from the council' other financial obligations (related to
       roads, health, education, etc.).
       In fulfilment of the first step, the costs and revenues identified and quantified in the financial
       model are listed in the following:
       Costs
       Operating Costs broken down into:
            â¢    Fixed Costs comprising:
                      o     Personnel costs including allowances, bonuses, statutory payments derived
                            from an elementary breakdown of staffing numbers by grade, salary scales
                            to arrive at the net payroll on top of which allowances, pension and bonuses
                            (including other gratuities) are added as a proportion of salaries. An item
                            referred as allocation to WSS adjusts the gross payroll to take into account
                            the existence of vacancies and recharges for staff deployed not only
                            exclusively for water/sewerage but also in other departments of the council;
                      o     Transport costs are derived from the number of units, distinguishing
                            between vehicles, motorcycles and heavy vehicles/machinery, average
                            distance travelled annually and average consumption costs (litres/ 100 km);
                      o     Other administrative costs including insurance, office stationary, utilities and
                            maintenance, professional and legal fees (e.g. audit) based on a percentage
                            of calculated personnel costs,
                      o     Maintenance and repair of existing assets and planned investment assets
                            based on a percentage of their current value;
            â¢    Variable Costs
                 The following are calculated on the basis of a unit cost linked to raw water
                 abstraction or volumes of water produced, whichever applicable.
                      o     Raw water abstraction charges payable to the Zimbabwe National Water
                            Authority (ZINWA) for the abstraction of raw water representing a natural
                            resource;
                      o     Chemicals for both treatment (aluminium sulphate and lime) and disinfection
                            (chlorine) purposes;
                      o     Power used primarily for pumping raw and/or clear water and sewage1;
            â¢    Capital and Financial Costs for the various investment loans identified, namely the
                 existing Exim Bank loan (CMEC) and the anticipated loan for the investment plans
                 subject to this report.
                      o     Repayment of principal loan as a constant amount over the period of the
                            loan reducing the balance annually;
                      o     Capital charges 2, which for the purpose of this financial analysis is equal to
                            the interest on the reducing balance of the loan, applying an assumed rate
                            of interest.




1      The overall power required to pump sewage in relation to that for water is considered negligible overall.
2      Capital Charge: the cost of capital (opportunity cost of capital) times the amount of invested capital.

           â¢   Sales and collections for volumes of water supplied in bulk. This is applicable to
               Harare Water under the current organisational setup, which would become obsolete
               once the satellite towns to which bulk water is supplied become part of the entity.
           â¢   Income (sales) and cash collections for water sold to the entities direct customers
               with water and sewer connections, referred to as retail sales and collections. For
               purposes of this project the value of sales and collections for the provision of
               services in relation to sewerage is combined with water sales through the
               application of a combined and single water and sewerage tariff.
       While the relationship between the production of water and water sales is determined by
       the billing efficiency (inverse of Non-Revenue Water) and the tariff, the relationship and
       ultimately the value of the cash collections is determined by the collection efficiency.
       Although this determines the significant portion of the receivables collected, the model also
       includes the collection of a small portion of old debt (after 3 years) to quantify the efforts
       and effects of anticipated debt collection to improve overall collections.
       Having identified and quantified the aforementioned cost and revenue streams these are
       used to forecast three financial analyses over the projectâs evaluation period. Firstly, an
       income statement to ascertain the gross margin and accounting profit of the water and
       sewerage specific enterprise; secondly, an annual cash flow statement to assess the
       financial sustainability and determine the cash liquidity both in terms of net annual cash
       surpluses/(deficits) and cumulative cash position; and thirdly a simplified balance sheet to
       estimate the entities position of assets and liability. The outline methodology applied to
       arrive at these three financial reports is presented in the following set of tables.

       The rationale behind this analysis approach is to assess the financial sustainability in terms
       of the entity responsible for the provision of water and sewerage services, net of any other
       current financial transactions related to other activities provided under the current council
       set up.
       The above analysis is carried out for each of the entities considered in this project, namely,
       Harare, Epworth, Norton, Ruwa, Chitungwiza and finally Greater Harare, whereby the first
       five entities are in the form as found currently and the latter representing a clustered form
       of all previously mentioned organisations. For each of these entities three scenarios are
       considered separately (spate model file for each):
          â¢   Scenario 1: for investment priority 1 + 2 + 3;
          â¢   Scenario 2: for investment priority 1 + 2; and
          â¢   Scenario 3: for investment priority 3 only.
       As mentioned above, the financial model makes use of the commonly used spreadsheet
       application, MS Excel, encompassing all input and output tables as summarised below:

       detail on calculation methods are provided in Annex 11 to this chapter, which furthermore
       presents detailed input data and results (outputs) for each entity and scenario considered.
       As part of the overall approach the financial model was input and calibrated for Harare at
       first, aligning the key input parameters with information reported by the entity for recent

       Water and Sewerage Service sector).

       years and where available for the base year 4 . The calibration exercise also included
       modelling of the outputs in line with reported data and realistic values anticipated by the
       entity. Once this was achieved, the model including the key parameters were used to
       model the other entities. The purpose of maintaining the same input parameters is to
       provide a basis for comparing the financial analysis outputs, not only for the various entities
       but also for the various scenarios considered.
       In line with the foregoing, the methodology adopted to ascertain the effect of clustering was
       to firstly determine a realistic common basis of key parameters applied to all entities
       including the clustered option. Thereafter, the different results, particularly in relation to
       profitability was used to determine the relative preference. This obviously implies that the
       absolute outcome of the financial model of the entities (apart from Harare) may not
       necessarily be realistic, but serve to fulfil the main purpose of determining the comparative
       outcome.

11.3   Basic Parameters and Assumptions
       To enable the financial analysis to be carried out, a set of basic parameters and
       assumptions needed to be defined and applied as outlined in the following table.

                                                entities uncreditworthiness costs are assumed to be equal to
                                                expenditures. Subsequently, the value of creditors is assumed to be
                                                nil, hence expenditure = costs.

       Further to the values and milestones presented in the foregoing, the following elaborates
       on the critical and key variables that determine the outcome of the modelâs results most.

11.3.1 Water Demand for Retail and Bulk Supply
       The water demand versus supply levels of bulk water supply is obviously a current issue as
       production levels do not cover gross demand (including NRW) for Harare leading to
       shortfalls in the desired level of water required by the satellite towns. While water demand
       levels for Harare and the satellite areas are based on average annual demands, the
       current and future supply of bulk water is arrived at through an iterative process that seeks
       to reflect the current position and improve the situation as rapidly as possible without
       depriving the supply of water through a regressive trend for Harare. Despite a forecast
       erratic and partly reducing average demand (due to current high NRW levels) an excessive
       increase of bulk water supply will cause greater supply deficits in Harare which are unlikely
       as Harare, as in the past, has prioritised the supply of water to its residence before
       satisfying the demand for bulk water supply to the satellite areas. Thus, the volume of
       water supplied in bulk as a proportion of calculated demand for the same increases from
       an estimate of 50 % at present (2013), increasing gradually at a rate of 5 % annually until
       100 % by 2023. Although this may appear to be considered to be slow, it should be borne
       in mind that there is likely to be a treatment deficit until 2017. The figure below illustrates
       the position described above.
       This clearly shows that the gross demand (including NRW) is higher than the production
       capacity in the first five years and that there is likely to be a shortfall in the supply of water
       for either and/or bulk supply, which is addressed by the allocation/proportion of bulk water
       supplied.
       Apart from affecting the demand satisfaction, this key decision/allocation affects the
       proportion of water sold at the bulk rate and the other proportion sold at the higher retail
       rate, though subjected to currently high water losses.

11.3.2 Non-Revenue Water
       As outlined in Table 11-5 above the current NRW for Harare is around 60 %, while NRW
       attributable to physical losses as used in the water demand forecasts is assumed to be
       40 %. The financial model takes into account both physical and commercial losses and
       hence the starting point is 60 % for 2013 with gradual improvements to the agreed
       milestones of 30 % by 2020 and 20 % by 2030. The NRW forecasts for the periods
       between the base year and aforementioned milestones is calculated on the basis of a
       linear interpolation.

11.3.3 Bulk Tariff
       Harare Water assumes a major role with regard to the supply of potable water for most
       residents in Harare and the satellite towns of Chitungwiza, Epworth, Norton and to a lesser
       extent Ruwa. Except for Chitungwiza, that operates its own sewerage treatment works, the
       other areas rely on Harare Water for the treatment of sewerage too. As most satellite areas
       do not have an alternative, this dependence on Harare can be regarded as a one-sided
       relationship in which Harare, being in charge of water production and sewerage treatment
       not only determines the level of service(s) provided but also sets the bulk tariff. On the
       other hand, Harare relies on the prompt payment of the satellite areas to settle costs
       incurred in the production of water and sewerage treatment services to be settled. This
       redefines the relationship in a more balanced way and supports the need to determine an
       affordable and cost covering bulk tariff.
       The financial model calculates the average unit bulk water cost taking into consideration:
           â¢       Abstraction fees payable to ZINWA;
           â¢       5 % production losses;
           â¢       Unit power costs based on the calculated average pumping volumes and dynamic
                   head as well as pump efficiency and of course the cost of power (per KWh);
           â¢       Unit chemical costs calculated on the basis of expected dosing levels for
                   flocculation, pH correction and disinfection for surface water treatment;
           â¢       40 % of financial costs;

Greater Harare Water and Sanitation Investment Plan                           Investment Plan Report
                                                                                          Chapter 11

           â¢   40 % of fixed costs and
           â¢   40 % of maintenance costs.
       Other than production losses, no other efficiency losses (NRW or collection) were included
       in the calculation for bulk water production.
       As presented for each year in Appendix 11, the average bulk water tariff for the project
       period is USD 0.31, ranging from USD 0.25 in 2014to 0.34 by 2030. Based on the current
       billing and upward trend of bulk water costs as derived from the unit cost calculations and
       in addition recognising the occurrence of malfunctioning bulk meters and/or losses from the
       transmission mains, a constant bulk rate of USD 0.40 is applied in the model throughout,
       which is equal to the current rate charged. This rate is applied as both a cost (for the
       satellite areas and a unit of revenue (for Harare). Since the main concern for the satellite
       towns lie in the provision of bulk water rather than the tariff, which offers a potential to
       realise a gross margin after applying current retail charges there was insufficient reason to
       reduce the bulk rate.

11.3.4 Retail Tariff
       The current charges for water and sewerage are made up of a combination of unit
       (variable) and fixed charges. Whereas water tariffs are generally charged by the unit of
       water sold (unless not metered or estimated), the sewerage service charges are based on
       the type of dwelling, size and/or number of sewerage facilities (toilets, etc.) and essentially
       represents a fixed charge. Although it is recommended that the tariff levels and structure is
       reviewed as part of a detailed tariff study to be carried out as one part of the reforms this
       project uses a combined simple average effective tariff derived from the total revenue
       received divided by the volume of water sold.
       The combined tariff in the base year was assumed to be USD 1.45 based on the revenues
       and volumes billed reported in the current and recent years. While these are regarded as
       excessively high in relation to average tariffs in the region, the tariff levels are reduced as
       assumed improvements in the reduction of water losses are realised, in part as a result of
       the meter replacements and other NRW reduction activities (pipe rehabilitation) included as
       part of the medium term measures included in this investment plan.
       The assumed combined tariff for retail water sales is expected to reduce from USD 1.45/m3
       in 2013 to 1.15/m3 by 2020 and further to 0.90/m3 by 2030. The overall combined tariff,
       (including water billed in bulk) is USD 1.20/m3 which is expected to drop to 0.96/m3 by
       2020 and again down to USD 0.76/m3 by 2030.

       Figure 11-3:        Average Tariff and Unit Costs

11.3.5 Collection Efficiency
       The collection efficiencies calculated for the base year for the various entities was
       generally low:
           â¢    Harare: 41 %
           â¢    Epworth: 64 %
           â¢    Norton: 67 %
           â¢    Ruwa: 60 %
           â¢    Chitungwiza: 60 %.
       With the anticipated reforms and associated drive to improve operational efficiencies the
       milestone for 2020 was set at 95 % which is expected to remain unchanged until 2030. For
       Harare, with the lowest current collection efficiency, this improvement rate may appear
       ambitious. However judging reports for previous years (2010: 73 %, 2011: 59 %, 2012:
       56 %) the result for the base year appears to be an outlier and therefore it should be
       possible for Harare Water to achieve much improved collection efficiencies in 2014
       (assumed to be 50 %) through to 2017 to increase by 10 % annually.

11.3.6 Maintenance Costs
       As explained in Appendix 11 and outlined in Table 11-5 above, the calculation of
       maintenance costs is based on the value of existing and future investment values>
       However, due to the significant numbers and sizes of existing facilities and hence high
       value as well as the anticipated investment costs, the forecast ideal maintenance costs are
       high. From reports and experience as well as confirmations during field visits, the actual
       expenditure on maintenance and repair is considerably lower than it should be. Thus, the
       model adopts a gradual increase from 10 % of the calculated ideal maintenance cost to a
       maximum of 50 % (by 2021). This represents a gradual increase of maintenance costs
       from USD 2.3 million in 2013 to USD 13.8 million in 2021. By 2030 the forecast
       maintenance costs for Harare are estimated to be USD 19.4 million for the year.

11.3.7 Particular Adjustments for Greater Harare
       To best model the situation of a clustered entity, the key parameters were based on Harare
       and adjusted to reflect the weigted average position. Thus, the NRW was adjusted to 55 %
       in 2013 and the collection efficiency to 45 % for the base year. By 2020 these efficiency
       levels are assumed to reach the same milestones as assumed for Harare on its own.
       Furhtermore, the clustering is deemed to benefit from economies of scale and thus the
       proportion o other administrative costs was adjusted downward from 20 % to 15 %.

11.4   Current Financial Situation
       The following sections briefly summarise the financial position based on the latest available
       data reported by the respective councils and local boards for 2012. While this information
       provides an indication of the financial performance, it is not complete or in some cases
       reliable. Nonetheless, it provides a guide to calibrate the base year of the financial model
       for the individual entities.

11.4.1 Harare Water
       As a starting point for the financial assessment of water and sewerage activities relating to
       Harare (i.e. Harare Water) as well as a foundation for the calibration of the financial model
       the income statement was obtained for the latest available financial year from Harare
       Water, 2012 as presented in the following table.

       The financial model was calibrated to reflect a similar financial result for 2013, which was
       further supported with additional information received recently for part of the base year.

11.4.2 Chitungwiza Municipality
       The most recent available financial information from Chitungwiza was for 2012. This was
       summarised in the form of a consolidated income statement as shown in the following table
       and used to assimilate the base year of the financial model to reflect much the same
       position.

       The small, but nonetheless positive financial result shown in Table 11-8 above is attributed
       to the low expenditure on bulk water, based on the low levels of water received on the one
       hand and the fixed charges levied to its customers on the other. Furthermore, the
       noticeably low levels of expenditure reported for staff contributes towards achieving a
       surplus reported. The financial model adopts a technically more sustainable situation, with
       increasing volumes of water received and higher staffing levels with associated higher
       levels of remuneration. As a result the calculated income statement for 2013 is assumed to
       record a deficit.

        Total Expenditure                                                             1,045,637

       While the financial model adopts a similar position for 2013, it is assumed that the surplus
       has reduced with the adoption of a technically slightly more viable situation of increased
       water volumes and staffing.

11.4.5 Ruwa Local Board
       For the financial year 2012 Ruwa reported a deficit on its water and sewerage operations
       as summarised in Table 11-10 below.

       The major expenditure items are staff, power and bulk water costs, which are not covered
       by current incomes from water and sewerage services.

11.5   Overall Assessment of the Current Financial Situation
       Despite two entities (Epworth and Norton) reporting a surplus on their water and sewerage
       activities for 2012, the overall result for all five entities is less positive. This is mainly
       attributed to the councils and local boards inability to maintain their facilities, leave alone
       provide for replacement and recapitalisation as evidenced in the noticeably low levels
       reported for maintenance in the financial overviews provided in the foregoing. Whereas this
       may explain high levels of NRW it is important to recognise other challenges and
       shortcomings observed in one or more of the entities:
          â¢   The operation of a merged and consolidated financial system for all operations
              carried out by the councils and local boards, whereby billing and receipting of water
              and sewerage is combined with land rents and other services. It is therefore
              obvious that expenditure for all council and local board operations are provided

                  from single source and prioritised on grounds not necessarily related to technical
                  requirements or revenues from water and sewerage. This phenomenon has been
                  seen in other parts of the country and is believed to be responsible for the lack of
                  re-investments and maintenance;
            â¢     Due to generally dilapidated facilities production levels and service delivery is
                  low/poor, detrimentally affecting collection efficiencies;
            â¢     Unpredictable and low revenue collections affect payments increasing creditor
                  balances (if goods and services sold on credit) and delaying salaries which in turn
                  have negative effects on the reliability of suppliers and working morale of the
                  councilâs and local boards staff;
       Essentially, a situation prevails whereby a downward spiral is created in which service
       delivery is reduced affecting lower revenues which in turn reduce the already low level re-
       investment and maintenance of the facilities resulting in lower service delivery. It is clear
       that a turnaround in both the technical and financial performance is unlikely to be achieved
       without investments into the basic facilities responsible for the supply of potable water and
       sewerage collection and treatment services that form part of the entities mandate.

11.6   Funding Source
       Having recognised the need to invest into the rehabilitation and expansion of water and
       sewerage facilities the financial model absorbs the following financing scenario that is
       either already implemented or anticipated based on discussions with the potential donors
       (World Bank and ZimFund/AfDB). As presented in the following table for scenario 1 in
       which all three priorities are implemented 50 % of the required funding would be provided
       as a grant while the other 50 % would be a loan repayable in 20 years at an interest rate of
       5 % p.a. This funding is applied to the main investments excluding meter replacements and
       pipeline extensions, which are assumed to be financed directly by the utility (Harare Water)
       and passed onto private developers opening up new areas with housing for which water
       and sewerage services are essential.

11.7   Areas of Investment Impact
       Apart from the detailed presentations of the investment plans with their associated
       technical impacts detailed in the previous chapters, the planned capital investments should
       aim to maximise their positive impact on the following key areas in order to turn around and
       support a financially sustainable entity:
          â¢   Increase water supply to cover the demand for water and sewerage services,
              thereby increasing the revenue base;
          â¢   Reduce NRW in line with the milestones; 30 % or lower by 2020 and 20 % or lower
              by 2030 to reduce the marginal cost of water;
          â¢   Increase cash collection efficiencies to 95 % or better by 2020 and maintain this
              minimum thereby improving the cash flow and liquidity enhancing the financial
              viability;
          â¢   Ensure that maintenance and repair is carried out including meter replacements to
              enhance the longevity of the existing and newly invested assets;
          â¢   Revise and implement a cost covering tariff and review its structure to reduce the
              fixed elements;
       Apart from these main variables that underpin the level of financial sustainability the
       following associated improvements are also expected to be implemented as part of the
       overall organisational and operational reforms required:
          â¢   Improve on data collection and record keeping of both technical and financial nature
              including e.g. bulk meters to enable water balances and the like to assess critical
              performance indicators and enable management decisions;
          â¢   Introduce routine recapitalisation in the form of meter replacements to reduce high
              NRW levels;
          â¢   Conduct a full consumer survey to establish the consumer details including
              consumer category;
          â¢   Ensure timely and accurate billing;
          â¢   Develop and implement a strict disconnection policy that will improve collection
              efficiencies;
          â¢   Settle financial obligations on time (possible with an improved cash flow position) to
              improve staff motivation and productivity as well as shorten delivery times of
              consumables (e.g. chemicals) and materials (e.g. spare parts) thereby ensuring the
              quality of water and reducing/avoiding the downtime of facilities required in the
              production of water and/or the collection or treatment of sewerage.
          â¢   Ring fence both receivables and payables related to water and sewerage;
          â¢   Assess current staff capacities and provide relevant training and/or staff
              replacements.
          â¢   Apply multi-skilling and other measure of improving staff productivity allowing the
              unit personnel costs (per 1000 connections) to reduce and conversely to enhance
              the collection rate per staff.
       These associated activities and measures should be an integral part of achieving the key
       goals. They are indirectly assumed forming an intangible part of the financial model.

11.8   Financial Projections and Evaluation Results

11.8.1 Income Statement
       An overview of the main line items of the individual income statements forecast and
       produced for each entity is presented in the following table. This table shows mixed results
       for the different entities.
       HARARE
       Apart from 2014 the income statement for Harare is generally positive, with surplus annual
       gross margins of up USD 54.1 million in 2015, which positively influence a similarly surplus
       adjusted income statement that shows a peak in 2019 of around USD 32.2 million. The
       deficit forecast for 2014 is attributed to a combination of lower retail tariffs, high NRW levels
       and low collection efficiency. The consistently improving levels of revenue and cash
       efficiencies (i.e. billing and collection efficiency) as well as the generally increasing demand
       for water provides sufficient income to offset the opposite effects of falling tariffs and
       increasing costs. This implies that the income generating aspects are anticipated to grow
       faster than the factors pushing costs upward. The fluctuations in the income statement
       after around 2017 are mainly due to the effects of the various investment costs,
       The overall trend and composition of the income statement for Harare is illustrated in
       Figure 11-4 above for the period up to 2023.

       CHITUNGWIZA
       Desptie some Interim surplus results for Chitungwiza, the income statement is
       overwhelmingly negative. Despite this, a noticeable improvement is forecast from around
       2018 when the effects of the planned investments are felt. After this point, notably in 2020
       both the basic and adjusted income statements turn positive with a surplus of USD 1.7
       million and USD 0.5 millionj respectively. Although the subsequent years are forecast with
       an adjusted income statement deficit, this is significantly improved in comparison ot the
       period before the project. While the income statement could be truned positive from the
       point of the project implementation, this would imply an increase in the tariff, which is not
       justifiable and not implemented in the model as the projected tariff is kept the same for all
       entities to provide a level ground for comparison.
       EPWORTH
       Throughout the evaluation period Epworth is forecast to return deficit income statements
       despite the application of the same high tariffs used for the other areas. Nonetheless, an
       improved position is perceived after the implementation of the investments, namely in 2020
       and again around the end of the project horizon in 2029
       NORTON
       Again, this area displays the same trends and similar absolute retunns as sescribed for
       Chitungwiza implying that the relatively high tariffs are inadequate to cover the bulk plus
       administrative costs. The entity appears to fall just short of adequate volumes of water that
       would allow some economies of scale to be realised.
       RUWA
       Further to the underlying patterns observed for the other areas, Ruwa ia anticipated to
       break into a positive gross margin from 2019 onward. However the adjusted income
       statement is forecast to only briefly recover in a window of three years from 2019 to 2021
       caused by the effects of the first major investment phase. A second brief recovery of the
       adjusted income statement is forecast for 2025 only reflecting the impact of he next
       investment phase.
       While Ruwa appears to perform better than Chitungwiza, Epworth and Norton, it is
       inadequately self-sustainable in the short and medium term from an income statement
       point of view. As with the aforementioned satellite towns Ruwa would require a subsidy if it
       were to continue operating independently (with some additional supply of water from
       Harare).
       GREATER HARARE
       The main difference of the financial model for the clustered entity is that it replaces the bulk
       sales otherwise sold to the satellite towns with retail sales made directly to its customers in
       all areas. Although this involves a greater volume sold at a higher (retail) tariff, it is subject
       to the weighted average water losses estimated at 55 %. Nonetheless, the total calculated
       income is higher than for Harare Water alone. On the other hand the combined costs are
       also higher. As these more or less balance out, the gross margin is not significantly
       different to that anticipated for Harare Water. While the gross margin is forecast to be
       surplus throughout the entire evaluation period, the adjusted income statement is expected
       to start with a surplus in the base year and dip into a one-year deficit in 2014 in much the
       same way as displayed by the other areas, reflecting the still poor efficiency performance
       and at the same time implementing a tariff reduction combined with additional costs. This

11.8.2 Cash Flow Statement
       The bottom line of the cash flow statements are summarised for all entities in the table
       overleaf, whowing both the annual net cash flow (at the end of each respective year) and
       the accumulated cash flows.
       HARARE
       After 2014 the forecast net cash flow projections are expected to be in surplus, growing
       consistently until 2017 when the Exim Bank loan sets in thereby reducing the net cash flow
       to a deficit position by 2018. Despite the repayment of the Exim Bank loan upto 2022 a
       brief recovery of the net cash flow is realised between 2019 and 2020 (both years included).
       From 2023 the net cash flow is forecast to be positive upto 2026 when the anticipated
       repayment of the loan for the project under this investment plan commences. By the end of
       the project horizon the net cash flow is projected to improve into a surplus position.
       Thus, the otherwise consistently growing cashflow is interrupted and reduced, in part to a
       negative net cash flow mainly due to the financial implications of the variouis investments.
       The cumulative cash flow is positive overall from 2016 onward. Hoever, the forecast bank
       balance reduces during the years when the aforementioned effects of the various
       investments set in. In this respect reduced accumulative cash flows are expected in the
       years 2021 to 2023 and again in 2027 to 2028. The first dip is illustrated in the figure below
       that shows the cash flow positon upto and including 2023.
       The initial deficit anticipated in the early ears from 2013 to 2015 are attributable to the
       generally low efficiency levels, i.e. NRW and collection efficiency which are anticipated to
       improve, rhough gradually over time.
       CHITUNGWIZA
       The net cash flow for Chitungwiza is positive in only one year (2014) over the project
       horizon. The initial cash flow in the base year is also negative, mainly due to poor efficiency
       levels which improve and turn the net cash flow into a positive position in 2014. From 2015
       the repayment of the first phase of the loan for the project under this investment plan

       reverts the net cash flow back into a deficit which is not recovered over the project period
       as additional financial costs burden the entities financial position. Similarly the cumulative
       cash flow for Chitungwiza is in deficit, growing consistently in a more or less linear fashion.

       EPWORTH
       The net and cumulative cash flow expected for 2013 is negative, reflecting the situation of
       low sales due to inadequate and unreliable bulk water supplies from which equally
       inadequate revenues can be obtained to cover the mainly fixed operating costs. Despite
       this, Epworth reported a nominal surplus for 2012 achieved in the same situation, whihch is
       explained through receipt of fixed charges and high recharges to other departments. In any
       case, the potential of attaining a cash flow surplus from the operation of water and
       sewerage facilities in Epworth is also reflected in the financial model for the period from
       2014 to 2015 (inclusive), which is achieved by an assumed increase in the volumes of bulk
       water supplied to to the entity. However the net cash flow turns negative in 2016 upto and
       including 2018. Howver the previously accumulated cash flow is forecast to be adequate to
       bridge this period and thus the cumulative cash flow remains positive to the end of the
       project horizon, growing consistently as net cash remain surplus after 2018.
       NORTON
       Modelled projections of cash flows for Norton follow the same pattern and similar
       magnitude as outlined for Chitungwiza above. The underlying reasons are the same and
       overall the entity is unable to generate adequate surpluses despite the relatively high tariffs
       (same as those applied across all entities).
       RUWA
       Despite a financial recovery from 2014 to 2017 -based on increased volumes of bulk water
       supplies coupled with improved revenue and cash efficiencies- at least in terms of the
       cumulative cash flow, the negative cash flow from 2016 to 2018 and again from 2022 to the
       end of the project horizon attributed to the financial implications of the various investments
       result in a constantly negative cumulative cash flow from 2018 onward.
       Thus, overall, Ruwa is not expected to greatly improve its financial position and if operated
       as a separate entity is likely to return similar financial results as reported for 2012 by the
       logal board and as forecast in the model.
       GREATER HARARE
       In line with the results for the income statement of Greater Harare, the Cash Flow is
       similarly in deficit in the early yaers of the evaluation period (for 2013 and 2014 only) and
       thereafter generally turns and remains positive. Although the net cash flow briefly returns to
       a deficit from 2014 and 2018 at the onset of the repayments fo the planned investments,
       the accumulated cash flow is sufficiently positive to buffer this brief period of deficit.
       With this result the clusterâs liquidity would be adequate to take on the individual losses
       forecast for the satellite towns.

11.8.3 Annual Balance Sheet
       A simplified balance sheet to reflect the position for each year within the evaluation period
       was generated by the financial model as summarised for all entities in the table overleaf.
       In view of the planned investments the total assets have grown significantly over the
       project horizon. For Harare and Greater Harare this increase is 113 % and 131 %
       respectively. For the satellite towns this growth is:
          â¢   Chitungwiza: 137 %;
          â¢   Epworth: over 1000 % (ten-fold);
          â¢   Norton: 407 %

          â¢   Ruwa: 394 %%
       This ties in with the results of negative net current assets implying that the existing and
       furthermore the future cash position is not tenable to support such heavy investments in
       the satellite towns.

11.9   Financial Projections and Evaluation for Other Scenarios
       In addition to the base and ideal investment option as expressed under scenario 1
       (investment priority 1 + 2 + 3) -for which results are presented in the foregoing- two
       additional, lower investment scenarios- were investigated for Harare and Greater Harare to
       cater for improved service delivery in these areas with lower investment requirements. For
       these scenarios the requirements of the satellite towns was included under the financial
       model for Greater Harare.
       To provide a comparative basis betweent he various scenarios, all input data except for the
       actual investment costs remained unchanged. The summary results for all three options
       are presented in the following tables.
       The Income statements for scenarios 2 and 3 in respect of both the gross margin and the
       adjusted accounting profit are positive throughout, though higher for scenario 3 than x.
       Similarly the surplus is higher for scenario 2 than sceneario 1.
       With regard to the cash flow statements shown in the second table the resulting net and
       cumulative cash flow is the same in the base year and is generally in surplus, crowing
       consistently over the project period. Again, the comparison between scenario 1, 2 and 3
       reveals the same relationship, i.e. the surplus at the endo fhte project evaluationperiod
       (2030) is highest for scenario 3, next for scenario 2 and then scenario 1. This comparative
       result is to be expected as investment costs are lower for scenario 2 than 1 and again
       lower for scenario 3 than 2, while the benefits remain constant.
       Thus the overall outcome is that the financial result is acceptable (generally surplus) for
       scenario 1, but better for both scenarios 2 and 3. Howver, at the same time, the
       investments are more extensive and technically superior for scenario 3 than 2 and again
       scenario 2 is technically superior to 1.

11.10 Viability Assessment for Greater Harare Metropolitan Utility
       Summarising the various findings presented above it can be stated that the base model for
       Harare using current and reducing tariff levels is positive with regard to the income
       statement, sustainable in terms of the cash flow and shown to have an affordable rate of
       investment according to the balance sheet.
       However, this cannot be stated for the satellite towns that return a substantially inferior
       financial position taking into consideration all three financial statements forecast for these
       areas. It can further be stated (in general terms) that the satellite areas neither have the
       liquidity at present nor are they likely to have this in future to cover costs and as such, not
       be able to honour the obligations of a loan required to implement the much needed
       investments.
       Clustering Harare Water together with the satellite areas does however present an
       opportunity of achieving a financially sustainable result and at the same time be in a
       position to refund the loan required to implement the much needed capital investments in
       all areas.
       While the existing loan from Exim Bank has provided for the funding of capital investments
       in Harare worth USD 130 million, the terms and conditions of a 5-year repayment period at
       an interest rate of 3.5 % p.a. poses a heavy burden on the entity. Nonetheless, the
       financial model shows that by and large it is possible to still afford an additional loan or
       loans required to implement the medium to long-term investment plan as proposed herein
       and service the existing loan obligations, however with the result that there are occasional
       periods during which the forecast financial performance may require assistance from the
       shareholders of the entity.
       The two alternative investment plan scenarios offered in this investment plan do provide
       scope for reducing the financial burden on the entity. However, these do not offer the same
       degree of satisfactory long-term technical solutions. Since the first option can be afforded,
       it would be advisable to consider re-negotiating the existing loan towards more favourable
       conditions in order to comfortably take on the full investments recommended and detailed
       under the investment scenario 1.
       As indicated above, the full investment for all areas, i.e. including all satellite towns, is best
       achieved under a single entity that clusters all areas into one more capable organisation.
       In view of the above, it is therefore recommended to cluster the areas and prioritise the
       investment plan as detailed under scenario 1.

12     ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

12.1   Introduction
       The overall thrust of the investment plan is to improve and optimize the future delivery of
       water and sewerage treatment services within Greater Harare, such that in future the
       residents of Greater Harare have adequate access to safe and clean water and an efficient
       system for the disposal of waste water. In doing so it is important that this objective is
       achieved within the context of safeguarding the wider environment, such that the overall
       result is a healthy population coupled with a healthy environment. To achieve this requires
       that environmental and social concerns are identified and incorporated into all stages of the
       management cycle, from planning through to implementation and operation.
       The purpose of this section is to outline a general framework to provide for the
       incorporation of environmental and social concerns within subsequent implementation of
       the investment plan and operation of the resulting infrastructure. In this respect it is relevant
       to note that the investment plan builds on and, in many instances, extends existing
       infrastructure, such that it comprises a mix of rehabilitation, improvement and extension of
       existing water and sewerage treatment systems plus, in some cases, the construction of
       new infrastructure.
       The section starts by outlining the relevant national policies and legislation pertinent to the
       management of water resources and the environment in Zimbabwe, and identifying the key
       management institutions and outlining their general roles (Section 12.2). Thereafter,
       consideration is given to the formal procedure for conducting environmental impact
       assessments in Zimbabwe, and how this will be incorporated as part of the investment
       process (Section 12.3), as well as to supporting international assessment procedures
       (Section 12.4). This is followed by a summary of the major project works proposed for
       Greater Harare, and general guidance as to how environmental and social concerns will be
       incorporated and addressed within the investment cycle (Section 12.5).

12.2   Zimbabwe Policies, Legislation and Institutions

12.2.1 Constitution of Zimbabwe
       The newly adopted âConstitution of Zimbabweâ, as part of the declaration of rights (Chapter
       4), specifically recognizes the rights of all persons to safe, clean and potable water (Section
       77) and to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being, and to have the
       environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations (Section 73) (Table
       12-1).

12.2.2 Key Ministries
       There are three ministries that share key responsibilities towards the successful delivery of
       adequate water and sanitation services within a context of maintaining a healthy
       environment, namely the:
       â¢   Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing,
       â¢   Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate, and
       â¢   Ministry of Health and Child Care.

       The general responsibility of each is outlined in Table12-2, together with relevant policies,
       strategies and legislation in Table 12-3. There are other Ministries that play a strong
       supporting role, such as the Ministry of Finance which is responsible for raising the
       necessary funds for infrastructure development.

        Environmental       (a) to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being; and
        rights              (b) to have the environment protected for the benefit of present and future
                            generations, through reasonable legislative and other measures thatâ

                            (ii) promote conservation; and
                            (iii) secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources
                            while promoting economic and social development.
                            (2) The State must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within the
                            limits of the resources available to it, to achieve the progressive realisation of
                            the rights set out in this section.
        Section 77: Right   Every person has the right toâ
        to food and water   (a) safe, clean and potable water; and
                            (b) sufficient food;
                            and the State must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within the

        and Climate                      management and protection of the environment

       The Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing is responsible for
       supervising local authorities and regional development including both the rural and urban
       areas. These functions are governed by three pieces of legislation: the Urban Councils Act,
       the Rural District Councils Act and the Provincial Councils and Administration Act. The
       Urban Councils Act (Chapter 29:15) provides for the administration of the countryâs towns
       and cities. Urban Councils are ranked, according to their size and levels of development,
       into cities, municipalities, towns and local boards. The Act affords the Minister of Local
       Government, Public Works and National Housing wide ranging supervisory powers over
       urban authorities. The provision for input by civil society, in contrast, is relatively weak and
       poorly developed.
       Under the Urban Councils Act, urban councils are mandated to provide water and waste
       water treatment services to residents, as well as to take responsibility for environmental
       protection. In doing so, the Act does not preclude the possibility of delegating responsibility
       to a designated service provider (public, private or mixed). The manner in which water and

       The Ministry of Health and Child Care is responsible for promoting the health and quality of
       life for all people in Zimbabwe. As part of its Preventative Services, the Ministry includes a
       Department of Environmental Health which administers the Public Health Act (Chapter 19
       of 1924) and related regulations. The Public Health Act (Chapter 15:09) clearly states that it
       is the duty of a local authority to furnish water supplies in line with health requirements. It
       also requires other agencies providing water in an area, such as ZINWA, to comply with
       this requirement. The Public Health Act also requires the local authority to maintain existing
       water supplies in good working order.

       quality inspections and samples on drinking water sources. Under the Public Health
       (Effluent) Regulations, 1972, the Department also plays a role in terms of water pollution
       control, specifically in terms of monitoring the microbiological content of effluents. The
       Department delivers these services through officers at the national, provincial, district and
       ward levels.
       Responsibility for management of water and environmental resources is primarily vested in
       the newly constructed Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate, which combines the
       previously separate Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Management, and

       of the environment and water are the National Environmental Policy (2009) and the
       Environmental Management Act (2002, updated 2007), together with the Water Act (2002)
       and the recently updated National Water Policy (2013).

12.2.3 Management of Water Resources
       The recent National Water Policy defines the vision for urban water supply and sanitation
       services as follows:
       âAll urban water users should enjoy adequate, continuous, readily accessible, safe, hygienic,
       sustainable and affordable domestic water and sanitation services provided by accountable,
       efficient, coordinated, funded and capacitated institutionsâ
       The policy document demands for adequate and affordable services to all residents and
       underlines the importance of efficient and conservative management principles when
       producing and supplying drinking water. These principles have been centrally incorporated
       into the process of development of the investment plan, as outlined in Chapter 6, which
       summarises the key strategies applied during the planning process in order to optimize the
       delivery of efficient, sustainable and affordable water and waste water treatment services.

12.2.4 Environmental Management
       The National Environmental Policy and Strategy was gazetted in June 2009. Its vision
       closely follows that of the National Development Objective of the government âto alleviate
       poverty and improve the quality of life of the people of Zimbabweâ. In line with this vision,
       the goal of the National Environmental Policy is:
       âTo avoid irreversible environmental damage, maintain essential environmental processes,
       and preserve the broad spectrum of biological diversity so as to sustain the long-term ability
       of natural resources to meet the basic needs of people, enhance food security, reduce
       poverty, and improve the standard of living of Zimbabweans through long-term economic
       growth and the creation of employment.â
       The Environmental Management Act (Chapter 20:27), 2002 (amended 2006) is the primary
       legislation dealing with environmental management in Zimbabwe. The intention of the
       Environmental Management Act was to consolidate previously disparate environmental
       legislation into a single act, and in so doing to provide an overall and integrated approach to
       environmental management. It aims to provide for sustainable management of natural
       resources and protection of the environment and prevention of pollution and environmental
       degradation.
       One of the requirements under the Environmental Management Act is for the Minister to
       prepare a National Environmental Plan and for each local authority to prepare a local
       Environmental Action Plan for the area under its jurisdiction. This requirement has yet to be
       complied with in any of the project areas.
       The Act provides for the establishment of an Environmental Management Agency (EMA)
       and lays out the responsibilities of EMA in terms of overseeing environmental management
       in the country. One of the functions of EMA is to develop and enforce environmental quality
       standards for various parameters including minimum quality standards for water for
       different uses, and for the discharge of effluent into the environment. As yet, EMA has not
       produced standards for drinking water quality. This has previously been done by the
       Standards Association of Zimbabwe, whereby Zimbabwe Standard No. 560:1997 (Water for
       Domestic Supplies) lays down the minimum physical, chemical and bacteriological

       requirements for purity as delivered to the consumer, of water for domestic supplies
       regardless of source. Reference is also commonly made to the World Health Organization
       guidelines for drinking water quality.
       EMA has produced regulations concerning the discharge of effluent to the environment,
       known as the Environmental Management (Effluent and Solid Waste Disposal) Regulations,
       2007. According to the regulations no person shall dispose of effluent into a public stream
       or into any other surface water or ground water, whether directly or through drainage or
       seepage, except under a licence. The regulations provide criteria for a wide range of
       physical, chemical and bacteriological parameters, according to which effluent can be
       categorized into four categories:
       â¢   Blue â safe;
       â¢   Green â low hazard;
       â¢   Yellow â medium hazard;
       â¢   Red â high hazard.
       Any person wishing to dispose of effluent is required to apply for and receive a permit for
       the appropriate class of licence. Such a licence is valid for one year and needs to be
       updated annually.
       Another of the key functions of the EMA is to manage the environmental impact
       assessment (EIA) process, which provides for the incorporation of environmental
       assessment and management in all economic and development activities, as outlined in the
       following section.
       EMA carries out its duties through a network of national, provincial and district offices and
       officers.

12.3   Zimbabwe Procedures for Environmental Impact Assessments
       The Environmental Management Act identifies those projects for which an EIA is required,
       as listed in the First Schedule of the Act (Table 12-4). According to the Act:
       â¢   A person who proposes to embark on any of the projects listed in the First Schedule is
           required to submit an EIA report to the Director-General;
       â¢   The developer can only embark on the project if she/he has obtained a certificate from
           the Director-General;
       â¢   It is an offence for any person to knowingly implement a project without a certificate
           showing that an EIA has been carried out.
       The process for environmental review and conducting an EIA are outlined in the
       Environmental Management (Environmental Impact Assessments and Ecosystems
       Protection) Regulations of 2007. Before carrying out an EIA for a prescribed activity, the
       developer must first submit a prospectus to EMA. The prospectus should provide the
       following information:
       â¢   A description of the proposed project;
       â¢   A description of the anticipated environmental and social impacts; and
       â¢   Terms of reference for the proposed environmental impact assessment.

        Water supply (including water withdrawals from

        rivers or reservoirs and major pipelines)

       In response to the prospectus, the Director General may require the developer to submit
       additional information or, if satisfied that the proposed EIA is capable of evaluating the
       projectâs impact on the environment, approve the prospectus and ask the developer to
       proceed with the EIA.
       Once the EIA has been completed this must be submitted to EMA for review. Once again,
       the Director General may either approve the EIA or else, request for additional information.
       If the project is approved, the Director-General will issue a certificate, which serves as
       authorization for the project to be implemented.
       To assist the EIA process, the former Ministry of Environment and Tourism in 1997
       published Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines. The purpose of these guidelines
       is to facilitate the implementation of EIAs within specific sectors, including the water and
       waste management sectors. For each sector the guidelines provide examples of major
       activities that are likely to be undertaken for projects in that sector; the types of
       environmental impacts that are likely to result; possible measures for managing such
       impacts; sample terms of reference for EIA studies; and useful sources of information for
       use in an EIA study.
       Public participation
       Public participation is a requirement of the EIA process, and the policy states that the public
       should participate in the preparation and review of EIA reports. Such consultations typically
       focus on determining the probable impacts and the mitigation measures that will be
       acceptable to the community involved.

12.4   International Policies and Procedures
       Implementation of the investment plan is likely to depend to a greater or lesser extent on
       securing foreign investment, for example through the African Development Bank or World
       Bank. In this case there will be an additional need to comply with environmental and social
       assessment policies and procedures of the relevant investment agency. For example, the
       AfDB, in accordance with their environmental and social assessment procedures (2003),
       classified the existing Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project, as a
       Category 2 project, this being a project likely to induce site-specific environmental and/or
       social impacts but that can be minimised by the application of mitigation measures. For
       Category 2 projects it is necessary to prepare an Environmental and Social Management
       Plan.

12.5   Framework for Environmental and Social Management

12.5.1 Summary of Works
       The following works are proposed for Greater Harare for the medium and long-term for
       water supply (Table 12-5) and for treatment of waste water (Table 12-6). An indication of
       the level of environmental assessment likely to be required for each component (ESMP or
       EIA) is also provided.
       For each town and for both water supply and waste water treatment works, it will be
       possible to address the environmental management for some of the proposed works
       through an ESMP whilst other works will require a more detailed EIA. Water supply works
       that will require a full EIA include:
       â¢   Construction of the Kunzvi Water Supply Scheme (Harare),
       â¢   Construction of new reservoirs (all component towns),
       â¢   Construction of new treated water transmission mains (Chitungwiza), and
       â¢   Extension of the distribution system to new service areas (all component towns).
       Other works that can probably be addressed though an ESMP include:
       â¢   Rehabilitation of existing water treatment plants (Harare, Ruwa),
       â¢   Upgrading of existing treated water transmission mains (Chitungwiza, Norton, Ruwa),
       â¢   Rehabilitation of existing storage reservoirs (Chitungwiza, Epworth, Norton, Ruwa), and
       â¢   Rehabilitation and upgrading of existing water distribution network (all component
           towns).
       For the waste water treatment works, the following works will require an EIA:
       â¢   Construction of new outfall sewers (Harare, Chitungwiza, Norton, Ruwa),
       â¢   Construction of new waste water treatment plants (Harare, Norton), and
       â¢   Extension of the sewer reticulation system to new service areas (all component towns).
       Other works that can probably be addressed though an ESMP include:
       â¢   Rehabilitation of existing sewer reticulation networks and sewers (Harare, Chitungwiza,
           Norton, Ruwa),
       â¢   Rehabilitation of sewer pump stations (Chitungwiza), and

12.5.2 Planning
       In terms of the overall project cycle from planning to implementation to operation, the
       present investment plan effectively covers the planning stage, at least in broad terms. In
       preparing the investment plan consideration of environmental and social concerns has
       been incorporated into all of the proposed investment components (Table 12-7).
       For many aspects, the scope of possible options has been constrained by the need to
       incorporate and build on existing water and sanitation infrastructure, for example in terms of
       potential locations for treatment plants and the types of technologies to be used.
       The major exception, in terms of water supply, is the construction of the Kunzvi Water
       Supply System. Detailed feasibility studies for the Kunzvi system have previously been
       carried out, although these will need to be updated.
       In terms of sanitation one of the key planning considerations is how to optimally extend
       sewer services to the southern portions of the city, where much of the future expansion is
       envisaged to occur, and to treat the resulting waste water. These issues have been
       examined and analysed in a series of three discussion papers. These include consideration
       of factors such as: impacts to catchment water flows and water supply from the Manyame
       catchment, the location and quality of effluent releases, different types of treatment
       technology (pond systems with or without irrigation, BNR systems), efficiency of nutrient
       removal, one centralized versus numerous dispersed treatment plants, cost factors, (capital
       and operational and maintenance costs), predicted energy costs, affordability, land
       requirements, carbon budgeting and staffing requirements (numbers and skills). Based on
       these considerations it is proposed to construct a new trunk sewer around the south of the
       city, and then to pump and transfer the sewerage into the Mupfure catchment for treatment
       in ponds followed by disposal through land irrigation.

12.5.3 Construction and Operation
       In addition to the construction of the Kunzvi water supply system, the Harare South outfall
       sewer, pump station and waste water treatment works, the construction of new water
       transmission mains, water storage reservoirs, main sewers and the construction of a new
       waste water treatment facility in Norton, can be anticipated to require detailed EIA studies.
       As regards the production of EIAs concerning the extension of water supply and sewers to
       new service areas, it is possible that these could be picked up by prospective developers
       rather than being incorporated as part of the existing investment plan.
       The remainder of the proposed construction measures primarily focus on the rehabilitation
       of existing infrastructure, such that it should be possible to adequately address potential
       environmental and social concerns through preparation of an Environmental and Social
       Management Plan. Such plans should identify potential environmental and social impacts

13     RISK ASSESSMENT
       This chapter summarises the specific issues that need special consideration when
       progressing to the next project phases, the detailed studies, designs and implementation of
       the works. When developing this investment plan, specific assumptions were made
       regarding technical design criteria and standards, the economic growth and political stability,
       the institutional arrangements within the councils regarding water and sewerage operations
       and available financial arrangements. All such assumptions impact in various ways and
       magnitude on the investment programme, from planning all the way through to
       implementation and operation. The risks can be grouped into four main categories as
       follows:
          â¢    Principle Design Criteria â assumptions made with regard to principal design
               criteria;
          â¢    Institutional Arrangements and Financing â assumptions made regarding
               sustainability of the investment measures and availability of funds to implement
               them;
          â¢    Project Implementation â assumptions made regarding the scheduling of the
               implementation programme;
          â¢    Sustainability Issues â assumptions regarding operational improvements

13.1   Risk Assessment of Principle Design Criteria
       The principle design criteria determine largely the layout and implementation schedule of
       the infrastructure components, some of the design criteria are critical and the rating of the
       risk is medium to high. The responsibility to develop suitable criteria is with the Consultant.
       Such criteria will be fine-tuned during subsequent planning stages as more refined data
       becomes available. Additional information such as; flow, pressure, quality, effluent and
       other operational data collected by the Council during their operations will improve the
       quality of design criteria. The responsibility to review and approve the proposed criteria is
       with the World Bank and the Councils.

13.2   Institutional Arrangements and Financing
       The institutional arrangements and the financing risks of the investment measures are
       mainly with the Government of Zimbabwe and the various other financiers. The
       implementation of the National Water Policy will be a critical component of the project
       success. Institutional and organisational changes, the involvement of the private sector and
       other key policy principles will promote the successful implementation of the investment
       measures and lead to sustainable operations.

13.3   Project Implementation
       Given that there is no financial commitment yet for the implementation of the project
       measures under this investment plan, there is a huge risk that the priority investment
       measure which will set the foundation for improved service delivery and enable the service
       providers to operate in a sustainable manner, may not be implemented. The
       implementation is depended on the positive appraisal of the investment measures by the
       World Bank and other fanciers. Preparatory activities such as detailed studies and design
       must be financed and begin as quickly as possible. The responsibility to encourage
       financial support, secure funds and to follow the implementation schedule is with the
       Government, the World Bank and the Councils.
