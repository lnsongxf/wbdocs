   Box 1. The hidden agricultural loan portfolio—risks and missed business
   opportunities

   MFIs’ expansion in Peru into medium-size towns in rural areas started at least 10 years ago. Most institutions have not
   adjusted their credit methodology and instead only offer loans to the traditional, well-known sectors in urban areas:
   trade, services, and some small factories. Agricultural activities and livestock farming are usually not eligible. But the
   reality is that micro entrepreneurs in rural areas have diversified businesses with different sources of income and quite
   complex risk profiles and financial needs.
   Since money is fungible, clients apply for loans by presenting the loan officer with an eligible activity—for example, a
   small grocery shop or transportation service firm—but also use the funds to finance their agricultural activities, which
   are not evaluated by the loan officer. This has two different effects that need to be considered. First, there is a hidden
   risk, because if the client has a problem in his agricultural activity, it will affect his overall repayment capacity. Second,
   because the loan officer only considered the eligible activities, the client’s profile (and hence his potential needs)
   are not registered and cannot be evaluated and used for cross-selling activities or any other commercial targeted
   campaign. It is important to draw MFIs’ attention to this critical issue and create awareness of the hidden risks and the
   missed business opportunities they have in their loan portfolios. In some branches, 30 percent to 50 percent of their
   loan portfolio is affected by this phenomenon, according to interviews with loan officers.

Case Study Selection
Following the desk research, a targeted survey was
created to better understand why and how a select group
of LAC MFIs are serving rural and smallholder clients.
The survey, which covered a wide range of questions
on the operational models used by MFIs to reach
smallholders, was sent to 19 MFIs in LAC, including
(microfinance) banks, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), and non-bank financial institutions. These 19
MFIs were chosen because they are operating in rural
areas and IFC had prior information regarding their
activities and interest in the agricultural sector. A
total of eight MFIs responded to the survey. It must
be noted that we use the term “MFI” here to refer
to financial institutions that may have diverse legal
status, from licensed banks, such as Banco de Ahorro
y Crédito ADOPEM, to NGOs authorized to deliver
financial services, such as Women’s World Banking

T       his section describes and analyzes the current
        practices of the four case study MFIs. Where
        possible, these practices are compared against
regional and global trends gleaned through the targeted
survey and desk research. Lessons learned and success
                                                            The Indian MFIs surveyed reported that they did not
                                                            differentiate between farmer segments. They appear to

factors are highlighted.                                    MFIs rely heavily on group lending and standardized
                                                            products and procedures that do not require advanced

preliminary research work in India, it seems useful to
draw a comparison between selected features of the
Latin America MFIs that replied to the targeted survey
and those emerging from India using a fairly similar
survey. It must be kept in mind that while the India MFIs
are typically “mainstream” MFIs, those responding to
the LAC survey (eight out of 19 receiving the survey)
self-selected to participate in an exercise already known
to focus on agricultural lending. Tables 3 (LAC) and 4
(India) summarize the comparison.

From the two tables, one could argue that the
India picture is closer to what one would find in a
comprehensive survey of MFIs, perhaps a bit biased
towards the non-existence of an agrifinance business
line. The LAC MFIs, on the other hand, show a
predisposition to serve smallholder farmers. For
example, several of them have specific loan products
for farmers. They are far, however, from having a heavy
involvement in agriculture, as only one of the LAC MFIs
had close to a 20 percent exposure and all others were
less than 13 percent. In addition, as will be shown and
discussed below, both third-party lending (i.e., through
buyers or input suppliers) and value chain financing
are relatively new areas for LAC MFIs. Another reason
for the differences between the LAC and Indian MFIs
could be attributed to agriculture in LAC being more
commercially driven, even among smallholder farmers.

Use of diverse segmentation criteria. Reconciling the
way in which MFIs in the case studies categorize their
farmer clients with IFC’s segmentation framework is
somewhat challenging. Overall, we find that these MFIs
segment their clientele by factors such as loan size, crop
diversification, and level of indebtedness, and generally
take an individualized approach to client assessment
based on cash flow analyses. In other words, the lender
does not start by profiling the farmer borrower as
commercial, or semi-commercial, or subsistence, and
then assigning that client a loan package. Instead, a
dominant driver in loan application analysis seems to
be loan size, which does not necessarily align with IFC’s
segmentation profile.

An exception can be cited in the case of Financiera

The greater risk inherent in longer-term lending is
likely to be an obstacle, but other factors may explain
the scarcity of fixed assets loans, including risk aversion
on the demand side and additional requirements
associated with medium/long-term loans. Value chain
arrangements associated with perennial crops may
enable access to long-term financing (i.e., integrating
smallholders into value chains with secure market
relationships, access to technical assistance, and the
like), but this would be more the exception than the

Design and piloting of new delivery channels. The
lack of appropriate delivery channels is one of the
principal challenges to smallholder lending, according
to the MFIs surveyed for this study. Assistance in this
area could have a significant impact on the size and
profitability of agricultural lending programs.

Support for financial education programs for
smallholders. The LAC MFIs surveyed for this
study identified lack of financial education as a main
constraint to smallholder lending, yet few are offering
these services. Support for design or expansion of
financial education programs may be worth considering.


Potential Areas for Further Research
The study revealed a number of additional research
topics to build upon and broaden the existing knowledge
base on effective smallholder lending. The topics are
outlined below.

Access to finance for smallholder agricultural
producers in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.
Replication of this research study globally would allow for
regional comparison, identification of more successful
experiences in lending to semi-commercial smallholders        and profitability in smallholder agriculture. Additional

Role of government and donor guarantee
programs in encouraging agricultural lending. It
is not uncommon that MFIs, along with other financial
institutions, benefit from government and/or other
types of guarantees aiming at promoting lending to
the agricultural sector. While there are descriptions of
the various government and donor guarantee plans,
there is relatively little to assess their impact. Research
could shed light on the effectiveness and performance
(e.g., additionality and costs) of the guarantee schemes
in promoting lending and ensure the sustainability of
an agricultural lending system in the long run. The
research should be able to determine the elements of
good design for such guarantees. Related to this, there
should be an examination of the impact of government
policies that set minimum portfolio lending targets for
agricultural lending, such as in India.

shareholder in Banco ADOPEM, along with the BBVA
Microfinance Foundation, continues to operate as an
NGO, collaborating with Banco ADOPEM through
support for training to the bank’s clients. Seeing a
market opportunity in underserved rural areas, and as
part of its mission, Banco ADOPEM began lending to

ADOPEM has one principal but highly flexible
agricultural loan product, agrocrédito, which allows
for payment schedules based on each smallholder’s
preferences and payment capacity. However, this credit
product is only one element in an integrated long-term
strategy for serving agricultural smallholders, and the
agricultural sector more broadly, with a comprehensive
package of financial and non-financial services. This
package includes financial education and micro-insurance
(life, accident, and funeral expenses), and an incipient
value chain consolidation program for high potential
crops, as well as a savings product that is accessible to
low-income households in both urban and rural areas.

Risk Management
In addition to the cash flow tool—which Bancamía
thinks is important to measure risk at the client level—
it also manages risk through consultation with credit
bureaus and its internal credit scoring system, which
analyzes character and financial information. The
bank considers the credit bureau system quite good;
the two private credit bureaus include commercial
references (from input providers, for example). In the
internal scoring, clients in rural areas are given slightly
more leeway than urban clients because of the rural
clients’ distance from branches. For example, a rural
client can be up to eight days late with a payment and
still be qualified as a 5, the highest rating possible. In
comparison, an urban client must pay within four days
to receive that rating. Collateral terms are also a bit
more lenient for rural clients than for urban clients. To
prevent indebtedness, the bank also limits eligibility if

Case 3:
Financiera Confianza, Perú
Background
In May 2013, Financiera Confianza completed a merger
with Caja Rural de Ahorro y Crédito Nuestra Gente
(which itself had been formed by the fusion of two Cajas
Rurales and one Edpyme), with investment and other
support from the BBVA Microfinance Foundation, IFC,
Financiera Confianza’s founding NGO SEPAR, and other
shareholders. The new financial corporation operates
under the name Financiera Confianza, S.A.A. Financiera
Confianza started as an NGO and all institutions that
formed part of Nuestra Gente were rural Cajas or
Edpymes. Over the last two years, the new organization—
formed by the two specialized, rural MFIs—has been
working through the challenge of integrating different
policies, products, staff, and practices.

  Box 3. Coffee rust in the central region: Financiera Confianza’s proactive
  risk management strategy

  A decentralized organizational structure has helped Financiera Confianza prevent a significant deterioration in its
  portfolio quality when Perú recently fell prone to roya (rust) disease, which has besieged a certain variety of coffee
  in Central and South America in the last few years. When problems were first noted, middle (regional) management
  and local branch administrators in affected areas teamed up to launch a preemptive review of all coffee loans. Under
  the direction of middle management, including the product specialist, staff made visits to most clients growing coffee
  and established the nature and extent of the disease on the plantations, as well as a plan to repay the loan through
  production from existing healthy stock or other sources of income. While the full extent of the potential risk is not
  entirely known, of an approximately $13.65 million exposure to coffee, $10.78 million is expected to be repaid
  according to the normal repayment schedule. The remaining $2.88 million will be subject to various mutually agreed
  measures of repayment, such as restructuring and/or refinancing. Financiera Confianza sees this personal attention to
  helping clients through difficulties as a strategy to engender loyalty, ensuring that clients will return to the MFI when
  the opportunity arises to replant.

Case 4:
Caja Huancayo, Perú
Background
Caja Huancayo is a municipal Caja, 100 percent owned
by the municipality of Huancayo. With a concentrated
presence in the central region of Perú, Caja Huancayo
has been operating in the microfinance market for 25
years. It has the strongest market in Huancayo and the
Junín province, with more branches than any other
institution, despite growing competition from Cajas
and other financial institutions entering this market in
recent years. Clients interviewed for this study have
described it as an institution that encourages loyalty and
provides some of the most competitive interest rates.

Caja Huancayo has been involved in financing agriculture
in a variety of ways since 1996. The Caja finances a
wide variety of agricultural activities, including livestock
raising, milk production, and almost all types of crop
production. Its agricultural finance strategy includes
leveraging its outreach points (branch, information
points, and ATM and correspondent banking networks)
to further penetrate the sector, building inwards
between branches. The agricultural portfolio growth             This represents a sharp increase since July, when PAR

The evaluation methodology also considers other

is a significant mix of crops, where more than one crop
makes up more than 20 percent of the financing needs.
This conservative approach to assessing the farmer and
the credit required usually entails lowering price and
productivity estimates to anticipate a very conservative
scenario, which could result in lower financing than
clients may prefer.
