Key Characteristics of Aggregation Case Study
                         KISKUN-VIZ, HUNGARY
Context                  •	 High-income country

                         •	 Aggregation covering urban and rural areas

                         •	 High level of water supply and sanitation (WSS) performance

Purpose                  Economic efficiency, performance, professionalization

Scope                    WSS functions and services

Scale                    •	 Administrative boundaries

                         •	 Localities covered: 54 for water and 35 for wastewater

                         •	 Population covered: 161,000 inhabitants for water and 141,000 for wastewater

                         •	 Coverage: 100% for water; 87% for wastewater

                         •	 Connections: 63,670 for water and 43,658 for wastewater

                         •	 Network length: 1,377 km for water and 906 km for wastewater

Process                  Top-down

Governance               •	 Merger

                         •	 Public company

                         •	 Decision making: municipalities and the Hungarian state are the utility’s shareholders

                         •	 Asset transfer: assets remain the property of municipalities and are managed by the operator as part of the
                          merger agreement

                         •	 Liability: liabilities and debts from previous operators are taken on by aggregated utility

                         •	 Staff transfer: all staff was transferred

                         •	 Clear entry and exit rules

Outcome                  Positive, with decreased operating expenses

Findings                 Political resistance when choosing utility headquarters location and nominating CEOs; difficulty retaining
                         skilled staff because of financial constraints; accountability mechanisms toward employees; harmonization of
                         operating practices among aggregated entities on the basis of best practice; accountability toward customers
                         (satisfaction survey); aggregation appears beneficial, especially for service quality and sustainability in small
