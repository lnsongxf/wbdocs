The Philippines Economic Update (PEU) provides a brief summary of key economic and social
developments, important policy changes and the evolution of external conditions over the past six
months. It also presents findings from recent World Bank studies on the Philippines, situating them in the
context of the country’s long-term development trends and assessing their implications for its medium-
term economic outlook. The PEU covers issues ranging from macroeconomic management to financial
market dynamics to the complex challenges of poverty reduction and social development. It is intended
to serve the needs of a wide audience, including policymakers, business leaders, financial firms and
investors, and analysts and professionals engaged in the social and economic development of the
Philippines.
The PEU is a biannual publication of the World Bank’s Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global
Practice (MFM GP), in partnership with the Poverty & Equity, Finance & Markets, Social Protection & Labor
GPs. The team that prepared this edition worked under the guidance of Birgit Hansl (Lead Economist and
Program Leader) and Ndiame Diop (Practice Manager for the MFM GP’s Philippines Office), and consisted
of Kevin Chua (Economist and Task Team Leader) and Kevin Cruz (Research Analyst) from the MFM GP,
Jan Rutkowski (Lead Economist) and Pablo Ariel Acosta (Senior Economist) from the Social Protection &
Labor GP, Nataliya Mylenko (Senior Financial Sector Specialist) from the Finance & Markets GP, and
Sharon Faye Alariao Piza (Economist) from the Poverty & Equity GP. The report was edited by Sean Lothrop
(Сonsultant), and the graphic designer was Robert Waiharo (Сonsultant). Peer reviewers included Eric Le
Borgne (Lead Economist) and Rafael Moreno (Senior Economist). Logistics and publication support were

                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Philippines has emerged as one of the most dynamic economies in the East Asia region. Despite a
challenging global economic environment, the Philippine economy has grown at a rapid pace over the
past five years, supported by sound macroeconomic fundamentals and a highly competitive workforce.
Strong capital investment and robust domestic demand have helped secure the Philippines’ position as
the leading growth performer among major economies in East Asia and the Pacific. Public spending rose
by more than 10 percent during the first half of 2016, as the government continued to implement its
ambitious investment program. Services and industry remained the primary engines of growth, while the
lingering effects of El Niño further diminished agricultural output and a weaker-than-expected global
recovery continued to hinder the export sector. Nevertheless, the GDP growth rate rose from 5.5 percent
in the first half of 2015 to 6.9 percent in the first half of 2016, enabling the Philippines to outperform
regional peers such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Meanwhile, the country is transitioning to a new economic policy framework. The Duterte
administration took office on June 30th after winning a peaceful democratic election marked by record
voter turnout. The previous administration made major achievements in securing macroeconomic
stability, promoting public sector transparency and focusing fiscal resources on pro-poor infrastructure
projects and social services, and the new president’s economic team has prepared a 10-point
socioeconomic agenda designed to reinforce private sector confidence in the continuity of the existing
macroeconomic framework. The preliminary agenda is intended to bolster the government’s current
fiscal, monetary and trade policy stances, while prioritizing tax administration reforms. Despite these
reassurances, however, a degree of uncertainty remains regarding the ultimate direction of
macroeconomic policy. The short-term challenges is how to successfully manage the economic transition
and providing the right signals to investors and businesses. Over the longer term, policymakers will need
to explore innovative strategies for sustaining high growth rates as the returns to the country’s current
economic model inevitably diminish.
The Philippines’ current monetary and fiscal policies have effectively supported growth . Although core
inflation is gradually rising, inflation rates remain below the central bank’s 2-4 percent target band. The
central bank further loosened its monetary policy stance in June, lowering its key policy rate by 100 basis
points to 3.0 percent. High domestic liquidity is reflected in increasing credit growth, especially to the real
estate and construction sectors, but also to households. Meanwhile, election-related outlays combined
with efforts to improve budget execution significantly boosted public spending. This increase in
expenditures outpaced revenue growth, resulting in a fiscal deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in the first half
of 2016. This revered a budget surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP recorded during the same period in the
previous year. However, the fiscal deficit remained within the statutory limit of 2 percent of GDP and was
almost entirely financed by domestic borrowing. Moreover, the country’s debt burden slid from 44.9
percent of GDP at end-2015 to 43.0 percent in mid-2016.
The economic outlook is optimistic, with risks tilted to the upside. The substantial improvements in
macroeconomic stability achieved over the past decade, combined with low and stable inflation rates,
prudent fiscal management, sustained current-account surpluses and comfortable levels of international
reserves, have established the necessary conditions for further robust growth. Over the near term, the
Philippines is poised to benefit from the completion of several large public infrastructure projects, which
are expected to boost private investment. Improved infrastructure, solid remittance inflows and
significant social spending should continue to support the growth of household consumption. If remaining
budget-execution bottlenecks are successfully addressed in the next few months, and if uncertainties
regarding the specifics of the reform agenda are quickly resolved, the annual GDP growth rate could
exceed the 6.2 percent currently projected for 2017-18.

                                                      VI
While the near-term outlook is highly positive, the Philippines’ growth model is subject to medium-
term risks. These include the continued failure of external demand to meet expectations and/or a
decrease in remittance inflows, both of which stem from the slow and uneven recovery of advanced
economies and China’s ongoing economic rebalancing. Conversely, an accelerating recovery among high-
income economies could lead to higher interest rates in the US and EU, potentially tightening external
borrowing conditions and diverting the attention of international investors. On the domestic front,
medium-term risks include the persistent vulnerability of the agricultural sector, as well as unresolved
constraints on private investment, such as limits on foreign investment and technology transfer, a lack of
competition in major sectors and structural deficiencies in the business environment. Finally, ensuring
that growth is inclusive will continue to pose a major cross-cutting challenge to Philippine policymakers—
one that is likely to intensify as the country’s evolving economy increasingly shifts to more skill- and
capital-intensive forms of production.
Enhancing the inclusiveness of growth is a stated priority of the new administration. The Philippines has
made some progress in its fight against extreme poverty. According to recent estimates, the extreme
poverty rate decreased gradually from 10.6 percent in 2012 to 8.4 percent in 2015 as real household
income grew. While frequent natural disasters, including a record number of typhoons between 2013 and
2015, undermined welfare gains, the government’s social protection programs mitigated their impact.
Overall, income growth among the country’s poorer households exceeded the national average, reducing
income inequality. As the Philippine economy continues to develop, the challenge of ensuring inclusive
growth will become more complex, and investment in human capital will be necessary to ensure that the
nation’s workforce is able to meet a rising demand for skilled labor. The new administration is committed
to continued investment in education, job skills, public health and social assistance in order to promote a
transformative and inclusive growth pattern. The government is currently engaged in a process of
stakeholder consultation as it develops the next six-year Philippine Development Plan, which is expected
to provide guidance on both short- and medium-term policy priorities for achieving this ambitious goal.
The government’s fiscal agenda calls for higher rates of public investment, which will require a
commensurate increase in revenue mobilization. The new administration aims to accelerate the creation
of high-quality jobs through greater public investment in infrastructure, education and healthcare. To
finance this agenda, the authorities are planning a comprehensive tax reform effort designed to make the
Philippine tax system the most equitable, efficient and competitive in the region. This edition of the
Philippines Economic Update includes a special focus section, which examines critical policy issues related
to the government’s tax reform program. It evaluates the value-added tax and the excise tax on
petroleum. The design and administration of these taxes has important implications for fiscal equity,
economic efficiency and budgetary sustainability, and the focus section assesses each in terms of its
prospective impact on the government’s stated development objectives.

Part I: Recent Economic and Policy Developments

The Philippine economy grew 6.9 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2016, exceeding China’s
growth rate of 6.7 percent. Strong domestic demand drove overall growth, supported by an increase in
public spending in the run-up to the recent elections. Public spending rose by more than 10 percent during
the first half of 2016, as the government continued to implement its ambitious investment program.
Services and industry remained the primary engines of growth, while the lingering effects of El Niño further
diminished agricultural output. Meanwhile, anemic external demand continued to inhibit the performance
of the export sector.

1.1 Growth: A Robust Expansion Continues Despite a Weak External
Environment
1.      During the first half of 2016, as its major trading partners continued to struggle with an
uncertain recovery and a difficult rebalancing, the Philippines emerged as the strongest performer
among its East Asian peers. The Philippine economy expanded by 6.9 percent, year-on-year, in the first
six months of 2016, up from 5.5 percent in the first half of 2015. The country continues to defy global
trends, as growth in other emerging markets and developing countries remains subdued, while the
recovery among advanced economies has largely failed to meet expectations. Global trade growth
remains sluggish,1 and commodity prices have stabilized at low levels. Though capital flows appear to have
steadied, they experienced several bouts of volatility at the start of 2016 and in the wake of the UK’s vote
to leave the EU, commonly known as “Brexit.” Yet despite this challenging global environment, surging
domestic demand and high rates of capital investment drove the continued expansion of the Philippine
economy, enabling it to outpace all of its major regional peers—including China, Vietnam, Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia and Mongolia—during the first half of the year.

2.      Robust capital formation, bolstered by pre-election investment frontloading, played a key role
in the recent expansion. Capital formation was the principal engine of growth in the first six months of
2016, followed closely by private consumption (Figure 1). As in previous election years, businesses
frontloaded investment in the first two quarters to hedge against political uncertainties. The rate of capital
formation rose from 16.7 percent in the first half of 2015 to 27.1 percent in the first half of 2016.
Investment in durable equipment expanded by 41.1 percent, while investment in construction grew by
13.6 percent. This resulted in the Philippines catching up to the investment levels in the region.2 Whether
this increase in investment will generate significant consumption spillovers in subsequent quarters
remains uncertain, as investments in construction and durable equipment tend to primarily benefit
owners of land and capital, real estate managers and construction workers, with a more modest impact
on the middle-income households that have the highest propensity to consume.

3.       Private consumption grew at its fastest pace since 2012, as households benefitted from low
inflation and interest rates, strong remittances inflows and a high degree of economic confidence.
Household consumption grew by 7.2 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2016. Inflation averaged
just 1.3 percent, boosting real household purchasing power, while low interest rates supported an
expansion in consumer lending. Strong remittance inflows further bolstered household consumption,3 as
the share of overseas workers continued to increase. A healthy job market, stable commodity prices,
sufficient government social assistance and enthusiasm for the new government dramatically increased
consumer confidence, and survey data from the second quarter of 2016 showed Filipino consumers to be
the most optimistic in the world.4




1 The WTO recently lowered its 2016 forecast for global merchandise trade growth to 1.7 percent. See: WTO (2016).
2 In the first half of the year, Philippine gross fixed investment reached 23.7 percent of GDP, higher than the average of 20.3
percent in 2010-2015. In comparison, the six-year average is 24.8 percent of GDP in Malaysia, 25.3 percent in Thailand, and 32.1
percent in Indonesia.
3 According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ Consumer Expectations Survey for the first and second quarters of 2016 , 97 percent

of surveyed households with OFWs used remittances for food and other household consumption, 41 percent reported using
remittances to increase savings, and only 5.5 percent reported using remittances for investment.

4.       However, the global economic recovery remains weaker than expected, and net exports have
contributed negatively to growth for six consecutive quarters.5 Exports expanded by 7.0 percent, year-
on-year, in the first half of 2016, while imports grew by 19.9 percent. Exports of electronic components,
which comprised more than half of total merchandise exports, grew by 8.3 percent, year-on-year, during
the first half of 2016, up from 16.7 percent in the same period of 2015. The combination of a sluggish
recovery among advanced economies and China’s ongoing economic rebalancing continue to dampen
demand for Philippine manufactures, which largely explains the disappointing performance of exports.
Key agricultural exports remained weak, reflecting the poor overall output of the agriculture and fisheries
sector. Meanwhile, investments in capital goods and the purchase of intermediate inputs drove import
growth. Imports of office, electrical and telecommunications equipment rose as local industries expanded
their productive capacity, while imported electronic components and semiconductors were used to
assemble electronics for export as part of a regional value chain.

5.      On the production side, the service sector continued to thrive, and its growth rate accelerated
from 2015. The service sector, which accounts for three-fifths of total economic output, grew by 8.0
percent, year-on-year, contributing 4.2 percentage points to overall growth in the first half of 2016 (Figure
2). Robust domestic consumption fueled the country’s wholesale and retail trade, which expanded by 8.3
percent, while high domestic liquidity and rising demand for property supported growth in the finance
and real estate subsectors.6 The rapid expansion of business services reflects the continued development

of the country’s information technology and business-process outsourcing (IT-BPO) industry, which is
expected to create 225,000 new jobs and generate US$25 billion in revenue in 2016.7 The IT-BPO industry
has also had considerable spillover effects on other sectors such as trade, real estate and construction.

6.      Manufacturing output continued to grow despite anemic export demand, but low global
commodity prices caused the mining and quarrying sector to contract. Manufacturing grew by 7.2
percent in the first half of 2016, compared to just 5.3 percent in the previous year, pushing the overall
growth rate of the secondary sector to 7.9 percent. Strong domestic demand supported the growth of
manufacturing, while low oil prices reduced the cost of electricity8 and fuel. Other industrial subsectors
also expanded rapidly; construction grew by 11.6 percent, and electricity, gas, and water utilities grew by
9.8 percent. However, the mining and quarrying subsector contracted by 0.7 percent, largely due to a
reduction in nickel ore output caused by low global commodity prices.9

7.      The agricultural sector contracted by 3.3 percent in the first half of the year due to the lingering
effects of El Niño, which diminished crop production by 5.6 percent and fishery output by 5.9 percent.
Decades of underinvestment have contributed to both the low productivity of the agricultural sector and
its vulnerability to extreme weather conditions. Formal lending to the sector remains low at just 4.0
percent of the total bank lending portfolio. Domestic credit constraints are exacerbated by the near-total
absence of foreign investment in the sector over the past three years.

1.2 Financial Markets and Monetary Policy: Accommodative Financial and
Monetary Conditions are Facilitating Growth
8.      Strong credit growth, especially lending to the real estate and construction sectors and to
households, has contributed to the ongoing economic expansion. The credit-to-GDP ratio gradually
increased to 45.7 percent in mid-2016, reflecting abundant domestic liquidity. But while the credit-to-
GDP ratio has increased steadily over the past five years, it remains below the levels of peer countries,
suggesting that the credit supply has room for further growth.

9.       The composition of bank lending portfolios reflects the structure of the economy and recent
sectoral growth dynamics. Together, real estate, construction and household consumption accounted for
one-third of outstanding loans (Figure 3). Salary loans increased by 47.0 percent, year-on-year, in the first
half of 2016, and motor vehicle loans rose by 33.4 percent, though each began from a low base. Lending
to priority sectors such as agriculture, however, remained weak despite mandatory targets (Box 1). After
contracting through most of 2015 and 2016 (Figure 4), lending to the agricultural sector represented just
3.3 percent of total bank loans in June 2016. Overall, the extended period of strong nominal loan growth
would appear to justify the central bank’s continued focus on enhanced risk management.

percent, while core inflation averaged 1.7 percent.
Rising food prices pushed the headline inflation rate
from 0.8 percent in July 2015 to 1.9 percent in July
2016, as an increase in meat, vegetables and sugar
prices more than offset a decline in the price of rice
caused by a strong harvest and low import prices. The
continuing slump in global crude oil prices eased
inflationary pressures, and core inflation remained
broadly stable at 1.9 percent between July 2015 and
July 2016. Overall inflation levels remained below the
central bank’s 2-4 percent target band. Faced with low
inflation the central bank further loosened its

to roughly 12 percent in the first quarter and 14 percent in the second quarter of 2016, year-on-year.




10The lower key policy rate coincided with the shift to the Interest Rate Corridor (IRC) system. The central bank has stated that
the IRC reforms were primarily operational in nature and were not intended to materially affect prevailing monetary policy
settings upon implementation. Inflation indicators for August indicate increasing pressure from core inflation, leaving little room
for further monetary loosening.

                                           Box 1. Mandatory Lending Targets
Philippine law sets mandatory targets for lending to the agricultural sector and to micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs), with the objective of improving access to finance in these underserved sectors. Republic Act 10000, known as the
Agri-Agra Law,11 requires that all banks allocate 25 percent of their total loanable funds to borrowers in the agriculture and
fisheries sector, and at least 10 percent of loanable funds must be devoted to beneficiaries of agrarian reform programs.
Republic Act 9501, the so-called “Magna Carta for MSMEs,”12 requires that all banks allocate at least 8 percent of their loan
portfolio to micro and small enterprises and at least 2 percent to medium enterprises.
An analysis of bank compliance with mandatory lending targets reveals that the banking system as a whole has struggled
to expand lending to MSMEs and the agricultural sector. Over the past five years lending to micro and small enterprises grew
by an average of 3 percent per year, and lending to medium enterprises grew by 13 percent, while lending to agriculture
declined. At the same time, the total lending portfolio expanded at an average rate of 25 percent annually. Despite the lending
targets, the pace of credit growth in priority sectors was significantly lower than that of the overall lending portfolio. The
Philippine experience with lending targets is not unique, and the international evidence reveals that similar targets are
frequently ineffective.
Lending to the agricultural sector and MSMEs, especially micro and small firms, is inherently risky and requires a specialized
approach to product development and risk management. Mandating that all lenders allocate a given share of their total loans
to targeted firms and sectors does not necessarily create incentives for new specialized lenders to enter the market or for
banks that already lend to targeted borrowers to expand their operations. The authorities could better leverage specialization
by allowing lenders that focus on MSMEs or the agricultural sector to “trade” their excess loans to more traditional lenders.

 Market dynamics are further undermining banks’ ability to meet agricultural lending targets. The declining share of
 agricultural lending across the financial system at least partially reflects decreasing demand due to the sector’s low growth
 rate. Accelerating growth in agriculture and among MSMEs will require addressing structural obstacles as well as financial
 constraints. When well designed and properly managed, alternative risk-mitigation instruments such as guarantees and
 insurance have proven effective. While the Philippines has a number of institutions dedicated to providing such guarantees
 and insurance products for MSMEs and agricultural producers, they will not be able to fulfill their potential unless all
 elements of the financial system—including credit information, collateral registration, contract enforcement, equity
 financing and risk-mitigation mechanisms—can be more fully developed.

The Philippine financial system remains stable and well capitalized. The share of nonperforming loans
declined from 2.4 percent of total loans in June 2015 to 2.2 percent in June 2016. Philippine banks are
well capitalized, and at 16.0 percent the capital-adequacy ratio is well above the 10 percent regulatory
minimum set by the central bank. Total outstanding loans reached 6.8 trillion Philippine pesos (PHP) in
June 2016, a 16.0 percent year-on-year increase driven by the surging demand of a growing economy. In
addition, banks’ return on equity remained stable at 10.0 percent in June 2016, while the share of interest
income to total operating income increased from 70.0 to 74.0 percent as the growth of non-interest
income slowed. Meanwhile, net interest margins remained unchanged at 3.3 percent.

1.3 Exchange-Rate Dynamics and the External Sector: International Reserves
Are at a Record High Despite a Trade Deficit
11.     The Philippine peso continued to weaken in the first nine months of 2016 as the ongoing US
economic recovery heightened anticipation regarding the normalization of US interest rates. Month-on-
month exchange-rate movements fluctuated from PHP/US$47.5 at the beginning of the year to
PHP/US$46.3 in April, and the peso’s value declined again in July. Previous episodes of volatility reflected
unstable oil prices, a shift to a more accommodative monetary policy in Japan, the outcome of the UK’s
“Brexit” referendum and pre-election uncertainty. The peso continued to depreciate after the election
and in August, the peso depreciated by 1.2 percent, year-on-year, while the real effective exchange rate
depreciated by 3.6 percent in the same period. In September its lowest level in seven years, by the
time this report went to press, the peso had depreciated by 3.2 percent year-on-year. The peso’s
general weakening is likely due to the slowly rebounding US economy and the pending normalization of
US interest rates. Despite the weaker peso, international demand for Philippine exports remained modest
as China’s economic rebalancing, coupled with slow growth among major advanced economies, continued
to dampen global merchandise trade (Box 2).
12.    Although the trade deficit widened, the balance of payments (BOP) remained in surplus. The
BOP continued to be in surplus amounting to US$634 million in the first half of 2016, albeit lower than the

current-account balance, which has been in deficit since January. Rising service exports, mainly in the IT-
BPO and tourism industries, and robust remittances partially offset the poor performance of merchandise
exports. Sustained demand for skilled Filipino workers in overseas labor markets continues to generate
strong and stable remittance inflows. However, the growth of new hires abroad decreased in the first six
months of the year, with a precipitous 55.6 percent year-on-year drop in sea-based new hires outpacing
a slight 0.9 percent year-on-year increase in land-based new hires. 13

 Net incurrence of liabilities refers to net foreign direct investment to the Philippines.

 The term "Net unclassified items" is a balancing figure. There are two methods of computing the BOP position: the first approach uses
the change in net international reserves due to transactions, while the second approach computes the sum balances of the current
account, capital account less financial account. The two measures do not necessarily tally. The BSP uses the first approach to
determine the overall BOP position.

13.      The Philippines registered a US$0.2 billion net inflow in both the financial and capital accounts
in the first half of the year. This is a reversal from the US$1.5 billion net outflows recorded in the same
period last year, driven by strong direct investment as net FDI inflows doubled to US$4.2 billion in January-
June compared to the same period a year ago. Seventy percent of new FDI went to the financial sector,
largely a result of the full liberalization of the country’s banking industry, and 12.3 percent to the real
estate and construction sectors (Figure 9). The country continues to enjoy investment grade ratings from
all three major credit rating agencies.14 Despite this strong performance, FDI in the Philippines remains
among the lowest in the region, as the country’s long foreign investment negative list has limited FDI


13 Moving forward,   the softer demand for overseas Filipino workers from the Middle East amidst low oil prices, and the de-risking
activities in foreign banks remain a risk for the sustained growth of remittances in 2016. These risks were discussed in the April
2016 edition of the Philippines Economic Update.
14 Standard & Poor maintained the country’s BBB Stable long-term sovereign credit rating on September, 2016. In addition, Fitch

Ratings currently rates the Philippines as BBB-positive investment grade and Moody’s Investor Service rates the Philippines as
Baa2 stable investment grade.

coupled with lower net repayment of their liabilities.
14.      By midyear the BOP surplus had pushed gross international reserves (GIR) to an all-time high.
GIR reached a record US$85.3 billion at end-June, equivalent to 10.4 months of goods imports. Roughly
85 percent of GIR are in the form of foreign investment, 10 percent are in gold, and the balance are in
various foreign currencies, Special Drawing Rights and reserves positions at the IMF. The volume of GIR
grew by 5.8 percent, year-on-year, from US$80.6 billion in June 2015 to US$85.3 billion in June 2016. This
stands in stark contrast to 2014 and 2015, when the volume of GIR remained in a narrow band around
US$80 billion (Figure 10). Because it serves as a vital buffer against external shocks, the rising stock of GIR
is an important indication of robust economic fundamentals

     Box 2. The Poor Performance of Global Merchandise Trade and the Resilience of Service Exports
Low international commodity prices, China’s shift towards a slower but more sustainable growth path, and an anemic
recovery among advanced economies continue to undermine the growth of global merchandise trade. The trade slowdown
has reflected a combination of structural and cyclical headwinds, with the latter accounting for about two-thirds of the
observed deceleration in global trade last year. 15 Lower commodity prices have resulted in falling real incomes and sharp
currency depreciations among commodity exporters, substantially reducing their merchandise imports. This import
contraction has been particularly pronounced in Brazil and Russia, but a general slowdown has been observed across most
commodity exporters. Since commodity exporters purchase about 20 percent of the exports produced by other emerging
markets and developing economies, falling commodity prices have also had an adverse impact on non-commodity exporters.
Meanwhile, China’s economic rebalancing has reduced its demand for industrial commodities and intermediate goods.

Subdued industrial activity and low rates of capital investment in the manufacturing sectors in the US and euro zone
compounded this trend. Feeble global investment— reflecting mediocre growth, deleveraging pressures in advanced
economies, and a maturing credit cycle in EMDEs—could continue to cap the growth of goods trade throughout 2016.
The global trade in services appears to be more resilient to low oil prices than the merchandise trade, as it is more closely
linked to consumer spending and income growth among major oil importers. The services trade now accounts for one-fifth
of the total global trade volume and half of global trade value-addition.16 While barriers to the services trade have fallen
globally, important obstacles remain in many smaller economies.17 Over time, the share of services in global trade is expected
to continue to increase, especially IT-BPO and other IT-based sectors.18
Despite the resilience of services, global trade growth is expected to remain weak in 2016 . Following a pattern of repeated
and significant downward revisions, global trade forecasts for 2016-17 have been lowered once again,19 reflecting evidence
of a deteriorating relationship between global trade and economic activity. After growing roughly in line with global economic
output in 2015, global trade growth is expected to marginally outperform global economic growth during the forecast period.
Over the medium term, maturing supply chains, slowing trade liberalization and persistent weakness in global investment
are expected to hinder global trade growth. Lingering weaknesses in the global merchandise trade diminish the scope for
productivity gains through specialization and the diffusion of technologies in global value chains. 20 This process is expected
to cause global trade growth to fall back in line with global economic growth. A shift from truly global supply chains to regional
ones could accelerate this process.21

1.4 Fiscal Policy: The New Administration Attempts to Maintain Fiscal
Sustainability while Implementing an Ambitious Spending Program
15.      The government’s fiscal balance swung into deficit in the first half of the year, as rising
expenditures outpaced revenue growth. A surge in election-related spending, combined with efforts to
improve budget execution, caused public expenditures to accelerate in the first half of 2016.22 This caused
the budget surplus of PHP14 billion (or 0.2 percent of GDP) recorded in June 2015 to plunge to a deficit of
PHP120 billion (or 1.7 percent of GDP) by June 2016, though it remained below the statutory deficit ceiling
of 2.0 percent of GDP. Domestic borrowing financed 94.4 percent of the budget deficit, and total financing
shot to PHP110.3 billion, seven times the level recorded in mid-2015 (Figure 15). Nevertheless, rapid GDP
growth caused the public debt burden to decline from 44.8 of GDP percent in June 2015 to 43.0 percent
in June 2016 (Table 2).

16.      As public spending increased in the first half of 2016, so did revenue collection. Public spending
rose by 14.0 percent in the first half of the year to PHP1.1 trillion, or 17.8 percent of GDP (Figure 16).
Infrastructure spending rapidly accelerated as the government frontloaded investment expenditures in
order to comply with a ban on public spending immediately before elections.23 Nevertheless, by mid-2016
the authorities had executed just 11.9 percent of the annual budget. Improvements in revenue collection
boosted total public revenue by 0.7 percentage points to 14.3 percent of GDP in the first six months of
2016. Economic growth and enhanced tax administration caused tax revenues to rise by 10.0 percent,
year-on-year,24 without any increase in tax rates or other policy changes. Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)
collections increased by 11.0 percent, while Bureau of Customs (BOC) collections increased by 6.7 percent.
In an effort to improve the efficiency of the BOC the government passed Republic Act (RA) 10863, also
known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act, in May 2016.25
17.     The new administration submitted its proposed budget to the legislature on August 15 th,
shedding new light on the government’s policy agenda. The draft budget lays out the government’s fiscal
policy priorities for 2017 and beyond. It calls for raising the deficit ceiling from 2.0 to 3.0 percent of GDP
from 2017 to 2022, in order to allow for increased spending on infrastructure, social services and rural
development as part of an effort to promote more inclusive growth (Box 3). Budget hearings began on

election except for: (a) maintenance of existing public works projects, (b) work executed through private contracts, (c) project
planning and preparations that do not include actual construction, and (d) emergency response and disaster relief projects.
24 Upgraded IT systems and improved business processes significantly boosted the collection efficiency of the BIR.
25 The new legislation is designed to modernize customs laws, rules and procedures in order to enhance the efficiency and

transparency of the BOC.

26th. The House of Representatives is expected to complete its third and final debate by the third week of
October and then pass the draft budget to the Senate.26 If the approved House and Senate versions differ,
a bicameral conference committee will be convened for deliberation, and President Duterte is expected
to sign the new budget into law by December.

                                                       Box 3. The Duterte Administration’s Inaugural Budget
 The proposed 2017 budget reflects the new government’s 10-point socioeconomic agenda. The proposed PHP3.35 trillion
 budget would increase spending by 11.6 percent over the 2016 budget in an effort to alleviate binding constraints on the
 creation of high-quality jobs. The proposed budget would increase infrastructure investment to 5.4 percent of GDP in order
 to address infrastructure bottlenecks and enhance connectivity between the country’s wealthier and poorer areas. Agriculture
 and rural development are a major expenditure priority, as the government is striving to modernize the agricultural sector
 and foster inclusive rural development. The budget also calls for boosting education and health spending from a combined 4.7
 percent of GDP to 5.3 percent. The increased education budget would finance the construction of 37,500 new classrooms, the
 hiring of an additional 53,831 teachers and the provision of private-school scholarships to 2.7 million students.
 The Duterte administration’s emphasis on the rule of law is underscored by a large proposed expansion in the budget for
 the police, the military and the justice system. The budget proposal includes a 24.6 percent increase in spending on the
 Philippine National Police and a 15 percent increase in spending on the Armed Forces of the Philippines
 In addition to its short-term budgetary priorities, the new government has also outlined its medium-term fiscal plan. The
 most significant departure from the previous administration is the proposed increase in the deficit ceiling to 3 percent of GDP,
 which the administration regards as sustainable in the medium term. In a recent budget address President Duterte stated that
 the higher deficit limit will allow the government to continue to increase spending on infrastructure, rural development and
 social services. In parallel with its planned expenditure increases the government has launched an initiative to reform the tax
 system by increasing tax collections, enhancing systemic efficiency and promoting fiscal equity. The government expects these
 measures to boost tax revenue from a projected 14.5 percent of GDP in 2017 to 16.1 percent in 2018.

1.5 Employment and Poverty: Progress Continues, but Unresolved Constraints
Limit Gains in Critical Areas
18.     Robust economic growth and an expansionary fiscal policy accelerated job creation in 2016, but
persistently high rates of underemployment remain a key challenge. In the second quarter of 2016 the
service sector continued to lead net job generation (1.4 million), followed by industry (0.8 million);
meanwhile, the agricultural sector continued to post significant job losses (-1.5 million). Strong and
sustained economic growth has caused the unemployment rate to decline steadily over the past decade,
from about 8 percent in 2015 to just 6 percent in the first half of 2016 (Figure 17). However, the quality
of employment remains limited. In the first six months of 2016 the underemployment rate increased by
1.1 percentage points, year-on-year, to 19.0 percent, broadly in line with its decade average (Figure 18).
The persistence of high rates of underemployment despite years of robust growth highlights important
structural issues in the labor market. In particular, the pervasiveness of irregular employment prevents
workers from reaping the full benefits of economic growth (Box 4).

19.      Rising nonagricultural household income and the government’s social protection programs
continue to improve the welfare of the poor. Recent estimates indicate that the extreme poverty rate
gradually declined between 2012 and 2015, as real household income steadily increased. While a series
of natural disasters, including a record number of typhoons, undermined these gains, social protection
programs were able to mitigate the damage to household welfare. The extreme poverty rate, measured
at the international poverty line of US$1.90 per day in 2011 purchasing-power parity terms, fell from 10.6
percent in 2012 to 8.4 percent in 2015. The decrease in extreme poverty in recent years was driven in part
by the country’s conditional cash transfer program, which accelerated income growth among the poorest
households.

20.       Perception-based survey data indicate that poverty continued to decline during the first half of
2016. Perception-based survey data can provide an early indication of poverty trends that complements
official estimates (Box 5). In the first six months of the year, self-rated poverty and self-rated food poverty
data from the Social Weather Station revealed continued progress toward more inclusive growth. Self-
rated poverty at the household level declined by 5.5 percentage points to 45.5 percent of the population,
year-on-year, while 35 percent of the population rated themselves as food poor, the lowest share in over
five years.

                                    Box 4. The Challenge of Irregular Employment
 Irregular employment is increasingly common in the Philippines. According to the most recent Labor Force Survey about 25
 percent of workers in the formal private sector were employed on an irregular basis in 2014, and there is evidence that this
 share has increased substantially in recent years. 27 While some firms use temporary contracts to hire seasonal or short-term
 workers, the pervasiveness of these contracts reflects a substantial gap in the employment benefits and protections afforded
 to temporary and permanent employees. Temporary contracts allow employers to hire workers without providing the benefits
 that are due to a permanent employee, and to terminate workers without incurring the administrative and monetary costs
 involved in the formal termination process.
 Although temporary contracts, subcontracting and other forms of employment are legal and may serve a legitimate purpose
 in principle, in practice they are frequently abused. For example, some firms terminate and then rehire the same worker
 every five months, a practice known as “5-5-5,” in order to circumvent the Labor Code’s provisions on employment security.
 Similarly, “labor-only subcontracting” allows employers to evade the requirements of regular employment contracts, including
 employee benefits and employment protections. In particular, the high cost of terminating permanent contracts gives
 employers a strong incentive to use fixed-term, project-based or seasonal contracts, which are much easier and cheaper to
 terminate.28
 The use of temporary contracts contributes to a bifurcated labor market, in which secure permanent jobs exist alongside
 precarious temporary jobs. In the Philippine labor market, workers doing similar jobs often receive very different levels of
 benefits and job security, which is inefficient from both a social and an economic perspective. Temporary workers, whose
 future employment is highly uncertain, are less likely to invest in job-specific skills. For the same reason, employers are also
 less likely to invest in the skills of temporary workers. As a result, pervasive irregular employment tends to hinder human
 capital formation and reduce labor productivity.
 Policymakers can limit the abuse of temporary contracts either by strengthening the enforcement of existing regulations or
 by reforming those regulations to alter employer incentives. While tighter enforcement could marginally reduce the
 frequency of irregular contracts, this strategy would be costly and difficult to implement effectively. Indeed, the incidence of
 irregular employment is currently rising in OECD countries despite efforts to curb it.29 Alternatively, policymakers could
 attempt to narrow the cost gap between permanent and temporary contracts. This could be achieved through regulatory
 reforms designed to reduce the costs of permanent contracts, increase the costs of temporary contracts, or a combination of
 both.30
 A more radical approach would be to introduce a single employment contract (SEC) in order to eliminate the division
 between permanent and temporary employment. Under an SEC, all contracts are be open-ended, but the administrative
 procedures governing termination are relatively relaxed; instead, employment protection is provided via severance pay, the
 amount of which increases with job tenure. Legal recourse is limited to cases of discrimination or violations of worker rights.31
 In the Philippines an SEC would increase protections for irregular workers, but it would reduce protections for regular workers.
 From the employer’s perspective, an SEC would be more flexible than a regular permanent contract, but less flexible and more
 costly than the current range of temporary contracts. For these reasons, introducing an SEC could be an effective means of
 achieving the government’s goal of “crafting a set of rules and regulations that are more holistic in orientation and at the same
 time more easily implementable and enforceable.”32

                                      Box 5. Perception-Based Poverty Measures
 The Philippine Statistics Authority has released official poverty estimates from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey
 (FIES) every three years since 1988, and it has produced first-semester estimates using the Poverty Indicators Survey each
 year since 2013. Nevertheless, the timeliness of poverty data has long posed a significant challenge to poverty research.
 Moreover, the official estimates have undergone multiple methodological revisions, which limit time-series analysis. In this
 context, alternative estimation measures can help close gaps in the data and provide important complementary information
 on the evolution of poverty trends.
 Surveys that focus on self-rated monetary and food poverty can augment official poverty estimates by providing a
 qualitative perspective that reflects the experience of poor households. Even the most well-designed poverty line is
 ultimately an arbitrary number, and households that endure the externalities of economic growth but have limited access to
 its benefits may experience changes in subjective poverty that cannot be captured by official statistics. 33 In the Philippines,
 the Social Weather Station, an international survey firm based in the Netherlands, has released self-rated poverty estimates
 since 1983. Its monetary-poverty estimates have been published quarterly since 1992, and its food-poverty estimates have
 been published quarterly since 1998. The frequency of the data allows for a detailed qualitative analysis of poverty trends in
 the Philippines.
 However, perception-based, self-rated poverty measures are subject to their own unique caveats. The survey methodology
 for establishing self-rated poverty is limited and requires additional questions to validate its findings. 34 Moreover, poverty is
 measured subjectively by the survey respondent (i.e. the head of household) and may not reflect the perceptions of the
 household as a whole. Nevertheless, the timeliness and frequency of self-rated surveys can provide early indications of
 emerging poverty dynamics and enable a more accurate analysis of long-term trends.

measures and suggest a hybrid approach.

Part II: Outlook and Risks

The Philippines’ short-term growth prospects remain positive despite a number of medium-term risks and
policy challenges. The GDP growth rate is projected at 6.4 percent in 2016, and while the World Bank
expects growth to ease slightly to 6.2 percent in 2017 and 2018, this is a conservative forecast with
significant upside risks. Meanwhile, the poverty rate is projected to decline further as rapid economic
growth boosts real household income. The external environment is expected to gradually improve, but
short-term policy uncertainty during the transition to the new political administration and capacity
constraints on the execution of public infrastructure projects are expected to slow economy-wide growth.
Swift action to address either or both of these risks could accelerate growth over the near term.

2.1 Growth Outlook: Prospects are Optimistic, with Risks Tilted to the Upside
21.     The Philippines’ growth outlook is positive and includes significant upside risks. The World Bank
projects real GDP growth rates of 6.4 percent in 2016 and 6.2 percent in 2017 and 2018 (Figure 19). These
growth projections remain unchanged from the April 2016 edition of the Philippines Economic Update,
which incorporated the potential impact of the recent election and included the assumption that public
expenditures would rise through 2018. However, the current forecast assumes that capacity limitations
may slow the implementation of large-scale public infrastructure projects, and that it could take longer to
overcome these obstacles. Meanwhile, lingering uncertainty regarding the new administration’s reform
agenda will lead to caution among investors and consumers. However, if the government is able to
successfully address these challenges, growth could exceed the rate of 6.2 percent projected for 2017-
2018. These challenges notwithstanding, the Philippine economy continues to benefit from strong
macroeconomic fundamentals and is projected to remain among East Asia’s top growth performers over
the short-to-medium term (Figure 20).

 Figure 19. The annual GDP growth rate is Figure 20. …and the Philippines is expected to
 projected to exceed 6 percent from 2016 through remain among East Asia’s fastest-growing
 2018…                                           economies.

22.      Our growth projection assumes that the government will maintain an expansionary fiscal
stance. The government’s plan to raise public investment is a good strategy to close the investment gap
to other East Asian countries. While infrastructure spending is expected to accelerate in the next two
years, it is challenging to reach the PHP860.7 billion allocated in the 2017 budget—which would represent
a 13.8 percent increase over 2016—unless the government is able to rapidly expand its implementation
capacity. However, if the new administration is able to remove key implementation bottlenecks, the rate
of gross capital formation could exceed the current forecasts of 9.0 percent in 2017 and 8.3 percent in
2018, leading to higher overall growth rates. Together with the 2017 budget proposal, the new
administration announced PHP7 trillion in new infrastructure spending over 2017-2022. The rollout of
infrastructure spending would be partly accelerated through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. In
2017 the government plans to increase the infrastructure budget to PHP860.7 billion, up 14 percent from
2016. While this would push the fiscal deficit to 2.7 percent in 2016 and 3.0 percent in subsequent years,

the increase in the projected GDP growth rate would lower the debt-to-GDP ratio from 44.8 percent in
2015 to 42.6 percent in 2016, with further declines in 2017 and 2018.

23.      The growth projection reflects an accommodative monetary policy in a context of slowly rising
inflation. The inflation rate is expected to average 2 percent in 2016 before rising to 2.5 percent in 2017
and 3.0 percent in 2018, well within the central bank’s target range of 2-4 percent. Rebounding oil prices
are expected to boost headline inflation in the second half of 2017. Crude oil prices are projected to level
off at US$39.7 per barrel this year before rising to US$53.2 per barrel in 2017 and US$59.9 per barrel in
2018. Meanwhile, a planned increase in the wages of military personnel and teachers, combined with the
anticipated acceleration of public investment, is expected to intensify inflationary pressure on the supply
side.

24.      The growth forecasts of 6.4 percent for 2016 and 6.2 percent for 2017 assume that economic
activity will normalize following the fiscal stimulus caused by the national election. After hitting 6.9
percent during the first half of the year, the GDP growth rate is expected to decline from the second half
of 2016 through 2017. As public and private investment return to equilibrium, the contribution of gross
capital formation to growth is expected to diminish. Similar trends were observed during the 2013 and
2010 elections; policy uncertainty prompted firms to accelerate investment in the run-up to the election,
while the government frontloaded public expenditures in order to comply with the ban on pre-election
spending. As a degree of policy uncertainty is expected to persist during the transition to the new
administration, no new major private investments are anticipated over the next 6-12 months.

25.      Over the medium term the government’s ability to accelerate infrastructure investment will
have a major impact on the economy’s growth trajectory. While consumption is likely to remain a
mainstay of future growth, a sustained increase in capital formation driven by public infrastructure
investment would accelerate growth on the supply side. In 2017 40 percent of the planned infrastructure
budget will be allocated to the road network, railways, seaports and airports. While not all of these
infrastructure investments are likely to be executed in the proposed timeframe, rising public investment
levels could have both a direct impact on growth and important multiplier effects on the productivity of

                                                     19
key sectors, including industry, real estate and construction, and tourism. Gross capital formation is
expected to be the single largest contributor to growth over the 2016-18 period. Slowing growth in 2017
and 2018 will result in part from base effects, as growth rates in 2015 and 2016 were already very high.
However, if the government is able to fully implement all planned infrastructure projects, rates of gross
capital formation could be even higher than anticipated, boosting overall growth in 2017 and 2018.

                                          Box 6. The Global Economic Outlook
Global growth prospects have weakened over the past six months . The World Bank recently revised its global economic
growth forecast for 2016 downward to 2.3 percent. Emerging markets and developing economies are facing stronger
headwinds due to anemic growth among advanced economies, persistently low commodity prices, and lackluster global trade
and capital flows. Commodity exporters continue to struggle to adjust to the protracted slump in global prices, while
commodity importers are showing greater resilience to headwinds. However, low energy prices have delivered a surprisingly
modest growth windfall. The global growth rate is projected to gradually accelerate to 2.9 percent by 2018 as commodity
prices stabilize (Table 4).
Downside risks to the global outlook have intensified. Key sources of risk include deteriorating economic conditions among
major commodity exporters, a weaker-than-expected recovery among advanced economies, rising private-sector debt levels
in some large emerging markets, and heightened policy and geopolitical uncertainties. While the available policy space for
monetary and fiscal stimulus is narrow globally, structural reforms could boost growth in both the short and long term.
In an environment of weak growth, rising risks and limited policy buffers, growth-sustaining structural reforms are
increasingly urgent. Well-targeted structural reforms could boost aggregate demand, reduce macroeconomic vulnerabilities
and signal to investors that the authorities are committed to reinforcing strong fundamentals in support of long-term growth.
Greater investment in infrastructure, productivity-enhancing technology and human capital could complement and catalyze
this process. Structural reform and investment policies should aim to close public infrastructure gaps, encourage foreign
direct investment, build human capital, foster economic diversification and lower barriers to trade. While countries with
diminishing fiscal space may have a limited ability to finance investments in infrastructure and human capital, international
cooperation efforts could support expansionary fiscal policies in the event that large downside risks materialize, channeling
global resources into productive infrastructure and strengthening social safety nets in the most fragile economies.

26.     Domestic consumption is expected to remain the second-largest contributor to growth.
Although the share of consumption is diminishing relative to other growth components, it still represents
roughly two-thirds of total expenditures. Several factors are expected to support a robust increase in
consumption over the projection period. First, the ongoing economic expansion should continue to boost
the income of middle-class households, which have a high propensity to consume. The combined share
of lower middle-, middle-, and upper middle-income households grew from 44.6 percent of the population
in 2009 to 45.8 percent in 2012, and in recent years they have consistently accounted for about two-thirds




                                                                   20
of total household income.35 Second, while remittance inflows are gradually decelerating, they are
projected to remain relatively strong over the medium term, and employment prospects for the country’s
overseas workforce remain generally positive. Third, strong economic growth is expected to expand
domestic employment opportunities. As a result, consumption growth is likely to remain strong in 2016
before slowing moderately in 2017 and 2018 as inflation rates rise and remittance inflows level off.
27.      Net exports are unlikely to experience a major rebound in 2016 as global growth remains
lackluster, but the external environment is expected to improve gradually in 2017 and 2018. The poor
performance of net exports has been the most important drag on growth in recent years, with negative
contributions recorded in 2015 and projected for 2016 (Box 6). The World Bank recently lowered its global
growth forecast for 2016 from 2.5 percent to 2.3 percent. In 2017, however, global growth is projected to
rebound to 2.7 percent before reaching 2.9 percent in 2018. This is expected to boost demand for
Philippine exports and to gradually narrow the trade deficit despite strong domestic demand for imported
capital and consumer goods. Import growth is projected to remain robust in 2016, then decelerate in
2017-2018 due to base effects and a slowdown in capital-goods imports. By 2018 export growth is
expected to outpace import growth, narrowing the trade deficit.
28.       The service sector is expected to remain the key driver of output growth. Prospects for the
service sector are highly positive, with sectoral growth rates projected to reach 7.0 percent in 2016 and
6.8 percent over 2017-18. A burgeoning domestic middle class and remittances from overseas Filipino
workers are fueling the growth of real estate and construction, while economy-wide growth is supporting
robust demand for financial services. A combination of domestic financing and FDI is facilitating the
service sector’s growth. Over the past three years real estate and construction, wholesale and retail trade,
utilities, transportation and IT represented a combined average of 55 percent of the banking system’s
total loan portfolio. Meanwhile, finance and insurance firms were among the top targets of foreign
investment, receiving 56 percent of FDI in 2014, 34 percent in 2015 and 70 percent in the first half of 2016.
Banks are the largest issuers in the local-currency corporate bond market, accounting for 28 percent of
peso-denominated corporate bonds at end-March 2016. The IT-BPO industry enjoys particularly strong
growth prospects, with revenues expected to hit US$35 billion in 2018, surpassing the projected value of
remittances. While the IT-BPO industry continues to grow, the Philippines should strive to move into even
more sophisticated services such as knowledge-process outsourcing (KPO) (Box 7).
29.     Manufacturing growth is likely to slow unless the sector receives substantial new investments
in productive capacity. Since the nadir of the global financial crisis in 2009 the manufacturing sector has
steadily expanded, and its contribution to growth has been marginally higher in the post-crisis period
(Figure 21). Capacity utilization, however, is estimated at 83-84 percent, broadly unchanged since 2012.
Investment in durable equipment is rising, but from 2014 through the first half of 2016 transportation
equipment accounted for an average of 46.3 percent of sectoral investment, while specialized and general
industrial machinery accounted for 21.9 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively. Going forward, increased
investment in new equipment and facilities will be necessary to sustain the sector’s growth.
Growth prospects for the agriculture sector remain bleak due to a combination of chronic
underinvestment and intense vulnerability to weather-related shocks. Agriculture comprised just 8.5
percent of GDP during the first half of 2016, and the sector’s contribution to growth is minimal (Figure
22). However, agriculture employs a disproportionate share of the labor force, and domestic food
production has a significant influence on consumer price inflation. Nevertheless, both foreign investment
and bank lending to the sector have been low, and underinvestment has contributed to the sector’s

vulnerability to extreme weather conditions. Increasing agricultural productivity will be crucial for
boosting growth and also for essential for ensuring more inclusive growth. The structural constraints in
agriculture, such as land tenure issue and value chain weaknesses, are a medium-term reform agenda.

                                 Box 7. Moving up the Value Chain: from BPO to KPO
 Over the past decade and a half, the Philippines has emerged as one of the leaders in the global IT-BPO industry. Sectoral
 revenue has risen exponentially over the past decade, growing at an average annual rate of 30 percent between 2000 and
 2015 to reach US$22 billion. The IT-BPO industry is also among the leading contributors to job creation, and total sectoral
 employment increased from 138,000 in 2005 to about 1.03 million in 2014. Growth forecasts are highly optimistic: the IT-BPO
 industry is projected to generate US$25 billion in revenue in 2016, and direct employment is expected to reach 1.3 million.
 Moreover, IT-BPO has had sizeable positive spillover effects on other economic sectors. The industry’s total direct and indirect
 contribution to the growth of value-addition in services exports, real estate, construction, retail trade and telecommunications
 is estimated at around 10 percent of GDP. The Philippines currently ranks as the world’s top destination for voice support, a nd
 it has the potential to compete in a range of high-value-added, knowledge-based services in the future.
 However, the country’s IT-BPO industry faces long-term sustainability challenges stemming from international competition
 and technological progress. The Philippines’ IT-BPO industry generates 85 percent of its revenue from relatively routine
 cognitive tasks that are highly susceptible to automation. Low wages could slow the pace of automation, but are unlikely to
 halt it. As the global market for complex services grows, shifting production toward high-value, non-voice services such as KPO
 can promote the industry’s sustainability.
 There are important lessons to be learned from the experience of similar outsourcing destinations. India successfully
 diversified into high-value-added outsourcing services and is now the global leader in KPO, with a 63 percent global revenue
 share. With a highly skilled talent pool, relatively low-cost labor, well-developed IT infrastructure, and an enabling business
 environment, India was in a strong position to take advantage of the rising demand for more sophisticated outsourcing
 activities. The revenue generated by India’s KPO industry shot from just US$260 million in 2001 to an estimated US$15.2 billion
 in 2015 and is projected to reach a staggering US$55.5 billion in 2019.36 While India is expected to remain the global leader,
 Latin American and Asian economies have the potential to attract investment in KPO services by leveraging a relatively skilled,
 low-cost workforce and a generally favorable business climate.
 The Philippine government and the private sector recognize the opportunity to expand into KPO and other complex IT-BPO
 services, but a number of constraints are preventing the country from moving up the IT-BPO value chain. Foremost among
 these is the need to further develop the skills of the local workforce through improved education and job training. 37 In addition,
 the Philippines must continue to address key infrastructure gaps, especially in IT and telecommunications infrastructure, foster
 a more favorable business and investment climate, and forge public-private partnerships devoted to providing non-voice
 service training and skills development. Due to its cross-cutting nature, a successful transition to a more diversified and
 sophisticated IT-BPO industry will require a concerted effort involving the private sector, academia and the government.

2.2 Poverty and Shared Prosperity: Progress Continues, Supported by Robust
Growth and a Strong Social-Policy Framework
30.      Robust economy-wide growth, combined with the government’s stated commitment to an
inclusive development agenda, is expected to generate further gains in poverty reduction in the near
term (Table ). The decline in the poverty rate could be accelerated through greater investment in human
capital formation, with an emphasis on health, education and social protection services targeting the poor
and vulnerable (Figure 23). Poor households are highly concentrated in the agricultural sector, where
productivity increases could boost incomes and make growth more inclusive. Accomplishing this would
require a comprehensive rural development strategy, and formulating such a strategy is among the new
administration’s top policy priorities. The creation of more high-productivity jobs in other sectors would
also expand the distribution of the returns to growth.
31.      Improving labor-market conditions and planned investments in human capital are expected to
have a positive impact on poverty. The projected economic expansion over 2016-18 is expected to bolster
employment, while the country’s well-targeted conditional cash transfer program (Pantawid Pamilyang
Pilipino) should continue to shore-up consumption among poor households. The cash transfer program is
currently the third-largest in the world, with 4.2 million beneficiary households registered in 2015. It has
helped reduce short-term poverty by closing the income gap among beneficiaries by up to 7.4 percentage
points, enabling poor households to cover their basic needs. Going forward, sustained economic growth
combined with increased spending on health, education and social protection programs is projected by
the World Bank to reduce the extreme poverty rate from 10.6 percent in 2012 to 7.8 percent in 2016, 7.2
percent in 2017 and 6.7 percent in 2018.

2.3 Risks and Policy Challenges: The Government Must Maintain Adequate
Policy Space to Adapt to Rising Headwinds
32.      The Philippine economy appears well positioned to weather the headwinds generated by a
volatile external environment. Robust growth, low and stable inflation, a declining debt-to-GDP ratio,
sustained current-account surpluses, and ample international reserves all indicate a strong
macroeconomic position (Figure 24). The country’s abundant foreign-exchange reserves are adequate to
counter global shocks, and the government has enough fiscal space to expand domestic public spending.
Meanwhile, the country’s monetary position is sufficiently strong to accommodate an increase in global
interest rates.
33.      However, the challenging external environment continues to threaten an otherwise positive
economic outlook. The most important risks stem from trade and monetary-policy conditions. First,
adverse developments among the Philippines’ key trading partners could further dampen export growth.
Key sources of risk include a difficult recovery in Japan, slower-than-expected growth in the US and further
turbulence in the euro zone, as together these markets account for about 60 percent of Philippine exports.
Second, the anticipated normalization of US policy rates could increase financial market volatility, prompt
a reversal in capital flows and/or increase borrowing costs, all of which could have a negative impact on
the Philippine economy. The gap between policy rates in the Philippines and the US is currently narrow at
about 2.5 percent. The monetary-policy authorities must carefully account for the real risk of outflows
resulting from an increase in the US Federal Funds Rate, which could lead to higher borrowing costs,
slower growth in construction and real estate, and increased leverage among both households and firms.
The central bank has conveyed its policy commitment to use a mix of monetary policy tools to mitigate
external and domestic shocks.

EU represents about 13 percent of Philippine

Moreover, the share of remittances from the UK
has averaged 5.3 percent since 2010, though the
British labor market employs only 0.3 percent of all
overseas Filipino workers. The UK has been the
source of about 1.2 percent of total net FDI since

policy uncertainty. The new administration’s economic team has laid out a 10-point socioeconomic
agenda (Box 8). The new government has taken steps to reassure businesses and investors that the
continuity of existing macroeconomic policies will be maintained, including growth-supporting fiscal,
monetary and trade policies. Major structural reform initiatives are planned in the areas of tax policy and
administration, expenditure tracking, land-tenure security and constitutional restrictions on foreign asset
ownership. Nevertheless, as the details of these policies and their implementation strategies are still
under discussion, businesses are likely to maintain a cautious approach toward investment and expansion.
The government is currently consulting with stakeholders as part of the process for formulating the next
Philippine Development Plan, which should be finalized by the end of 2016. This plan is expected to further
clarify the government’s medium-term policy priorities. If the authorities are able to foster a climate of
strong policy credibility over the next 6-12 months, the country’s economic prospects could further
improve. This represents an important upside risk to the growth forecast.
36.      The new administration has already prioritized a range of revenue and expenditure reforms.
The government plans to increase expenditures by 12 percent per year from 2017 to 2019, which would
push total public spending from 16.8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 20.2 percent in 2019. To achieve this, the
government would need to raise public investment management capacity. Executing its far-reaching
public investment agenda will require the establishment of adequate procurement processes and project-
implementation safeguards. While public revenues have been steadily increasing, at their current growth
rate they will not be sufficient to finance the government’s ambitious expenditure agenda. The authorities
have therefore proposed a set of tax reforms designed to boost total revenues from 15.8 percent of GDP
in 2015 to 17.2 percent in 2019. In order to accomplish its fiscal-policy goals, the government must avoid
delays in the approval and implementation of these reforms. In the most optimistic scenario, in which the
tax reform package is approved and implemented on schedule and the medium-term budget is fully

executed, growth could exceed the current baseline projection of 6.2 percent in 2017 and 2018.38 This
represents a second upside risk to the growth forecast.
37.      The agricultural sector is highly sensitive to weather-related shocks, and this vulnerability poses
both direct risks to sectoral output and indirect risks to consumer-price inflation. Although the effects
of El Niño have already waned, the Philippine agricultural sector continues to face the threat of a La Niña
pattern toward the end of the year.39 This or other weather-related shocks could further damage
agricultural output, which would likely intensify food-price inflation unless the government moved quickly
to increase food imports. Anticipating this risk, the government has launched a comprehensive program
to help mitigate the effects of La Niña through measures designed to strengthen agricultural production,
enhance flood control and reduce disaster risk.40 In addition, the government has approved roughly one
million metric tons of rice imports to bolster the domestic food supply. The planned removal of
quantitative restrictions on rice imports by 2017 should reinforce the resilience of food prices.41

 2.   Instituting a progressive tax-reform program, boosting collection efficiency and indexing taxes to inflation as part of a
      package of tax legislation to be submitted to Congress by September;

      for attracting investment (e.g. the Davao model), and relaxing Constitutional restrictions on foreign ownership of assets
      other than land;

 7.   Investing in human-capital development by increasing health and education spending and promoting the expansion of
      skills training to meet the evolving labor demands of the private sector;
 8.   Promoting science, technology and the creative arts to accelerate innovation, build creative capacity, and promote
      sustainable and inclusive development;

      shocks; and

inclusiveness and foster high-quality job creation would intensify the impact of growth on poverty
reduction and shared prosperity. At its current growth rate of over 6 percent per year, per capita income

could double in a decade. However, maintaining an inclusive growth pattern requires an enduring
commitment to implementing structural reforms to encourage investment in industries and sectors that
create high-quality jobs. The government’s 10-point socioeconomic agenda calls for accelerating public
investment in infrastructure and social services, enhancing competition in key economic sectors, securing
property rights, and simplifying regulations to improve the ease of doing business in the Philippines.
39.      Its effect on competition will be a key measure of the reform agenda’s success. One of the
government’s most immediate policy challenges will be to ensure the effectiveness of the Philippine
Competition Commission, the country’s newly formed antitrust agency. The commission’s first case will
attract intense scrutiny, as it will likely set important legal and regulatory precedents for mergers and
acquisitions. The government will have to balance the commission’s mandate to uphold antitrust laws
with its goal of promoting the public interest.
40.    The passage of the government’s tax-reform agenda will present a second critical policy success.
The proposed reforms are designed to make the country’s tax system more equitable, efficient and
competitive, but their design features, implementation schedule and economic effects are highly
complex. As the success or failure of the government’s tax reforms may prove pivotal to the country’s
economic development, the second special focus section included in this edition of the Philippines
Economic Update offers an in-depth look at tax policy in the Philippines.

Part III: Increasing Tax Revenues Efficiently and Equitably42


The new administration aims to accelerate the creation of high-quality jobs through greater public
investment in infrastructure, education and healthcare. To finance this agenda, the authorities are
planning a comprehensive tax reform effort designed to make the Philippine tax system the most
equitable, efficient and competitive in the region. This special focus section examines critical policy issues
related to the government’s tax-reform program. It evaluates the design and administration of the value-
added tax and the excise tax on petroleum. These taxes have critical implications for fiscal equity, economic
efficiency and budgetary sustainability, as well as the achievement of the government’s stated
development objectives.

3.1 Introduction: The New Administration’s Tax Policy Agenda
41.      The recently elected government is in the process of launching an ambitious tax-reform
initiative designed to enhance fiscal equity and promote shared prosperity. The Philippine economy has
expanded rapidly for over a decade, yet the country’s impressive growth performance has had only a
limited impact on job creation and poverty reduction. The new government is attempting to shift the focus
of economic policy from ensuring macroeconomic stability to promoting shared prosperity. A combination
of expenditure rationalization, prudent debt management and strong tax administration has reinforced
the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals, and policymakers can take advantage of this period of
stability and growth to build a more equitable, efficient and inclusive revenue framework.
42.     Greater public spending, underpinned by improved revenue mobilization, will be necessary to
develop the physical and human capital required for broad-based growth. The authorities have
considerable scope to increase revenues through efficiency improvements in tax administration, without
the need to raise tax rates or establish new taxes.43 Between 2010 and 2013 tax-revenue collection
increased by about 1.2 percentage points of GDP due to a combination of improved tax administration
and continuously high growth. However, further improvements in tax administration could continue to
yield marginal revenue gains, but without deeper structural reforms enhanced administration is unlikely
to enable the government to reach its revenue target of 16 percent of GDP by 2020.
43.     To generate faster increases in tax revenue and ensure that the government can both achieve
and sustain its revenue-to-GDP target, the authorities are considering a comprehensive tax-reform
program. This program would proceed in several phases, and it would include both policy changes and
administrative reforms. Some elements of the reform agenda would focus on raising tax revenues by
strengthening collection efficiency and broadening the tax base, while others would concentrate on
enhancing fiscal equity by alleviating the tax burden on lower-income households (Box 9).
44.      Maintaining consistent political support for comprehensive tax reform will hinge on the public’s
perception that the quality of the tax administration is improving and that tax revenues are being well
spent. A successful reform process will require measures to strengthen the transparency and
accountability of the budget process and improve the structural efficacy of the nation’s revenue
institutions.44 The authorities have already taken steps to promote public trust in the revenue agencies
and reinforce the quality of their services.45




43 For instance, in 2013, the BIR announced a campaign to boost tax collection from self-employed professionals such as doctors
and lawyers. The government estimates that only about 403,000 out of 1.8 million self-employed professionals pay taxes in a
given year, and their average declared income is close to the minimum wage. The government believes that the successful
implementation of these reforms could boost tax revenues by as much as 2 percent of GDP.
44 Key transparency and accountability reforms include the passage of the Freedom of Information Bill, enhancing budget

preparation and reporting, measures to allow the public to track expenditure execution, the timely release of a tax-expenditure
statement, limitations on the use of lump-sum funds for large budget items, mandatory posting of procurement bids and awards
on government websites, and strengthening the role of the Audit Commission.
45 Simplifying tax procedures and processes could help build confidence in the efficiency of the revenue authority. Publishing the

net worth of top revenue officials on government websites could send a strong signal to the public that the revenue agencies are
committed to good governance. Strengthening the Audit Commission’s oversight of BIR and BOC activities and ensuring that they
adhere to their own audit rules could improve the accountability of the tax administration. Implementing Executive Order 38 of
1998, publishing BIR and BOC performance indicators on their websites, relaxing bank-secrecy laws in cases involving tax fraud,
and requiring all government agencies and selected private sector groups (e.g., utilities and professional associations) to share
their data with the BIR and BOC could further enhance public sector transparency. .


                                                               29
                             Box 9. The Government’s Proposed Tax Reform Package
 On September    26th
                    the government submitted the first of six tax reform packages to Congress in support of its inclusive
 growth strategy. The reform program has two overarching objectives: (i) to make the country’s tax system the most equitable,
 efficient and competitive in the region, and (ii) to generate sufficient revenue to finance the administration’s 10 -point
 socioeconomic development agenda. Each reform package will focus on a different area of tax policy and attempt to balance
 tradeoffs between revenue generation, economic efficiency and fiscal equity. These packages are part of a larger reform
 agenda that encompasses tax administration, good governance and budgetary reforms, as well as measures to simplify
 regulations, promote competition and enhance the business environment.
 If approved, the first reform package will be implemented in two phases. The first phase would consist of reforms to the
 personal income tax, the value-added tax (VAT), and oil and vehicle excise taxes. The country’s personal income tax brackets
 would be adjusted to reflect inflation, and its income tax rates, which are among the highest in the region, would be reduced.
 Reducing the coverage of VAT exemptions would offset the decline in income tax revenue. Meanwhile, the government would
 restructure the excise tax on personal automobiles and petroleum products, and one-quarter to one-third of the net revenue
 gain would be allocated to social protection programs such as conditional cash transfers, targeted electricity subsidies, direct
 discounts, expanded coverage of the national healthcare system (PhilHealth), and targeted subsidies to sectors that are
 adversely affected by higher petroleum prices. During the second phase a set of new surtaxes would be levied on unhealthy
 or socially harmful goods. These include taxes on sweetened drinks, which would be indexed to inflation, as well as higher
 excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol products, which would be introduced after the current “sin tax” matures.
 The third tax reform package would reduce corporate income taxes while rationalizing fiscal incentives. The proposed
 reforms would lower the corporate income tax rate and simplify its provisions to improve compliance. Revenue losses would
 be offset by the rationalization of fiscal incentives, which would become more transparent, targeted, and performance-based,
 and “sunset provisions” would be applied to existing incentives. The current 5 percent gross income tax rate would also be
 replaced by a reduced corporate income tax rate. Finally, VAT zero-rating would be strictly limited to direct exports, tax-credit
 certificates would be abolished, and all VAT refunds would be paid in cash.
 The fourth and fifth reform packages focus on property taxes and capital-gains tax. The proposed reforms would attempt to
 simplify property taxes to support a more competitive real estate market and improve the efficiency of land use. Key measures
 would include reducing the estate and donor’s tax rates, as well as the tax rate for land transactions. Revenue losses would
 be offset by the rationalization of property valuation, which would bring property values closer to market prices and require
 the systematic review and revision of property values every three years. The tax rate on interest earned on peso-denominated
 deposits and investments would be cut from 20 percent to 10 percent, and all other capital-gains taxes would harmonized
 with this rate to improve their progressivity.
 A sixth and final reform package would address other tax types, but the specific reforms that would be included are still
 under discussion. The government is currently in the process of finalizing the sixth proposed tax-reform package. The current
 draft proposal includes a tax on high-fat foods, a tax on luxury items such as yachts and jewelry, new taxes on gambling, new
 taxes on mining, and a tax on carbon production.


45.     Successful public finance reforms allow the public to see more tangible improvements in
governance and convince them that their taxes are being spent wisely. This crucial reform would help
make a better case for tax policy reforms. Successful implementation of public sector reforms would
allow the country to increase public investment and pro-poor spending and take advantage of new
opportunities arising from the global economic rebalancing. This note discusses two key taxes, the value-
added tax and excise tax on petroleum.

refunds amounted to around 0.7 percent of GDP on
average (Box 10).
47.      The BIR collects VAT on domestic commerce, while the BOC collects VAT on imports, and both
BIR VAT and BOC VAT revenues have improved over time. BIR VAT receipts grew at an average rate of
17 percent per year from 1988 to 2005, when the RVAT Law caused revenues to jump by 60 percent in a
single year. Between 2007 and 2009 revenue growth slowed to an average of 6.5 percent per year, before
accelerating again in 2010. Between 2011 and 2012 the annual growth rate of BIR VAT revenue shot from
6 percent to 25 percent. BIR VAT revenue grew by another 9.4 percent in 2013 as a result of improved tax
administration. Meanwhile, import VAT revenue has proven much more volatile. BOC VAT receipts grew
at an average annual rate of almost 32 percent from 1988 to 1997, then fell by almost 32 percent in 1998
as imports collapsed. BOC VAT revenue briefly recovered during 1999-2001 before falling by 11 percent
in 2002. In 2006 the RVAT Law increased BOC VAT revenue by 73 percent, but revenue growth turned
negative in 2009 during the global economic slowdown. Since 2010 BOC VAT revenue has significantly
improved, growing at an average rate of 16 percent per year, largely as a result of the BOC’s intense anti-
smuggling campaigns.
48.     The difference between actual and potential VAT revenues—the VAT tax gap—remains
substantial despite narrowing significantly in recent years. The VAT tax gap can be broken down into a
policy gap, which is the result of legal exemptions and other forms of special tax treatment, and an
administrative gap, which primarily reflects noncompliance. Between 2006 and 2013 the estimated policy
gap averaged three percent of GDP, while the estimated administrative gap averaged 3.7 percent of GDP.
As actual revenues averaged 4 percent of GDP, the VAT gap represented almost two-thirds (63 percent)
of potential VAT revenues. Of this, 28 percent reflects legal exemptions and special treatment, while 35
percent results from noncompliance.

                                         Box 10. The Philippine VAT System
The Philippine government introduced the VAT in 1988. In 1994 the VAT base was broadened to include professional service
providers, banks, nonbank financial firms and international shipping companies, but the implementation of these reforms
way delayed by questions regarding their constitutionality. In 1996 the government approved a number of VAT exemptions,
including exemptions on imported oil and coal, educational services, and the importation, production and sale of books and
newspapers.
In 2005 the authorities expanded the VAT base and increased the VAT rate in an effort to avert a fiscal crisis. Under the
RVAT Law the tax base was expanded to include electricity, petroleum, and medical and legal services, inter alia, and the rate
was increased from 10 to 12 percent. The law also imposed a 70 percent cap on input VAT credit, extended the input VAT
claim on capital goods exceeding PHP1 million over five years, and imposed a uniform 5 percent final withholding VAT on
government purchases.
Currently, there are three VAT regimes: exempt, zero-rated and taxed at 12 percent. The 12 percent rate applies to all goods
and services except those that are specifically exempted or zero-rated by the tax code. Firms that produce zero-rated
products can apply for a VAT refund on their inputs.46 In practice, however, these refunds are difficult to obtain, and the
government now issues tax credit certificates in lieu of refunds. To protect exporters from cash-flow shortages the
government extended the zero-rating to suppliers, but this has become a major source of revenue leakage. One important
and unusual feature of the Philippine VAT system is its use of excess input tax credits. These credits cannot be directly
redeemed for a VAT refund, but instead enable firms to apply for a tax credit certificate within two years of the quarter in
which they were issued. 47
VAT exemptions are primarily intended to reduce the tax burden on poor households, but the system for granting
exemptions is vulnerable to abuse. As of 2014 VAT exemptions were applied to agricultural and marine products, educational
services, sales by cooperatives, the sale or lease of small properties, and firms with gross sales of less than PHP1,919,500 per
year. Unlike zero-rating, firms that produce exempt goods cannot apply for VAT refunds on their inputs. 48

49.     Overall, the Philippine VAT system is slightly progressive due to the exemptions on goods and
services consumed by the poor. However, a number of economically unjustifiable exemptions have also
been granted to large corporations and cooperatives. These exemptions reduce the progressivity of the
VAT and widen the VAT policy gap.
50.     A large and growing number of exemptions undermines the efficiency of the VAT. Some of these
exemptions also create economic distortions. For instance, most cooperatives are exempt from VAT,
which creates an incentive for corporations to restructure themselves as cooperatives in order to reduce
their tax liability, even if restructuring is not economically efficient. Moreover, the exemption for
cooperatives is also largely unnecessary from a policy perspective, as small cooperatives are already
protected by the VAT threshold. At the individual level, the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010 exempts
senior citizens from VAT on specific items such as medical services, food, and transportation, but these
exemptions are vulnerable to exploitation.
51.     Moreover, VAT administration is complicated by a number of provisions that are at odds with
international good practices. While the introduction of the VAT in 1988 reduced the complexity of the



46 Zero-rating is typically applied to exports. Suppliers selling inputs to exporters are also zero-rated.
47 In 2012 the Office of the President issued Executive Order No.68, which enabled all tax VAT-registered taxpayers to redeem
their outstanding tax credit certificates for their full cash value. While this did not completely eliminate the use of tax credit
certificates, it did make them optional.
48 Firms with revenue below the threshold are not required to register for VAT. If they choose to be exempted from the VAT, they

are required to pay income tax equivalent to 3 percent of their annual gross sales and are not allowed to obtain VAT credits for
their inputs.

exemptions can erode revenues over time.
54.     More importantly, the VAT’s efficiency,
equity, and simplicity challenges could be
addressed by expanding the VAT base. Eliminating a number of existing exemptions could expand the
VAT base and boost revenue. Many exemptions that directly target specific individuals or firms have little
economic justification, and even those designed to serve legitimate policy purposes could be replaced by
superior alternatives (Box 11). Eliminating exemptions on inputs used to produce final goods that are also
exempt would alleviate distortions, reduce administrative complexity and improve compliance rates.
Increasing the VAT threshold to around PHP3 million and indexing to inflation would lower compliance
costs for small enterprises. Finally, limiting zero-rating to exporters would help curb leakages caused by
the current system of zero-rating suppliers of exporters in special economic zones.
55.      VAT administration could be improved by eliminating the use of tax credit certificates and
instead providing prompt VAT refunds in cash. The current rule requiring a pre-audit of refunds is not
consistent with international good practices and leads to long delays. Relaxing the rule would greatly
expedite the refund process. Introducing risk-management techniques would enable low-risk taxpayers
to get refunds faster and audits could be completed after the refund was issued. Low-risk taxpayers caught
over-declaring refunds would be reclassified as high-risk and subject to more stringent pre-audit
requirements. Finally, policymakers should reject any proposal to replace the VAT with either a sales tax
or a so-called “simplified VAT,”)50 as doing so would not reflect international good practices.




49 For instance, sales by non-agricultural, non-electric, and non-credit cooperatives are considered VAT-exempt only if the capital
contribution of each member does not exceed PHP15,000. Sales of residential lots are VAT-exempt only if their value does not
exceed PHP1,919,500. For dwellings, the applicable threshold is PHP3,199,200. For leases of residential units to be VAT-exempt,
monthly rental must not exceed PHP12,800. These are only a few of the many complicated rules and requirements that
characterize the Philippine VAT system.
50 This is similar to a turnover sales tax in that taxes paid on inputs are not refunded.




                                                               33
                                              Box 11. VAT Equity Analysis
VAT exemptions on basic consumer goods greatly increase the progressivity of the tax burden. The bottom income decile
accounts for 1.8 percent of total adjusted household spending but only 0.9 percent of VAT-eligible spending. Meanwhile, the
top income decile accounts for 37.5 percent of total adjusted household spending, but 48 percent of VAT-eligible spending.
Because the VAT is a proportional tax, the distribution of VAT liability mirrors the distribution of VAT-eligible spending.
(Figure 27). While removing VAT exemptions on electricity, social housing, cooperatives, and spending by senior citizens and
persons with disabilities could reduce the progressivity of the VAT system (Figure 28), any resulting increase in the tax burden
on the poor could be offset by cash transfers and/or enhanced social services.

3.3 The Petroleum Excise Tax
3.3.1 Performance Challenges
56.      The Philippines operates a specific excise tax regime for petroleum products, under which most
are either exempt or taxed at very low rates. Since 1997 all excise taxes on petroleum products have
either been fixed in nominal terms, reduced or eliminated.51 The real value of excise tax rates that were
fixed in nominal terms fell by 53 percent between 1997 and 2013, while the real value of rates that were
reduced dropped by 83 percent.




51 Excisetaxes on a range of industrial chemicals, fuels and building materials remain unchanged since 1997. Liquefied petroleum
gas has been exempt from excise tax since 1977. In 2006, excise taxes on oil products consumed by low-income households were
reduced or eliminated to offset the impact of the expanded VAT base.




                                                                34
57.     Petroleum excise tax rates in the Philippines are low by international standards. Premium
unleaded gasoline is currently taxed at 9 percent of the pump price, while diesel is exempt. By contrast,
in the majority of OECD countries premium unleaded excise taxes account for between 25 and 40 percent
of the pump price (Figure 29).52 In 2014 the VAT rates on premium unleaded gasoline and diesel were
equivalent to just 10 and 11 percent of the pump price, respectively.
58.     Leaving nominal excise rates unchanged has caused excise tax revenues on petroleum products
to plummet since the late 1990s.53 In 1997 the total petroleum excise tax revenue collected by the BIR
was equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP. By 2001 the total petroleum excise tax revenue collected by both
the BIR and BOC had fallen to 0.8 percent of GDP, and by 2013 it had dropped to just 0.2 percent of GDP,
with BIR revenues amounting to a mere 0.07 percent of GDP (Figure 30). Sharp reductions in BIR
petroleum excise revenues were observed in 2001, 2002 and 2004, as refinery production during these
years fell by 2, 18 and 21 percent, respectively. 54 In 2006 petroleum excise revenues again declined when
excise exemptions were introduced and, surprisingly, excise revenues also fell sharply when the economy
recovered from the global slowdown and refinery production increased. 55 As the Philippines’ reliance on
refined petroleum imports has increased, the share of BOC revenue in total petroleum excise revenue has
steadily risen. Between 2006 and 2013 the BOC’s excise revenue on petroleum products more than
doubled in nominal terms to PHP14.2 billion.

53 VAT revenue on petroleum products has also declined as a share of GDP, as the excise tax rate is part of the VAT base.
54 The 2004 decline in BIR petroleum excise revenue may be due to the closure of the Caltex refinery in September 2003.

Compensatory imports also likely shifted excise revenue from the BIR to the BOC.
55 It is possible that following weak demand in 2008 and 2009, local refiners merely drew-down inventories in 2010.

alone an estimated PHP38 billion in petroleum products was smuggled into the country,57 costing the
government PHP4.1 billion in foregone VAT revenue and PHP8.5 billion in foregone excise revenue.58
60.      The failure to index petroleum excise tax rates to inflation not only reduced revenue but has
also diminished the distributional equity of the tax burden, as real tax rates have fallen while real
household income levels have rapidly increased. While retail prices for petroleum products have risen
significantly since 1997 (Figure 31), petroleum excise rates have fallen sharply in real terms. As petroleum
products are overwhelmingly consumed by wealthy households, the declining real value of petroleum
excise taxes has greatly diminished their redistributive effect. In addition, the use of different excise tax
rates for different petroleum products has generated economic distortions. This is especially true of the
exemption for diesel, which has negative equity effects and creates environmental externalities. 59
61.     Consumption of petroleum products rises with household income. In 2012 households in the top
income decile consumed almost 60 percent of all retail petroleum products, and households in the top
three deciles consumed more than 80 percent,60 (Figure 32). Even within the top decile, consumption is
heavily concentrated in the top two percentiles, which together consume 30 percent of all retail
petroleum products. The only exception to the trend is kerosene, the consumption of which is inversely
correlated with income (Figure 33).

 tax rates have either remained unchanged or declined in nominal terms.

62.      Diesel’s exemption from excise taxes not only cannot be justified from an equity standpoint, it
also creates economic inefficiencies by distorting relative prices for gasoline and diesel. Fully exempting
diesel from excise taxes is not consistent with international good practices.61 In most countries, the excise
tax on diesel is equal to or only slightly lower than the excise tax on premium unleaded gasoline (Figure
34). However, the Philippine government’s complete elimination of the excise tax contributed to the
reversal of the diesel consumption trend, from -1.4 percent between 1997 and 2006 to 3.4 percent
between 2006 and 2013, despite a general shift toward cleaner energy sources.62 As a result, the
exemption on diesel likely worked against the government’s efforts to reduce air pollution and curb the
growth of carbon emissions.
 Figure 34. In most OECD countries the excise tax rate for diesel is only slightly lower than the excise
 tax rate for premium unleaded gasoline.




61 By contrast, exempting kerosene, which is largely consumed by the poor, is less distortionary and more equitable, as there is
no close substitute for kerosene in the same price range.
62 These figures are based on the compounded annual growth rate.

3.3.2 Reform Options
63.      Increasing excise tax rates on petroleum products would improve the efficiency and equity of
petroleum taxes, boost tax revenue, and reduce distortions and negative externalities. If rates are not
increased, real tax revenues are expected to continue to decline over time, reaching an estimated PHP25.2
billion (or 0.18 percent of GDP) in 2015.63 The most effective option would be to raise excise tax rates to
a target share of retail prices, then automatically index tax rates to inflation to maintain a consistent tax-
rate-to-retail-price ratio.
64.       While a one-time increase in excise rates coupled with indexation would be ideal, a second
option would be to asymmetrically adjust excise taxes based on petroleum prices. Policymakers can use
a formula-based approach to automatically raise excise taxes when petroleum prices fall and keep excise
taxes steady when petroleum prices rise. To soften the increase in the excise tax rate as petroleum prices
fall, the formula could stipulate that only a portion (e.g., 50 percent) of the decline in petroleum prices be
translated into higher excise taxes. This type of adjustment mechanism can ensure a more gradual, less
jarring transition to higher excise rates. For example, when pretax retail prices fall, excise rates could
increase by half the amount so that consumers and the government benefit equally until the excise rate
reaches its target share of the retail sales price. An equity analysis (Box 12) indicates that in the Philippines
the optimal excise-tax-to-retail-price ratio would be 20 percent for gasoline and 10 percent for diesel,
kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).



                        Box 12. Excise Taxes on Petroleum Products: An Equity Analysis
 Under the current excise tax regime for petroleum products, households in the top income decile bear 62 percent of the
 tax burden, while households in the bottom decile bear only 0.18 percent.64 However, since the national average petroleum
 excise tax burden is equivalent to just 0.03 percent of total income, the redistributive effect is extremely modest compared to
 other taxes.65 The progressive distribution of the tax burden is due in part to the fact that gasoline, which is overwhelmingly
 consumed by the wealthy, is subject to excise taxes, while fuels that are more likely to be consumed by the poor, such as
 kerosene, diesel and LPG, are exempt (Figure 35).
 Increasing the excise-tax-to-retail-price ratio to 20 percent for gasoline and 10 percent diesel, kerosene, and LPG would
 enhance the efficiency of the petroleum excise taxes, but it would reduce the progressivity of the tax burden. Under the
 revised system the share of petroleum excise taxes paid by households in the poorest income decile would rise from 0.18 to
 0.57 percent, while the share paid by households in the richest decile would fall from 62 to 52 percent. 66 However, the increase
 in tax rates would intensify the redistributive impact of the tax (Figure 36).67 Despite the marginal reduction in progressivity,
 more than half of the increase in the tax burden would be borne by households in the top income decile, while only 0.63
 percent would be borne by households in the bottom decile. Finally, an increase in targeted cash transfers could fully offset
 the negative impact on poor households.




63 These estimates assume that the demand elasticity is -0.3 and that collection efficiency is at 85 percent.
64 The petroleum excise tax regime’s Kakwani Index score is 18.25, indicating progressivity
65 This is reflected by its very low Reynolds-Smolensky Index score of 0.01
66 It should be noted that the after-tax Gini coefficient would fall to 54.45.
67 The very large increase in the magnitude of the tax would boost its Reynolds-Smolensky Index score to 0.04, since the

distribution of the tax burden would still be progressive.


                                                               38

3.4 Conclusion
Targeted reforms to the VAT and petroleum excise taxes could greatly enhance the efficiency, equity
and revenue-generating power of the Philippine tax regime. In recent years the growing scope of
exemptions and special tax treatment has substantially eroded the VAT base. The VAT policy gap costs the
government an estimated 3 percent of GDP in foregone revenue each year, while another 3.7 percent is
lost to noncompliance. Many exemptions that focus on specific individuals or firms have little economic
justification and should be eliminated. Mandating third-party information sharing to crosscheck VAT
declarations could strengthen compliance. Eliminating exemptions and improving compliance can boost
VAT revenues without the need to increase rates.
The Philippine government could raise almost 1 percent of GDP in new tax revenue by bringing
petroleum excise tax rates closer to global standards. Increasing rates as a share of retail prices and
indexing them to inflation would halt the deterioration of real revenue without the political burden of
future ad hoc tax increases. Increasing excise tax rates and eliminating exemptions for kerosene, diesel
and LNG could also improve the distributional equity of the country’s tax system, as higher -income
households consume the vast majority of petroleum products. More closely aligning tax rates for gasoline
with rates for other fuels would attenuate price distortions, while increasing petroleum excise tax rates
would encourage conservation and fuel efficiency, reducing air pollution and carbon emissions.
