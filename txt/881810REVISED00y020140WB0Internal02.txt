1.      INTRODUCTION

Over the past century or so, a wide assortment of pre-harvest agreements, joint ventures, deals and
pledges that can be termed “contract farming” have been brokered between farmers and buyers.
Many different farm products and markets are involved. In most cases, but not all, the primary goal
in integrating vertically, for both farmer and buyer, is an improvement to profitability. The buyer
gains through a reduction of the cost base and/or in increased reliability of supply, while the farmer
benefits from an increased gross margin through higher yields, or new and more profitable products,
lower transaction costs, or higher prices. Together with other supplementary benefits—such as
stability for the supplier or linkage with the community for the buyer, or product branding for
both—as well as potential detriments, these add up to a landscape of advantages and
disadvantages.

During the 1980s and 1990s, contract farming was frequently criticized as a potentially exploitative
arrangement, which favoured the more powerful buyer and left the small-scale farmer and the
environment vulnerable to abuse. More recently, there is renewed interest from policy makers and
their development partners in contract farming as a means of leveraging the recent wave of large-
scale investment in land and agriculture to include small-scale farmers and to link them to new
market opportunities. Commentators from a variety of perspectives have reviewed the potential
advantages, disadvantages, risks and regulatory mechanisms, and many broadly favour the
promotion of contract farming as a means of inclusive growth to benefit the most vulnerable groups
of youth, women, disabled and subsistence farmers over and above the strictly commercial benefits
available to private sector participants. The establishment of contract farming becomes a means to
link small-scale farmers to markets, which might otherwise be inaccessible for reasons of distance,
standards, processing, or any of the other disconnections and impediments that hold them back.

However, the enthusiasm of these commentators to promote contract farming must be tempered
by the number of published examples where contract farming has not performed as well as
expected. Contract farming is clearly not a panacea to eliminate rural poverty. Many problems,
such as market failure, side-selling, difficulties in establishing fair pricing models, abuse of power,
inability to manage quality or performance, compliance and inappropriate dispute resolution, reveal
the gulf that lies between theory and practical reality. The concept of farming under a contractual
arrangement is, therefore, too broad to be either dismissed as exploitative or promoted as
universally beneficial. Each case must be evaluated on its own merits and failings.

The desire among development organisations to support small-scale producers through contract
farming has resulted in a number of descriptive publications and manuals. These have been written
to help establish successful contract farming schemes as well as to provide advice to public sector
officials seeking to promote such schemes often with the help of case studies describing their
success, or failure (see, for example, Eaton and Shepherd 2001, Action for Enterprise 2009,
TechnoServe 2011, Prowse 2012, and Will 2013). However, there have been few attempts to
evaluate donor-supported contract farming projects, either financially or economically, or to
measure their inclusiveness and their impact in the community. This document aims to provide a
task team leader with tools for a critical evaluation of projects promoting contract farming
schemes before, during and after the life span of the project.

AN ANALYTICAL TOOLKIT FOR SUPPORT TO CONTRACT FARMING


This toolkit has three objectives:
    • Provide guidance on what kinds of contract farming schemes work well, and in what
        circumstances (the best practice function)
    • Provide guidance on how to analyse inclusive contract farming schemes in order to identify
        those with a good chance of success/sustainability - ‘the right horse to back’ (the diagnostic
        function)
    • Provide a framework for applying socio-economic and financial analysis to operations that
        support such schemes (the cost-benefit function)




2.      WHAT IS CONTRACT FARMING?

Arrangements linking       Contract farming is the term applied to commercial arrangements linking
farmers and buyers for     farmers and buyers for producing and marketing farm products. It is simply
producing and              a label to distinguish a farming venture in which there is a reciprocal
marketing farm             obligation with a buyer to produce and to purchase from an operation
products
                           where no such undertaking is present.

…which have evolved        The contractual arrangements would include, at a minimum, a promise of a
over time to cover the     consideration (e.g. money, inputs, services) in return for the product to be
inputs and services        supplied at a specified time, quantity and quality. The contract farming label
provided by the buyer      could be applied to any forward agreements, from the farmer using the
in return for the supply
                           futures market to hedge his harvest sales, or a small trader pre-financing a
of specific quantities
and quality of output
                           tree crop, to the integrated nucleus estate where, year after year, the
                           collaborating farmers produce exclusively for a firm that provides a
                           centralized management. They have all evolved to fit particular
                           circumstances of crops, local conditions and markets, and the appraisal of an
                           opportunity for contract farming should not be constrained by the
                           limitations of a label.

Different types of         Various definitions for contract farming have been proposed (Prowse 2012).
contract farming           Each seeks to include or exclude different sorts of pacts and bargains
models exist               depending on the author’s point of view, and a number of typologies have
                           emerged within this broad scope.

Production and
                           In the USA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) distinguishes
marketing contracts in     production and marketing contracts (MacDonald and Korb 2011). In 2008,
the USA                    39% of the value of agricultural production in the USA was produced under
                           contract; 22% under marketing and 17% under production contracts (see
                           country case study – USA).

Production contracts       Production contracts are increasingly important in the USA and the EU,
are becoming               especially for poultry and seed production, and are starting to gain
increasingly popular,      prominence in Asia and Africa (see poultry case study). A production
especially in the USA,
                           contract makes use of a farmer’s services and some of the assets in return
but also in Asia
                           for payment, while the contractor provides the inputs and retains ownership
                           of the output. For example, farmers provide labor, equipment/buildings,
                           while contractors provide other inputs such as feed, veterinary and livestock


                                                                                                      2
AN ANALYTICAL TOOLKIT FOR SUPPORT TO CONTRACT FARMING


                           transportation services, and young animals. The farmer’s remuneration is a
                           fee paid for the specific services instead of a payment for the market value
                           of the product. Additionally, farmers can effectively be paid a bonus
                           depending on yields, mortality rates, etc. Since contractor-provided inputs
                           may account for a large share of production costs, the fee paid to the farmer
                           may be a small fraction of the commodity’s value.

Marketing contracts        In contrast, marketing contracts focus on the commodity as it is delivered to
tend to form the bulk of   the buyer. They specify a commodity’s price or method for calculating the
the contract farming       price, the delivery point, and the quantity to be delivered. The parties in a
arrangements in            marketing contract agree to its terms well before harvest, preferably before
developing countries       the planting of annual crops. Variants of this, often of longer duration,
                           specify a method or formula for determining prices, rather than a specific
                           price, at the time of agreement. Contract pricing may limit a farmer’s
                           exposure to the risks of wide fluctuations in market prices, and they often
                           specify price premiums to be paid for commodities with desired levels of
                           specified attributes (such as sugar content in cane). The farmer owns the
                           commodity during production and retains substantial control over major
                           management decisions, and, hence, retains more autonomy in decision
                           making than is available under production contracts.

                           With a perspective focused on developing economy agriculture, Eaton and
                           Shepherd (2001) recognized five different outgrower models depending on
                           the intensity of collaboration as a key feature.

                           The informal model is usually a seasonal arrangement, without a formal
                           written contract, between smaller buyers (for example, traders or
                           agrochemical dealers) and a number of farmers. 1

                           The intermediary model makes use of agents or intermediaries between the
                           farmers and the contractor. The contractor cedes some control to the agent
                           but has outsourced the procurement process. In practice, the intermediary
                           has a contract with the contractor and a back-to-back contract, or
                           agreement, with farmers.

                           The multipartite model requires the collaboration of a number of different
                           organizations, which are likely to include statutory bodies in, for example,
                           extension. The farmers may be organized into cooperatives or producer
                           associations, and financing institutions would provide support.

                           The centralized model is a direct linkage between a buyer such as a
                           vegetable exporter, and a large number of surrounding farmers. The buyer

  It is often claimed that this model is very important to many small-farmers in developing countries where
village traders supply small groups of farmers with inputs and reclaim their value at harvest when they market
their produce. However, the scale and relative importance of this model has not yet been convincingly
quantified, though Shepherd (2004) concluded that in Asia these vertical linkages between farmer and
intermediary which provided working capital were generally “non-exploitative and generally serve to secure
supply, guarantee markets and reduce transaction costs”.



                                                                                                             3
AN ANALYTICAL TOOLKIT FOR SUPPORT TO CONTRACT FARMING


                             provides all the services and support that might be added by other
                             organizations in the multipartite model. The input from the buyer can range
                             from minimal to a close engagement in the production process.

                             The nucleus estate model is again a direct linkage between buyer and
                             producers but here the buyer also manages a central estate or farm. From
                             its own production, the buyer can guarantee a minimum availability of raw
                             material for a factory processing, for example, rubber, sugar or oil palm.

All types have success       No one type fits all contexts, and no one type is intrinsically more successful
stories and failures         than another. So, although we may define different models, the promoter of
                             contract farming needs to focus on the specific situation rather than the
                             generic institution. There can be hybrids between the above models; for
                             example, an agribusiness may use agents to supply a specific crop in an
                             intermediary model, but the same agents may also supply inputs and market
                             other crops in an informal model.

Contract farming works       Contract farming need not imply a multi-season relationship, but that is the
best when both parties       overall tendency of contracting in developing countries. Where a long-term
take a long-term view        collaboration is possible, trust can be built up, and the buyer and seller can

development of mutual        all parties need to work towards this. Yet, contracting as a means of
trust                        financing for the season is a common starting point, where, for example, a
                             trader will provide agrochemicals on credit at the appropriate time in the
                             season and take delivery of the crop in payment after harvest.

This toolkit considers all of the production models because each has a role to play in improving the
inclusiveness of small-scale farmers. It is recognised that this toolkit gives less recognition to the
informal and production models because they have received less attention from Governments, their
donor partners and researchers. However, when future efforts are considered to support contract
farming, it is important that these models are not ignored, because for some farmers in some
countries, they could be an excellent starting point to increase participation in contract farming (see
case study on sustainable coffee: Vietnam).

                             poorly delivered and costly, while the small-scale farmer is usually coping
                             with an unmanaged production risk and marketing an irregular surplus in
                             a spot market.

                             These circumstances conspire to a likely outcome of increasingly
                             marginalized small-scale farmers who are less able to compete in a
                             globalized marketplace. Here, contract farming seems to offer a solution:
                             a contractor provides some or all of the inputs in exchange for product
                             thus easing the immediate production issues, and, with the improved
                             husbandry following from the supply of extension services, productivity,
                             profitability and livelihoods can hopefully be enhanced. If the contractor
                             also links to the market, then the chain is complete, and small-scale
                             farmers become full participants in the agricultural economy. While this
                             may seem to be the answer to improving the incomes of many
                             disadvantaged small-farmers, such a contract farming solution is only
                             sustainable if it provides incentives, usually profits, for all the actors in the
                             value chain.

What does the small          Despite the considerable amount of literature and research on contract
farmer want from             farming, there is poor understanding of what small-scale farmers really
contact farming?             want; their desires tend to be simply assumed. Further research is
                             required to understand the motives and rationale for small-scale farmers
                             wanting to join contract farming schemes.

                             Of course in practice there are many pitfalls and issues along the way, but
                             contract farming succeeds in many environments on different continents
                             with different value chains. Fundamentally, however, there remains
                             doubt about “inclusiveness” and just how to ensure that the most
                             marginalized in the rural economy can benefit from the vertical
                             integration that contract farming might offer.

                             The concept of inclusiveness looks to ensure that the rural disadvantaged,
                             the smallest-scale farmers, women, youth, ethnic minorities and the
                             disabled, can all benefit from growth and are not left behind. Some
                             analytical reviews of contract farming have looked at farmer selection in
                             an effort to understand levels of inclusion or exclusion, and the findings
                             are mixed (see, for example, Sartorius and Kirsten (2004), ADB (2005),
                             Miyata et al. (2007), Junning Cai et al. (2008) and Singh (2009). For
                             example, the fruit juice processor looking to fix procurement costs at a
                             low level will logically select the larger scale farmers able to provide a
                             predictable and consistent volume; meanwhile, the rice processor,
                             surrounded by smallholders, may not have access to enough larger scale
                             farmers to provision tranches of a 20,000 tonne annual requirement but
                             can work with cooperatives and producer associations to secure
                             aggregated supplies from many small-scale farmers.

Contract farming is not      A segmentation of smallholder agriculture is helpful here in setting our
suitable for all small-      expectations of contract farming to be inclusive. Various authors have
scale farmers                provided a taxonomy of small-scale farmers, using characteristics such as
                             assets (Berdegué and Escobar 2002), land holding (Hazell et al. 2010) and
                             markets (Torero 2011) 2. Vorley et al. (2012) summarized these in defining
                             three Rural Worlds:
                                 • Rural World 1 comprises the producers with access to capital,
                                     some organization, information and infrastructure, and a
                                     capability of “stepping up” to formal and coordinated markets.
                                     Vorley et al. describe these as the richest 2-10%, matching a
                                     survey of four East African countries by Jayne (2012) who found
                                     this segment to be less than 4% of the rural population.
                                 • Rural World 2 consists of the majority of smallholders, largely self-
                                     sufficient but occasionally selling surpluses to the informal sector;
                                     they vary from being net sellers of food crops to net buyers. A
                                     part, often substantial, of the household income will be derived
                                     from non-farm activities.
                                 • Rural World 3 comprises the rural households approaching
                                     landlessness. A wider survey by Jayne et al. (2002) estimated that
                                     25% of households in sub-Saharan Africa were in this position.
                                     These are tenant farmers and wage laborers and a population
                                     transitioning out of agriculture into the labor market.

                             On this understanding of the smallholders (and the proportions will of
                             course vary throughout the developing world) generally only a tiny
                             segment are potential beneficiaries of contract farming at its simplest. It
                             is likely that only Rural World 1 may have the capability as individuals to
                             match the requirements of the contracting firm directly.

Clustering of farmers        Rural World 2 can best benefit through supply aggregation into co-
increases opportunities      operatives and producer organizations. Indeed, the producer
                             organization that is not simply an aggregator of produce but also a
                             negotiator and manager can equalize the imbalance in power between
                             buyer and seller in this environment, if it has the necessary human and
                             financial capabilities that are so often missing.

                             Rural World 3 will benefit directly if production by Rural World 1 and 2
                             farmers expands thus creating more on-farm employment opportunities
                             as well as in the expanding local economy.

The primary goal of          Overall, the opportunity to increase the revenue to a community through
support to contract          contract farming is the primary goal of those who would support contract
farming is to increase       farming. The expectation that contract farming can engage all local
rural revenue                households is unreasonable and risks neglecting the benefits of increasing
                             the local income, and risks ignoring the rather different support needed

 In the past, a distinction was also made between farmers who participate in the economy and those who do
not, i.e., subsistence farmers. While there are those rural producers completely isolated from the surrounding
economy, it is more common to find an increasing proportion of household livelihoods derived from off-farm
activities (e.g., hunting, fishing, charcoal, forest products, trading and so on) that give access to the economy
for those who have no farm surplus to sell. Perhaps a better distinction is in those who are net sellers of farm
produce and those who are net buyers, with a grey area in between of occasional sellers.

                                                                                                                6

                     by Rural Worlds 2 and 3. Few farmers in Rural Worlds 2 and 3 will be
                     capable of collaboration unless there are sufficiently robust producer
                     organizations to intermediate. Measuring success simplistically through
                     targets of farmer numbers involved in a contract farming scheme
                     implicitly assumes a homogenous base of smallholders to approach, and it
                     overlooks the practical realities of collaboration.

                     In conclusion, support for contract farming should moderate expectations
                     of inclusion with an interpretation that gives due weight to the increased
                     revenue derived for the local economy, rather than placing all the
                     expectations simply onto the number of farmers involved. Contract
                     farming has the potential to contribute to inclusive agriculture, but it will
                     also impact significantly by creating off-farm employment due to
                     increased prosperity.



4.    RISK IN CONTRACT FARMING

                    Contract farming is not inherently more precarious than other agricultural
                    investments, but the initiation of a contract farming venture has an impact
                    on the risks endured by both parties to the contract, and these are not
                    always well understood. Any agricultural investment involves risk, and risk
                    should feature in management planning, but, in practice, risk management
                    may get less attention than the more immediately pressing elements of
                    costs and profit.

                    The perception of risk also shapes behavior with respect to the contract.
                    The position of the small-scale farmer, who has a low capacity to bear risk
                    and is so justifiably averse to risk, is not always factored into the planning of
                    integrated ventures. The assumption that behavior is rational, and led by
                    the logical weighing of costs and benefits, has a place in modeling on paper
                    but in practice is less appropriate.

                    From the outset, the contracting parties should understand how risks may
                    be increased or decreased by the contract and what measures to mitigate or
                    cope are necessary. The development partner or policy maker will want to
                    know that any additional risk is manageable, and that its sharing is
                    equitable.

                    The integration of producers and buyers in contract farming leads to a
                    change in the profile of risk for each enterprise. Table 1 below briefly
                    reviews some examples of changes in risk noted in published case studies
                    and descriptions.

While we can look at past experience in Table 1, and we might learn through case study of
misfortune something of the severity of a risk, the probability of the risk is specific to each
project, and accordingly should be assessed specifically.

Risk can be broken down into an evaluation of the potential impact, the probability and the
manageability. A matrix can be built up to place individual risks on a table of likelihood
against severity or impact, and so assign priorities and encourage a review of manageability.

Strategies for risk management fall into three categories:
    • Coping: the ability to deal with the consequences through financial reserves or
        buffer stocks
    • Transfer: the reassignment of the risk to another willing party; for example, to an
        insurer or through a contract with a futures market
    • Mitigation: reducing the probability or the severity of the threat; for example,
        investment in irrigation or ensuring that non-contracted crops are also planted

The application of each depends on the balance of likelihood, severity of the consequence
and the manageability, since a likely hazard is best managed actively whereas a rare threat
might be withstood by advance provision of reserves, for example, or transfer of the risk to
an insurer.

One of the key risks in contract farming is the counterparty risk of contract misbehaviour
(see Table 1), and this is discussed further below in Section 5.2.3 together with the value of
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms that recognize the importance of the
relationship.

5.1     OBJECTIVES

The private and public sectors’ support of contract farming are different: essentially, the
private sector is driven by profit while public sector actors are driven by socio-economic
benefits, for example, inclusiveness. The separate aims lead to disparate criteria for success
using financial and socio-economic yardsticks. In reality, both sectors do interact, because
governments establish laws to protect their citizens and the environment, as well as by
enjoying the benefits of increased tax revenues from successful contract farming whilst
investing in improved infrastructure to improve the flow of inputs and outputs. Also, if the
public sector wants to see greater levels of inclusiveness, this can be achieved by supporting
the private sector’s business drivers.

The objectives of the private and public sector complement each other. For example, Will
(2013) regards the establishment of successful inclusive contract farming as three sequential
steps (Figure 1), which stress that the objectives of inclusiveness in contract farming must be

built on a viable business model. Similarly, Shepherd (2013) notes that one of the problems
of the donor’s support for contract farming is the tendency for it to be seen as “a
development tool where commercial principles do not apply”. A successful inclusive
contract farming scheme must be built on a viable and competitive business model that
should be sustainable.

       1 level objective: a viable CF business model
       For CF to be viable, the CF business model needs to be competitive.
       Competitiveness depends on:
       -an appropriate CF business model
       -an adequate CF management (structure and field operations)
       -a realistic CF business plan with feasible financial options
       Based on an economic, risk and financial analysis of alternatives to CF and optional
       CF business models

      2nd level objective: a sustainable CF scheme
      For CF schemes to be sustainable, farmer-buyer contractual relationships need to be:
                                              st
      -financially/economically viable (see 1 level objective)
      -socially equitable (e.g., group-based approaches, gender equity)
      -environmentally sustainable

       rd
     3 level objective: an inclusive CF scheme
      For CF schemes to be inclusive, they need to:
                                                     nd                           st
     -meet sustainability criteria according to the 2 level objective (including 1 level objective)

There are a number of business elements that form the basis of the commercial viability of
contract farming (Section 5.2). These are:
   • The product and market, which includes the market opportunity and the
        participant’s capability to supply it
   • The characteristics of the participants who are commercially involved in the contract
        and third party supporters who can be vital to ensuring its success
   • The responsibilities and terms described in the contract, including the pricing
        mechanisms
   • The management of the contract; both buyers and sellers have an important human
        commitment to the success of the relationship (and its reinforcement through ADR
        rather than recourse to the state courts)
   • Plans for scaling-up the business, which may be required to maintain the
        competitive status of the value-chain

Understanding and implementing the appropriate activities within each of these five
elements are the crucial building blocks to the success of the contract agreement. From the
perspectives of both the buyers and farmers, the critical measure of success is how these



                                                                                                      11

building blocks combine and contribute to the financial analysis of costs and revenues that
determine its commercial viability (Section 5.3).

Once the business case is proven, the public sector will want to understand the socio-
economic impact of the contract farming arrangement at community and national levels and
evaluate its impact on the environment. Therefore, a socio-economic analysis will be
needed (Section 5.4).

The final evaluation required of public-sector support for contract undertaking is the
measurement of the level of inclusiveness (Section 5.5). This will determine the level of
support that could be made available by government and donors.

Any agency that aims to support contract farming will wish to appraise a project before
investment and also evaluate it during and after completion of support to the project. While
the initial appraisal would be made on projections, subsequent evaluations would be based
on actual results.



5.2      BUSINESS ELEMENTS

5.2.1 THE PRODUCT AND THE MARKET
As with any successful business investment, there must be a clear market opportunity and
the chosen product should have a clear comparative advantage to compete. Therefore,
there are some guiding product and market principles that can help decide whether to
support contract farming investments or not (Table 2).

Processors and           Processors have been catalysts to establishing contract farming in
supermarkets have        developing countries (see Papain case study). The need for a reliable supply
been important           of high-quality raw materials has stimulated efforts to contract farmers; for
catalysts for contract   example, many small-scale farmers in Africa grow cotton for ginning or
farming
                         supply milk to dairies under contract. More recently, the traceability
                         standards demanded by the European supermarkets have encouraged
                         exporters to establish systems to both train and monitor their growers in
                         good agricultural practices.

Products and markets     Criteria for successful contract farming with small-scale farmers include:
needing regular farmer       • The existence of a monopsony: by definition, the existence of only
contacts, that are                one buyer eliminates side-selling, but the buyer has a very strong
difficult to mechanize
                                  negotiating position; third-party support to farmers and farmer
or create monopsonies,
                                  groups can help redress this imbalance
are more successful
                             • The need for regular communications between the buyer and
                                  sellers: the daily collection of milk linked with a regular supply of
                                  inputs and payments ensure that contracts with dairy farmers are
                                  more likely to be effective
                             • Crops that require considerable seasonal labor and are difficult or
                                  costly to mechanize are well-suited to smallholder-based contract-
                                  farming if there is sufficient family labor available. For example, in
                                  Zimbabwe, almost 300,000 farmers are contracted to grow cotton
                                  and tobacco (see Zimbabwe country case study). However, the

                                                                                             12

                                     aggressive competition between buyers of these crops can
                                     sometimes lead to considerable problems associated with side-
                                     buying and side-selling

Contract farming with       Trying to establish contract farming with staple foods is much less likely to
staple crops is much        succeed; the multitude of buyers creates too many opportunities for side-
more problematic and        selling (see cassava case study). 3 Contracting staple crops only works when:
is rarely successful
                                 • The buyer can identify a variety that is more valuable than the ones
                                     normally used by farmers (see potato processing case study)
… except when the end-
product is tailored to           • High levels of management input and imaginative marketing are
suit the factory                     used to improve margins in the value chain; these can make staple
                                     food contracts work, but may not be sustainable in the longer-term
… a third party catalyst         • A value chain is constrained by lack of credit, then a financial
is required to eliminate             institution can be the catalyst to the establishment of contracts
a constraint
Plantation crops work       Plantation crops are often successful contract farming models. This is
well                        because the buyer is effectively a monopsony; the contracted farmers are
                            near to the nucleus estates of factories ensuring close communication and
                            sometimes the central estate can help the farmer undertake activities.

  The case study notes that efforts to set up contract farming by industrial processors of cassava in
Nigeria have been disadvantaged by side-selling. In contrast, cassava production for processing in
Thailand has been very successful. However, it is not consumed as a staple food in Thailand, as
virtually the entire crop is used for industrial-scale processing.

5.2.2 PARTICIPANTS
                          Beyond the buyer and the seller in the contract, other organizations can
                          have an important role in contributing to the success of the relationship
                          (e.g., Government and its agencies, donors and NGOs). The role of these
                          other participants should be to support the successful and equitable
Financial institutions
                          development of the relationship and not control it. In addition, there can
can have an important
role to play
                          be an important role for financial institutions if credit is a major constraint
                          (see rice processing in Senegal), and independent bodies for dispute
                          resolution.

The buyers should first   Most rural households in developing countries are net buyers of food and
target asset-richer       do not have the assets and expertise to increase their production (Rural
farmers first and then    Worlds 2 and 3). Naturally, businesses who want to establish contract
become more inclusive     farming target the asset-richer farmers. However, once the viability of the
                          relationship is proven, it then becomes easier for motivated smaller-scale
                          farmers to join. The strategy of starting with larger-scale farmers and then
                          becoming more inclusive has a number of advantages. For the buyer, initial
                          targeting of larger-scale farmers means that there are fewer contact points,
                          which reduces aggregation costs, and those farmers are more likely to have
                          expertise of commercial transaction. For the farmer, the fewer initial
                          contact points means they get regular communications.

The development of        There has been much written about the benefits of developing farmer
functioning clusters      clusters, cooperatives and producer-based organizations (e.g., Strohm and
benefits both parties     Hoeffler (2006), Ton and van der Mheen (2010)). This is certainly the case
                          in contract farming where it helps with communications, distribution of
                          inputs and aggregation of outputs. In theory, operating as part of a cluster
                          gives farmers greater powers of negotiation



5.2.3 ESTABLISHING THE CONTRACT
                   Contract farming is different from traditional agricultural marketing, which
                   can be characterized as a single transactional process.

Characteristics of transactional and contract farming

 Transactional farming                            Contract farming
 Focused on a single transaction                  Orientated towards repeat sales over many years
 Buying price determined at time of sale          Actual buying price (or formula) fixed pre-planting
 Limited buyer/seller interaction                 Close, frequent buyer/seller contact
 Limited additional services provided             Provision of inputs & extension services
 Minimal focus by the buyer on improving          Continual emphasis on improving quality of service
 yield/quality, etc.                              and product by all parties

Enforcement of            If an agribusiness invests in supplying inputs and advice and then does not
contracts is difficult    receive the output, considerable losses can be incurred. In developed
                          countries, the farmer/producer will sign a contract with penalty clauses
                          that enables the agribusiness to reclaim the investment. This is much more
                          difficult in developing countries when the small-scale farmer usually has


                                                                                                       15

                             few assets other than the land 4 and house on which he depends and the
                             state courts may not function optimally.

                             It seems that signing contracts in these circumstances might be pointless
                             other than as a reminder of the terms. However, a more relational
                             approach would put less emphasis in the contract on the transaction and
                             more on the relationship and the mutual benefits that accrue from such a
                             relationship.

A working relationship       It is important to keep contracts simple. There is little to be gained from a
between both parties         complex contract that defines every possible eventuality over a period of
might be a better target     time and yet cannot be enforced. Instead, the contract might define the
                             basic parameters of the contract in terms of product, quality, and quantity
                             and the consideration of inputs, services and payments. The conduct of the
                             relationship, and the resolution of disputes, should be given due attention
                             with a view to preserving the longer-term stability of the venture. It might
                             be sensible to have a formal contract with a cluster or cooperative and a
                             relational, or verbal, agreement with the individual farmers so they
                             understand the parameters without signing a document or pledging their
                             assets.

The importance of trust      The buyer can still advertise the market buying conditions, and both parties
                             would behave with each other as if there were a legal contract. However,
                             the relationship would be established on trust, and as such, it would be
                             important to have a system in place to ensure that all farmers understand
                             the terms and conditions of the relationship, and that there is a
                             communication channel for the farmers to give their opinions and views
                             back to the buyer.



CONTRACT RISK
                             The key to effective risk management in contract farming applies not only to
                             the individual parties fulfilling their roles and objectives, but also to the
                             conduct of the contract. Here, the risks of adverse behavior by the other
                             party to the contract (also called counterparty risks) should be given priority,
                             as the behavior of the opposing party (the “counterparty”) is so often the
                             primary cause of dissent in contract farming, through, for example, side-
                             selling or late payment. Recourse to the state courts is not a realistic
                             solution generally, and the best approach is mitigation.

                             Where the contract is expected to last over a longer period of time the
                             relationship becomes more important than the transaction itself. While a
                             legal approach to the contract will attempt to cover the risk of every
                             eventuality that might arise in the life of the contract, a more relational
                             approach (McNeil 1978) will look to secure the relationship between
                             contracting parties for the duration of the contract and how to resolve
                             disagreements. It is then incumbent on the parties to the contract to work
                             towards building the relationship through trust.

    Even then, the farmer may only have customary tenure with no right to sell or mortgage

                                                                                                         16

Dispute resolution          It is important that the dispute resolution procedures have been agreed in
process                     advance, and that the appropriate processes are available. These might
                            range from arbitration, with a decision reached by an arbitrator or a panel,
                            to mediation where the disputing parties, through the facilitation of an
                            independent mediator, work out a solution. The presence and clear
                            understanding of the dispute resolution process should lower the risks
                            perceived by investors and agribusinesses contemplating entry into
                            contractual arrangements 5.



PRICING
                            The factor that has the biggest impact on profitability for the farmers and
                            indeed the agribusiness is the price of the contracted product. In some
                            cases it is relatively easy to agree a price at planting or well before harvest,
                            for example, if the buyer:
                                • Has a fixed price marketing agreement for its end-product 6
                                • Is a monopsony
                                • Adds considerable value to the farmer’s raw material

The need for flexible       It is not always possible to fulfill these requirements; in fact, the majority of
pricing models              agricultural marketing does not meet these parameters, and flexible pricing
                            models become essential. Both parties can reduce risks and also share in
                            gains that might accrue between agreeing a contract and delivery.


Pricing models are crop     There is a range of pricing models that can be used (Table 3). The key
and market dependent        issues to choosing the successful pricing models are:
                                • Flexibility
                                • Transparency
                                • Ensuring that everyone in the value chain gets a remunerative
                                     return for their investment over a number of years and does not
                                     attempt short-term gain.

Farmers might need          Before a contract can be established, price negotiations will need to take
support in establishing     place. Small-scale farmers may require some support to have sufficient
the correct pricing         information to achieve a remunerative price. The formation of groups, or
model and setting the       the collaboration with an external agency or NGO, can assist them with

                            their costs, but sometimes it can be difficult to get all the details required.

 Examples of this can include processors who have an agreed price for their end-product. A rice mill in
Senegal negotiated a series of deals with rice wholesalers before the processing season so they were in a
position to offer farmer groups back-to-back contracts (see Senegal rice case study).

5.2.4 MANAGING THE CONTRACT
Patience and     Contract farming, in the sense of longer-term relationships, does not
persistence      develop spontaneously, and it will take time, often several seasons, to
                 smooth out problems as they develop in the venture. If there is a fixed
                 price arrangement, it might take a few years for the “average” to be seen
                 to work in both parties’ favor. Where new crops are introduced, or new
                 technology is adopted, 7 to 10 years is not an unreasonable expectation for
                 a project to reach maturity.

Good management         The quality of the management is a critical factor and yet it is the most
involves good           difficult to define. Perhaps, the biggest managerial impact in contract
communications and      farming is achieved by establishing good communications, listening and
listening skills        acting on each party’s issues and honoring agreements. This is the basis of
                        trust between the buyer and seller.

                        In the case of the agribusiness, good management means establishing
                        frequent dialogue with the farmers, or farmer groups, supporting with
                        inputs and extension, providing appropriate information and having the
                        flexibility to quickly react to unexpected circumstances as and when they
                        occur. The frequent dialogue can be aided by contracting a cluster of
                        farmers near good roads.

The use of ICT is       Over the last few years there have been tremendous advances in the use of
becoming increasingly   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), which have had a
helpful                 radical impact on the connectivity of farm communities into the value
                        chain. Mobile phone text messaging is used to communicate agronomic
                        and other technical advice, collection and marketing plans as well as to
                        handle payments. The farmer can use the same service to inform the
                        buyer of potential problems.

                        Contract indiscipline is a common cause of failure in contract farming
                        ventures. Since enforcement through the state courts is often not an
                        option, other management strategies are needed. From the buyer’s
                        perspective these management strategies include:



                                                                                                    19

The importance of            •   Selection of the farmers. If an agribusiness invests in resources for
farmer selection                 a farmer, it is important that they get sufficient output to recover
                                 the initial investment. However, not all farmers are capable of
                                 producing the necessary yields and quality nor can they always
                                 deliver reliably. Therefore, contract farming is not an option for all
                                 farmers and the selection process is critical to its success (Ton and
                                 van der Mheen 2010)

formation                        others

communications
                                 decisions and transparency all add to the cohesion of the venture
The importance of
                             •   Incentivize - without strong incentives to participate in the venture,
incentives                       there will be no commitment. Small-scale farmers are generally
                                 risk averse and manage with a range of coping strategies, such as
                                 diversifying their income beyond farming and cultivating reliable if
                                 low-yielding crops; specialization and single buyer programs may
                                 not be attractive
Prompt payment and           •   Prompt, reliable payments will reduce the risk of side-selling. If the
the buyer should take            product must be stored, perhaps for aggregation, prior to purchase
on the burden/risk of            then it is preferable that it is not stored by the farmer, but in a
storage
                                 central warehouse as this reduces the temptation for side-selling
                                 and should help reduce the chances of quality deterioration
Penalize misbehavior –       •   Penalize misbehavior by exclusion from the venture. This depends
sensibly                         on making the membership aspirational and again understanding
                                 the incentives that drive behavior

Buyers also need to be   However, contract ill-discipline is not confined to farmers: buyers fail on
controlled               their side of the contract by, for example, changing buying prices, down-
                         grading the quality of produce to a lower price band, or over-charging the
                         cost of inputs. Too often there is little possibility of the producer taking the
                         dispute to court, and, in the absence of contract oversight by the state or
                         other agency, an alternative dispute resolution procedure is essential.

Regular and open         Published experiences of contract farming shows that regular, open
communications are       communication is a key strategic investment. The farmer who rarely sees
important and need to    the buying agent is more likely to sell to the next buyer passing through the
be promoted              village than the famer who has frequent contact through company extension
                         agents who will also buy the crop. It is not surprising that contract farming
                         works well in the dairy sector where the milk is collected daily. Companies
                         that set up an agreement with farmers growing staple crops are particularly
                         vulnerable to side-selling in the readily accessible markets. The relationship
                         with the suppliers needs specific attention in the management of the
                         contract, and developing trust via close contact and prompt payment will
                         have consequences for the costs in procurement.

                         Communication becomes even more important when problems arise,
                         positions become entrenched and the contract is at risk. The approach that
                         seeks a resolution of the issues behind a problem is more likely to lead to an
                         enduring relationship than one that seeks a judgment from a third party. In

                                                                                                      20

                           addition, the constructive involvement of national and local politicians can
                           be essential in ensuring that accurate messages are communicated.

Some well-established      Arbitration and mediation as procedures of alternative dispute resolution
industries have            are becoming more widespread, but may need to be established. Examples
respected dispute          in some more established and formalized industries are seen in the tobacco
resolution processes       industry in Zimbabwe (ASI 2012) 8 and the Tanzanian sugar industry (PADEP
                           2006) 9. Both of these two industries are well established, and the respect
                           that parties have for the arbitration process has built up over time.


5.2.5 SCALING UP THE BUSINESSES
                   It is important that efforts to establish contract farming operations include
                   plans for increasing efficiencies and expansion. Both the buyers and
                   farmers are entrepreneurs and need to improve their returns, achieve
                   higher yields, reduce production costs and improve quality to ensure that
                   the value chain continues to be competitive. Farmers can be helped to get
                   better yields through continued extension support and agricultural
                   research; which should lead to lower production costs. Buyers can expand
                   their business by contracting more farmers to grow for them and by
                   innovation to improve their efficiency. Importantly, small-scale farmers
                   should have the opportunity to diversify their operations and the
                   relationship with the contractor can support this.


5.3     APPRAISAL AND EVALUATION OF THE BUSINESS MODEL

Before evaluating the details of proposed contract farming models, it is necessary to understand the
objective or aims of the business model and evaluate if it is commercially logical and whether it is
likely to give both parties a competitive edge. For example, buyers may want to establish contract
farming to obtain a reliable supply of raw material at a specific location of the correct quality or to
save investing in land and land clearance, etc. The farmer needs to have a business objective for
entering into a contract (e.g., to secure inputs and technical advice) or an assured market and buying
price, etc.

Once the logic of the business objectives have been substantiated, all the business elements
discussed above need to be considered. However, the most important aspect of the appraisal of the
business model is the financial analysis (i.e., whether the elements have created a business whereby
both the buyer and seller make an acceptable return on their resources or whether they would be
better off investing their time and money in other businesses). As with any value-chain, all parties
have to consistently make an acceptable return on their investment for relationships to be
sustained. In conjunction with the financial evaluation, it is important to understand the risks that

contract farming agreements. TIMB representatives are present during all tobacco sales and promptly settle
any disputes that arise through arbitration.

  A Regulation (GN. No. 173 of 2005) provides the conditions for compensation in case of a manufacturer’s
failure to buy cane or a grower’s failure to deliver. Furthermore, the Tanzanian sugar board is empowered to
intervene as arbitrator in case of failure to agree on compensation.

                                                                                                           21

are involved with the investment and the processes in place to minimise them. Obviously
investments that have higher levels of risk should project better returns.

Need to produce farm       Any financial analysis of contract farming needs to demonstrate that the
budgets to calculate the   farmer will have a positive gross margin and an acceptable rate of return for
benefits of involving      their labour and/or their investment. This should be compared with other
small-scale farmers in     uses of their resources (e.g., the returns for producing other crops). It may
contract farming
                           well be necessary to prepare whole-farm budgets for the small-scale farmers
                           to fully understand the projected impact on their incomes through contract
                           farming. It will be necessary to understand how the change will impact the
                           risk profile for the farmer.

If the buyer has made      When evaluating contract farming schemes from the perspective of the
capital investment in      buyer, there are normally two different financial calculations that need to be
processing equipment,      considered. The first is for the overall business, and the second is just for
use conventional           the contract farming operation. For the overall investment in the business,
financial analysis tools
                           and especially if there is significant capital expenditure, it would be
                           necessary to undertake the traditional financial analysis such as internal
                           rates of return (IRR), return on investment (ROI), payback period, etc. This
                           analysis is often undertaken assuming a steady price for the raw material
                           produced by the contracted farming. However, the level of risk will
                           determine the minimum IRR needed to make the investment attractive.

Contract farming must      When appraising the establishment or expansion of contract farming
deliver product to the     operations, the analysis is simply based on how much it costs to deliver a
buyer at a price similar   unit of raw material. As the contract farming is designed to produce raw
to other sources           material for the business, the costs of production must be comparable with
                           other sources of supply. For example, a business might want to compare
                           the cost of sourcing from contract farming with production on their own
                           farms, purchasing from larger commercial farms, purchasing on the open
                           market or even importation in order to ensure its longer-term
                           competitiveness. Like the gross margin undertaken for the small-farmer, the
                           first part of the evaluation is based on a simple cash analysis and as noted by
                           Da Silva (2005) “Both parties have to see the partnership as a source of
                           gains—financial or otherwise—that could not be matched in the next best
                           alternative.” However, as with the evaluation of IRRs, it is necessary to
                           consider the degree of risk. As with cassava production in Nigeria (section
                           5.2.1), the lack of reliability of supply from small-scale farmers has resulted
                           in processors having to invest in their own farms to secure a more consistent
                           supply of raw material; a significant investment for the processor, but
                           necessary to overcome the risk of non-supply by the contracted smaller-
                           farmers.

Buyers need to consider    When a processor considers what the best model to obtain raw materials is,
the financial cost of      supporting contract farming has considerable advantages over backward
backward integration       integration into commercial farming. It saves investment in purchasing and
and the risk of being      clearance of land and investment in machinery. If it relies on purchasing
reliant on a few large
                           from a few large commercial farms, it becomes dependent on a few
commercial farmers
                           suppliers who could have significant negotiation power. Therefore, despite
                           the effort needed to establish contract farming with small-scale farmers, it
                           has some advantages providing the total cost of the operation does not

There are other            There are some benefits for a business to obtain raw materials by
benefits associated with   contracting with small-scale farmers:

farmer
                                   the ethical dimension to a corporate mission but also have market
                                   benefits where the agribusiness can be seen to be working
                                   inclusively
                               • Contract farming with small-scale farmers can improve the standing
                                   of businesses within the community
                               • Purchasing produce from small-scale farmers can result in tax
                                   breaks

                           These should enhance the returns to the business, which could in part be
                           used to cover the costs of establishing contract farming, but it is hoped that
                           some benefits would be passed on the farmer.


5.4     SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

Identify how contract       If a potential investment is to receive support, a Task Team Leader (TTL)
farming reduces market      will want to evaluate the socio-economic implications of a successful
failures                    intervention. For example, how it will address market failures, how it
                            benefits small-scale farmers and their community, etc.

Economic analysis can       The economic analysis is often regarded as being more important to the
lead to increased           public sector and donors than to the private sector. In reality, it can
investment in public        provide leverage for the private sector to negotiate with Government for
goods                       better infrastructure and appropriate policies.

                            Normally, the economic analysis of World Bank investment would take a
                            traditional approach and undertake a simple cost/benefit analysis or an
                            evaluation of the economic rate of return. The socio-economic analysis
                            would also estimate the jobs and businesses that would be created as a
                            direct and indirect result of the project. Ideally, there would be
                            “counterfactual” areas to fully evaluate the economic returns from the
                            investment.

                            When undertaking the economic analysis, the TTL needs to consider:
                              • The project’s development impact in terms of traditional
                                  economic analysis. This can be based on the financial data
                                  collected on gross margins/farm budgets and the buyer’s
                                  costs/benefits even if there are the usual concerns about the
                                  counterfactual and the appropriate shadow price. Using these
                                  data, it is possible to calculate expected economic IRRs and other
                                  economic indicators
                              • How much extra revenue is returned to the rural areas and what
                                  are the numbers of direct beneficiaries? In addition to the

                            •   Have the farmers benefited from increased prices and have their
                                incomes/food security/nutrition been improved because of better

                            •   How sustainable is the investment? Does it have a significant
                                environmental impact?
                            •   What is the impact on the infrastructure of the rural areas? Has
                                there been a negative impact (e.g., on the degradation of roads) or
                                has it resulted in improvements (e.g., new roads, schools, medical
                                facilities being built, improved marketing facilities)?
                            •   What has been the impact on the country’s trade balance through
                                exports or import substitution?

                        The rural income and other benefits that have been created and identified
                        should then be compared to a counterfactual where there has been no
                        support for contract farming.

Scaling up operations   In addition to expanding their farming operations by supplying the
                        contracted commodity, it is hoped that the relationship will transfer
                        agricultural and business skills to the farmer to be able to diversify
                        production and take advantage other market opportunities to supply other
                        buyers.

5.5     MEASUREMENT OF INCLUSIVENESS

                        Part of the economic analysis of any donor support to projects will include
                        some measurement of inclusiveness. However, potential contract farming
                        investments will have greater emphasis on the measurement of
                        inclusiveness.

Measure a range of      The success of an inclusive agribusiness intervention may be judged by
indicators              evidence of reduced vulnerability and insecurity among beneficiaries. A
                        number of proxy indicators for determining whether or not the project
                        contained measures aimed specifically at generating increases in the
                        incomes of the poor smallholder farmers include, for example:
                            a) Increased job opportunities: It is preferable that jobs resulting
                               from contract farming are, as far as possible, permanent but even
                               seasonal opportunities are very valuable to Rural World 3
                               households
                            b) Increased farm-gate incomes, as a result of the introduction of
                               new product opportunities, better yields resulting from technology
                               transfer and training or higher prices due to improved quality or
                               complying with specified standards. Farm-gate revenues can be
                               improved due to shorter marketing chains, establishment of
                               aggregation centers and reduced input costs as a result of bulk
                               purchasing
                            c) The number of farmers that are involved, including average size
                               and which category they fit into (see section 3), gender, etc.
                            d) Spillover effects: increasing rural incomes will result in non-farm
                               job and business opportunities, as the increased farm revenues are
                               recycled

                              f) Contributions to improved food security and/or nutrition in rural
                                 areas

The dilemma of            It has been noted that a monopsony can be the basis for successful and
supporting non-           long-term contract farming relationships and, also, it is easier for the buyer
competitive contract      to address some market failures such as input supply and extension. Such
farming models            models therefore tend to lead to higher farmer yields and better quality.
                          Yet, because of the lack of competition, the cost of inputs may be higher
                          and the farm-gate prices offered may not be as good if there were more
                          suppliers and buyers. However, encouragement for the establishment of
                          farmer clusters and associations with some support and information from
                          third parties can help achieve better returns for the farmers.

…as opposed to            In contrast, competitively structured models might lead to higher farm-
competitive models        gate prices but less provision of inputs and extension, which could deliver
                          lower yields. They might also score poorly on quality, which limits the
                          price advantage they can pass to farmers.

                          Measurement of inclusiveness can be difficult to project accurately before
                          a potential investment, but estimates can be made. During the first few
                          years of a contract farming scheme, these data can start to be collected
                          more accurately and a better understanding of the inclusiveness and
                          economic benefits can be estimated. The private sector will be able to
                          supply some of the necessary information, such as the numbers of farmers
                          and the money returned to the rural areas, but it will be necessary to
                          employ an M&E team to gather data on the wider impact in the
                          community.

                          One of the aims of inclusive agriculture is to increase the involvement of
                          women, especially in the financial benefits that arise from successful
                          contract farming. However, the culture in some countries makes it difficult
                          for women to sign contracts and/or retain the remuneration from
                          commercial agriculture.



6.       WHAT HINDERS CONTRACT FARMING? A SUMMARY

This section examines some of the reasons why contract farming models may be absent or weak in
an environment that might benefit from closer linkages.

Lack of investment in    The food processing industry, with its needs for year-round reliable supply of
industries that could    raw material, or the capability to store sufficient quantities, is often a key
drive contract farming   promoter of contract farming. It is particularly advantageous when there
                         are specific quality requirements that justify a premium among the
                         contracted producers.

Past contract failures   Trust is critical for contract farming and easily squandered by poor discipline

Some products and           Different products have different needs, and, as noted earlier, the
markets are less suited     contracting of staples is less likely than the contracting of high-value
to contract farming         horticultural crops or products for monopsony buyers.

Lack of clusters and        In areas of agriculture where most of the production is focused on supply to
meaningful surpluses in     the farming household, sales only become available when the season
underdeveloped areas        generates a surplus or when the household is in a position or need to sell.
                            Contracting in these circumstances of opportunistic marketing is difficult; it
                            might become feasible if the producers are assembled into small groups that
                            can collectively fulfill the contract, but this would depend on a surplus
                            generally being available in sufficient quantities at the same time.

                            On the buyers’ side, the organization and administration of the contract
                            model may need a caliber of management that is not available locally. A
                            training program might provide support.

Government policy can       Where national governments intervene either in the supply of inputs or in
sometimes be                the marketing of commodities, the interference or potential interference
disadvantageous             may deter any contractual arrangements, particularly in staple crops. This is
                            one of the reasons why staples are rarely contracted successfully.

                            Macroeconomic stability is important. Contract farming can represent a
                            significant investment, which would be deterred by instability, and changing
                            circumstances in the operating environment may weaken the contract itself.

                            concept of commitment to a single crop or a single buyer may be far from
                            attractive. This is an area easily overlooked, and the design of the incentives
                            to participate should take into consideration the changes in the status of risk
                            for the producer.




7. HOW CAN CONTRACT FARMING BE STARTED AND
STRENGTHENED?

State and donor support and facilitation for contract farming is given to stimulate the private
sector’s involvement and encourage greater inclusiveness. This should be done in such a way that it
does not uncompetitively benefit one enterprise over another. Support should be focused on the
provision of public goods, targeted finance, minimising risk and help with technical assistance with
innovation. There is also an argument for reviewing oversight and regulation.

Much of this toolkit focuses on the more formalised relationship between large-scale buyers and
small-scale farmers. It is important that the many informal traders and farmers operating at the
village level are evaluated and possibly considered for support. In some circumstances, they are

                                                                                                       26

vital for delivering inputs, finance and market information and the provision of markets to farmers in
a way that the more formal contract farming arrangements cannot deliver.

7.1     REGULATION

                         Regulation needs to be light. It is too easy to smother the spark of creating a
                         joint venture with regulations that undermine the incentive while giving an
                         illusion of control that cannot be implemented. These are private sector
                         initiatives that identify and invest in a need, and boundaries and norms,
                         while important, can be too restrictive.

Little need for more     For the most part, regulatory measures that might be needed in the area of
regulation…              contract farming are likely to be on the statute books already and will
                         concern areas of:
                             • Competition
                             • Employment and labor
                             • Environmental issues
                             • Safety and health
                             • Land

…perhaps some            These general policies might gain from some refinement, but, in view of the
refinements              diversity of contract farming schemes, and the widespread use of informal
                         contracts, it is unlikely that regulatory policies specific to contract farming
                         would be able to cover the breadth necessary without being unduly
                         prescriptive. Compulsory oversight of each contract by an “independent”
                         agency has been suggested; however, caution is needed because, in practice
                         it could be a restriction (and the accompanying potential for rent-seeking
                         actions) to the establishment of joint ventures, and could also be useless
                         without the ability to implement across a multiplying number of schemes. It
                         would also be difficult when many contract farming arrangements are
                         informal and without contracts.

Unreasonable contracts   In general, successful contract farming benefits both sides of the contract,
are not sustainable      and, since the goals of each party are not mutually antagonistic,
                         unreasonable contracts are unlikely to be sustainable. Where repeated
                         malpractice and contract abuses are found, of course, regulation—or at
                         least intervention by an authority invoking existing regulations—may be
                         necessary. Manipulation of the contract itself, by either party, is most
                         common, and a dispute settlement procedure is more pressing than an
                         additional burden of regulation, which might impede the creation of vertical
                         linkages.

Tough regulations are      Regulations can seem to be tough and give the illusion of protection, but, in
difficult to implement     practice, the ability to implement may be weak. Regulation on its own will
                           not equalize an imbalance of power unless there is strong implementation,
                           and note that the imbalance can also favor the producer who abuses the
The bottom line:
                           contract by failing to deliver. The implementation of regulations enforcing
regulation is a feeble
substitute for well-
                           contracts is difficult anyway, with small-scale producers financially unable to
managed collaboration.     take legal action, and large-scale buyers unable to recoup losses from
                           impoverished farmers even if they wanted to. Here it would seem that
                           aggregation of product through a producer organization would be the most
                           secure way of ensuring a fairly negotiated agreement and maintenance of a
                           code of conduct that benefits all the players.



7.2     FACILITATION WITH PUBLIC GOODS

                           Government support to the emergence of contract farming can develop on a
                           number of levels:
                              • Market promotion – trade and investment policy should be
                                 supportive of investment and development of exports; encouraging
                                 investment and competition downstream
                              • Logistics – improvement of roads, especially at the farm level, and
                                 storage facilities in conjunction with private operators add to the
                                 capability of small-scale farmers to participate in contract farming
                              • Seed import legislation – the import of improved planting material
                                 can be a bottleneck to upgrading production and can be a particular
                                 problem where the sponsor intends to introduce new varieties or
                                 new crops
                              • Producer groups and cooperatives – the advantages of working with
                                 farmer groups has been discussed in terms of lowering procurement
                                 costs, and also in facilitating the distribution of inputs and technical
                                 knowhow. The policies and legislation around formalizing producer
                                 groups should be in place
                              • Innovation and extension - innovation is key to competitiveness, and
                                 the ability to disseminate knowledge and technology through
                                 extension by the participating firms can be encouraged through cost
                                 sharing
                              • Finance – access to finance is a persistent issue in the rural economy
                                 and contract farming offers scope for innovation through the use of
                                 contracts to increase the ability of farmers to access finance if it is
                                 made available


7.3     TARGETED FINANCE

Both buyers and sellers    Both producers and buyers need finance to start a farming operation, but
will benefit from          there are often too many risks to attract commercial money. The initiation
financial support –        or expansion of contract farming ventures may need support and there is an
especially during start-   argument for donor assistance. The buyers need support to become more
up
                           inclusive, otherwise the temptation is to target the larger asset-rich
                           producers. The farmers need support with training and aggregation to form

                                                                                                      28
AN ANALYTICAL TOOLKIT FOR SUPPORT TO CONTRACT FARMING


                            viable clusters. There have been some donor-supported efforts to give
                            financial support to the tripartite agreements between buyers, extension
                            providers and farmer groups (see Rice case study).

Initiate a challenge fund   There is a range of funding instruments that can be used:
to support contract            • Public funds can be used to establish necessary infrastructure to
farming?                            open up new areas, establish water sources for irrigation, provide
                                    market information, etc.
                               • Matching grants can be made available to both buyers and sellers,
                                    preferably as part of a challenge fund
                               • Long-term patient capital can provide the opportunity to establish
                                    plantation crops, building of storage and rural processing facilities

                            There will always be the need for short-term finance to cover direct costs of
                            both production and processing, but such funds tend to be more available
                            commercially once successful contract farming relationships are established.

7.4     THE ROLE OF POLICY AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT IN RISK MANAGEMENT

                            While the management of the contract itself is key to success, government
                            policy can also be directed in support and there are opportunities for
                            interventions to reduce risk:
                                • Production risk – water management infrastructure (irrigation/flood
                                    control); development of research and extension services in
                                    conjunction with the contract partners; phytosanitary border
                                    controls; seed service
                                • Market risk – contract law; logistics infrastructure of storage and
                                    improvements to roads
                                • Operating environment risk – competition policy; encouraging
                                    insurance capability


7.5     TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

                            One of the attractions of contract farming is that it provides a vehicle for
                            farmer training that might be needed where public extension systems are
                            not delivering quality support. Obviously, extension provided by contract
                            farming is mainly focused on the product needed by the buyer, but it can be
                            broadened if partially public sector financed or if the buyer attempts to
                            market a wider range of the farmers’ products. Given that contract farming
                            in some cases can be perceived as a result of the failure to deliver farming
                            messages, there is an argument for public funds to at least partially support
                            the provision of technical support.

ANNEX 1: SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A
PROJECT LEADER

In theory, there are many advantages for contract farming, but some of the problems highlighted
above make it difficult for it to be applicable to all crops and for all farmers. A checklist is provided
here to assist project leaders to evaluate the potential for supporting contract farming. These
checklists need to be studied pre-project, during the project and post-project to evaluate whether
the proposed contract farming value chain is likely to be successful and sustainable.

ANNEX 2: CASE STUDIES

CASSAVA PROCESSING IN NIGERIA 10
Contract farming with        Background – Nigeria produces over 50 million t/year of cassava; the vast
staple foods for             majority is processed and consumed as garri. The prices paid by the garri
processing is difficult      manufacturers establish the fresh cassava market price floor. Cassava can also
                             be used as a base for processing into High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF – used
                             as a partial substitute for imported wheat flour) and ethanol. Two large
                             investments were made in 2008/10 in factories with capacities to convert
                             70,000 and 75,000 t/year of cassava roots into HQCF and ethanol respectively
                             (which is less than 0.3% of Nigeria’s total production). The aim was to support
                             local farmers and contract groups of small-scale farmers to supply raw
                             material. Contract prices were agreed at slightly higher than market prices,
                             inputs were provided and the farmers initially supplied roots.

                             Issues - during the first years, whilst the processors were building their
                             markets, the factories were able to obtain sufficient roots. However, in 2011,
                             flooding wiped out nearly 500,000 ha of cassava crop (about 8% of total
                             plantings) and in 2012, the market prices almost doubled mainly due to
                             inadequate supply. The contracted farmers in the areas surrounding the
                             factories, which did not suffer from the adverse weather conditions expected
                             to be paid local market prices to supply the factories. This made the
                             production of HQCF and ethanol uncompetitive.

                             The response – the processors recognized that their businesses would not be
                             viable if they were subjected to such wide variation in raw material costs,
                             which are the biggest costs in their process. They responded by acquiring large
                             tracts of land with the aim of producing well over half their raw material using
                             mechanized agriculture. Their projections showed that despite the large
                             capital investment in land clearing and equipment, the increased yields
                             associated with higher levels of input would mean that the cassava roots would
                             be cheaper than from small-farmer production.

                             Lessons learnt –
                             1. Relying on contract farming for cassava in Nigeria is extraordinarily
                                 difficult. When traditional buyers hike prices, small farmers seek the best
                                 prices. The processors cannot simply pass on cost increases, as both
                                 industries have to compete with imports.
                             2. Perhaps the processing companies did not invest sufficient resources in
                                 ensuring good communications with farmer groups, but even if they had,
                                 the farmers still expect to be paid market prices even if it meant breaking
                                 any agreements.
                             3. The processors believe that the only sensible way forward to ensure
                                 commercial viability is to produce a significant proportion of raw material
                                 on a large-scale. They believe that through better management,
                                 mechanization and use of inputs, they will get higher yields & can deliver
                                 cassava roots less expensively to their factories.
                             The challenge for donors and other public sector actors is to try to grow farm
                             sizes and introduce mechanization for improved efficiencies, higher yields and
                             lower unit costs so that farmers can profit at lower prices.

                           Issues - To become efficient, rice millers need to buy and stockpile enough
                           paddy rice to process for six months after each harvest. This has proven to
                           be challenging because farmers generally do not accept credit terms from
                           millers since historically many went unpaid. In late 2011, a large scale
                           milling operation (VITAL Agro-Industries), in the heart of the river valley, did
                           not have sufficient funds to hold stocks but relied on trucks roaming the

role                       USAID/PCE brought together VITAL with leading water-user Unions
                           (representing the producers) and the National Agriculture Credit Bank
                           (CNCAS), with the aim of increasing market opportunities for farmers.

                           The response – The following steps were put in place:
                           i) The mill required wholesalers to sign contracts for processed rice,
                                stating the price, and/or provide promissory notes
                           ii) CNCAS and the farmer Unions agreed on seasonal finance
                           iii) VITAL agreed to no side-buying
                           iv) The farm gate price was agreed between VITAL and the farmer Unions
                                at meetings convened by the Agriculture Ministry
                           v) VITAL contracted directly with the individual farmer groups
                           The system has been in operation for two seasons and 20,000 t of rice was
                           bought from 6,800 farmers, valued at $4 million. The farm gate price has
                           increased by 15%. The mill operated efficiently and CNAS loan
                           reimbursements improved from 80 to 95%.

                           Lessons learnt – the system brings together the buyer, farmers, wholesalers
                           and lenders and gets them to work supportively. The model works because:
                           • An external agency recognized that a number of elements could be
                               brought together into a strategy to benefit small rice producers
                           • This included 12,000 t of storage made available to the farmer groups by
                               a grant by Spanish Aid. However, further significant expansion will be
                               dependent on future investments in storage
                           • The rice mill is by far the biggest single buyer of rice in the valley and is
                               the dominant player in the market
                           • The rice mill established selling prices ahead of buying from the farmers,
                               so farm gate prices can be fixed

                           manufacturers.

                           Issues – to get a constant and reliable supply of processing quality potatoes.

                           The response - In Bangladesh, Bombay Sweets & Co., a major potato chip
                           manufacturer, introduced contract farming in 2008 to secure their raw
                           material supply base. Staring with farmers with above-average farm size
                           and forming groups with a minimum of 8 ha, they distributed seed of their
                           preferred varieties, agrochemicals and technical advice with an agreement
                           to buy the end-product at prevailing market prices. The savings in
                           processing of high dry matter varieties and the good chip quality covers the
                           cost of servicing the farmers. The farmers are not tempted to side-sell
                           because they receive market price. This has worked sufficiently well for the
                           company to expand and help their farmers grow and market other crops.
                           They have 500 farmers contracted.

                           In India, PepsiCo developed a similar contract farming system to supply raw
                           material for ‘Frito Lay’ potato chips. PepsiCo has different models
                           depending on the skills of the farmers and their socio-economic status. In
                           West Bengal, they operate under a ‘vendor model’, in which the vendor is a
                           local person hired to liaise between the farmer and the company, and who
                           also ensures the availability of seed and other inputs, and monitors the crop
                           with technical experts. The vendor’s remuneration is based on the
                           performance of the farmers. In 2008, PepsiCo worked with 1,800 farmers
                           (6,500 ha) producing 12,000 t (less than 0.2% of the West Bengal’s
                           production). The farmers were given inputs, including specific varieties
                           suitable for processing, and a fixed buying price. With extension advice and
                           the correct inputs, farmers achieve higher yields.

                           Lessons learnt – The key driver for the success of these contract farming
                           operations is that specific varieties are chosen which improve the factory’s
                           efficiency. Therefore, higher-than-market prices can be paid. The success is
                           also helped by the raw material cost being a small portion of the final selling
                           price. Other lessons include:
                           • Differentiate the end-product to improve factory efficiency
                           • Target larger farmers in close proximity to each other who have the
                                potential to improve yields
                           • Appoint agents (vendors) and remunerate based on the farmer’s
                                performance

POULTRY IN ANDHRA PRADESH, INDIA 13

Production contracts       Background – Andhra Pradesh is the leading poultry producing state in India,
are becoming               at over 1.4 million tonnes of meat in 2004.
increasingly popular,
especially in the USA,     Issues – The industry is prone to production and market risks, which affect
but also in Asia
                           profitability within the value chain, and particularly leave small farmers
                           vulnerable. These risks threaten other businesses in the value chain,
                           especially the hatcheries.

                           The response - Some large poultry firms (e.g., Venkateshwara Hatcheries
                           Pvt. Ltd., Suguna Hatcheries, Pioneer Hatcheries, Diamond Hatcheries, etc.)
                           began integrating their activities with others in the value chain in the late
                           1980s. This integrated operation would typically include raising of
                           grandparent and parent flocks, rearing of day-old-chicks, feed milling,
                           provision of veterinary services and a market outlet. The poultry firm
                           provides day-old chicks, feed and medicines, while the farmers supply land,
                           labor and other minor variable inputs. At the end of the cycle, the farmer
                           receives a net price (by weight) that is pegged to an industry price set by a
                           group of hatcheries (not the retail price). The industry price fluctuates
                           within a narrow range and is much more stable than retail price. However, if
                           the retail price does rise sharply, the farmer gets a bonus to remove the
                           temptation of side-selling. The contract assumes mortality rates up to 5%;
                           beyond that, the farmer carries the risk. The processor spends time and
                           resources in screening producers for reputation and prior experience.

                           Lessons learnt – An analysis was carried out to evaluate the benefits of
                           contracting with large poultry input suppliers. The survey showed that:
                               • The importance of credit, insurance and the reduction of market risk
                                   are attractive to the farmers
                               • Contract producers are more efficient than non-contract ones, but
                                   margins per bird were lower. However, they had larger flock sizes,
                                   probably due to the credit and assured markets
                               • The whole value-chain generated more money, but the researchers
                                   concluded that most of the gains are appropriated by the buyers
                               • Processors choose farmers with poor prospects as independent
                                   growers because of poor access to technology, credit, etc.
                               • The case study suggests that contract farming is a useful institutional
                                   arrangement for the supply of credit, insurance and technology to
                                   farmers—all of which are otherwise very demanding problems

MILK PRODUCTION IN RAJASTHAN, INDIA 14

More success with         Background/Issues – Farmer’s income from crop production in Rajasthan is
products that require     seasonal. In contrast, dairying generates a stable cash income on a regular
regular farm visits …     basis, which is an important economic incentive. With limited crop
and livestock             opportunities in the state, livestock provides employment opportunities and
                          livelihood security.

                          The response – The World Bank’s District Poverty Initiatives Project (DPIP),
                          launched in July 2000 in seven of the poorest districts and 7,039 villages in
                          Rajasthan. It supported the formation of Common Interest Groups (CIGs),
                          comprised of 10-15 villagers, and helped to identify and implement
                          commercial activities, the majority being dairy activities. The DPIP worked
                          with the Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation (RCDF, an apex body in the
                          state), the District Milk Cooperative Unions and a range of NGOs to promote
                          institution building and social capital development, and to create backward
                          and forward linkages. In general, most CIGs established marketing linkages
                          with RCDF for an assured market and stable prices. The RCDF provided
                          training to producers and invested in the necessary infrastructure: cold
                          storage tanks, cattle sheds, management and milk testing equipment. After
                          suitable training, it also provided one-time grants for each member to
                          obtain two cows and production support, such as cattle feed, fodder,
                          vaccinations, medical aid and fodder seed.

                          CIGs on a milk route linked to RCDF received an assured market, twice daily
                          collection, transparency in pricing and payment every 10 days. In contrast,
                          non-contracted dairy farmer CIGs sold in local markets to private traders and
                          suffered significant wastage and lower returns.

                          Lessons learnt –
                          Benefits to the farmer from the partnership include:
                          • Access to milk marketing routes with no limit on supply volumes, an
                              assured market and a transparent price

COTTON PRODUCTION IN ZAMBIA 15

Contract farming can      Background – In the early 1990s, the Zambian cotton industry was run by
play an important         one parastatal company, the Lint Company of Zambia (LINTCO). The
development role in       company provided inputs, loans and marketing services to all cotton
some traditional crops,   farmers, almost all (97%) being smallholders. In 1995, LINTCO was
such as cotton, but the
                          privatized and its assets were bought by Lonho Cotton (Zambia). To meet its
contractual
arrangements need to
                          processing requirements, Lonrho had an outgrower program providing
evolve                    inputs and extension; in 1998/99 it invested over $3 million into 88,000
                          farmers.

                          Issues – After privatization, five other ginning companies were established
                          to form a “competitive” industry in the country. These companies
                          competed for a limited amount of cotton that led to large-scale side-buying
                          and side-selling. This led to non-payment of loans and shortfalls in cotton to
                          process, and contributed to the decision to sell Lonrho Cotton to Dunavant
                          (Z) in 2000.

                          The response – Dunavant developed a new way of working with small-scale
                          farmers that became known as the Distributor Model. It streamlined input
                          credit and technical support, which became focused on distributors--the
                          intermediaries between the company and the farmer groups. Over 150,000
                          farmers grow cotton for Dunavant, with an average of 1.2 ha/farm. The
                          farmers are formed into village groups of usually 50-60. A group leader is
                          elected by group members to represent their interests with the distributor.
                          The group leader’s responsibilities are to assist the distributor to mobilize
                          farmers, and allocate inputs and technical support. The farmers deliver to a
                          local depot where their crop is weighed, graded and recorded by the
                          distributor. The farmers are given a pay slip indicating the amount owed
                          minus the credit repayment outstanding for inputs, and Dunavant makes

                          A distributor should be an experienced cotton farmer, and live in the locality
                          of the group. They are not ‘employees’ of Dunavant, but are contracted
                          legally through an ‘Agreement for Micro Credit Financing’ to supply inputs
                          and technical support to groups. Dunavant provides agricultural,
                          administrative and business training to distributors who are paid a
                          commission based on loan recovery and crop volume produced. If the
                          distributor fails to recover the full amount lent to farmers, the debt will be
                          carried forward. Since the introduction of the distributor system, the
                          company’s loan recovery has increased significantly, from around 50% when
                          it was owned and operated by Lonrho to about 90%.

                          Lessons learnt – It is vitally important to incentivize intermediaries operating
                          small-farmer outgrower schemes.

MAIZE FOR PROCESSING: SENEGAL

Sometimes flexible   Background - Every year Senegal imports substantial volumes of maize to
pricing models are   supply the industrial mills involved in animal feed and human corn-based
needed               food products, as well as the local wholesale market. Since 2009, the United
                     States Agency for International Development/Projet Croissance Economique
                     (USAID/PCE) has promoted Senegal’s industrial maize value chain by
                     supporting the emergence of integrated local production and marketing
                     networks, in particular, through the development of seasonal contracting.

                     Issues – For the first three seasons, the producers and consolidators used
                     fixed price purchasing clauses. Such clauses set the seasonal harvest price at
                     the outset of the season. The absence of clear price adjustment clauses
                     generated chronic disruptions in the marketing process and strongly limited
                     contract compliance ratios as the maize market in Senegal moved with
                     international prices. As global prices fell, the processors preferred imported
                     maize if the price went below the contracted price for local production.

                     The response - USAID/PCE convened a stakeholder workshop bringing
                     together producer leaders, consolidators and financial institutions party to
                     the 2011 rain season program. The group reviewed the input procurement
                     practices as well as price setting approaches. It was agreed that value chain
                     stakeholders should agree on certain price setting benchmarks and develop
                     a flexible pricing formula adjusting to import values with the requisite set of
                     contractual clauses.

                     Analysis of the imports showed that Argentina was the major and most
                     consistent supplier of maize to Senegal, and that the market for maize in
                     Argentina could be used as a starting point for estimating Dakar values.

                     The Agricultural Secretariat of the Government of Argentina publishes
                     official Free on Board (FOB) prices based on exporter declarations daily. The
                     International Grains Council publishes freight rates (not to Senegal, but
                     shipping sources indicated an approximate constant for delivery to Dakar).

SUSTAINABLE COFFEE: VIETNAM

                    Background - Nedcoffee Vietnam is a leading coffee exporter. It is a wholly
                    owned subsidiary of Amtrada Holding, a Dutch group of companies engaged
                    in the origination, procurement and trading of coffee, cocoa and tree nuts.
                    Nedcoffee Vietnam was established in 2008 with the construction of a
                    factory and warehouse in Buon Ma Thuot with a fully integrated, state-of-
                    the-art processing line and designed capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year.
                    Nedcoffee is now Vietnam’s third largest exporter with annual exports of
                    around 90,000 tonnes per year.

                    Issues – Under current trade regulations in Vietnam, exporters are not
                    permitted to buy coffee directly from farmers. This presents a difficulty for
                    those companies seeking recognition for coffee certified as produced
                    sustainably/responsibly (under the 4C, Rainforest Alliance or UTZ schemes)
                    since traceability through the value chain is a key element.

                    The response – About 15% of the coffee handled by Nedcoffee is certified as
                    sustainably produced. Nedcoffee supplements its regular procurement
                    through a network of traders with buying through 22 “partner collectors”.
                    Mrs. Giam is a typical partner and runs a coffee collecting business from a
                    small store beside the road some 3 km from the Nedcoffee factory. All of
                    the 500 t/year of coffee that she buys is sent to Nedcoffee. She also trades
                    pepper and rice and supplies agrochemicals. Her annual turnover will easily
                    exceed USD 1.0 mn, and from May each year she starts to pre-finance the
                    crop with advances of fertiliser. The apparent small-scale of the 40 t store
                    and neighbouring house belie the scale and complexity of this business.
                    Mrs. Giam provides the linkage between Nedcoffee and the farmers that
                    permits the development of traceable certified sustainable coffee.

                    Coffee verified or certified as produced under sustainable conditions attracts
                    a premium of USD 40-60/tonne for the exporter in the World market. Of
                    this, half will stay with the exporter to cover the costs of handling the coffee
                    separately and for maintaining the traceability of the supply. The remainder
                    is split equally between the collector and the farmer. There is, therefore, an
                    incentive for each player in the supply chain to maintain the integrity of the
                    certified or verified coffee.

                    Lessons learnt –
                        • Incentivized market intermediaries can be a “vital cog” in the linkage
                           of small farmers to international markets
                        • The assured market offered by Nedcoffee gives Mrs. Giam the
                           confidence to loan inputs to nearby farmers

PAPAIN PRODUCTION IN TAMIL NADU 16

Processors…have        Background - Papain is product isolated from papaya latex and has a
been important         wide range of industrial uses, particularly in food processing. As the
drivers of contract    product had export opportunities, a number of companies encouraged
farming                farmers to grow papaya and tap the latex. As it was a new procedure,
                       farmers did not have the confidence to try it without contracts to
                       assure them of the market. One company, Senthil Papain and Food
                       Products (SPFPC), established a contract farming scheme initially by
                       targeting innovative and progressive farmers who were approached to
                       produce papain. Besides providing inputs and extension advice, SPFPC
                       guaranteed the market by contract. In 2009/10, the company allowed
                       researchers to analyze the finances, efficiencies and motivation of the
                       participants.

                       Methodology –
                          • Randomly sampled 83 contracted papaya farmers and 28 who
                             did not grow papaya or process papain
                          • Calculated variable, fixed and, hence, production costs
                          • Cobb-Douglas production function was used to study the
                             technical efficiency of papain production, and the factors
                             influencing farmer decision making was estimated using logit

ANNEX 3 : THE IMPACT OF CONTRACT FARMING BY
COUNTRY

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 17

Production and             Background – In 2008, contracts accounted for 39% of the value the USA’s
marketing contracts in     agricultural production. This has increased from 28% in 1991 and from 11%
the USA                    in 1969. Only 12 % of farmers had contracts, but of course, these were the
                           bigger farms. Some products are much more likely to be grown under
                           contract than others (for example, 90% of poultry production, 68% of pig,
                           and 90% of sugar beet and tobacco). However, it was much less prevalent
Production contracts       for field crops (26% of maize, 25% of soybean and 23% of wheat).
are becoming
increasingly popular       Most production contracts (97%) are for livestock, whilst field crops were
                           more likely to be under marketing contracts and most tend to only commit
                           part of their production. Production contracts are rarely used in crops,
                           except for seed crops and some horticultural produce.

                           Farm size – Contracting is closely correlated to farm size. Nearly 70% of the
                           largest farms (with at least $1 million in annual sales) used contracts in 2008,
                           compared with 7% of small farms.
                           Interviews showed they help farmers reduce the income risks that arise
                           from fluctuations in commodity prices and yields. Contracts assure farmers
                           of outlets for commodities in markets with few buyers and they reward
                           those who produce the attributes required by the buyer by linking prices to
                           those attributes. But contracts can also have less benign effects. They can
                           introduce new and unexpected risks for farmers (e.g., they can extend a
                           buyer’s market power and can impact how farming is structured/managed).
                           Financing – Contracts provide assurance that specialized capital investments
                           can be recovered, particularly in the case of investments associated with
                           products in markets with few buyers.
                           Lenders also prefer assured market outlets because it reduces the risks of
                           default on loans. Farmers that need substantial borrowings often need
                           contracts before they can get a long-term loan. However, many of the
                           contract farmers do carry substantial debt; contract farms have higher ratios
                           of debt to net worth.
                           Most farms in the USA are classified as rural residence farms (family-
                           operated with annual sales below $250,000) whose operators state that
                           their primary occupation is not farming. Most of these farmers do not make
                           use of contracts (less than 13%).

                           Lessons learnt – the difference in agricultural modernization between the
                           USA and developing countries is massive, but some lessons could be learnt:
                               • Contract farming has focused on larger farms
                               • Production contracts are important for poultry production
                               • Contracts are important for securing finance

Products and           Background – In 2011/12, at least 50 companies contracted 328,000
markets that are       small-farmers to grow crops on 628,000 ha; this, therefore, impacts
difficult to           about 30% of rural households. The vast majority of contracted

successful
                       (2%). Increased contract farming could help overcome some of
                       Zimbabwe’s agricultural problems by providing a new supply base
                       following the collapse of its large-scale commercial sector. It could
                       also provide an acceptable vehicle to “access donor funds to reduce
                       the risk of firm’s engagement”. A major study was undertaken to
                       interview the main organizations involved with contract farming in
                       Zimbabwe. The findings of the research included:
                       Management - Well-managed contracts reduced transaction costs and
                       increased returns to farmers and firms; when managed poorly, default
                       on both sides leads to losses. Other important management issues
                       included selection of farmer and geographic locations, adopting a
                       good business model and building trust. Contracting companies
                       required extra marketing and management skills developed for
                       working with large numbers of small producers.
                       Finance – Business in Zimbabwe is constrained by lack of finance.
                       Smallholder farmers do not have resources to fund production and
                       rely on contract farming. Finance is difficult for the contractor, which
                       severely limits the expansion of lending to farmers. The introduction
                       of ICT has helped.
                       Farmer organizations – Formal groups have the potential to reduce
                       the transaction costs improving the returns to all actors because they
                       could provide the services to farmers at cost, but it is imperative to
                       instill marketing skills. Most contract farming works through informal
                       groups of between 5 to 200 farmers with a lead actor/farmer
                       incentivized to liaise between group members and the contractor.
                       Regulation – The legal and regulatory framework was not supportive
                       of contract farming. There are many registration requirements for
                       contract farming firms which come with fees resulting in a high cost of
                       compliance, and which can reach $20,000/year.
                       Recommendations –
                          • Support efforts to increase yields, which will improve farmer
                             profitability
                          • Provide technical support to help establish new contracts
                          • Create a conducive business environment for investment
                          • Promote financial instruments that improve efficiencies
                          • Harmonize laws and policies on contract farming
                          • Create a body to help settle disputes
                          • Traditional field crops have the biggest impact in terms of
                             farmer beneficiaries, newer crops have less impact

ANNEX 4: CONTRACT FARMING AND ADR


Types of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

The success of a contract farming arrangement depends on the existence of a relationship of trust
among the parties, and on the buyer and intermediary in particular taking a long-term and good
faith approach toward their relationships with growers. In addition, parties may take steps to
mitigate the likelihood of any dispute arising, for example, in the structuring of the relationship and
the design of the contract and overall arrangement.

However, if mitigation measures fail and trust breaks down, the existence of a reliable dispute
resolution mechanism can help contain any fallout. Indeed, without such a mechanism, contract
farming schemes can collapse altogether; widespread unauthorized side-selling by farmers has been
known to undermine the viability of an arrangement and lead buyers to withdraw in the absence of
any ability to counteract the practice. Moreover, provisions for dispute resolution can be powerful
tools for protecting growers when buyers do not act in good faith. Growers often have little
bargaining power and recourse if a buyer or intermediary acts in bad faith—as it may, for example,
by unfairly rejecting produce. In addition, having an accessible and ready-to-use dispute resolution
mechanism at their disposal could give both buyers and growers the confidence they need to enter
into a contract farming agreement in the first place, as all parties can have greater assurance that
their rights will be safeguarded.

Given that court processes can be costly and prone to corruption and delay, ADR likely offers the
most practical solution for the majority of contract farming disputes. ADR simply refers to any
process for resolving a dispute outside of an official court procedure. 19 ADR differs from court
proceedings in that it generally takes place in a private setting and is confidential. 20 Depending on
the type of procedure involved, ADR can represent a more consensual and less confrontational
approach, with the neutral third party playing a facilitative rather than an adjudicating role. 21

In fact, ADR may be especially important for contract farming. Farmers in developing countries
generally have limited means and/or familiarity with legal procedures, and so often face
overwhelming barriers in taking a dispute to court. For example, if a grower delivers produce to a
collection center and is told—as has been known to happen—to come back in a few days, or that the
buyer or intermediary will not accept his produce, the farmer may be left with little choice but to try
and sell the production in the local market at a loss, even if he or she feels that the agreement has
been breached. If, on the other hand, some type of ADR mechanism were in place that allowed a
determination to be made fairly and quickly, the farmer would at least have a chance to make his or
her case. In fact, the very presence and availability of a viable mechanism may make a breach less
likely in the first place.

ADR processes can generally be classified by the role of the neutral third party:



19
   See “Alternative Dispute Resolution Guidelines,” Investment Climate Advisory Services of the World Bank
Group, Washington: 2011, p. 2.
20
   The fact alone that decisions do not become a matter of public record may make ADR the highly preferred
solution for many parties.
21
   Notwithstanding, official court procedures may incorporate ADR as part of the normal dispute resolution
process.

                                                                                                         48

•    Facilitation-based ADR processes lie at the consensual end of the spectrum. In these processes,
     the neutral’s task is to bring the parties together and moderate negotiations rather than
     recommend or issue a decision. The archetypal example of a facilitation-based ADR process is
     mediation
•    Recommendation-based processes go one step further, where the neutral not only facilitates
     discussion but also is authorized to propose non-binding solutions to the dispute. An example of
     a recommendation-based process is conciliation
•    Adjudication-based processes have the highest degree of intervention by the neutral. In these,
     of which arbitration is the most common, the neutral acts like a judge who hears and issues a
     binding decision that may be enforced in court. 22 Because the outcome of an adjudication-based
     process is a final determination of the dispute, this type of ADR tends to be more adversarial.
     Adjudication-based processes generally follow set procedural rules and often take place in
     dedicated ADR centers

    arbitration/adjudication

It is important to note that there is no “one-size-fits-all” ADR solution that is inherently suited to any
single outgrower model, or indeed to contract farming arrangements generally. The suitability of any
kind of ADR to a dispute depends on factors such as whether the parties have an arm’s length or a
trust-based relationship, whether legal or factual issues lie at the heart of the dispute, time and cost
constraints, the sophistication of the parties, and the importance of obtaining a final decision.
Motivation may also play a role; a party bringing a dispute to ADR may prefer mediation if his or her
goal is to change the behavior of the parties, but may resort to arbitration if he or she is more
interested in getting to a final outcome.

Nevertheless, the choice of ADR in contract farming arrangements 23 is necessarily guided by one
defining characteristic that sets contract farming apart from most other business relationships: the

22
   In arbitration there may be more than one neutral; it is quite common for arbitrations to be presided over
by a panel of three or more arbitrators.
23
   Contracts typically specify the ADR procedure to be used in a “dispute resolution clause”, so it is important
that the choice of mechanism(s) be given due consideration at the outset. Dispute resolution clauses can
incorporate some flexibility. For example, it is common for such clauses to call on the parties to try mediation
first, and then to move to arbitration if that attempt fails.

                                                                                                              49

fact that individual smallholder farmers or groups of farmers are likely to be on one side of almost all
disputes. This holds true in cases where a buyer contracts with intermediaries like producer
organizations, input retailers or lead farmers, since the intermediaries themselves will need to have
arrangements with individual growers (or, in the latter case, be growers themselves). As a result, and
especially in developing countries, contract farming arrangements are almost certain to reflect a far
greater gap in legal and economic sophistication and means, bargaining power, tolerance for
bureaucracy, and basic ability to access ADR mechanisms, than is typical for most commercial
relationships. Where no provision is made for this disparity, the end result may be that farmers have
no practical way to redress their grievances, which could lead them to suffer losses in silence or, in
extreme cases, to make their grievances known through more disruptive means.

Thus, while arbitration and mediation—by far the two most widely known and used forms of ADR—
may certainly be useful in resolving contract farming disputes, it is important to consider ways in
which these procedures might need to be adapted or applied in the contract farming context.
Thankfully, this task is made somewhat easier by the fact that the vast majority of contract farming
disputes tend to arise over a common set of issues:
    • Delayed payment/non-payment by buyer: The buyer fails to pay on time, or entirely
    • (Unfair) rejection by buyer: The buyer rejects the produce for reasons that the seller sees as
        unjust
    • Side-selling by producer: Instead of selling its entire production to the contracting buyer as
        agreed, the grower sells produce to a different party. This is of particular concern to buyers
        that have made a substantial investment in inputs, equipment, and/or services, or who are
        relying on contracts to supply the needed amount of produce
    • Grading disputes: The parties disagree over how production is graded. This is a concern as
        contracts often stipulate that buyers will accept different grades of produce, but that
        farmers will be paid more for higher grades
    • Crop failure: Crop failure occurs when no marketable surplus is produced. Contracts address
        this by assigning risk to one or the other party
    • Force majeure: A force majeure event is an extraordinary occurrence, beyond the control of
        the parties, which results in the destruction or substantial loss in value of the grower’s
        production. Such events include war, crime, arson, civil unrest, weather and natural
        disasters. Many contracts have force majeure clauses that place the risk on one or the other
        party if such events happen
    • Pricing disputes: Some contracts may specify a base price and stipulate that the parties will
        agree on a final price or premium around the time of harvest. Vague price terms can often
        lead to disputes, especially in the absence of a trusting relationship between the parties

Moreover, contract farming arrangements possess a number of distinct characteristics that also
inform the choice of ADR mechanism:
    • Accessibility: Growers often live and work far from the towns and cities where dispute
        resolution centers are found, so the ADR process should take place in a location that
        growers can easily reach
    • Trust: In some cases there may be a wide gap in bargaining power and/or legal
        sophistication between buyers and growers, so it is important to have procedures that
        growers trust and feel comfortable with
    • Reliability: Buyers will want to know that ADR mechanisms are reliable and predictable in
        order to justify their investment. Reliability does not mean that the processes should favor

        one party or the other, but that they should be neutral, work well, produce objective
        outcomes in line with the law and contractual terms, and not be susceptible to bribery
    •   Cost: The vast majority of contract farming disputes involve amounts that, while quite large
        in relation to growers’ income, are small relative to the overall cost of resolving the dispute.
        Thus, the cost of a procedure must be low enough to make it worthwhile for both parties to
        use
    •   Speed: Many contract farming disputes naturally revolve around the quality of perishable
        produce. Such disputes must be resolved within a matter of days if they are to be usefully
        resolved at all
    •   Confidentiality: In many instances the buyer will not want proprietary information made
        available to the public or its competitors as a result of a public dispute resolution process.
        As a result, ADR mechanisms that preserve the confidentiality of such information as well as
        the ultimate outcome of the process may be of interest

Finally, it is important to note that while it is of course important to facilitate efficient procedures,
the goal of ADR is to offer parties a better outcome rather than to simplify the overall process for
resolving disputes. Thus, there will always be the risk that a dispute may go through mediation—
perhaps followed by arbitration—and still have to end up in court. In most cases, however, making
sure there are appropriate avenues for ADR should advance the goals of increasing confidence in
business dealings and securing access to justice for farmers.

Suitability of Different ADR Types for Contract Farming

Keeping in mind the kinds of disputes that tend to arise between buyers and growers, it is possible
to make a more nuanced evaluation of the suitability of some of the more common types of ADR to
contract farming.

    1. Mediation and Conciliation

Mediation is a type of negotiation moderated by a neutral third party who might be an industry or
law expert, a government officer, or a respected member of the community. The mediator’s role is
strictly facilitative; he or she does not decide in favor of one party or another, but guides the parties
toward a consensual resolution. Mediation is a flexible process with no fixed timeline, so it is most
useful when buyers and sellers are interested in a long-term relationship, and when time is not
pressing. Mediation can also be useful when non-legal measures—for example, an apology or
explanation by one party—might help end a dispute. Mediated solutions rely on the good faith of
the parties to put them into practice; they are not enforceable in court.

Conciliation is a similar process, but differs from mediation mainly in that the neutral evaluates the
case and makes a non-binding recommendation that may favor one of the parties. It therefore offers
parties a greater degree of authoritative guidance that might be persuasive in settling the dispute.

Mediation may be purely voluntary or it may be required by a court. In either case, the
communications between the parties and the mediator, as well as the proposals for resolution
exchanged during the mediation process, are usually confidential. This is important in order to
facilitate good faith, as candid and honest communication between the parties increases the
likelihood of resolution.

Because it is more consensual in nature, mediation is often tried before arbitration, which is a more
confrontational process. In fact, it is not uncommon for contracts to make mediation mandatory, at

                                                                                                        51

least at the outset, for all disputes. While this kind of provision has the positive aim of trying to
defuse a disagreement consensually before it escalates, mandatory mediation may not be desirable
for all types of contract farming disputes. For example, because mediation and conciliation can take
a long period of time, and even then do not guarantee a final decision, they would not be the best
choice in cases that must be ruled on quickly, such as disagreements over the rejection or grading of
produce.

The consensual nature of mediation is relevant to the kind of relationship the parties have, as well as
to whether they want to continue that relationship. Thus, mediation or conciliation might be used in
side-selling cases where the buyer, notwithstanding the grower’s alleged violations, is interested in
maintaining the relationship, or more interested in changing growers’ behavior than in punishing an
offender. On the other hand, if a buyer wanted to send a strong signal to other growers, he or she
might prefer an ADR method with a more final outcome.

    2. Arbitration

Arbitration, along with mediation, is one of the better known types of ADR. Arbitrations are often
held under the auspices of formal centers that offer meeting rooms, support services, rosters of
qualified arbitrators and, most importantly, a set of procedural rules that parties agree to follow.
Arbitration awards, unlike mediated outcomes, are enforceable in court. These features—the ability
to choose specialized arbitrators, the adherence to formal rules, and the fact that arbitration awards
are binding—appeal to parties who want a structured, enforceable decision that allows them to
sidestep the cost, delays and bureaucracy of the courts. As with mediation, arbitration proceedings
and evidence are generally confidential.

However, these same characteristics may also make conventional arbitration unsuitable for many
contract farming disputes. Arbitration centers are generally found in towns and cities and may
therefore be hard for growers to reach. In addition, their formality and bureaucracy—and therefore
their expense—may be intimidating to some parties. And while they may offer a faster and less
unwieldy choice than the court system, the expense and procedural rules of formal arbitrations still
make them cost-effective only when large amounts of money are at stake.

A more workable solution for contract farming may be what is known as ad hoc arbitration—a less
formal and simplified process that generally takes place without reference to a specific arbitration
center and its rules. However, one drawback to ad hoc arbitration is that, because the parties do not
agree to an institution and set of rules beforehand, they may not be inclined to use ADR once a
conflict arises.

    3. Adjudication

Adjudication is a simplified kind of arbitration used in industry-specific disputes. Adjudication
addresses the problem posed by ad hoc arbitration; that is, the fact that the lack of reference to a
specific ADR mechanism can leave parties without a framework when a dispute arises. To get around
this, it may be feasible for a well-regarded institution to build an in-house ADR capacity, which
parties could agree to use, for settling disputes. The institution could be a government or a private
body, but to be credible, must be trusted by both sides.

While adjudication has generally been used most in the construction sector, the principle of having a
sector-specific ADR framework could also be adapted to agriculture, where marketing, exporting or
investment promotion boards might provide a suitable forum. The host institution could adopt
simplified procedural rules and fee schedules that are appropriate to the sector and—ideally—


                                                                                                    52
AN ANALYTICAL TOOLKIT FOR SUPPORT TO CONTRACT FARMING


provide for adjudications to take place in rural locations that are accessible to growers. 24 Sector-
based boards already play a facilitative role in negotiating disputes between buyers and farmers in
some countries. In certain cases, such as the sugar industry in Tanzania and the seed cotton sector in
Zimbabwe, these roles are authorized by law. Embedding a simplified ADR mechanism within such
institutions could help solidify these roles and make available the decisiveness of an arbitration-like
process while cutting much of the cost and bureaucracy that might otherwise come with it.

However, while the advantage of adjudication lies in its ability to customize the ADR process to fit
contract farming situations, the flip side of this is that such a capacity most likely will need to be built
from the ground up, and so it will not be a readily available option in many cases.

     4. Expert Determination

Expert determination, as the term suggests, relies on a technical expert to resolve a dispute rather
than on a neutral third party. While not as common as other kinds of ADR, expert determination
could be a useful tool for contract farming, where claims related to alleged faulty grading or unfair
rejection call for quick, on-the-spot decisions by persons with specialized knowledge. For expert
determination to work, parties would need to agree beforehand on a list of experts whom they
could call on at short notice. Expert determination could also be a feature of any in-house ADR
capacity built up for adjudication.

However, while expert determination could be effective for resolving technical disputes, it would not
be as suitable for disputes that require legal or contractual interpretation, or where the negotiations
require a trained facilitator.

     5. Traditional Dispute Resolution Systems

Many countries have formal or informal traditional dispute resolution mechanisms that are still
widely used. In some cases, these mechanisms may rely on the recognized authority of respected
members of the community. In Rwanda, the traditional system of abunzi mediation has been
incorporated into the formal justice system so that local cases involving parties within the same
district and falling below a set value threshold must attempt abunzi mediation before going to the
courts. While abunzi mediation, by its own terms, would not apply to contract farming disputes,
many contract farming arrangements have successfully piggybacked on existing systems to address
at least some disputes. These systems have the advantage of being more likely to be known and
trusted by—and accessible to—smallholder farmers.

The following table sets forth these considerations.




24
  For example, this might be possible if a government agricultural agency has a network of extension offices
that are easier for growers to reach, or from where officers can travel to growers.

Impact of Contract Farming Structure

In addition to the nature of the dispute presented in any case, the parties to a farming contract will
want to consider the nature and structure of the outgrower model in place in selecting the method
of ADR to be employed. As the contracting model becomes more complex, with more
comprehensive contracts and more intense collaboration, the considerations of the parties will likely
be somewhat different. The table below sets forth various considerations of the parties to farming
contracts as reflected in various outgrower models.

Conclusions

In summary, when evaluating ADR options for a contract farming arrangement, it is helpful to
consider the following points:
    • Features of ADR solutions that are particularly important for contract farming include: (1)
       physical accessibility; (2) low cost; (3) speed; (4) low level of bureaucracy; (5) having a
       mechanism that growers trust and feel comfortable with
    • While there are multiple ADR mechanisms available, the parties will want to consider the
       likely types of disputes which could arise under the contract as well as the nature of the
       contractual system employed by the buyer
    • ADR mechanisms to be used by the parties should be identified beforehand (for example, in
       a dispute resolution clause of a written contract). This will help reassure buyers of the
       viability of the arrangement, and also let farmers know where to turn in case a dispute arises
    • Mediation and arbitration are the most widely known forms of ADR, but must be applied
       with forethought in contract farming situations:
            o Mediation is most suitable for consensual situations where time is not of the
                 essence and the parties are interested in a long-term relationship. Disputes related
                 to business issues that fall within these parameters are also well suited to mediation
            o Arbitration commonly refers to the resolution of relatively large-scale commercial
                 disputes, can be quite expensive, and uses rules and procedures that generally
                 require parties to hire lawyers to navigate. Arbitrations also tend to be held in
                 centralized chambers that may be difficult for farmers to reach. For these reasons,
                 arbitration is probably most useful for disputes between firms and intermediaries
                 other than farmers
    • If practicable, it may be appropriate to incorporate other ADR solutions such as traditional
       dispute resolution systems, agricultural expert determination, and authorizing (and building
       capacity in) a sector-focused agency to host a simplified ADR function
